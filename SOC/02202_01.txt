and provided for the entry of the Federal
Republic of Germany into the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization. You will be asked to
approve the agreements reached at those
meetings.
Our country continues to give full support
to the United Nations. The Canadian delegation took an important part in the deliberations of the recent meeting of the General
Assembly in New York. It is earnestly hoped
that the adoption of the resolution on disarmament introduced in the political committee by the Canadian delegation may lead
to agreement on an effective system of international safeguards.
While no final settlement has been reached
in Korea, the lessening of the threat of
renewed aggression in that area has made
possible the withdrawal of a substantial
portion of the Canadian forces.
At the invitation of the Geneva Conference
Canada has accepted the heavy responsibility
of serving on the Armistice Commissions
which have been formed to supervise the
restoration of peace in the Associated States
of Indo-China.
Last autumn our nation was the host at
the annual meeting of the Consultative Committee of the Colombo Plan. You will be
asked to approve Canada's continued participation in the Plan as well as in the United
Nations' Technical Assistance Program.
A meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers will be held in London at the end of this
month to consider a number of problems
affecting the peoples of this great association
of nations. My Prime Minister plans to attend
this conference.
During the summer arrangements were
completed to permit the navigational facilities
of the St. Lawrence River to be enlarged
and a hydro electric project to be undertaken
in the International Rapids section.
Work on these two projects has already
begun and my ministers are convinced the
stimulus to the national economy resulting
from their construction will be shared in all
parts of the country.
Since you last met, Cape Breton Island
has been linked with the mainland by the
new causeway, which will be ready for
service as soon as the ship canal has been
bridged.
It is expected that, in the course of the
coming season, the new ferry between North
Sydney and Port aux Basques will be in
operation and the ferry service between
Yarmouth and Bar Harbour started. Construction of a new ferry to operate between
Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island will
be undertaken early in the present year.

To improve navigation on the Pacific Coast,
you will be asked to make provision at this
session for the removal of Ripple Rock.
Canadians learned with deep regret of the
loss of life and damage to property caused
by two severe storms felt heavily in the
province of Ontario and the province of Nova
Scotia. An agreement has been reached with
the province of Ontario to assist those
persons whose homes were damaged or
destroyed, and assistance has been given under
the Agricultural Prices Support Act to the
producers of apples in Nova Scotia. You will
be asked to make the necessary financial
provision for these arrangements.
The Disabled Persons Act which you passed
at the last session was proclaimed to come
into force at the beginning of the present
year. The governments of all the provinces
have announced their intention to participate
in implementing the program to assist those
who are totally unable to care for themselves;
and my ministers are now in a position to
conclude the necessary federal-provincial
agreements to bring this humanitarian measure into operation.
Although the national economy is in a
generally healthy condition, the relatively
poor wheat crop is being reflected by a small
decline in the total national income. Some
unemployment of a regional and seasonal
nature is being experienced. To help meet
this situation work on public construction
projects already approved is being accelerated
and you will be asked to make financial
provision for construction in the programs of
various departments and agencies on a scale
that will make possible a substantial increase
in the total expenditures for this purpose.
The Government proposes to introduce
legislation immediately for the amendment
of the Unemployment Insurance Act to
provide for an increase in the duration and
scale of supplementary winter benefits. It
is also proposing to introduce, during the
session, broader amendments designed to
make unemployment insurance a more effective instrument in providing financial support
to unemployed workers.
The National Housing Act, 1954, enacted
early in the last session, which authorized
lower down-payments and larger loans, and
which enabled the chartered banks for the
first time to make loans on the security of
residential mortgages, has been an important
factor in stimulating the construction of a
record number of houses in the past year.
The prospects are favourable for a high level
of house building in 1955.
It is proposed to bring into general operation on the first of February the provision of
the act under which loans may be made for

JANUARY 7, 1955
home improvements. In accordance with an
undertaking given at the last session, this
section was proclaimed for small holders
under the Veterans' Land Act with effect
from the first of this year.
You will be asked to consider amendments
to the Railway Act relating to the elimination
of level crossings.
The Government also
hopes to lay before you during the present
session a measure to consolidate the legislation affecting the Canadian National Railways.
Amendments to the Electricity and Fluid
Exportation Act and a measure to control
works which affect the normal flow of rivers
which cross the international boundary will
be proposed for the purpose of ensuring that
natural resources are developed in the best
interests of the Canadian public.
You will be asked to consider a measure
to implement a convention between Canada
and the United States relating to fisheries
research on the Great Lakes.
You will also be asked to consider legislation to provide facilities for loans to fishermen
similar to those provided to farmers by the
Farm Improvement Loans Act.
The Government will submit amendments
to the War Veterans Allowance Act to raise
the basic rates as well as the ceiling on permissible incomes of recipients of allowances.
You will also be asked to consider amendments to the Blind Persons Act to lower the
age of eligibility and raise the income
ceilings.
A measure which will provide for amendments to the National Defence Act and the
Defence Services Pension Act will be placed
before you.
Legislation will be proposed to replace the
Meat and Canned Foods Act by measures to
provide for the inspection of meat and for the
establishment of standards for all agricultural
products.
You will be asked to approve a convention
signed by the members of the International
Civil Aviation Organization which fixes the
responsibility for damage caused to third

A joint committee of both houses will be
prcposed to examine, in the light of the
Municipal Grants Act and possible amendments thereto, the financial and other relationships of the Government and the Federal
District Commission with the City of Ottawa
and neighbouring municipalities.
Among other measures you will be asked

THE

LATE SENATORS BUCHANAN
AND BEAUREGARD
TRIBUTES TO THEIR MEMORY

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald:
Honourable
senators, since we last met, the Grim Reaper
has taken from our midst two of our highly
respected and dearly beloved senators. The
Honourable Senator W. A. Buchanan of
Lethbridge passed away on July 11 of last
year. It was my great privilege to have
known the late Senator Buchanan as a close
friend from the time I first entered the
House of Commons, in 1935. As a member of
the House of Commons he always took a keen
interest in young newcomers to that chamber, and throughout the years I valued his
friendship and advice most highly.
It is difficult to refer to the late Senator
Buchanan without calling to mind the rugged
individualism which characterized his whole
life and public career. His willingness to
accept new challenges at every point of life,
and a devotion to substance rather than
form, marked his rise to pre-eminence in
his chosen field of news publication as well
as in public service.
The late W. A. Buchanan was a son of the
manse. He was born at South Monaghan,
Ontario, on July 2, 1876, to the Reverend
William and Mary Pendrie Buchanan. His
father, being a clergyman, was required to
move from place to place, with the result that
the senator received his early education at a
number of public schools throughout the country. I will mention some of them: Norwood,
Warkworth, Brighton and Trenton. He left
school at the age of 16 years and immediately
took a job as a printer's devil with the
Peterborough Exaeminer. Afterwards he was
employed as a reporter with the Peterborough Review, and later in 1899, he went
to Toronto, to work on the Evening Telegram,
of which he became city editor, and subsequently news editor. With this experience

JANUARY 11, 1955

behind him he went on to St. Thomas, and
in 1902 became managing editor of the St.
Thomas Journal.
As with thousands of others, the lure of
the West at the turn of the century beckoned
the late senator, where he found new challenges in both private and public life. In
1905 he arrived at Lethbridge. The town
had only 2,000 inhabitants, and by comparison with busy Calgary, 126 miles to the
north, did not indicate great promise. However, neither in Calgary, nor in Edmonton,
to which he went later, was he successful in
setting up a newspaper. He returned, therefore, to Lethbridge, where he shortly became
sole owner of the Weekly Herald.
Having established himself in private business, he soon turned his attention to public
affairs, and in 1909, only four years after
his arrival in the West, he was elected as
Liberal member to the legislature of Alberta.
His ability was soon recognized, and Mr.
Rutherford, the Premier of that province,
made him a minister without portfolio in
his cabinet. Certain difficulties arose in
connection with a railway scandal, and his
sense of loyalty and fairness to those he
represented overcame political ambitions in
the provincial government of that day, so
three months after his appointment he retired.
Honourable members will recall what was
known as the "Reciprocity Election". Turning
from the provincial to the federal field, in
1911 he ran as a liberal candidate in support
of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and was elected for
the constituency of Medicine Hat, and in
1917 he became the first federal member
in the new constituency of Lethbridge, which
he represented in the House of Commons
until 1921. He then retired from federal
politics, and was appointed to the Senate
in 1925.
During his many years in parliament, Senator Buchanan performed yeomen service, not
only in both chambers but on committees.
Although champion of the West, he disapproved of sectionalism, and never allowed
sentiment to becloud his conviction that
legislation should be in the interests of
Canada as a whole and not of one section
of the country only. His outlook was always
"Canada first." Truly, he was a great Canadian. As a member of virtually all the important committees of this house, and latterly
as chairman of the Tourist Traffic Committee,
he earned the respect of everyone in this
chamber.
Admirers of the late senator-and we all
were admirers of him-often thought that
had it not been for his physical disability he
might have risen to higher prominence in
our land. Certainly it prevented him from

accepting the leadership of the Liberal party
in Alberta, a position which was offered to
him at one time. His disability, however, did
not reduce in any way his magnificent contribution to fellow journalists and citizens of
Canada. Truly both they and we are beneficiaries of a career dedicated to the betterment of his country and mankind.
To his wife and his two sons who survive
I express deep gratitude for the unselfish
service of a great man, and my sincere sympathy in their grievous loss.
On August 27 of last year we lost another
dearly beloved and highly respected member
of this house. I refer to the late Honourable
Elie Beauregard.
Here again in one man was combined a
variety of the most important elements that
have brought many Canadians to eminence:
a knowledge of the law, *a keen interest in
industry and vision in politics. These in
themselves are enough for greatness, but in
addition the late Senator Beauregard possessed the highest qualities of heart and
mind, and a gentleness of manner which
endeared him to everyone in this chamber.
I first became acquainted with Senator
Beauregard when, in 1949, I was elected
Speaker of the House of Commons. At that
time Senator Beauregard had been appointed
Speaker of this chamber. During my term of
office it was frequently necessary for us to
confer on matters of mutual interest. I found
him to be a man of deep understanding and
sympathy; and we had no problems which we
could not solve amicably. When I came to
this house he greeted me as a friend, and I
frequently turned to him for advice. His
passing is a great loss to me personally.
The late Elie Beauregard was born on
July 8, 1884, at La Patrie, Compton County,
Quebec, the son of Henri Beauregard and
Helene Ducharme. His formal education was
received at St. Hyacinthe Seminary, Montreal
College and Laval University, where he pursued the study of law.
After having been admitted to the Bar of
the province of Quebec in 1909, Senator
Beauregard opened a law practice in Montreal. He soon gained eminence, and in 1919
was created a King's Counsel. In 1941 he
was elected President of the Montreal Bar
Association.
But the late senator's activities went far
beyond the practice of law. He was a leader
in the business life of the community as well.
He held, among others, the offices of Chairman of the Provincial Bank of Canada, VicePresident of General Security Insurance
Company and President of H. Corby Distillery,
Limited.

SENATE

His interest in the field of education as well
was marked by continual contributions. He
was appointed Vice-President of the Administrative Board of the University of Montreal,
and in recognition of his services he received
an honorary degree from that institution in
November, 1953.
However, Senator Beauregard's great love
was for the field of public service at every
level-municipal, provincial and dominion.
Of course, it was in the last named field
where we came to know him and respect his
ability when he was summoned to the Senate,
in 1940, and especially when he was appointed
Speaker of this house, in which office he
gained recognition for his fairness in the
consideration of all problems that came before
him.
In the provincial field he was always at the
forefront in the Liberal party, and for a time
was Treasurer of the Liberal organization in
the Province of Quebec. I think it is a tribute
to his greatness as a politician and a leader
at all levels, and emphasizes his belief in
"grass roots" politics, that he continued to be
active in the municipal council of the city of
Outremont even after he became a member
of this house.
Of course his service here needs no elaboration. He was Chairman of the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce from
1945 to 1949; and before he became Speaker,
and after he left the Speaker's chair, he was
a member of all the important committees of
this house. In recognition of his services to
our country be was created a Privy Councillor
ln 1953.
Senator Beauregard bas passed on, but he
belonged to that class of great men whose
works live after them. His memory will be
for ever green in the hearts of all of us in
this chamber tonight, and among the many
thousands of Canadians whose lives touched
his during his long and colourful career.
To his wife, to his son and to his three
daughters, I extend my very deep sympathy.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
find it a little difficult to rise and speak about
these colleagues who have departed this life.
I had known Senator Buchanan personally
for a very long time. He was a westerner,
engaged in the newspaper business, as the
honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) has said, and he performed
very outstanding work in this field. He was
one of the founders of the Canadian Press, an
organization which was formed for the purpose of supplying newspapers with a news
service which none of them would be able to
obtain through their own resources. He

always afterwards played a leading part in
that organization, and at one time served as
its president.
Like all members of this house I feel the
passing of Senator Buchanan very keenly.
He was so typical of the men and women who
have come from other parts of Canada to our
western country and left a lasting impression
there. The respect of the people of western
Canada for the eastern provinces has been
enhanced by men of Buchanan's character
and ability. When you ask "Where did Bill
Buchanan come from?" or where did someone else of outstanding ability come from, the
answer frequently is that be came from some
place in eastern Canada. As a result, although
we think the west is the best part of our
country, we have a feeling that there must be
something pretty good in those parts which
produce men of such high character.
I will not repeat what my honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has said. I will
only add what I think is in the hearts of
most of us. By some measure men and
women in the legislative bodies of this
country assess the character and ability of
their fellow members. I cannot tell you what
the measuring rod is, I cannot tell you the
method by which they arrive at the measurement, but it is usually reliable. And as to
our late colleague, the conclusion is: "Bill
Buchanan was quite a man, quite a gentleman." That phrase seems to stick in your
mind when you think of the late Senator
Buchanan. He was a man, and he was a
gentleman; and I want to add another word:
he was also a Christian gentleman. He took
a very active and leading part in the church
of his choice in southern Alberta. Indeed,
he made a great contribution to the building
of new churches in that part of our country.
We will miss him here, because we always
felt that his opinion was the considered
opinion of a man who loved his country and
also wanted his country to be right on every
question. For the life of me, sitting here as
I have done for so many years and the late
senator sitting just about opposite me, if I
had not known through reading current
history I must say I could never have been
quite sure on what side of politics he was.
As a westerner, I want to pay my very
great respects to Senator Buchanan for the
contribution he has made to Alberta, to
western Canada, to the Canadian newspaper
field, and to our whole country. I would say
in conclusion that his wife, who herself is
very ill, and his two sons have been left a
priceless heritage in the memory of this
Christian gentleman, and great citizen.
Now I want to speak a word or two of
Senator Beauregard, whom I knew quite

JANUARY 11, 1955

well. It seemed to me that it was a real
pleasure to know him, and I was delighted
when I found that he was a keen student of
religion. Indeed, he was a very advanced
student of the subject, and lie spent many
hours reading religious theses in order to
understand the religious problems facing the
world today. And whether I agree with his
particular form of religion or not, whether
you agree with it or not, the fact is that anybody who knew his religion as well as he
did, and was willing to spend so much time
studying it, must have found there something that the rest of us can copy. That was
one of the factors that made him so influential in cementing the good feeling between
the people of Quebec and those of the rest
of Canada. We as Canadians need more men
and women of that kind in our legislative
bodies, in our House of Commons and in our
Senate, because Canada can never be as'
great a country as it should be unless we
achieve the kind of unity towards which
Senator Beauregard made so valuable a contribution. In whatever part of Canada we
live we feel proud of Quebec for producing
so eminent a fellow citizen as Senator
Beauregard.
During his term of office as Speaker, the
late Senator Beauregard's judgments were
invariably sound. He was fair and considerate and always remembered that our group
was not very large. I hate to admit that I
was sometimes wrong in my contentions, but
I knew occasionally that I was a little out
of line. He always tried to keep me on the
right road, because lie was aware that the
government supporters could override me if
they really wanted to do it. It was heartening to me and to others of our group that lie
was so keen to see fair play given to the
minority in this chamber.
His wife has lost a great life partner, and
his son and daughter, a noble father. I say
the same to Senator Buchanan's family. I
speak of what I know: I can sympathize with
them to the very limit. I want them to know
that we, who have been associated with him
for so many years, loved him,-yes, not only
respected and admired him, but loved him.
When a member of this house has a pretty
hard battle before him, the assurance of the
support and love, of his fellow members for
those who may be bereaved is a great help
and comfort to him. To the families of both
our friends I say that we shall retain the
happiest memories of them; that we believe
they are yet living with us, that tonight they
are listening to our statements, and saying,
"We did not think they thought so much of
us as they do."

(Translation):
Hon. Mr. Gouin: Honourable senators, I
cannot let this occasion go by without saying
a few words in memory of my friend,
Senator Elie Beauregard.
The last time I chatted with him, last summer, I had no idea that I would never see
him again and that I should have, this
evening, the difficult and bounden duty to
pay to him this posthumous tribute.
He was a deserving man, a most deserving
man. A great lawyer, he became at one time
president of our Bar Association; a shrewd
businessman, lie was a member of the Board
of Directors of the Provincial Bank and of
various insurance companies.
To his great intelligence and his capacity
for work, lie joined devotion to duty and
kindness. Those who saw him at work know
what pains lie went to, as a member of the
Board of Directors of the University of Montreal, during the great crisis of 1930.
As a man of great culture, lie showed by
his actions how much our culture meant to
him. I have myself been in a position to
witness the solicitude lie showed those whom
lie could help. He enjoyed being of service
to others and did it with admirable tact as
well as with all his heart.
On many occasions I was an associate of
his, so I had occasion to admire his clear and
sure judgment, his deep knowledge of men
and his extraordinary acumen. A man of
good counsel, he played in the Liberal party
a most important part. His was the ability
of a great tactician. Even more, I would
salute in him a strategist of exceptional
value. In the record of our electoral battles,
Senator Beauregard deserves a place of
honour.
I have lost a very dear friend, while our
country, in my estimation, has lost a great
citizen. Those of my generation will never
forget the name of the former Speaker of the
Senate, of a Canadian who was as distinguished as lie was modest, Senator Elie
Beauregard.
To his widow and his children, I would
express my deep sympathy.
Hon. Mrs. Jodoin: Honourable senators,
may I join with the honourable members
of this Chamber who have just spoken in
praise of the honourable senator from Rougemont, who, for fifteen years, was the pride of
the Province of Quebec.
As gracious as lie was modest, his greatest
quality was the absolute discretion which
gained him the complete trust of his own as
well as his political family.
He carried discretion to the point of
silence, for among his intimate friends he
often claimed that: "When we speak of our

SENATE
neighbour we are always inclined to speak
against him". But in his case we are not
tempted to do so. Our attitude is rather one
of sincere praise and gratitude for the great
principles which inspired him with respect
for the reputation of others and for the confidences which his legal profession obliged
him to receive. "Live and let live", he would
say to his children, "with due respect for the
personal opinions and tastes of each one of
you". In his private, political and public life,
he was true to that principle.
(Text):
Honourable senators, it was for me a matter
of much pride and confidence that I entered
this chamber for the first time leaning on
the arm of the late senator from Rougemont
(Hon. Mr. Beauregard). He was my godfather
in the Senate.
I wish to join with others in extending to
his wife and daughters the deepest sympathy
of his many friends, especially the women of
the province of Quebec, and our admiration
of the great man who has passed from our
midst.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
we are paying tribute tonight to two senators
who will be greatly missed from our midst.
Senator Beauregard endeared himself to all
of us when he was Speaker of this chamber.
I had the opportunity of attending the very
impressive
funeral
service
of Senator
Buchanan. The large church was filled with
people from the city and the surrounding
country. The chancel was banked high with
flowers: each blossom, each petal, representing someone's kind thought, or the memory
of some kind deed. The minister expressed
his feelings and the feelings of many of us
when lie recited Lord Tennyson's poem,
Crossing the Bar:
Sunset and evening star,
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea.
But such a tide as moving seems asleep,
Too full for sound and foam,
When that which drew from out the boundless
deep
Turns again home.
Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark,
And may there be no sadness of farewell
When I embark.
For though from out our bourne of time and
place
The flood may bear me far,
I hope to see my Pilot face to face,
When I have crossed the bar.
There was a long funeral procession, and

our late friend was buried in Mountain View
Cemetery, on the crest of a hill that overlooks a vast stretch of prairie, and from
which the distant foothills of the Rockies can

be seen. Those were the lands he loved
and its people were those he had served for
nearly half a century.
I join with my colleagues extending to the
relatives of the late Senators Buchanan and
Beauregard the sympathy which has been so
well expressed.
Hon. James A. MacKinnon: Honourable
senators, I did not realize that there was
going to be an opportunity this evening to
speak of our late colleagues, Senators
Buchanan and Beauregard. I cannot permit
this occasion to pass without speaking about
my former deskmate, Senator Buchanan, a
man whom I had known for over fifty years
from the day he first came to Edmonton from
Eastern Canada.
He came there because
Edmonton and Alberta were being very much
spoken of at that time in Eastern Canada,
and because several people with whom lie

had gone to university were then in professional and public life in Edmonton. I refer
particularly to the Attorney-General of
Alberta at that time, the Honourable C. W.
Cross, who was an intimate, personal friend

of Senator Buchanan. I remember the conversations that Billy Buchanan had with his
friends about getting established in the newspaper business in Alberta. It was decided
that he would go to Lethbridge, which he did,
and this proved a happy choice for him. He
eventually spent a lifetime in Lethbridge, in
the midst of thousands of people who dearly
loved him and who have mourned his passing
most deeply.
Senator Buchanan founded the Lethbridge
Heraid in a fairly modest way. To begin
with, I think, the paper was published weekly,
and subsequently it was published 'daily. He
built the paper into a very substantial organ
of public opinion, a newspaper that has been
respected and quoted throughout Canada and
in many parts of the world. Billy Buchanan
did his own thinking and lie spoke and wrote
as he thought.
I also knew Billy Buchanan when he went
from Lethbridge to Edmonton as a member
of the provincial Legislature, and I knew him
again during the period to which my honourable Leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has referred, the period of political unrest and uprising in the Liberal party in Alberta. I say
the Liberal party, for there was only one
party in the province at that time. There
was, I believe, only one representative in the
Legislature who was not in the ranks of the
Liberal party. Senator Buchanan eventually
came to Ottawa, where he had a most distinguished career. He had a great love for
Canada, for Alberta, but particularly for
southern Alberta.
He possessed a great
affection for his fellowmen.
It has been

JANUARY 11, 1955
mentioned that he was flot a partisan; he
certainýly was not a narrow partisan. An
ardent Liberal, he thoroughly believed in
Liberal principles but, as I have already said,
he did his own thinking and followed his own
conscience.
The late Senator Buchanan also had a
tremendous love for Waterton Lakes National
Park in southern. Alberta, which he did so
much to establish and build Up.
Senator Buchanan was called at a Urne
when he had so m'any reasons for wanting to
remain. First of all, there was his family,
and then he had just seen completed the construction of a splendid new building to house
his beloved Lethbridge Herald.
Senator Buchanan, who had the love and
affection of everyone who knew him, could
always be called ýupon to give everything he
had to public service or any cause that
needed his help. Hle wasalways ready to go
at a momen.t's notice to ýany part of Alberta
where -duty, political or othorwiso, called.
I cannot say enough about my memory of
the late Senator Buchanan. We had always
been intimate friends. His frionds were my
friends and my friends were his friends. I
have feit his passing most deeply, and I know
that everyone in my province sincerely
mourns the loss of such a wond-erful adopted
son of Alberta. There is nothing more I can
a'dd. There are many things I would like to
have said in a much better way, but I arn
glad of the opportunity to pay tribute to my
old friend of over fifty yoars' standing, a man
for whom I ýalways had the deepest affection
and regard.
I did not know our late colleague, Senator
Beauregard, noarly so well, but I knew him
to be a man who impelled respect and affection. To the families of those two departed
colloagues 1 wish to oxtond my very deepest
sympathy at thîs time.
Hon. W. Rupert Davies: Honourablo
senators, occasions such as this are always
saýd and perhaps a little depressing. For
that roason I shall be brief. 1 should like
to ondorse everything that has been said about
the late Sonator Beauregard, who was our
highly respected Speaker for some four or
five years, but I particularly want to pay
tribute to my late senatorial friend and
newspaper colleague, Bull Buchanan. I knew
Senator Buchanan for about 30 to 35 years.
1 sat with him on the board of the Canadian
Press for 20 years, during two years of
which he was the presiding officer. The
honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. Haig) spoke of Senator Buchanan's interost in the dominion newspaper organization. I have here a book on the history of

the Canadian Press, the co-operative news
gathering organization of this country, and
I would like to tell the house that this nonorganization,
partisan, non-profit-making
owned and operated by the newspapers of
this country, was born in the Canadian west.
The newspapermen of the west found that getting news from the east and far countries was
a very difflcult business indeed, when they
started their newspapers out there in the
early days of the century, and even before.
I do not know what part Senator Buchanan
playod in stirring themn up, but they became more and more agitated about the
situation as time went on. They were getting
very littie news and paying a very big price
for it. In this book entitled The Story of
the Canadiart Press, by M. E. Nichols, President of the Canadian Press ini 1931-33, is
a picture of a group which had met in
Winnipeg in 1910 to see if they could do
something about the poor news services which

row is Bill Buchanan. Some of the western
sonators will know the others, such as M. E.
Nichols, of Vancouver, J. W. Dafoe, editor
of the Winnipeg Free Press, and Tom Miller,
publisher of the Moose Jaw Times, who was
Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan for a
short period before his death.
These men decided to do something about
a botter news service. As I have said, the

came to Ontario and met with Senator Jaffray,
of the Globe, John Ross Robertson, of the
Telegram, and two or three others, and that
was when the Canadian Press was born.
Perhaps it is true to say that the Canadian
Press was born in the West, but it had achieved, shall I say, at least a youthfuh appearance
by 1917.
I saw much of Senator Buchanan at our
newspaper meetings. 1 sat with him. once
when he was president of a committee
which was dealing with an application
from the telegraphers for more money. We
sat as a sort of labour committee, and
I was very much impressed at that time
with the kindliness and fairness with which
ho approached the whole matter. Too often
there is a feeling that when employees
ask for more money they do not need it
and do not deserve it. Buchanan did not
take that attitude, but ho listened very
pationtly to everything the delegation had
to say. We sat down around the table, and
it was largely due to his kindly interest
and fairness that a very amicable conclusion was reached. I only wish some other
industrial disputes, which seem to hang like

SENATE
a shadow over this country at the present
time, could be settled in the same amicable
way.
Senator Buchanan was one of the founders
of the news gathering organization of this
country. While a number of senators who
knew him well for many years have paid
tributes to his memory, perhaps I may be
permitted to read a short extract from this
book The Story of the Canadian Press to

show what the newspapermen of Canada
thought of him:
When William Asbury Buchanan joined the staff
of the Toronto Evening Telegram in the late
'nineties he quickly established his claims to recognition; all his associates believed that he would
eventually be one of the chief executives of the
Telegramo.
But Buchanan was not content te
remain an employee; his thoughts were fixed on
Canadian towns where small capital would buy a
long-tern option of ownership of a small daily or
a weekly in a town that had possibilities of early
growth. His survey led him finally to Lethbridge,
then a town of 2,000; Lethbridge made good its
possibilities of growth; the weekly blossomed in
the Lethbridge Daily Herald, one of the most
admired of Canada's smaller dailies.
Buchanan's incursions in politics, which ended in
his Senate appointment, were only faintly reflected
in the conduct of his newspaper; his heart was in
the Herald and fairness to the reader was his
primary concern. He helped to plant that spirit in
the principles and practices of the Canadian Press,
an institution which his abilities and energies have
enriched.
The Western Associated Press had in
Billy Buchanan a staunch supporter; in its darkest
moments there was in Lethbridge an unfailing
source of encouragement.
In business and in politics Buchanan's progress
was relatively free from the rude jolts commonly
suffered by men who start with light kit on long
and rugged roads. He won his objectives with
apparent ease. For these mercies his debt is to
Nature's equipment: he had ability; everyone liked
him; everyone had confidence in him.

I think we can all endorse that tribute.
I will close by joining with other honourable senators in expressing to the families of
both Senator Buchanan and Senator Beauregard sympathy in their great bereavement.

speak most highly, and I should like everyone
here to know that he was a very fine man.
To his wife, whon I have known for a very
long time, and to his sons, I extend my own
sympathy as well as that of everyone in the
chamber.
Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourable
senators, I wish to add a few words of tribute
to the memory of these two great Canadians.
I always admired and respected Senator
Beauregard, and I am sure we all agree that
he enriched the prestige and dignity of this
chamber.
I was drawn to Senator Buchanan, when
I first entered the Senlate, by a friendship
which, over the years, grew into a very deep
affection. I can assure honourable senators
that no one present here tonight could be
more deeply conscious than I of that vacant
chair, which the late senator once occupied.
At his passing sincere tributes, such as we
have heard tonight, were paid to him from
all over Canada. There were tributes to his
memory as a man, as a publisher, as a distinguished Canadian citizen and an adornment
to public life. I cannot and do not propose
to attempt to add to what has 'already been
said in these respects. But I do want te
express my own appreciation of the privilege
it has been for me to know and to love the
late Senator Buchanan. His great heart and
mind influenced me considerably.
Senator Buchanan will be missed perhaps
net so much for what he did, as for those
rare and precious qualities which he possessed.
This chamber, honourable senators, will be
very much the poorer for his passing.
(Translation):

Hon. Cyrille Vaillancour: Honourable senators, may I say one last word, net to repeat
what has already been said, but to underline a
characteristic which was common to both
our friends. Both Senator Buchanan and
Senator Beauregard understood that noise is
not the necessary accompaniment of good,
but that good is often brought about without
noise.
They both lived up to that principle and
quietly worked in their own way toward
the prosperity and development of Canada,
making little noise but doing much good.
In closing, may I repeat the prayer I said
in each case on learning of their passing: "0
God give him eternal peace and protect his
family".

Hon. Cairine R. Wilson: Honourable senators, unfortunately, I left my native province
while Senator Beauregard was still at school,
but I should like to endorse everything that
the honourable senator from Sorel (Hon. Mrs.
Jodoin) has said about him. And I agree
with the honourable senator from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. MacKinnon) that it would be impossible to say enough in tribute to Senator
Buchanan. He was my earliest, and may I
say my best, friend in this house. When I
first entered the chamber, feeling very much
lost amongst the many males, he took me
under his wing. I asked if I might sit next to (Text):

in the chamber tonight and to pay tribute to
his friend of many years' standing, the late
Senator Buchanan. In his absence from the
city, the senator from Ottawa has asked me,
with your leave, to pay tribute on his behalf.
It reads as follows:

From this reference may be realized the sincere
pride with which our late colleague regarded the
profession of his choice. Indeed, a real appreciation of Senator Buchanan is inseparable from his
identity as an editor and newspaperman. I knew
him for over forty years, and he stands out clearly
as a great example of responsibility for the written
and printed word as reflected in the press of this
country.

and thus to activate otherwise idie generating
capacjty i the States of Washington and
Oregon. The Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical
Corporation of the United States would
finance the prai ect and receive part of the
downstream power, which would. be uýsed for
aluminum production at Spokane.
According to the statements then made by
the British Columbia minister, the water
licence to the Kaiser interes-ts would be issued
for a period of 50 years. The 3 million acre
feet of storage would produce about 2 billion
k.w. hours of electricity a year. 0f this,
it is undersýtood that British Columbia is to
receive 20 per cent. Including $275,000 to be
collec-ted in taxes, the value of the overaîl
return to British Columbia has been set at
around $1 million a year.
As I said before, I want to, make it quite
clear that I believe this has been changed,
although I have no figures or official statement before me -to that effect. According
to reliable sources the Kaiser Corporation
and the Bonneville Power administration
were each to receive 40 per cent; that is,
they would receive 800 million kilowatt hours
each. In addition, Kaiser agreed to pay $1
million annually .to Bonneville Power for its
share of power, and $275,000 in water rentais
and taxes to the British Columbia Government. Finally, the capital carrying charges
assumed by the Kaiser Corporation to finance
this $30 million dam in British Columbia
were estimated to be approximately $2 *4
million annually.
There bas been some indication that there
is in the agreement a provision under which
the British Columbia Government may be
obligated to forgo its share of the power in
certain circumstances and receive a cash
payment annually. If this is correct-and I
want to emphasize the words "if this is correct"-it would appear that there is an
agreed price for power for 50 years, no matter what may happen to power values over
that long period of time. So far, to my knowîedge, there is no provision for British
Columbia to get any share of, or payment
for, power that may be produced in the
United States or any work-s that may be constructed there in future to make use of the
storage facilities on the Arrow Lakes.
Honourable senators, in a nutshell, that is
the basis of the original agreement. As I
said before, there has been soine indication,
I believe, of a change in the proposition, but
no officiai statement to this effect, only pronouncements made by the minister, of which
I have no record.
The point at issue to which the people of
British Columbia as a whole object-and I
say "as a whole" advisedly, for there has

been great controversy and objection heard
from all over that province because of the
number of people who would be fiooded out
by the project-is that it would provide for
the Kaiser Aluminumn Company in the United
States very much cheaper power than we in
the province could get. It is not necessary
for me to explain to honourable senators
that this would militate against the establishment of industries in British Columbia. In
addition, it would tie up potential sources of
energy for many years in our province, when
one has only to look into the foreseeable
future to realize that before many years have
passed we shaîl be in need of ahl possible
sources of energy for our own use.
I think I can quite fairly state that were
thîs project to go through-and I hope, as it
now appears, that it will not go through-it
would provide most unfair competition for
Alcan, the Aluminum Company of Canada,
which bas vast undertakings in the central
and northern parts of the province. I say it
would resuit in unfair advantage over that
company, because it would enable the Kaiser
Aluminum. Company to seil its products
much cheaper than the Aluminum Company
of Canada in British Columbia could. I also
emphasize that the loss of potential power
is inestimable.
I need not say more on this particular
project, because I am sure the people of
British Columbia, and I think of the rest of
Canada, welcome the legislation forecast in
the Speech from the Throne, aimed as it is
at preventing the sort of exploitation of which
I have spoken. Unfortunately, the Government of British Columbia is rather hoping
for immediate returns rather than the longtermi benefits that are so necessary for that
province which has such great possibilities
for future industrial development.
I happenied to be present in the other
place-I believe I am correct, Mr. Spèaker,
in referring to it as the other placeHon. Mr. Euler: Not necessarily.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: -when this bill was
introduced, and I was very glad indeed
to notice the spontaneous and enthusiastic
reception accorded it from all sides of the
house, with the exception of one small quarter
which I need not designate and which of
course naturally would not approve of it.
By the time the bill reaches this bouse I
hope we shahl have further facts on the subject and shaîl be able to go into it in greater
detail. The measure is of great importance
to British Columbia at this time because the
province is just beginning to realize on the
vast reservoir of natural wealth with which it
bas been so richly endowed. Indeed, the

SENATE

eyes of the western world over the past five
or six years have been focussed on British
Columbia with its great expansion and
development.
As a private member of the former Coalition Government of British Columbia I am
proud to say that in 1951 that Government
announced a billion dollar investment program in the province. It included important
projects that I feel are worthy to be brought
to the attention of this chamber, because I
think, with all due respect to honourable
members, that many of them do not realize
the tremendous development which is taking place in British Columbia, that jewel in
the crown of Canadian provinces.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: Among the projects
which were launched, started or initiated at
that time was the Westcoast Transmission
Company's $700 million natural gas pipeline,
destined to be laid from the Peace River
district to the United States border south
of Vancouver.
Unfortunately, for causes
which have nothing to do with British Columbia but which originated on the other side
of the international border-you will remember there was a great deal of opposition there-it was announced that the construction of that pipeline would not be
started till 1955. The British Columbia section of that pipeline alone is estimated to
cost $130 million.
Of course, the most spectacular development of all is one to which I have already
alluded, the one undertaken by the Aluminum
Company of Canada at Kitimat. I had the
good fortune to be flown in to that development in the early stages of its construction
and it was only then I realized what was
being done, that this great industry, this immense undertaking, was being built in the
middle of the wilderness, in virgin forest,
five hundred miles from the nearest
settlement.
Those of you who have not visited British
Columbia's hinterland cannot envision the
magnitude of the task involved in setting up
what is to be a $600 million development by
the time it is completed. The project comprises a power development, a smelter, and a
townsite at Kitimat. The Aluminum Company has already spent $275 million on this
development. The first unit of the smelter
was completed at Kitimat in 1954 and the
first ingot was poured in the presence of the
Duke of Edinburgh. The first shipment was
made to the United States in September of
that year. The present plant is capable of
producing 91,500 tons of aluminum a year,
but already plans are under way for so

extending the ýpresent facilities as to increase
the yearly output by 60,000 tons and give
employment to an additional 1,000 people.
The operations at Kitimat at this stage have
provided jobs for thousands of workers,
skilled and unskilled. The new townsite is
being built in the wilderness, and in order
that it may be laid out along modern lines,
town-planning experts from all over Canada
have been retained. It is expected that
within a few years the development will give
employment ýto at least 10,000 people, and
that the townsite at Kitimat will ultimately
provide habitation for 50,000 to 60,000 people.
This vast undertaking, I must point out to
honourable senators who do not know the
district, will lead to a very great development
of the lands along the Canadian National
Railway line in that part of Canada from
Alberta to the Kitimat area, and this also
will be of tremendous advantage.
Another important ramification of the Alcan
project is the proposed $65 million Kitimat
Pulp and Paper mill, which will be jointly
owned by the Aluminum Company of Canada
and the Powell River Pulp and Paper Company.
I would like to mention a few other
developments which have taken place in
British Columbia in the last few years. The
Pacific Great Eastern Railway has constructed
a new line from Quesnel to Prince George,
and an extension is being projected north
from there, opening up that vast area. My
colleagues from Alberta will realize what this
will mean to that part of the country.
Other big developments include the Trans
Mountain Oil Pipe Line, involving a crude
oil pipe line from Alberta oil fields, refining
plants at lower mainland and refineries at
Ferndale and Anacortes in the State of
Washington at a cost of $100 million. As a
result of the construction of this pipe line
new refineries will be constructed at Ioco
(Imperial Oil Company), and Stanovan
(Standard Oil Company of B.C.), and an addition at Shellburn (Shell Oil Company of
Canada, Ltd.). The estimated cost of these
is $30 million.
In the mining and metallurgical field, the
Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company
has spent $57 million in the last few years in
extensions to its plants. Plans for the
development of a power plant at Waneta were
announced in 1951, and this undertaking was
completed last year. Various other extensions of the operations of the Consolidated
Mining and Smelting Company have alsb
been put in hand.
I hope I shall not be accused of being too
biased if I point out that most of these

JANUARY

projects were started long before the present
Social Credit Government came into office. I
mention that, though I do not want to be too
partisan, because the present provincial administration has a habit of taking credit to
itself for everything that has been done in
British Columbia, whether before or after
it acquired power, and it is only fair to point
out that many of the things I have mentioned
today were initiated and in fact completed,
before its regime began.
The H. R. MacMillan Harmac plant was
completed in 1950. An addition was begun
in 1951 and finished in 1954. The total cost
of these two developments was $35 million.
Another and smaller enterprise which I
should like to mention is a veneer plant
operated by Western Plywoods Cariboo
Limited at Quesnel: it employs five hundred
people and represents an investment of
$1,700,000. The Elk Falls Company Limited,
of Duncan Bay, is building a newsprint mill
at a cost of $40 million. Another great industrial development was started by Columbia
Cellulose Company at Prince Rupert about
five years ago. This pulp mill first came into
production in 1951, and the initial investment was about $27 million. Since then the
plant bas been considerably enlarged, at a
cost of some fifteen to twenty million dollars.
Over five hundred persons are employed,
and the investment represented today is of
the order of $47 million.
The addition to the plant of the New Westminster Paper Company Limited, which was
announced and proceeded with during the
Coalition regime under the Liberal leadership of Premier Byron Johnson, involved an
outlay of $2,500,000.
The Alaska Pine and Cellulose Company's
addition to its plant at Port Alice, which was
started in July 1951, represents a cost of
$8 million. B.C. Forest Products has spent
$2 million on a new veneer plant at Victoria,
employing 375 persons. Powell River Pulp
and Paper Company Limited has increased
the capacity of its plant at Powell River with
an outlay of some $50 million.
These are just a few of the developments
which I thought should be specifically mentioned, because it is only right, in my view,
that honourable senators and, in fact, all
the people of Canada should know of the
progress which is being made in the province of British Columbia. In fairness, I
must add that under the present government
many extensive operations are in progress.
Millions of dollars are being spent on industrial developments. Very large outlays are
being made by the B.C. Power Commission
and the British Columbia Telephone Company. The Frobisher and Venture interests
envisage a multimillion dollar project; and

12, 1955

when these and many other plans have come
to fruition the effects on the economy of
British Columbia will be very marked indeed.
Having touched briefly on matters raised
in one portion of the Speech from the Throne,
I wish to turn for a few moments to another
item which, while of peculiar value to our
province, is of interest to the rest of Canada,
namely the intimation of an improved deal
for municipalities affected by the tax-free
federal policy under the Municipal Grants
Act. It is reported that where the value of
federal property in any municipality amounts
to more than 2 per cent of the total assessment, that city will get grants equivalent to
the full municipal tax. At present, I understand that those communities which contain
federal property in excess of 4 per cent get
grants equal to 75 per cent of the tax. I have
not yet seen the bill, so I do not know what
it contains; but if the provisions are generally
in line with what is reported, they will be
of great value, particularly to my own city
of Victoria, which contains $3,250,000 worth
of federal properties. As honourable senators know, there are in Greater Victoria a
big naval base and various other federal
properties which are not included in this
total; but excluding these, the value of federally-owned property in Victoria amounts
to roughly 2j per cent of the 1955 gross
assessment.
Everyone welcomes such establishments.
One has only to look at the requests for post
offices and other public buildings of all kinds
throughout the country to realize what tremendous assets they are to the payrolls of
the communities concerned. At the same time,
the fact that they are usually located on
what are, for assessment purposes, the most
valuable local sites, means that the tax rolls
suffer accordingly. Services of various kinds
have to be supplied, and as a consequence the
ordinary ratepayer is more heavily taxed
because of the existence of these federal
buildings. I believe that if the suggested
legislation becomes law the harassed ratepayers of cities such as Victoria and Vancouver-to mention only two out of manywill be substantially helped; and I am very
glad that this matter bas been included in
the Speech from the Throne.
I must say a word in connection with
another item in the Throne Speech, which is,
of course, of peculiar interest to British Columbia; and that is, the proposed provision
for the removal of Ripple Rock. For many
years Ripple Rock has been causing a "ripple"
on the surface of British Columbia, because
it is a very, very serious hazard to navigation,
and the cost of removing it is considerable;
otherwise, I am sure, the Government would
have removed it long ago. I know the news

SENATE

will be welcome that at last the Government
are going to blast it out-or whatever it is
they intend to do with it.
Having touched on some material matters
mentioned in the Throne Speech, I want to
refer to the more distinctly humanitarian
projects which, of course, are of particular
interest to me as a woman. I welcome the
inclusion of the promise of legislation to
make substantial increases for public construction projects with a view to helping to
meet regional and seasonal unemployment
crises. In view of what I have said about
the development, growth and expansion of
British Columbia, some may suppose that we
in that province should be immune from
crises of this kind, but even in our salubrious
climate, because of too much rain, or from
other causes, outdoor industry must occasionally stop. Then, of course, there are other
factors over which we have no control-outside factors, which tend to upset the delicate
balance of the economy. The fact that wages
and standards of living are higher on the
Pacific coast than anywhere else in Canada
makes it very difficult for shipbuilding,
forest, and some other industries to compete
in world markets with industries whose
wages are lower and, in consequence, every
now and again we are faced with a burden
of unemployment.
Also, there is the fact that the genial climate of British Columbia attracts to that
province unemployed workers from the
prairies and other parts of the country where
nature is not quite so kind, who move to the
West in the hope of finding work under
rather more comfortable conditions. All these
factors tend to enlarge our problem of
unemployment, particularly in a city like
Vancouver, which is not only a seaport but
a border town. Vancouver has been having
a worrisome time.
Frankly, I think its
troubles have been exaggerated a little, but,
in any event, no one with any feeling
at all in his heart can but sympathize with
these unemployed people, whether they number 100 or 20,000. I am very glad to see
that something is going to be done in that
connection, both by way of public construction projects and by an increase in the benefits paid under the Unemployment Insurance
Act as well as by general amendments to
increase the effectiveness of the act itself.
I know there are a good many complaints
that this is not enough. I have not seen any
figures or any bills, so I cannot tell whether
it is enough, but at least it is a step in the
right direction. It is encouraging to those
who are undergoing these hardships at the
present time to know that the Government is
at least trying to do something to help them.

I am, of course, glad indeed to see that
there is to be an increase in the basic rates
payable under the War Veterans' Allowance
Act, and a higher ceiling on permissible incomes. I have always maintained that something is wrong with a policy which decrees
that a man or woman should not be allowed
to earn more than a certain sum. I think it
is a very bad principle and I do net believe
we should put any ceiling on permissible
incomes of any kind. Any person who has
the initiative and energy to go out and work
should be allowed · o do lall he or she possibly
t
can and not be subjected to an arbitrary
restriction on income, for such a policy
stultifies initiative and energy.
I am very glad to see that we are also
going to consider lowering the age of
eligibility of blind persons for pensions, and
raising their income ceilings. I do not think
we can do enough for the blind. Never having lost the use of my eyes, even temporarily,
I find it difficult to imagine what it would
be like to go through life without sight. I
feel we should do everything we possibly can
to make things casier for those who are
afflicted in this way.
Now I want to come down to a particular
problern which besets British Columbia
perhaps more than any other province. Apart
from factors I have mentioned-our salubrious climate and the climatic amenities-the
leisurely tempo of living draws to our province a great number of elderly people from
all parts of Canada. We welcome them.
Many of them are retired and have means,
but many others are working people and they
come with their families. We are glad to
have thern all, but the fact remains that their
presence has helped to create a problem.
In 1954 the population of British Columbia
was 1,266,000. I should like to emphasize
that as the provincial area is 366,000 square
miles, there is an average of about three
persons to every square mile, most of whom
are concentrated on the coast. Of that
population of 1,266,000, 13 per cent were
in the 65-years-and-over age bracket, as compared with 8 -5 per cent for Canada as a
whole; and 20 per cent were between the
ages of 45 and 64. Here I come to a point
which is to me particularly interesting. In
Victoria we have the highest ratio for all
Canada of citizens in the over-65 age group.
One in every six citizens in that city is over
65.
As I suggested before, this speaks
volumes for the climatie and other amenities
of the province. We have no deep snow, no
extremes of heat and cold, no mosquitoes, no
tornadoes, none of the things you people in
the rest of Canada have. The percentage of
the 65-years-and-over age group in ratio to
Victoria's overall population has quadrupled
since 1941. Some of the people who have

JANUARY
come there to retire are comfortably off, but
many others are barely eking out an existence on small pensions. Among this latter
group are retired federal and provincial civil
servants 'and burnt-out veterans with small
superannuation benefits. All these people
have a very difficult time, and I think you
will find from statisties that many of them
are included in our unemployed..
In Victoria at the end of October 1954
there were 2,375 unemployed men and women
on the books of the Unemployment Insurance
Commission. Of this number 331 were 65
years of age and over, which represented
13-93 or practically 14 per cent of the total.
A similar pattern presents itself in the
general unemployment picture of British
Columbia. On October 28, of the 8,171 unplaced applicants for jobs from people of
45 years of age and over, 2,731 were in the
65-and-up age group. Roughly, 39 per cent
of the unemployed men and 8-5 per cent
of the unemployed women were in the 45years-and-over category.
I want to point out to honourable senators that a psychological problem is involved
here. We are gradually getting to the point
of generally accepting, unintentially perhaps, the slogans: "Too old at 45" and "Get
out at 65". I feel I am speaking to a sympathetic audience here when I bring this up,
for if we had arbitrary retirement at 65 in
the Senate this house would be robbed of
some of its finest members-including, of
course, myself. So I know whereof I speak.
It is time we realized that the chronological
yardstick for measuring the earning ability,
capacity and powers of men and women
should be changed. Some people are too
old at 35, while others can go on doing a
good job until 80. What would the world
have done had Sir Winston Churchill been
told to get out at the age of 65? I can mention many men and women in Canada who
have made their greatest contribution to
Canadian life after having reached the age
of 65. And yet we say arbitrarily to civil
servants and people in industry that they
must get out at that age. Unfortunately, also,
if any of them lose their jobs at 35 or 40which may happen through no fault of their
own-and try to obtain other employment,
they are met with the objection: "You are too
old". The consequence is that the length
of time in which men and women can earn
enough with which to take care of themselves in their old age is shortened. I have
seen this happen many times.
It is a tragic thing to me that a man of
40 or 45, who is just at the peak of his
earning power and faced with full family
responsibilities, when his children are growing up and looking for higher education,

12, 1955

17

should be summarily told by the labour
market that he is too old. That is quite
wrong. We shall have to change our thinking altogether, and I think the Government
should start to give a lead in that direction.
The science of geriatrics has seen to it that
the life span is going to be longer than ever.
At a national health assembly meeting in
the United States a couple of years ago, a
certain scientist envisioned a time, not too
far in the future, when a life span of 146
years would be possible. He expressed the
rather horrible thought of a man marrying at
111, remarrying at 130, and living to be 146.
Happily, I shall not live to that age. The
scientist did not say whether women would
have a chance of remarriage at 130. The fact
remains, however, that the science of geriatrics, as well as medical science, is lengthening the span of life, while the span of working years is being shortened. I think it
is very bad psychologically to tell people
of 60 or 65 years of age that they are of
no further use on the labour market. I
have known cases, as I am sure honourable
senators have, of men being compelled to
leave their jobs at 65, probably at the height
of their experience and skill, and suddenly
feeling so frustrated and lost that they have
not lived very long afterwards. Also, such
people tend to become a burden to themselves
and the community. It seems to me ridiculous that we should insist on men retiring
at 65, when we do not grant them the old
age pension until 70. The two things do
not jibe. We must reconstitute our whole
thinking on this subject.
I spoke of the application of the science
of geriatrics and of medical science increasing the span of life, but apparently other
things are also conducive to longevity. I
was amused to read in a newspaper the other
day accounts of various people who had
attained 100 years of age, and who gave
some recipes for longevity that were quite
interesting. The recipe of one old lady, in
Missouri, was this:
Drink a nightly glass of beer with an egg beaten
in it. Also don't worry, and keep calm.

Another person, Charles Macklin, 107, of
London, England, gave this advice:
Every night before going to bed, wash
yourself all over with good brandy. Then
dress in an ordinary business suit and climb
into bed.
From what I know of a great many men,
they would think that a shocking waste of
good brandy!
A Toronto man of 100 advised eating three
steaks a day to live to a good old age. He
did not say whether he was a millionaire,

SENATE

but I think be must be if he can iafford three
steaks a day. One a day is the height of
opulence for most of us.
Honourable senators, we have got 'to face
the serious problem of our aging citizens.
At the present time nothing is being done
about it. True, we have marvellous social
welfare prograrns. The other day I discovered that the total amount appropriated
by the federal Government before the war for
social welfare in all its varied branches and
phases, amounted to $60 million. Today it
is somewhere in the region of one billion
dollars. So we are doing as much as we
possibly can in the general direction of caring
for our people, but we are not doing all ithat
we might particularly for the aged, and those
who are "too old at 45", and have to get out
of their jobs at 65.
It was ýsaid in the United States the other
day ithat by 1970 one-half of the working
force of the United States would be over 60
years of age. So the problem is not confined
to Canada. Indeed, I think all the civilized
countries of the world will have to look into
this problem of the older people. Unless we
want to become nations of preponderantly
old folks, so-called, at 40 years and over, we
shall have to change our present day estimate
of old age.
Honourable members, when I first came
into public life I was told that one of the
primary requisites of public speaking wias to
stand up, speak up and shut up. I have
stood up, 'I have tried to speak up, and I hope
that the interval between standing up and
shutting up has not been too long.
(Translation):

Hon. Leonard Tremblay: Honourable senators, in rising last year to propose, with eloquence and elegance, the Address in reply
to the Speech from the Throne, the honourable and most distinguished senator for the
senatorial division of Sorel (Hon. Mrs. Jodoin)
pointed out the fact that "for the first time
in the history of this country, a woman is
awarded the honour of moving the Address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne" and
concluded quite reasonably that such an historical event "strengthens the fine traditions of
our Canada, which advocate the freedom
of one and all to express their opinions".
(Text):
I recall also the interesting and witty
speech made last year, in seconding the
motion of the honourable senator from Sorel,
by the honourable senator from Fredericton
(Hon. Mrs. Fergusson), who, a bit later in the
same session, revealed herself to be a remarkable and most persuasive debater by obtaining

the amendment of a bill affecting certain
categories of civil servants who claimed the
liberty of deciding themselves whether the
measure was in their interest or not.
Our colleagues who belong to the sex which
our ancestors, ironically enough, qualified,
with a somewhat protecting air, as "the
weaker sex", showed, in the case to which I
have alluded, first of all their strength; and,
secondly, they demonstrated beyond any
doubt that the freedom of speech which they
enjoy may serve to safeguard in Canada other
liberties which are dear to their fellowcitizens.
(Translation):

Things have changed a great deal since
the days of the great Corneille, who could
place on the lips of one of his characters,
loudly applauded by his contemporaries:
Monsieur, quand une femme a le don de se taire
Elle a des qualités au-dessus du vulgaire!
(When a woman knows how to remain silent,
Sir, she is endowed with uncommon gifts.)

The above quotation alone shows most
clearly the progress accomplished in this
respect since the glorious seventeenth century. In recognizing the happy results of
the accession of women to public affairs, it
is fitting, I think, to rejoice sincerely and to
acknowledge the moderating and humanizing influence of women in politics . . . as

well as elsewhere, for that matter.
(Text):

This year again the task of proposing the
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne was entrusted to a representative of
the gentler sex, the honourable senator from
Victoria (Hon. Mrs. Hodges). The masterful
speech which we have just heard is proof
that the choice of the authorities was both a
happy and a judicious one. May I offer to our
colleague from Victoria my warmest congratulations and express to her my very deep
admiration. In so doing, I am voicing, I am
sure, the feelings of all honourable members
of this house.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Tremblay: Mr. Speaker, in rising
for the first time in this house, I would not
like to be remiss in the most agreeable duty
of congratulating you warmly upon your
appointment to the high and honourable post
which you occupy with so much dignity and
ability. Because of your sense of justice, your
tact and your experience in parliamentary
procedure you are eminently qualified for the
high duties entrusted to you, and I am particularly happy to add my tribute to the very
just homage already paid to you by my
honourable colleagues.

JANUARY
Honourable senators, there is in this chamber another most distinguished person whom
I wish to welcome, and who must assume the
responsibility for the perilous honour which
I have had the temerity to accept, that of
seconding the motion of the honourable senator from Victoria. I speak of the likeable
and-I might as well say it-the irresistible
Leader of the Government in this house
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald). Elected for the first
time in 1935, we sat together for eighteen
years in what we are agreed to call "the
other place".
Hon. Mr. Euler: No! Call it the House of
Commons.
Hon. Mr. Tremblay: I was, therefore, in a
position to follow his steady and welldeserved rise from the ranks of backbenchers
to the Speaker's Chair in that house.
It is sufficient for me to say that in all the
public positions which he has filled with such
a rare perfection, his infectious good humour,
his unruffled tactfulness, his proverbial good
nature, the skill which he possesses in the
highest degree of making friends and of
keeping them, his deep sense of duty and his
eagerness to serve his fellowmen, convince us
that he will continue for a long time his
march towards new summits.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
(Translation):
Hon. Mr. Tremblay: May I be allowed,
since we all know that he is bilingual, to
express in French my deep appreciation of
the honour which he has seen fit to bestow
upon the people I represent in the Senate,
in asking me to second the Address in reply
to the Speech from the Throne.
To the honourable senator from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Godbout), I wish to offer my
warmest congratulations upon the fine mark
of trust placed in him when he was called
to share the responsibilities of the Leader of
the Senate. This son of Quebec is an honour
to his province and we are proud of him; his
appointment is a matter of satisfaction to his
compatriots who have the greatest affection
and the deepest admiration for him. To this
man, also, who accomplished great things for
province and country when Canada was at
grips with the most terrible dangers of its
whole history, we extend our wishes
for success and the hope that the coming
years may offer him many other and greater
opportunities of devoting his talents and his
patriotism to the service of his fellow
citizens.
(Text):
In welcoming the newly appointed senators last year, my very good friend the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.

12, 1955
Crerar), with whom I had the honour to sit
for ten years in the other place, recalled certain weaknesses of your servant for vocal
music and his incorrigible habit of urging his
colleagues to sing in a chorus when the bell
called the "Commoners" for a division. He
even invited me to introduce in this honourable chamber that old and somewhat noisy
custom which rather belongs to another place.
I thank him for his generous and cordial welcome, but I hesitate to accept his kind invitation to sing. Let him not worry, however.
The reason for this attitude of mine does not
stem from a feeling of having grown older
since having been introduced into the new
atmosphere, so calm, so congenial and so
pleasant, of the Upper Chamber. On the contrary, in coming here one has the impression
of getting younger, for the hearty and spontaneous welcome one receives from Your
Honour and all honourable senators produces
on newcomers the same effect as the Fountain
of Youth. Having listened to the encouraging
speech of our honourable lady colleague from
Victoria, I may say that if ever my former
habit gets the best of me, I will undoubtedly
sing again Let me call you Sweetheart, and
not Darling I am growing old.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
(Translation):
Hon. Mr. Tremblay: Honourable senators,
although the Speech from the Throne may
not justify excessive optimism in regard to
world problems, it none the less leaves a comforting impression and shows us that, through
their laborious efforts, the Western nations
are firmly and efficiently progressing toward
their ideal of peace.
"...While the resources of diplomacy must
never be neglected in the search for peace,"
the Speech from the Throne states, "the efforts
of the free nations in building their deterrent forces must be maintained."
It is generally acknowledged that the first
duty of democratic nations is to build and
maintain the best defence system-I mean
collective defence-they can possibly provide.
Toward this end Canada must and does in
fact contribute generously. We are happy to
express our satisfaction to the Government of
our country whose external policy, I am sure,
has the unanimous approval of the Canadian
people.
May I take this opportunity of telling the
Right Honourable Louis St. Laurent, the Right
Honourable C. D. Howe, the Honourable Lester Pearson, the Honourable Paul Martin and
all the other ministers who so efficiently
second the Prime Minister, how much we
appreciate their efforts and their inestimable
contribution to the building of a true and

SENATE
durable peace in the world. Without security,
there is no use dreaming of development and
prosperity, since al that would be wiped out
once and for all were another cataclysm to
break out. Let us pray Divine Providence to
spare us from such a calamity and let us be
confident.
The sincerity, integrity and nobility of soul
of the Prime Minister, acknowledged and appreciated by everyone at home and abroad,
have made of him an authoritative and respected apostle of good will, of understanding,
of unity and of peace, not only within the
Canadian nation but among the free nations
of the whole world. Canada owes him an
irrevocable debt of gratitude for everything
be has done for our country.
At home, notwithstanding the shadows cast
by various fluctuations and difficulties in some
sectors of the economy and by increased
regional and seasonal unemployment, the
general picture is good and prospects most
encouraging.
Last September, there wero 109,000 people
without work drawing unemployment insurance benefits, a large number, it is true; but
it should be noted that during the same
month more than 5,100,000 persons were
occupying remunerative
employment
in
Canada.
But there is some feeling of unrest and
there are those who really fear an economic
recession and general unemployment. The
Government is conscious of these problems,
and is therefore seeking a solution to those
coming under its jurisdiction. For instance,
to avoid unemployment, the Government proposes that public construction projects already approved be accelerated, and asks
Parliament "to make financial provision for
construction in the programs of various departments and agencies on a scale that will
make possible a substantial increase in the
total expenditures for this purpose."
The Speech from the Throne indicates,
moreover, that the Government intends to
introduce "immediately" a legislative measure
designed to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act in order to increase the duration
and scale of supplementary winter benefits.
The Government "is also proposing to
introduce, during the session, broader amendments designed to make unemployment insurance a more effective instrument in providing
financial support to unemployed workers".
These measures, as well as others of no
less importance mentioned in the Speech
from the Throne, clearly demonstrate the
care with which the Government is doing
everything in its power to help all those
householders, Canadian men and women who,
through the force of local or temporary circumstances, might not find work.

Another measure, which has both an economic and a social effect and which is mentioned in the Speech from the Throne-and
the advantages of which the province of
Quebec has unfortunately not made as much
use of as its sister provinces-is the act
approved by the House of Commons on
March 8 last, providing for the construction
of new houses, repairs to and modernization of existing bouses and also for the
improvement of housing and living conditions.
With regard to this act, the Speech from
the Throne declares that it "has been an important factor in stimulating the construction
of a record number of houses in the past year"
and that "the prospects are favourable for a
high level of house building in 1955."
Judging from the marvellous results
obtained the very first year, the hopes entertained for the year 1955 are certainly not too
sanguine.
In a public statement made recently, the
honourable Minister of Public Works, Mr.
Winters, gave significant figures, which show
beyond any doubt what a strong impetus the
new act has given to house building. May I
be allowed to quote a few.
In the course of 1954, the building or remodelling of 110,000 to 115,000 bouses was
started, while it was completed in the case of
104,000 to 108,000 houses, which represents a
considerable increase over any other year in
Canadian history.
The present number of houses which we
are starting to build is even higher. Taking
into account average seasonal changes, we
start building 120,000 houses each year, that
is about 380 on every working day of the
year. The number of new houses started in
October 1954 alone reached 12,600, which represents an increase of 22 per cent over the
same month in 1953.
It might be interesting to glance over the
volume of loans made under the Housing
Acts in 1953 and 1954 in relation to the whole
housing program for each of those years.
In 1953, exclusive of conversions, construction of 102,000 houses was started throughout
Canada. The building of 40,000 houses was
approved for loan purposes under the
National Housing Act, that is somewhat less
than 40 per cent of the total number of
houses on which construction was started.
In 1954, the number of houses started
being about 110,000, exclusive of conversions, it is expected that about 52,000
housing units will be built under the
National Housing Act. According to this figure, it would seem that from 1953 to 1954
and even before then, the total increase in the
housing program has been carried out under
the National Housing Act. The number of

JANUARY 12, 1955
houses on which construction has started has
increased by 8,000, while the number of housing units with respect to which loans were
extended under the National Housing Act has
increased by 12,000.
Such figures testify to the real efficiency
of the 1944 act. From the very first year, the
results obtained were equal to the hopes it
had inspired.
May I be permitted, honourable senators,
as a citizen of the good old province of Quebec, to express regret at the costly indifference of the authorities of my province towards
the advantages offered all provinces under
the National Housing Act of 1944, and more
particularly under section 35 thereof. As you
know, the said section provides, and I quote:
35 (1) The Corporation may, pursuant to agreements made between the Government of Canada
and the government of any province, undertake
jointly with the government of the province or
any agency thereof projects for the acquisition and
development of land for housing purposes and for
the construction of houses for sale or for rent.
(2) An agreement referred to in subsection (1)
shall provide that the capital cost of the project
and the profits or losses thereon shall be shared
seventy-five per centum by the Corporation

(which means the federal Government)
and twenty-five per centum by the Governinent
of the province or an agency thereof.

Seven provinces, Ontario especially, have
derived great benefits from this Act and
have taken advantage of its provisions to
do away with slums. Toronto alone, as a
result of agreements concluded with the
federal Government, bas received for that
purpose from the Canadian Government an
amount of $1,362,000.
In that city, whole wards have been cleared
away of their filthy slums and good, sanitary
and bright homes have been built to bouse
human beings created "in the image and
likeness of God", who used to live in abject
conditions and who now live in conditions
where their physical and moral health is
not threatened any more. Unfortunately,
certain of our large cities in the province
of Quebec are faced with the problems arising from slums, which are perhaps the worst
social evil of our times. We express the wish
that all people of good will unite in an
effort to remove them.
Canada is a young, vigorous and rich
country. She is endowed with a healthy and
enterprising population. She is blessed with
natural resources of which we have found
but a small proportion. The pace of our
growth is such that for the first time in
history it bas exceeded that of the United
States. To give only one example of this,
our Prime Minister said recently that our
annual production of steel increased from

2 and a quarter million tons in 1946 to 4
million tons, and other Canadian industries
have expanded as rapidly.
Since 1946, our gross national product has
doubled, passing from 12 billion to 24 billion
dollars.
In northern Quebec and in Labrador, rich
deposits of iron ore are being developed.
Already a railroad has been built for that
purpose from Knob Lake to Seven Islands
on the St. Lawrence, which is a greater distance than that from Montreal to Toronto.
More than one million tons of rich ore have
already been transported to Seven Islands
and put on board ships or piled up near
The St. Lawrence Seaway
the shore.
will permit the 10 milion tons or so annually
produced at Knob Lake to be transported
quickly and cheaply as far as the plants
located around 'the Great Lakes.
The marked increase in orders of wheat
coming from foreign lands during these last
weeks is another encouraging sign.
In the field of international trade, everybody knows and admires the unceasing efforts
that our tireless and dynamic Minister of
Trade and Commerce makes to bring Western
nations and more particularly our great and
sympathetic neighbour to lift the obstacles
that hinder freer trade. Our trade being in
the hands of a man of such stature and
ability as Mr. Howe, we certainly can look
upon the future with a good deal of optimism. The speech which President Eisenhower delivered recently before the American Congress on the subject of tariffs constitutes for us a ray of hope. We are deeply
convinced that other friendly nations will
undoubtedly follow such a commendable
example in the best interests of all.
Many other questions, such as the coming
into force of the Disabled Persons Act which
was passed at the last session and from which
all provinces, ours "like the others", whatever
one may say about it, will beneflit through
agreements concluded with the federal Government; the amendment to the Blind Persons Act in order to lower the age of eligibility and raise the maximum permissible
incomes; many other beneficial measures that
were mentioned in the Speech from the
Throne deserve more than a passing reference, but we shall have other opportunities to
deal with them. Therefore, as I have already
abused your patience, I beg of you, honourable senators, to excuse me for omitting
them.

DIVORCE
REPORT OF COMMITTEE CONCURRED IN

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Divorce, presented
the first report of the committee.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant:
1. Your committee recommends that their quorum
be reduced to three members for al purposes,
including the taking of evidence upon oath by the
committee or any subcommittee as to the matters
set forth in petitions for bils of divorce.
2. Your committee also recommends that leave,
be given them to sit during all adjournments of
the Senate, and also during sittings of the Senate.
3. Your committee further recommends that
authority be granted for the appointment of as
many subcommittees as deemed necessary by the
committee for the purpose of hearing and inquiring
into such petitions for divorce as may be referred
to them by the Committee on Divorce. The subcommittee in each case to report their findings to
the main committee.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable sena-

tors, when shall this report be considered?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: With leave, I move
that the report be concurred in now.
Honourable senators, perhaps this is an
appropriate time to make some comments.
At its organization meeting this morning, the
Committee on Divorce did me the honour of
electing me as its chairman,Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: -for which I was duly
grateful and appreciative.
May I say to the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) that the members of the
Committee on Divorce will not be taking a
holiday on Monday and Tuesday next, but
will be sitting every day next week and also
the week following, and perhaps for a number of other weeks as well; yes-and sometimes perhaps on Saturdays. Already 334
petitions have been filed. There are open
files-by that I mean that notice has been
given by publication in the Canada Gazetteof 409 petitions. So I think that we are
assured of the largest docket that has ever
come before the Divorce Committee for consideration. Last session we heard 145 cases

23

before Christmas. This session we are starting later, with a larger number of cases to
deal with.
Honourable senators may have noted that
we ask for certain rights and privileges for
the committees. We recommend a quorum
of three senators to hear evidence on the
general committee or on any subcommittee.
I am sure that the house will be interested
to know that we now have an arrangement
for the sitting of four sub-committees-really
four divorce courts operating simultaneously
-every day next week, and for as many
weeks as may be necessary to dispose of the
docket. Some 72 cases are ready for hearing
this coming week, 13 on Monday, 17 on Tuesday, 15 on Wednesday, and so forth. These
cases will be heard by subcommittees who
will report the facts to the general committee, and in turn the general committee
will make its recommendation to the house.
At the close of last session I thanked the
members of the Divorce Committee for their
very good attendance during the session. I
think it remarkable that with a total membership of about twenty, and frequently with
four sub-committees sitting, there was not
a single occasion when we had to adjourn
for lack of a quorum. This indicated a strong
sense of responsibility and devotion to duty
by the entire membership of the Committee.
I look forward to the completion of a
rather strenuous job. It is not one that we
have asked for, but since it is our obligation
we hope to do it with the utmost devotion,
care and responsibility. Thank you.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
before making a few remarks I should like
to ask a question of the Chairman of the
Divorce Committee (Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
How many cases are set down for Monday
next?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There will be thirteen
cases heard on Monday.
Hon. Mr. Haig: By how many subcommittees?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Four subcommittees.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I do
not rise to criticize the Chairman of the
Divorce Committee or the work done by his
committee. On the contrary, I was too long
a member of that committee to have anything
but admiration for its chairman and its
work. I think all those who serve on the
committee make a sacrifice that is made by
none of the other members of this house.
However, I should like to make a point quite
apart from any possible criticism. We do

SENATE
something in our divorce proceedings that I
do not think is necessary. As this is not a
political question I am speaking for myself
and not for the Conservative party. I refer
to our practice of not setting a deadline for
the completion of petitions to be dealt with
m a session.
According to the terms of the British North
America Act, Parliament has jurisdiction
over the granting of divorce. Ever since
Confederation applications for divorce have
been presented to Parliament and we have
dealt with them. For myself, 1, in clear
conscience, could not object to doing my
share of the work. And I do not think that,
after my extensive ex'perience of some years
gained while serving on the Divorce Committee, I could do otherwise than recommend
divorce in certain cases, for it appears to me
that to do so is in the interest of the children,
the innocent parties in the proceedings, and
of the good conduct of our country.
I am not going to argue the question as to
whether Parliament should continue to deal
with divorce petitions or not. Many people
have religious scruples about divorce, but
I am not going to discuss that matter at all.
However, the majority of people in Canada
believe that divorce is necessary. Two provinces only are without divorce courts.
Now, there are some 310 petitions for
divorce ready for hearing by our committee.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: 334.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In my opinion a date such
as March 1, or April 1 should be set as a deadline, after which all applications not completed should stand over until the next
session. I do not think that we should allow
these applications to drag along into May
and June before being completed and made
ready for hearing. I may say that very frequently these late applications are the ones
out of which certain mernbers of the House
of Commons-very few I am glad to saytry to make a little political capital by criticizing the Senate on its handling of divorce
proceedings.
I have practised law in Winnipeg for over
fifty years and well do I know the attitude
of the courts in Manitoba on divorce matters.
We did not have divorce courts in that province prior to 1890. We really had the right
to grant divorce in 1870, but it was not until
about 1890 that we suddenly found that out.
Because of my long practice of law in Manitoba, I am in a position to say that even the
judges of the divorce courts there sometimes
make a little slip.

It is my opinion that our Divorce Committee in the Senate, under the chairmanship of my honourable friend from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), is as able a
body for the trial of divorce cases as is any
court in Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The custom is, whenever
possible, to have at least one lawyer on
every subcommittee, as chairman, sitting
with two or more laymen. The lawyer
chairman can direct the subcommittee on
questions of law on what evidence is legally
admissible, for instance-and the laymen can
say what they think of the facts in the case.
A layman's judgment of the facts is just
as good as a lawyer's. That is the kind of
court we have in the Senate, and it works
well. Now, out of the 385 applications for
divorce heard last year there were two or three
cases in which our committees were a little
lax. In Manitoba, if the judgment of a trial
judge is appealed, the appeal is heard by a
court consisting of five judges. Its attitude
to the facts is that as the judge who tried the
case, saw and heard the witnesses, his view
of the evidence should be upheld, unless, of
course, his findings are abhorrent to honesty
and good sense-that is, for instance, if be
held that twenty-five people who said one
car hit another were wrong, and one man
who said it did not, was right. The same
principle holds good with regard to our own
tribunal. There are not less than three senators on each committee which takes evidence,
and they decide on the facts whether one side
or the other is to be believed. Their findings, with the record, go to the House of
Commons. From time to time some honourable members of that house declare that
they do not agree with the judgment of one
or other of our committees. Well, why in the
world should a selfish House of Commons
assume to initiate practically all legislation?
The gentleman who occupies the first position in this chamber (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
and the present Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) have tried hard to
have more legislation initiated in the Senate.
but one excuse after another is raised to
deny that right to this house. If this principle
is to be followed through, why should not
the Commons try divorce applications themselves, and send the bills here for final
consideration?
Having voiced my objections, I want to
offer a remedy. I do not think we should
stop trying divorce applications, because I
realize the necessities of a country like ours.
If any of my boys or girls, their wives or
husbands,
were
guilty of misconduct,

JANUARY 13, 1955
it would be in the interests of my grandchildren, I believe, that the parents should be
separated. I love my children very much, but
I am sure that my grandchildren would fare
better in a household which was not divided
by the behavior of their parents. As a lawyer
I find as I grow older that the number of
women who consult me on these domestic
matters is increasing, because most women
prefer to talk with elderly lawyers. One
thing that troubles them is the cost of proceedings. As a rule the husband is the wage
earner, and it is difficult not to feel sympathy with a woman who finds it almost
impossible to finance her suit. On many occasions I have had to advise a divorce, because
the effects upon the children were such that
I could not conscientiously advise the wife
to carry on. So, while I do not favour
divorce, I admit its necessity; there seems
to be no alternative. But I will not argue the
question.
On a matter of procedure, I suggest that
this house should lay down a rule that cases
which are not ready for hearing by the lst
of March, or at least by the lst of April,
should be held over until the following
session. If this were done our members
would have a reasonable chance to deal with
other matters, and we should hear less
criticism to the effect that this house is a
glorified divorce court. I do not like that. I
do not appreciate anyone saying to me, "Well,
I suppose you are going down to Ottawa now
to help get the Senate divorce mill running".
It was certainly never the intention of the
Fathers of Confederation that the Senate
should find itself open to such .criticism. It
was intended that men and women experienced in public life should help to formulate
better legislation for Canada by serving in
the Senate.
I do not know what I would do without
the services of the honourable and distinguished senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine). When I go wrong he puts me
right. You ought to hear him lecture me
sometimes. In any event, I believe my honourable friend served on the Divorce Committee for some fifteen years.

such a thing to any honourable senator who
has served on the Divorce Committee for -a
long period of time.
In conclusion I would again urge that the
Chairman of the Divorce Committee take
steps to see that no divorce cases are heard
in the Senate this session after April 1.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
may I have the indulgenceThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
I would draw your attention to the fact that
if the honourable gentleman from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) speaks now he
will close the debate.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I have just a few comments to make in reply to the very kind
remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig). I wish to thank him for
his sympathetic attitude towards the Divorce
Committee and particularly towards its
chairman. I would like to associate myself
with his remarks about the honourable
senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine),
who gave many long years of patient and
excellent service both as a member and
Chairman of the Divorce Colnmittee. However, there was one remark which I believe
was inadvertently made by the honourable
Leader of the Opposition. In speaking about
the criticism made in the House of Commons
he intimated that on one or two occasions a
Senate divorce committee had been a little
lax. He used the words "a little lax". Now
there was no occasion last session-and I
speak from personal knowledge-when any
divorce committee was lax to any degree
whatsoever.
Hon. Hr. Howard: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Haig: I should like to thank the
honourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinity
for correcting me. I used those words intentionally because I thought that was the
case.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That was not the case.
There was no laxity at any time, and there
was no case in connection with which any
chairman or committee member should apologize. The case that was most criticized last
year was one which we had heard with care
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Twenty-one years.
and devotion for no less than seven hours.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is worse than I At the end of that time we adjourned to think
thought. Finally, one day I said to him, the matter over for the evening, and on re"Well, Walter, you can continue to serve suming next morning we were unanimous in
on the Divorce Committee if you want, but our decision. That decision was criticized in
I can tell you that you are not helping either the House of Commons, and a number of outthe Conservative party or myself by working rageous mis-statements were made with reon that committee all day." I added, "You gard to the facts. We were also criticized
owe it to the people of Saskatchewan, because the evidence had not been sent to
particularly Rosetown, to devote more of the House of Commons, and as a result a
your time to other legislation." I would say committee of that house approved of our

SENATE
decision without reading the evidence or
knowing anything about the case. That was
all right. It showed confidence in our committee which was justified. I do not say the
evidence should be read, but when criticism
is directed against us for not supplying the
evidence it is going a little too far.
The rest of the criticism was equally unwarranted. This house has no apology to
make to anyone for the course of events during last session. We anticipate criticism again
this session. No one can take part in public
affairs and hold himself above criticism.
Sometimes a little check-up does good, and
everyone is subject to being jacked up on
occasions. No one complains about that
at ail, but I do appeal to the press of this
dominion to deal fairly with us and to see
that they verify their facts before publishing
them. That is something they failed to do on
many occasions last year. I appeal to them
to be square with us. We are conducting a
judicial institution with judicial calm and
taking all the time that is necessary. We are
not hurrying a single case. We are giving
these cases the very best thought of which we
are capable, and we are rendering our decisions according to the dictates of our
conscience. In these circumstances, I think
we should be justly treated.
This session we have no fewer than sixtyseven contested cases, which represent a large
docket. We have many other cases that are
not contested. The honourable Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) suggests that
we should lay down some deadline for the
completion of cases. Our Rules provide that
no petition may be filed later than five weeks
from today; that is to say, by February 17
the right to file petitions expires. Last session
we insisted that all cases be completed within
one month after the final date for filing petitions, and I have no doubt that the committee
will follow this procedure again. It is certain
that no cases will be filed after February 17,
and probably no cases will be heard that are
not completed by the end of March.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I interrupt the
honourable senator to ask a question? Has it
been customary in the past to extend the date
for filing petitions?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It has been done.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: las it been done over
the years?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Very frequently over
the years, yes, but by no means has there
been established any precedent for doing it
again.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Has it been done as
a result of a motion brought in this house?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: On recommendation, of
course, of the committee. Usually special
circumstances have been pleaded which have
justified this action. There were several
reasons which justified our action in that
regard last year. There is no assurance that

we shall do it again this year unless there
are good reasons for doing so.
Until last year divorce applicants were
allowed an unlimited time to complete their
cases in connection with the necessary publication, services, and filings under the rules.
However, last year we set a deadline, and
those cases not completed by the appointed
time went over to the next session. We shall
certainly follow that procedure again this
year, and this should take care of what the
Leader of the Opposition has suggested.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Thank you.
The motion was agreed to, on division.
PETITIONS WITHDRAWN
Hon. Mr. Roebuck presented and moved
concurrence in the second report of the
Standing Committee on Divorce, recommend-

ing that an application for leave to withdraw
a petition be granted and that the parliamentary fees paid. under Rule 140 be refunded to
the petitioner, less the sum of $25 to apply
on costs, including printing and translation
costs.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
before the motion is put, may I inform the
members of the house who are not members
of the committee that it has been the custom
over the years, when divorce petitions have
been filed but later withdrawn, to refund
the parliamentary fees, less $10, for printing
and translation costs. However, the small
sum of $10 is scarcely enough to pay these
costs, and ýthis year the committee thought it
fair, and decided this morning, that the
amount to be retained should be $25, which
is a very moderate sum indeed.
The motion was agreed to, on division.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck severally presented and
moved concurrence in the third, fourth and
fifth reports of the Standing Committee on
Divorce, recommending that applications for
leave to withdraw certain petitions be
granted and that the parliamentary fees paid

JANUARY 13, 1955
under Rule 140 be refunded to the petitioners,
less the sum of $25 to apply on costs in each
case, including printing and translation costs.
The reports were severally read by the
Clerk Assistant.
The motions were agreed to, on division.

PRIVATE BILL
HURON AND ERIE MORTGAGE CORPORATION
BILL-FIRST READING
Hon. W. D. Euler presented Bill G,, an Act

respecting The Huron and Erie Mortgage
Corporation.
The bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second
time.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Thursday next.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
at the present time the House of Commons
is discussing a bill to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act. The purpose of the
bill is to increase the supplementary benefits and to extend the class eligible for them.
It is felt desirable that the bill should become
effective on Monday, and to make this possible it would, of course, have to receive
Royal Assent before then. The Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) was good
enough to say that he would defer his dis-

cussion on the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne, so that this house would
be free to deal promptly with the bill, if it
comes from the House of Commons today.
I propose, therefore, that the house rise
now, to reconvene at the call of the bell.
If the bill comes to us from the House of
Commons it can be taken into consideration immediately, and, if deemed advisable,
receive third reading, and be given the Royal
Assent today. I am assured that there will
be an opportunity later in the session to
discuss the bill thoroughly.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
After some time the sitting was resumed.
UNEMPLOYMENT

INSURANCE

BILL

FIRST READING
A message was received from the House of

Commons with Bill 6, an Act to amend the
Unemployment Insurance Act.
The bill was read the first time.

SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: With leave of the
house, I move the second reading now.
Honourable senators, the debate on the
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne in the House of Commons was interrupted this afternoon in order that consideration might be given to this bill, which by
reason of some urgency received second and
third readings there in the one sitting. The
bill provides that unemployment insurance
payments shall commence on a Monday.
Therefore, if this house deems it advisable to
pass the bill today, a considerable number
of working people will receive the increased
benefits for which it provides as from last
Monday, and others will receive the full
benefits under the bill from that day; whereas,
if the bill does not pass until next week, the
benefits will not commence until next
Monday. It is for that reason that I suggest
that the bill be considered now.
Some honourable senators may feel that we
are unduly rushing things. I would point
out, however, that the House of Commons
was assured by the Minister of Labour that
another measure embracing this bill would
be introduced later in the session, and that a
full opportunity would be given at that time
to all honourable members and senators to
discuss not only the features of this bill but
all phases of the general question of unemployment.
Honourable senators will recall that under
the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act the employee and employer each
pay, shall I say, two units of the amount
contributed, and the Government pays one
unit. That is to say, if the employer and
the employee each pay $1.00, making a total
of $2.00, the Government pays 40 cents,
together with the cost of the administration
of the act.
In order to be eligible for benefits under
the present act a man must have been
employed for a period of thirty weeks or 180
days. If an eligible person happens to have
used up all his benefits during the period
between January 1 and April 15, he may
receive what is known as supplementary
benefit. The act also provides that when a
man has made contributions for 90 days,
instead of 180 days, he is entitled to supplementary benefit for the period between
January 1 and April 15, to the extent of 16
days.
As honourable senators know, in Canada
there is considerable seasonal unemployment,

SENATE
most of which occurs in the winter months.
In order to ease the burden of those persons
who are out of work at that time supplementary benefit is paid.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Do I understand that
supplementary benefit is paid at the same
rate as the regular benefit?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: At the present time
the supplementary rates are less than the
regular rates.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does this bill bring them
up to the regular rates?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes. Honourable senators will notice by the table in the explanatory notes to the bill that a person without a
dependent receives supplementary benefit of
$12.90 per week, and a person with a dependent receives $16.80. The table which appears
in subsection 2 of section 1 of the bill indicates that under this measure a person without a dependent will receive a weekly supplementary benefit of $17.10; and a person
with a dependent, $24. It is apparent that
the bill would bring the supplementary payments to about the same amount as the regular payments.
The bill would also provide that a person
who has not qualified for regular payments,
and who under the present act would receive
a minimum of 16 days' benefit, will now
receive 60 days' benefit.
I think, honourable senators, that concisely
expla'ns the purpose of this bill. You will
all agree, I am sure, that in the interests of
those who are unemployed and who need the
increased benefits which the bill would provide, it should be considered and passed by
us today. As I have suggested, we can reserve
our right to criticize the measure and to seek
further information on the general unemployment question when the other bill comes
before the house.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable leader when the present rates came into
effect?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The present supplementary rates have been in effect since 1950,
but I would remind the honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity, who I know has shown
great interest in this subject, that the regular rates were increased in 1952.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Has the honourable
leader any information as to the approximate
amount of money expended for supplementary benefits, and what will be expended at
the proposed increased rate?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I have in my hand a table which shows the

supplementary benefit, Classes 1 and 2, for
the period January 1, 1950, to November 30,
1954, inclusive. It covers the payment of benefits, the number of persons qualified and the
days paid. If my honourable friend from
Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchil) or any
other honourable senators would like to have
this information, with leave of the house I
would be pleased to place the table on

Hon. Mr. Haig: As I understand it, the
present act provides for 16 days' supplementary benefit, and the bill now before us will
increase that to 60 days?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Sixteen days was the
minimum for those who had not qualified for
regular payments.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I understand.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The bill would also
increase the amount of the supplementary
payments.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The rates would be increased for the two categories from, in round
figures, $12 to $17, and $16 to $24?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I
have no objection whatever to the bill; in
fact, I do not know how some people live on
the amounts they receive by way of unemployment insurance benefits. I do, however,
have one observation which I should like to
make at this time, and the opportunity will
be open for me when the other bill comes
before the house to discuss the matter in
greater detail.
According to my understanding of the act,
its original purpose was to provide unemployment relief benefits as required, and also to
create a surplus fund to take care of periods
of widespread unemployment if they should
occur. For instance, in my own office we
pay our contribution towards unemployment
insurance every two weeks, as do the employees in the office, and it has always been
my understanding, and I think that of the
public generally, that by such contributions
we were accumulating a fund to meet a
major emergency. Now, the same thing was
done in Great Britain, yet, when the great

JANUARY 13, 1955
depression came, even with all the savings
that had accumulated in the fund were not
enough to meet the payments, and Parliament had to vote supplementary supply. I
am just a little bit disappointed that the
supplementary payrnents provided for by this
bill have to be taken out of general reserves.
I think supplementary estimates should have
been voted by Parliament, because this
measure is really for the purpose of taking
care of unemployment that is not normal.
For instance, supposing a bank clerk is let
out of his employment, there is not a chance
of his being taken on by any other bank.
The same remarks apply to many stenographers. An employer does not want to
take into his office a stenographer who has
been discharged. Now, all those people pay
for unemployment insurance, and surely,
payment of benefits to thern should come out
of a special fund. That is to say, various
classes should have been created, as was
done under the Workmen's Compensation
Act.
However, this is not the time to discuss
that point further. I am quite willing that
the bill should pass at once, for I really do
not understand how people can live and keep
a home together on amounts paid out under
the present act.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There are no supplementary estimates to provide for this bill?
This money, as I understand it, comes out of
the fund, does it not?

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: On account of the
urgency, I move, with leave, that this bill be
read the third time now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
the bill having passed both houses of Parliament, it is ready to receive the Royal Assent
this evening. This, I am sure, can be arranged. I therefore move that the house rise
now, to resume at the call of the bell, at
approximately 9.45.
The motion was agreed to and Senate
adjourned during pleasure.
At 9.45 p.m. the sitting was resumed.

Macdonald:

Honourable

senators, this is a very important day in the
history of our country. Eighty-two years ago
today there was born in New Brunswick a

child who was destined to become a medical
practitioner, with a large practice, in British
Columbia.

Subsequently he was elected to

the Legislature of British Columbia, where
later he became Minister of Public Works.
In 1922 he resigned f rom the provincial Legislature and Cabinet and became a member of

the Dominion Government. He was summoned to the Senate in 1930, and in 1942 he
was appointed Leader of the Government in

I have been a member of the Senate for
some twenty-five years, and I regard my
association with this chamber, on behalf of
my province of British Columbia, as one of
the wonderful experiences of my life.
We grow up and we get old, and as we get
old we realize that we cannot enjoy things
as we used to in our younger days. However,
we have many happy memories.
I do thank you, honourable senators.

Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
cannot let the Leader of the Government get
ahead of the Leader of the Opposition. The
honourable senator from Kootenay East (Hon.
Mr. King) comes from western Canada, and is
one of our heroes in that part of the country.

In fact, I recall many years ago hearing my
mother, who was an admirer of Ralph Connor,
speak in glowing ternis of the great doctor

who was the leading character in one of his
books. Little did I think at that time that
I would have the honour of sitting in the
Senate of Canada with that great doctor, the
senator from Kootenay East.
I extend to the honourable senator my best
wishes that he may be spared to be with us
for many more years.
Hon. James H. King: Honourable senators,

although the felicitations extended to me are
a bit embarrassing, I do appreciate the kind

remarks of the honourable leaders on both
sides of the house.

Some Hon. Senators: Agreed.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
January 12, consideration of His Excellency
the Governor General's speech at the opening
of the session and the motion of Hon. Mrs.
Hodges, seconded by Hon. Mr. Tremblay, for
an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
first allow me to congratulate the mover and
seconder of the Address in reply to the
gracious Speech from the Throne. Of course
I followed the speech of the mover, the
honourable senator from Victoria (Hon. Mrs.
Hodges), better than I followed that of the
seconder, the honourable senator from Lauzon (Hon. Mr. Tremblay); but I read his

JANUARY 18, 1955

speech the next day and came to one conclusion-that he is at least a friend of the
Prime Minister of Canada.
If the honourable senator from Victoria
had changed one word in her speech she
could have covered the whole subject of
Canadian affairs as she covered those of
British Columbia. Those who were here
admired the able address she delivered about
the province in which she lives. In summary,
what she said amounts to this, that a great
deal of money has been spent in the development of the natural resources of British
Columbia, that employees there are paid very
high wages, and that there is now a great
deal of unemployment because the goods
they produce cannot be sold to the outside
world. The honourable lady, who is a new
member in this house, certainly outlined the
situation in British Columbia correctly, as
I understand it from what I have read.
I am not going to attempt to make a long
dissertation on the Speech from the Throne.
I should not try to do so even if I could.
I do not want to hurt anybody's feelings, but
I am bound to say that I was disappointed in
the Speech from the Throne. I thought it
was a poor summary of what has already
taken place and a very scanty report of what
is to come. Had the Speech merely stated
that Parliament would be asked to amend
the Statutes of Canada it would have covered
everything. The Speech disclosed that the
Government would propose -the amendment
of certain legislation. Whether it will actually
do so I do not know, but the matters referred
to are not vital to the business of the country
anyway.
Honourable senators, I want to say how
delighted the Canadian people were on the
occasion of the Queen Mother's gracious visit
to Canada last November. As members of
the Senate, we were all invited to Ottawa to
attend the luncheon given jointly by the
Speaker of the Senate and the Speaker of the
House of Commons in her honour. I know
that all those who attended were delighted
by the function and had the highest praise
for the way in which it was organized.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The Speakers of the Senate
and of the House of Commons need not take
second place to anyone in acting as hosts at a
formal luncheon of that kind. I have not been
all over the world by any means, but I have
travelled a little and read a great deal, and
I cannot imagine a more perfect luncheon
than the one we enjoyed on that occasion.
The Speaker of the Senate, assisted by the
Leader of the Government in this house (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald), did credit to this chamber.
I am sure that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth,

upon returning home to Britain, carried with
her the kindest thoughts of the Canadian
people.
As far as I was concerned, there was only
one fly in the ointment. I really did not
intend to come down to Ottawa, but the
people of the city of Winnipeg seem to think
that I am a public servant, and the minute
some of them heard that I was not planning
to be present at the luncheon they said to
me: "Jack, you had better get on the train
and get down to Ottawa right away. You
can't tell what the Liberals, Social Crediters
or CCFers will do." I replied that I could
trust the Speaker of the Senate and the
Leader of the Government in this house to do
a good job, but they insisted that I should
be present. They even said, "If you won't
go on your own we will take up a collection
and send you." Four days before leaving for
Ottawa I received a communication, I believe
it was a telegram, advising me what kind
of clothes I was expected to wear at the
formal luncheon. For one thing I was to
wear a secretarial coat. Well, it seemed that
no one in Winnipeg knew what a secretarial
coat was, but finally I located an old tailor
who knew and he made me one. Then I came
on to Ottawa, only to find that most of my
fellow senators did not have this coat. However, the good ladies of our Speaker and
Government Leader quickly recognized that
I was wearing the prescribed dress, and this
made me feel rather proud of myself. The
Queen Mother appeared to us to be a wonderful woman who had reached her zenith in
life, and at the luncheon and other functions
in Ottawa she gave a demonstration of
womanhood that I am sure could not be surpassed anywhere. Like their fellow Canadians, the senators and their wives were
pleased and honoured that such a gracious
lady had cone to this country to give us the
feeling that we are an important part of the
Commonwealth, and that she recognizes us
as a nation which can be depended upon to
stand four-square for freedom in the troubled
world of today.
Honourable senators, I now want to refer to
other matters of a different character
altogether. First of all, I should like to deal
with the labour question. There have been
many complaints lately that labour forces
are demanding too high wages for the amount
of work they do. Now, I am neither prolabour nor anti-labour. Like many other
Canadians I started out in a small way,
working up through different stages in life
until I was in a position where I took on a
certain measure of responsibility. As a result
I know some of the problems that face men

SENATE
and women in the ranks of labour, and I
know that our taxation system imposes such
a burden on labour that production costs are
higher than they should be.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is no doubt about
that at all. As a practising lawyer in the city
of Winnipeg I have observed the taxation
rates increase so much since 1940 that many
wage earners are no longer able to live on
their pay, even though their incomes have
been increased. Certain factors are involved
in the manufacture of any article. There is
the cost of labour and the cost of the raw
material. Of course, in many cases the raw
material has been processed before being
shipped to the manufacturing plant. Then a
tax is imposed on the income from the sale
of the manufactured product. I think last
year the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting
Company made a profit of approximately
$900 million.

down in Canada by just saying we are going
to do so. We have to eut down expenditures
first, and then cut down taxes. We cannot do
it by the reverse way.
Everybody is faced with two tax loads.
First of all there is the personal income tax.
Then there is the corporation tax, which is
supposed to be imposed on corporations. But
who owns the corporations?
They are
individuals. A few years ago the Bell Telephone Company endeavoured to get an increase in rates. The Board of Transport
Commissioners proposed a certain rate, but
the company demanded twice as much. Upon
being asked why, it replied that the Government took half its profits anyway. Well,
that is the situation. All those costs increase
the price of goods to the consumer and, as I
said before, this is one reason we are having
difficulty in selling on the world market.
Hon. Mr. Horner: There is also the matter
of the sales tax.

JANUARY 18, 1955
how many are unemployed? I think it ought
to be able to give us an authoritative figure.
I do not want to enter into the discussion
on taxation between the Prime Minister of
Canada and the Premier of Quebec, but one
thing I have noticed about it is very interesting, and that is the large nurnber of people
who will be relieved from paying taxes at all
if the exemptions are increased to $3,000 for
married wage earners and $1,500 for single
people. That is where the big tax load is.
I am persuaded that that illustrates the problem I am raising today. I do not say that the
rich man should not be taxed, but I do say
that taxes have got to be cut down so that the
labouring man earning a moderate wage can
live. Only three months ago a labourer came
to my office, and told me that he was earning
about $2,200-I think that was the amountand his wife, who had been a nurse, was
also working. They had two children. His
wife, who earned about $1,500, took the
exemption of one child, and be took the
exemption of the other. Although I forget
the figure, I was shocked to learn what they
had to pay in taxes. The man told me that
after he and his wife had paid their taxes, and
regular living expenses had been met, they
had nothing left. At the very first attack of
unemployment, such people are on the street.
I have a very keen feeling for them. I do
not pretend to preach on behalf of labour, but
I think we as educated men and women, holding positions of importance, and who control
one division of Parliament, should raise our
voices to see that fair play is given to that
class of people in our communities.
Turning now to another class, our farmers
of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta-I
do not know so much about those of British
Columbia-are demanding parity of prices.
Just today, the farmers of Ontario officiallyI am not speaking of the men on the line
fence-demanded of the Ontario government
that agricultural products be put on a parity
price basis. Canada sells about 30 per cent
of its agricultural products on the world
market, and that controls the cost of the
other 70 per cent. Remember that in dealing
with the farmer, when it comes to getting
votes, you are dealing with a different type
of man from the labourer. Mr. Farmer knows
where he is going, and if he is convinced that
he is not getting a fair deal in the economy
of Canada he is going to vote for a change in
government. That is why the politician, or
the statesman, whichever you care to call
him, has to consider the interest of the
farmer. The Premier of Quebec has given
an exemption of 30 per cent on incomes of
$3,000. Why? Because he believes that will
exempt the farmers of that province from
taxation. He may be wrong, but he believes
50437-3

it. That is why he is putting that exemption
into effect. I have no doubt of that at all.
In the next election we shall have to face
the fact that the farmers of Manitoba., Saskatchewan and Alberta-I do not know about
British Columbia-and no doubt of Ontario
and Quebec, are going to demand that they
be given a fair deal in the economy of
Canada and receive a very fair share of its
earnings. These are matters that we as
senators must recognize in time and try
to solve.
To change the subject somewhat, I want
to make a suggestion to the Government,
through the Leader of the Government in the
Senate. For many years I have felt that
we are not getting the best possible service
from the United Nations. By that I mean
that we'do not send any opposition down to
the meetings. We are sending observers, but
they are not members on the committee. I
have been there, and I know. At the time
I was there, Canada had delegates, or alternates, who sat in on all the proceedings. Let
me tell you a story. We used to meet at
9 o'clock every morning. On one occasion
the then Minister of External Affairs, now the
Prime Minister of Canada, had to prepare a
speech for delivery before the Committee
on External Affairs. When he delivered the
speech I happened to be sitting next to him
at the table, and he said to me, "What do you
think of that speech, Haig?" I said; "Not
much, Mr. St. Laurent. I am sure it does not
express the best Canadian opinion." Mr. Coldwell spoke up and said, "I agree with Haig".
You were there, Mr. Speaker. Sitting across
the table was Paul Martin, and he said he
agreed with Haig, and John Bracken agreed
with Haig, and then Mr. St. Laurent said,
"I agree with Haig." Well, he took off for
two or three days, and then wrote a real
speech, and the funny part of it was this:
Mr. Bracken was his deputy on the committee, and on the day that speech was to be
delivered Mr. St. Laurent was sick with
the 'flu and could not be there, so it was
delivered by Mr. Bracken. The press of the
United States said that the Leader of the
Conservatice party had made a great speech
before the United Nations. I think very
highly of that representation on the United
Nations.
I suggest that in addition to her Government
representation at the United Nations meetings Canada should have two men or women
from the major parties and one from each
of the smaller parties. These representatives
would, I believe, return from their participation in the work of that body feeling as I
did, that while it has its faults and may be far

SENATE
from perfect it is the most promising organization on the horizon today for the promotion of world peace.
As a delegate to that body, I had freedom
to express my own opinions, but by agreement those of us who were not members of
the Government did not attend meetings at
which money questions were being discussed
and voted on.
I should like to make a brief reference to
the. matter of credit buying, and to remind
honourable senators of the steps taken some
five years ago by the Honourable Douglas
Abbott, then Minister of Finance, to restrict
Statistics published
credit arrangements.
recently indicate that as of the end of
September this year there was some $1,885
million worth of credit outstanding in this
country. Buying was tremendousl
heavy
during the Christmas season in my home city
of Winnipeg, and I presume it was so in
other cities, but the greater part of it was
on a time-payment plan. This seems to me
to create a false economy, and what the
result may be if we run into more difficult
times, I do not know. I believe the time
has come when some restrictions should be
imposed to prevent such heavy credit buying.
In a notice of motion tonight the Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)
referred to the ratification of the agreement
made between Germany and the NATO
countries having to do with the European
situation. As I see it, the world is no more
secure today than it was a year ago, and we
cannot afford to relax our efforts to maintain
peace. The recent incident in the French
Assembly illustrates the delicacy of the
problem in that part of the world. We in
Canada should therefore be very clear in our
course of action when we face the question of
ratification of the agreement.
I may be anticipating what some honourable senators may say on this subject, but
I believe no nation in the world today, not
even the United States or Great Britain, has
a greater responsibility than has Canada in
deciding what treatment shall be accorded
Germany with respect to ber place among
other nations. In the eyes of other countries
Canada is a nation without ambition for
world power. In saying that I am not
criticizing the United States or Great Britain,
for I am well aware of the magnificent fight
those two nations have put up over the past
ten years to meet the threat of domination by
Russia. Without them, I dare not guess what
might have happened. But now Canada has
her own part to play along with the other
nations in deciding whether Germany should
be rearmed.

Those of us who were in this chamber on
September 9, 1939, will recall vividly how
member after member stood up and voted
on the question of whether we should go to
war with Germany. Although we knew that
a decision to go to war meant that the sons
or other relatives of many of us would go
overseas and that some might not come back,
there was not a dissenting vote.
That decision having been made, we later
turned to the question of whether we should
ally ourselves with Russia in her fight against
Germany. We knew we were a small factor
in the battle between those two giant nations, but there was not one of us who did
not feel, rightly or wrongly, that we should
maintain a united front against the German
military machine. And in the end the United
States and Great Britain with Canada's help
were able to defeat the strong German forces.
We now face a new problem, and in that
too Canada must take her stand. I am again
reminded of an experience during my visit to
the United Nations. A delegate from Iran
approached me and asked if I was a Canadian, and when I told him I was he invited
me to come out after lunch and have a talk
with him. His first question to me was, "Are
you afraid of the United States?" I replied
that we were not, and added that while we
did not always see eye to eye with that
country on every detail, as neighbours we
were truthful with each other, trusted each
other to keep its word, and got along together
well. It is for that reason, I said, that we
hold up our hands in favour of United States'
policies which we feel we can support through
the United Nations.
Those of our citizens who lost relatives and
friends during the last war feel very bitter
about the proposed rearmament of Germany,
and I can quite understand why they would
have that feeling.
I am reminded of a
remark my son made to me after he returned
from service as a pilot in that war. I asked
him, "Doug, when you were taking off from
the runway in your plane carrying six tons
of bombs to drop on Germany, what were you
thinking about?" His answer, I think, was
significant. He said, "I thanked God that
my mother and dad were safe, because I
knew that I might well kill a good many
mothers and dads with the bombs I was
to drop."
I feel very strongly that if we do not have
Germany on our side we will see ber absorbed
into the Russian family. It is a bitter choice
we have to make, but I believe the majority
of the thinking people in this country are
in favour of our backing up the treaty to

JANUARY 18, 1955
allow Germany to rearm. In doing so we
will not only be doing right by ourselves but
we will be giving leadership to the smaller
nations. Because they will take their leadership from us, I think we should be clear and
unanimous in our support of the treaty.
In conclusion may I say, Mr. Speaker, that
I have enjoyed the period during which you
have presided over the sittings of this house.
I have also enjoyed my relationship with the
honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.

necessitate numerous public services and
many improvements in several important
fields of provincial administration, especially
in the vital fields of education and hospitalization.
Such tremendous progress and the brilliant
prospects before the province require a more
complete utilization of the sources of provincial revenue. It is unnecessary to emphasize that the progress and prosperity of the
Province of Quebec make a truly worthy
contribution to the progress and prosperity
of the country in general.
Therefore, the Quebec Legislature decided
to levy, within the province, a provincial tax
Unquestionably, as
on personal income.
agreed by all, it is a tax that the Canadian
constitution authorizes Quebec to impose.
Actually, this tax represents only approximately 10 per cent of the federal tax on personal income collected in the Province of
Quebec, because, even though our provincial
tax is apparently calculated to be 15 per cent
of the federal tax, the exemptions provided
by the provincial law materially reduce this
proportion.
In short, the provincial tax represents
approximately 10 per cent of the federal
income tax collected from the taxpayers in
the Province of Quebec and, by deducting the
provincial tax from the federal tax, Ottawa
will in fact receive about 90 per cent of the
tax on personal income collected in the
Province of Quebec.
The federal authorities assert that the province and the federal government have concurrent rights of taxing personal income. About
10 per cent to the province and about 90 per
cent to Ottawa, is an extraordinarily reasonable concurrence, you will no doubt agree.
Furthermore, it should be recalled that our
provincial income tax is used entirely for
purposes of education and hospitalization,
public health and social legislation among
others, in and for the province.
Since the end of the last war-I merely
mention facts without details or appraisalsome provinces have abandoned to the central authority certain important sources of
provincial income in return for payment by
Ottawa of federal subsidies to these provinces.
We have said on several occasions that the
Province of Quebec wishes to retain its
powers of taxation and does not wish to
exchange them for subsidies. We consider it
our duty to maintain such an attitude.
We are ready to enter into a really temporary agreement which would grant to the
parties concerned a further extension of time
to arrive at a definite arrangement. The
federal authorities are of the opinion-and
we respect their opinion without sharing itthat they have the right to impose taxes in

one province to assist certain provincial projects in another province. The Province of
Quebec has always been and is still ready
to co-operate reasonably and in a constitutional manner for the welfare and prosperity
of the other provinces of the Canadian
confederation.
It is beyond question that the revenue
derived from taxes levied by Quebec, including the provincial tax on personal income, and
which would be affected by the arrangements
arrived at between Ottawa and the other
provinces, it is beyond question, I say, that
such revenue of the Province of Quebec represents much smaller sums than the amount
offered by Ottawa to the Province of Quebec
in its proposal to exchange important sources
of provincial revenue for federal subsidies. In short, the other provinces and the federal
authorities, in our humble opinion, -cannot
reasonably object to the proposal we are making; first, because the amount collected by the
province is financially less than the grant
offered by the federal government and,
secondly, because, as everyone agrees, the
province is only exercising an indisputable
right. It seems to us only elementary justice
that the federal authorities should deduct
from their tax on personal income paid to
Ottawa by the taxpaSyers of Quebec, the
amount of the provincial income tax which
only after all represents a small fraction of
the federal tax.
It is our profound conviction that the taxing
powers which belong to the Province of Quebec must be exercised by the province. These
powers, which spring from dearly acquired
rights and freedom, are indispensable to responsible government; they are also essential
if the province is, freely and in accordance
with its religious and national traditions, to
exercise its rights and fulfil its obligations,
amongst others, those pertaining to the vital
fields of education and hospitalization.
In order to reach an agreement concerning
the deduction of our provincial tax, we are
ready to delete from our Act authorizing a
provincial tax on personal income the statements, in the preamble to the effect that the
province has a prior right in the matter of
direct taxation.
Further, we shall give effect, by Order in
Council, to the decision we have taken, a
couple of months ago, with a view to making
the tax payable to Quebec on undistributed
income and dividends consistent with the
Federal Act. In other words, by virtue of
such amendment, the province will only get.
15 per cent of the rates authorized by the
Federal Act in such cases.
Our provincial tax Act on personal income
is for a period of three years, that is to say,

SENATE

for each of the calendar years 1954, 1955 and
1956; we suggest that an agreement to be
arrived at between Ottawa and Quebec should
be for the same period.
The Quebec Government wishes earnestly
to reach an amicable settlement of this problem, and we express the hope that the abovementioned provincial proposals will be
favourably received by the federal authorities.
As I wrote you on October llth, "if you
decide to call a Canadian intergovernmental
conference at Ottawa, we will be happy to
attend and we will not hesitate to defer our
parliamentary work should this conference
take place during the session of our

Dear Mr. Duplessis:
Pursuant to our telephone conversation of
Wednesday November 3rd concerning your
letter received the day before, I wish to
inform you that I am having statistics compiled by our officials of the Department of
Finance, with a view to determining what
would result, as regards deductions, from the
fact that, to establish the taxable income
under the Federal Act and your own Act,
the amount of such taxable income would be,
for all single taxpayers, $500.00 less under
the Quebec Act than the Federal Act and,
for all married taxpayers, $1,000.00 less.
Possibly, your officers have already prepared compilations to that effect, and if such
were the case, it might be a good thing if we
were to agree to their contacting ours, so as
to prevent the possibility of misunderstanding
which would affect the governing rules
to be applied in order to eliminate double
taxation.

Office of the Prime Minister
Canada
Ottawa, January 14, 1955
The Honourable Maurice L. Duplessis, Q.C.,
Premier of the Province of Quebec,
Parliament Buildings,
Quebec, Que.
My dear Premier:
Since receiving your letter of November lst,
my Colleagues and I have considered at
length the problem raised by the Quebec income tax and by the fact that the taxpayers
having to pay it remain subject also to the
federal tax.
This is, of course, an inevitable consequence of two jurisdictions exercising their
concurrent rights to tax the incomes of the
same persons. The only way you suggested
to avoid the effect of double taxation upon
the taxpayers of Quebec is for us to deduct
from the federal tax on the income of each
individual an amount equivalent to the
amount which he is required to pay as the
provincial tax.
In your letter, you state that the provincial
tax "represents only approximately 10 per
cent of the federal tax on personal income
collected in the Province of Quebec because,
even though our provincial tax is apparently
calculated to be 15 per cent of the federal
tax, the exemptions provided by the provin.cial law materially reduce this proportion".
In this quotation from your letter, you refer
to two different aspects of the provincial law.
When you state that the Quebec tax represents approximately 10 per cent of the federal
tax you compare the yield of the provincial
tax to the amount produced by the federal
tax in the Province of Quebec.
When you say that your tax "is apparently
calculated to be 15 per cent of the federal
tax", you explain this percentage by referring
to the scale of exemptions granted by your
law. This scale is such that it does not
subject to your tax all the Quebec taxpayers
who are obliged to pay the federal tax. In
order to obtain an amount corresponding to
10 per cent of the amount yielded by the
federal tax, it has been necessary to fix, for
those who have to pay your tax, a higher
rate than if you had distributed the burden
over all those we tax.
Provincial legislatures have, like the federal Parliament, the right and the responsibility to distribute the burden of their taxes
on their taxpayers in whatever way seems
most appropriate to them. This is a right
and a responsibility which is the same for

all provinces, and none of them can be compelled to conform with the course of action
followed elsewhere. Whatever differences
there may be in the rules adopted by the
different provinces, the federal law must be
the same everywhere and it must be such
as to leave the federal government with the
revenues needed to fulfil its national responsibilities.
At present the federal law allows every
Canadian taxpayer having to pay a provincial
personal income tax to claim a deduction up
to 5 per cent of his federal tax. This method
of deduction raises certain administrative
difficulties and, what is more serious, it
makes the real incidence of the provincial
tax depend on the terms of the federal law
and makes the total amount deducted from
the federal tax depend on the terms of the
provincial law. Instead of deducting the
provincial tax from the federal tax, we intend to propose to Parliament a reduction
of the federal tax for all taxpayers of a
province having a provincial tax, whether or
not they have to pay the provincial tax. Thus,
the taxpayers of such a province will receive
the benefit of the total amount of the reduction in the federal tax and the federal and
provincial authorities will be able to determine, independently of one another, in what
way and to what extent their taxpayers will
be subjected to their respective taxes.
The 5 per cent deduction allowed at present
by the federal law was fixed in 1946. Since
that time, two changes have occurred. In the
first place the rates of the federal tax have
been reduced with the result that there has
been a corresponding reduction in the amount
represented by the 5 per cent. In addition,
the tax rentals paid by the federal Government to the provinces under the tax agreements have been rising as a consequence
of the increase in the population and in the
national product.
Pending the results of a new federal-provincial conference, we propose therefore to
ask Parliament to amend the federal income
tax law in order to grant a reduction of
10 per cent to all taxpayers of any province
where a provincial income tax is levied
whether or not all these taxpayers have to
pay the provincial tax. We will recommend
that this amendment apply to the years 1955
and 1956. At the same time, we will ask
Parliament to release from its present agreement any province which would prefer this
new arrangement and I am immediately so
informing the other Premiers.
Moreover, we feel it would be reasonable
to make the new percentage apply to taxpayers who have been in fact subjected to

SENATE
two taxes on their 1954 income. We intend,
therefore, to propose that the taxpayers who
will have paid provincial income tax for 1954
be allowed a deduction up to 10 per cent of
their federal tax.
We hope that this action on our part will
encourage your Government to act in the
same spirit and that we will have, on both
sides, helped to prepare the atmosphere for
useful and fruitful work during the next
federal-provincial conference.
In any event, we would have had to meet
before the end of 1955 to discuss the fiscal
relations of the years which will follow the
expiry of the present tax rental agreements.
We feel that it might be appropriate to
begin the new conference at an earlier date,
if that is possible. Upon my return from the
Commonwealth meeting in London, towards
the middle of February, I intend to communicate with the Premiers of all the Provinces
with a view to working out arrangements for
a conference and fixing a date for it.
Yours sincerely,
(Sgd.) LOUIS S. ST. LAURENT
Copy
Office of the Prime Minister
Canada
Ottawa, January 14, 1955
The following letter sent to all Provincial
Premiers with the exception of the
Premier of Quebec
My dear Premier:
You will no doubt have learned from the
press that I have been in communication with
the Premier of Quebec about the situation
created for personal income taxpayers in that
province resulting from the imposition of a
provincial income tax applicable in the years
1954, 1955 and 1956.
Before this provincial tax was imposed, the
situation in Quebec was that the income taxpayers of that province were paying federal
taxes at the same rate as other Canadians
although the people of Quebec were not
receiving the financial advantage for their
provincial services that the people of the
other provinces were receiving through the
tax rental agreements.
Since the imposition of the provincial tax
many of the personal income taxpayers in
Quebec are required to pay higher personal
income taxes than other Canadians, and payments under the tax rental agreements are
still unavailable to the people of that province,
because the government of the province preferred, as was its right, not to conclude an
agreement.

At the time the provincial tax was imposed,
the provincial authorities suggested publicly
that the total amount of the tax paid to the
province should be allowed by the federal
authorities as a tax credit against the federal
income tax.
If the federal government had accepted this
suggestion, we would have felt obliged to
make the same concession to any other province, and this would have meant that the
effective rate of federal taxation in each
province would have been set by the provincial authorities and would have differed from
one province to another. We felt that the
federal law must be uniform in its application in all provinces.
We did indicate, however, that the federal
government was not wedded to the principle
of tax rental agreements to the exclusion of
any better alternative arrangement if one
could be found. At the same time, we made
it clear that the present government had no
intention of abandoning the objective of the
tax rental agreements which is to make it
financially possible for all the provinces,
whatever their tax base, to perform their
constitutional functions themselves and to
provide a reasonable Canadian level of provincial services without an abnormal burden
of taxation. That is the foundation of the
policy of the federal government.
I had a meeting with the Premier of Quebec
at his request in October and he indicated,
at that time, that be was considering making
certain amendments to the provincial tax law
which he hoped might make some temporary
arrangement possible. My colleagues and I
felt it was our duty to make every effort to
find some alternative to the tax rental agreements which would preserve the fundamental
objective of those agreements which I have
mentioned and at the same time be more
acceptable to all provincial governments.
We are not yet in a position to propose an
alternative to the tax rental agreements which
we believe would be generally satisfactory
and, as the agreements still have two years
to run, we felt that, meanwhile, we should
propose a stop-gap arrangement which, without being unfair to the other provinces,
would reduce the burden of double taxation
placed on many of the income taxpayers in
the province of Quebec.
I have already indicated that we could not
meet the suggestion of the Quebec authorities
and allow the whole of their provincial income tax to be deducted from the federal
tax, unless we were prepared to accord a
similar right to any other province.
It is our view that whatever differences
there may be in the tax laws adopted by the

JANUARY 18, 1955
different provinces, the federal laws must be
the same everywhere and must be such as to
leave the federal government with the
revenues needed to fulfil its national responsibilties.
At present the federal law allows every
Canadian taxpayer having to pay a provincial
personal income tax to claim a deduction up
to 5 per cent of his federal tax. This method
of deduction raises certain administrative
difficulties and, what is even more serious, it
makes the real incidence of the provincial
tax depend on the terms of the federal law
and makes the total amount deducted from
the federal tax depend on the terms of the
provincial law. Instead of deducting the
provincial tax from the federal tax we intend
to propose a reduction of the federal tax for
all taxpayers of a province having a provincial tax, whether or not they have to pay
the provincial tax. Thus, the taxpayers
of such a province will receive the benefit
of the total amount of the reduction in the
federal tax and the federal and provincial
authorities will be able to determine, independently of one another, in what way
and to what extent their taxpayers will be
subjected to their respective taxes.
The 5 per cent deduction allowed at present
by the federal law was fixed in 1946. Since
that time, two changes have occurred. In
the first place, the rates of the federal tax
have been reduced-with the result that there
has been a corresponding reduction in the
amount represented by the 5 per cent. In
addition, the tax rentals paid by the federal
government to the provinces under the tax
agreements have been rising as a consequence
of the increase in the population and in the
national product.
Pending the results of a new federalprovincial conference, we propose, therefore,

50437-4

to ask Parliament to amend the federal income tax law in order to grant a reduction
of 10 per cent to all taxpayers of any province where a provincial income tax is levied
whether or not all these taxpayers have to
pay the provincial tax. We will recommend
that this amendment apply to the years 1955
and 1956. At the same time, we will ask
Parliament to release from its present agreement any province which would prefer this
new arrangement.
Moreover, we feel it would be reasonable to
make the new percentage apply to taxpayers
who have been in fact subjected to two taxes
on their 1954 income. We intend, therefore,
to propose that income taxpayers who will
have paid a provincial tax for 1954 be allowed
a deduction up to 10 per cent of their federal
tax.
I shall be glad to know at your convenience
whether your government would wish to be
released from the tax rental agreement in
order to take advantage of the proposed new
arrangement for 1955 and 1956.
It had always been understood that it
would be necessary to hold a federal-provincial conference before the end of 1955 to
discuss fiscal arrangements for the years
which will follow the present tax rental
agreements. In the light of recent developments it might be the desire of the provincial governments to have this conference
held at an earlier date.
I shall accordingly communicate with you
again shortly after my return from the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' meeting in
London towards the middle of February with
a view to working out arrangements for a
conference at a time which will be satisfactory to all governments concerned.
Yours sincerely,

to the Speech from the Throne, and at that
time I shall have something to say in reply
to the question just raised by the honourable
gentleman from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid).
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session
and the motion of Hon. Mrs. Hodges, seconded
by Hon. Mr. Tremblay, for an Address in
reply thereto.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, may I at the outset join with the Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) in congratulating the mover (Hon. Mrs. Hodges) and
the seconder (Hon. Mr. Tremblay) of this
motion. We had expected to hear outstanding
addresses by both these young honourable
senators-young at least in the number of
years in which they have served in the Senate
-and we were certainly not disappointed.
The mover, the honourable senator from
Victoria, delivered an address which applied
for the most part directly to the great province of British Columbia, but a good deal of
what she said could be applied to Canada's
other provinces. The honourable lady has
had a long experience in public life, and
enjoys the distinction of being the only
woman in the Commonwealth who has held
office as Speaker of an elected legislative
body. That is indeed an outstanding distinction. Because of her wide experience we
knew that we would receive an address of the
type which she delivered.
The seconder of the motion, the honourable
senator from Lauzon, has also had considerable experience in public life. It was my
privilege to enter the House of Commons on
the same day that he did, and it was also my
very good fortune to leave that house on the
same day as he. I was very happy in my
association with him there. He always took
an active part in the work of the Commons,
and I know that he will be active in the work
of this chamber. The honourable senator
represented his province-la belle province
de Québec-with distinction in the present
debate, and we look forward with pleasure
to further addresses from him from time to
time.
May I also join with the Leader of the
Opposition in congratulating His Honour the
Speaker on the splendid arrangements which

The Leader of the Opposition referred ta
the huge amaunt of maney being raised by
taxation. 0f course, huge sums have ta be
raised by taxation ta meet aur heavy
expenses. I arn sure that my hanourabie
friend would not want ta do away wîth
family allowances, with aid age security after
seventy, or pensions between sixty-five and
seventy, on the means test, or pensions for
blind and disabied persans, or unemployment
insurance, or any af the other social security
measures for which we have made pravision.
If enough people want ta abandon these
benefits, it is passible that taxation might be
substantialiy reduced; but I arn satisfied that
the members of this body and the Canadian
people generally wish aur social legisiatian ta
rernain on the statute books.

Honourable senatars will perhaps be interested in a breakdown af the revenue dollar
during the year 1953-54. The budgetary revenues for that year were $4,396 million, and
inciuding aid age security receipts of $293
million, we had a total revenue of $4,689
million. On that basis of revenue the breakdown of the spending of each tax dollar was
as follows:
Public debt charge, Il cents; Subsidies, tax
rentai payments ta provinces, 7 cents;
Defence,, 40 cents; Veterans' Affairs, pensions,
hospitals, etc., 5 cents; Health and Welfare,
social security, inciuding ald age security
payments, 18 cents: Resources and Develapment, 5 cents; Transport and Communication,
6 cents; Qenerai government, 6 cents; Otherý
unclassified expenditures, 2 cents.

SENATE
The total paid out on account of old age
security during the year was $339 million.
Our heaviest expenditure is for defence, but
we have large expenditures also for other
items I have mentioned. We do not want to
reduce our social security payments. And if
we want to survive, we cannot reduce our
defence expenditures.
Therefore I say that
although we all wish it were possible to
reduce taxation, no one has yet devised a
way of doing so.
Honourable
senators, I am frequently
asked if we could not have more legislation
introduced in the Senate. I find that that
question has been discussed from time to
time in this house. The most comprehensive
debate on the subject that I have been able
to find in the records was initiated by the
Honourable Charles Murphy, in the year
1934.
In that debate he spoke to the following
notice:
That he will call the attention of the Government
to the work of the Senate and to the efforts made
by the Senate to secure the initiation in this House
of Government measures, and will inquire if it is
the intention of the Government to introduce in
the Senate at an early date any of the legislation
indicated in the Speech from the Throne.

He opened his remarks by giving a brief
history of the intentions of the framers of
the constitution as to the work which should
be performed by the Upper House of Parliament. He then proceeded to outline the
various efforts made by the Senate over
the years to secure a larger share of government business than was usually allotted to
it by the governments of the day. The first
effort cited is that undertaken during the first
Parliament
after Confederation,
and he
quotes the report of the committee set up in
1868 under the chairmanship of Sir Alexander Campbell to inquire into this very
subject. May I be permitted to read a brief
extract from the committee's report, which
was presented on May 7, 1868:
The committee would observe that independently
of financial measures which begin as of course in
the House of Commons, the representative character of that house, and the system of responsible
government, render it expedient that some other
classes of important bills should be first discussed
there; the committee are, nevertheless, of opinion
that it would bo quite possible to originate a much
larger number of bills in the Senate than has
hitherto been the practice in the Legislative Councils
of any of the provinces of the Dominion.
It
appears to the committee that it must rest chiefly
with the Government of the day to accomplish this;
the business of Parliament will hereafter, the committee believe, be principally in connection with
public measures, and in the hands of the Government, and it will depend upon the ministers themselves in which house of Parliament many of these
The committee think
measures shall originate.
that the public interest in the more thorough consideration of legislative measures, as well as in the
dispatch of business, would be much better served

by a persistent effort on the part of the Government of the day to originate in the Senate as many
of their measures as the law and usage of Parliament will permit.

The report was unanimously adopted by
the Senate, but nothing further seems to
have been done about it until 1874. In that
year a joint committee of both houses was
set up to consider whether any facilities
could be provided for the dispatch of business
in Parliament. Nothing practical seems to
have been accomplished by that committee.
It has been generally agreed that money
bills should originate in the Commons. Sections 53 and 54 of the British North America
Act read as follows:
53. Bills for appropriating any part of the public
revenue, or for imposing any tax or impost, shall
originate in the House of Commons.
54. It shall net be lawful for the House of Commons to adopt or pass any vote, resolution, address,
or bill for the appropriation of any part of the
public revenue, or of any tax or impost, to any purpose that has not been first recommended to that
house by message of the Governor General in the
session in which such vote, resolution, address, or
bill is proposed.

Now, I do not intend at this time to go
into any discussion as to the correctness of
the procedure under which money bills cannot be introduced in the Senate. I think we
are all pretty well agreed that where an
appropriation of money is made the bill must
originate in the House of Commons, with the
approval of the Governor General. There are
also other bills which we might say have
financial implications or political significance,
and it is my opinion that such bills should
also originate in the other house.
There is another aspect, which the late
Senator Dandurand spoke about in the debate
of 1934. He said:
I refer to the fact that the Senate is considered
to be a revising body and as such has played its

part since its inception.

The initiation of bills in

this Chamber would change that situation and make
the House of Commons the revising body. Further-

more, arguments have been advanced against the
abandonment by the Senate of the position of a
court of appeal in regard to legislation coming
from the Commons. As a matter of fact, to judge
from the statements made by the Fathers of Confederation, and by Sir John Macdonald prior to
Confederation, and cited by my honourable friend
from Russell (Hon. Mr. Murphy), we have been
appointed mainly for the purpose of giving sober
second thought to proposed legislation, and, of
course, if we originated legislation and passed it on
to the House of Commons for approval, we should
not be fulfilling that function.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But we would still be
sober!
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, still sober.
Notwithstanding all that has been said
against the introduction of certain legislation in the Senate I did, at your request,
bring to the attention of the Government the
fact that this house would be pleased to have

JANUARY
more legislation introduced here in the first
instance. Honourable senators will observe
from the House of Commons Routine Proceedings and Orders of the Day for Monday,
January 10, that the Government gave notice
of 19 bills. Sixteen of those are what we
would call money bills and so could not be
introduced in the Senate. The remaining
three are not money bills, but have what I
might call a political significance. One of
them is an Act respecting the construction,
operation and maintenance of international
river improvements. Another is an Act to
regulate the exportation of power and fluids
and the importation of gas. The third is an
Act to Amend the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act. Honourable members will notice
from our Orders of the Day that I was successful in having introduced in this house
five of the eight bills which could not be
considered money bills. I trust that, as the
session goes along, we shall continue to have
introduced here measures which are not
money bills and have no political or financial
implications.
An honourable senator suggested last year
that a committee be set up to consider the
relationship between the federal Government, the municipality of the City of Ottawa,
and adjoining municipalities. Ten years ago
a joint committee appointed for this purpose
made a worth-while contribution to the subject, which is of vital importance not only
to the municipality of Ottawa and the adjoining municipalities but to others throughout
Canada. I took to Council the representations
of this house, and, as appears in the Speech
from the Throne, a proposal will be made
to the Senate to set up a committee similar
to the one appointed ten years ago. I am
sure that in this respect, once again honourable senators will make a great contribution
on a really important subject.
I come now to the question which was
raised this afternoon by the honourable
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid). I have not forgotten the very forceful
and notable addresses which were made in
this house last year in connection with the
narcotic drug traffic, and that it seemed to
be the wish of honourable senators that a
special committee of this house should be
set up to consider this very important issue.
A review of the drug and narcotics situation
as it affects Canadians, and particularly
young people, is very necessary and urgent.
There is no need to dwell on the evils of the
drug traffic. All honourable senators, I am
sure, realize however that the question is
not only one of punishment; it is also one of
treatment of those addicted, and the prevention of further exposure of our young people
to this pernicious traffic. In my opinion, the

19, 1955
place to attack this problem is at the source,
by concentrating on the prevention of distribution. It was remarked in this chamber
last year, to point the need of an inquiry
into this problem, that narcotie drugs are
an evil which destroys not only men's bodies
but also their souls. It is a great menace in
most large commercial centres, more particularly the sea-coast cities, and the alarming fact is that the traffic is on the increase.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police annual
report for the fiscal year ended March 31,
1954, states:
The illicit traffic in narcotic drugs continues to
reflect a steady increase. 507 arrests were made
this year compared with 495 for the previous period.
This total is a record high for several years.
Drug addiction is causing serious concern to
enforcement authorities and the problem of the
"repeat offender" is giving rise to a growing realization that addiction is the outward manifestation of social and medical conditions which
enforcement authorities alone are not competent
to cope with. The cycle of periodic arrest, subsequent conviction and imprisonment of the addict,
has failed to make any appreciable progress towards
correcting this situation and it would seem that any
real hope for positive, long term results in dealing
more effectively with the drug addict can only be
achieved by the combined efforts of medical, social
and enforcement bodies.

It will be recalled that in this chamber
last session the suggestion was made that,
in view of the seriousness of the condition
which exists in so many places throughout
Canada, this house should set up a special
committee to consider the whole problem.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), in
his speech yesterday, suggested that there
should be representatives from the Opposition parties at the United Nations meetings.
I was always under the impression that the
Opposition parties were represented at these
gatheringsHon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: -so I reviewed the
records fron 1950 to 1954. I found that in
1950 the Opposition had four representatives:
Messrs. Coldwell, Graydon, Higgins and Low.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But not from the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: From Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I believe I am the only
member of the Conservative party in this
house who ever went to the United Nations
meetings as a delegate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Well, as I have stated,
in 1950 four members of Opposition parties
attended.
Hon. Mr. Reid: From the House of Commons.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, from the House of
Commons.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Surely, honourable
senators, Parliament includes the House of
Commons. In 1951 the Opposition parties
had one representative, Major General
Pearkes. In 1952 there were four Opposition
representatives: Messrs. MacLean, Graydon,
Stewart and Beyerstein. In 1953 there were
two: Messrs. Coldwell and Macdonnell. Last
year, also there were two, namely Messrs.
Gillis and Michener. My honourable friend
says that the Opposition in the Senate had no
representatives. That may be so, but the Senate itself has been represented each year at
the gatherings. I see no reason for assuming
that Canada will not continue to be represented at United Nations meetings by members of the Senate and members of the various parties in the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I interrupt my honourable friend to ask a question? Since 1946 how
many of these representatives have been official delegates or alternates at meetings of the
United Nations?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have not that information at hand.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I suggest to you that none
have been.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I could obtain that
information, but I think I have shown conclusively that Opposition parties in Canada's
Parliament have always been represented at
gatherings of the United Nations.
In his address the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) said that the world is no
more secure today than it was a year ago,
and so on. I am amazed that the honourable
gentleman should be such an apostle of
gloom. Although world conditions are still
in a serious state, I think some progress in
the right direction is being made. I believe
that January 1 of this year marked the first
occasion in a long time, when a new year
has been ushered in without a fighting war.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We have one now.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That may be so,
but I am speaking about the first of January.
This means that we have had at least one
spell when there has been no fighting. If
there is a fighting war on now, I am hopeful
there will be more and longer spells of
non-fighting and that finally there will never

again be war. I think we are getting nearer
to that goal. In Indo-China the fighting bas
ceased, and an International Supervisory
Commission bas been set up to assist towards
stabilizing conditions in that country. In
Southeast Asia a counterpart of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization for defence bas
been founded in what is known as SEATOthe Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Last
year a meeting was held in Ceylon by a
further group of South Asian countries not
within the framework of SEATO but which
have as their objective the perpetuation of
peace in that area. In Europe we have seen
the rapprochement of France and Germany.
For the time being-and, I hope, for ever
-these countries have settled their dispute
over the Saar.
I am not endeavouring to say that we are
living under such conditions now that we
can sit back and not worry about the possibility of war. On the contrary, I do feel
we need to concern ourselves about it, but
at the same time I sincerely believe that men
are turning their minds, however slowly it
may be, to bringing about conditions of lasting peace. I feel that what is now taking
place throughout the world confirms my
opinion. If we can remain strong militarily;
if our navy, air force and army can remain
strong; if those who act for us in the councils
of the nations will not become tired by
continual talk, talk, talk; if they will be
patient, as they have been in the past, then
I am hopeful that in the not too distant
future the atomic energy which is being
developed today for destructive purposes will
be developed instead for purposes of peace.
The aim of every nation should be to develop
and use atomic energy for the benefit of all
mankind-for peace, not for war.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. J. Duffus: Honourable senators, may
I ask your indulgence to discuss a matter of
national importance, namely, that a fitting
memorial be erected to commemorate the
production, in 1842, on the farm of the late
David Fife, in my native township of Otonabee, of Red Fife Wheat, which was for more
than sixty years the standard variety of
spring wheat grown in Canada.
(Translation):
Honourable senators, may I repeat in
French that I would like the Senate to discuss a matter of national importance, namely,

JANUARY

the erection of a memorial to commemorate
the production, in 1842, on the farm of
David Fife, in the township of Otonabee of
Red Wheat, which was for more than sixty
years the standard variety of spring wheat
grown in Canada.
(Text):
It is not too much to say that David Fife's
discovery revolutionized world wheat farming. Permit me to recall how this great
discovery was made. Back in the early '40's
of the 19th century David Fife built and lived
in a log house with his wife and young
family on his farm in Otonabee township in
the county of Peterborough. The second
building which Mr. Fife erected on his farm
was a workshop. In this he made by hand
all the shingles required to roof his barns
and other out-buildings.
The next chapter in this interesting episode
discloses the fact that unfortunately and
under distressing circumstances the Fife
home was burned to the ground. This made
it necessary for Mr. and Mrs. Fife to take
up their abode in the workshop, which was
their home until they were able to afford a
new one for themselves and their family.
David Fife was a tall, thoughtful Scotsman,
at that time in his middle thirties, and
although of modest bearing he was possessed
of much native intelligence, constructive
imagination and prophetic vision. He was
destined to do more for Canada than perhaps any other man who ever lived in this
country.
The romantic and intriguing story of the
origin of Fife Wheat is inseparably connected
with the history of Canada. In fact, it should
be known in every classroom in this country.
It kindles the imagination, and invites
analogies of its importance by illustrating
how Fife Wheat was given to Canada long
before this young nation was ready to use
or exploit it.
It is very difficult for one to picture what
living conditions were like in that bushland
part of Canada in the 1840's. Those were the
ox-cart days of meagre transportation, and
the log-cabin days of our social development,
when the tallow candle was a symbol of the
prevailing crude and scanty domestic comfort and convenience.
The price of existence of David Fife and
his family was venture, vigorous struggle,
loneliness, unremitting toil and, doubtless,

little enjoyment of life. Educational facilities
were limited. Even elementary schools were
few and far between, and agricultural
colleges and experimental farms were still
undreamed of. Political institutions were at
the colonial stage, with Confederation a
quarter century in the future. Ontario was
Upper Canada, engrossed in its political problems and slowly moving onward and upward
from precedent to precedent toward responsible government.
However, under those primitive conditions,
the ingenious brain and native intelligence of
David Fife were at work planning means by
which to improve his own condition and that
of others. Obviously, he was of a practical
turn of mind, and, realizing the defects of the
only wheat then available in this country,
he wondered whether somewhere in the
world there might be a better quality of
wheat, one which would mature earlier and
be more immune to rust.
In the late fall of 1841 Mr. Fife left home
to visit some friends in Glasgow, Scotland.
While there a shipload of wheat from Danzig
was being unloaded at a distillery. Mr.
Fife took advantage of the opportunity and
procured a small sack of wheat, which he
brought home with him. Unfortunately,
under the circumstances, there was nothing
to indicate whether the grain it contained
was of spring or fall variety.
However, in the spring, with confidence in
God and inspired by the Biblical promise that
seed-time and harvest shall not cease, Mr.
and Mrs. Fife carefully, and no doubt prayerfully, planted the seed in a spot where a
pile of logs had been burned the year before.
Hopefully and patiently they waited. And
how bitterly disappointed they must have
been when, after anxious weeks, it became
evident that most of the seed was of winter
variety.
Fortunately, however, a few grains proved
to be of an early spring variety, and five
heads started to grow. Then suddenly, one
day, high hopes were dashed by near disaster
when one of Mr. Fife's oxen, quite unaware
that in satisfying his own taste he was imperilling the future economic welfare of half
a continent, devoured two of the heads of this
miniature crop. In fact, it was only Mrs.
Fife's keen eye and alertness in seeing the
animal and driving it away that saved the
remaining heads.
At maturity those three precious heads
were harvested and hung up on a beam in
the kitchen of David Fife's log home. In
the spring the three heads were threshed in
the palm of David Fife's hand, and the seeds,

SENATE
counted as carefully as if they were small
pieces of gold, were planted. Under confident,
intelligent and watchful care, they matured,
and yielded wheat of a ten days' earlier
spring variety which was more immune to
rust, smut and frost damage than any wheat
theretofore known in this country.
Thus, in 1842, the small area on David
Fife's bushland pioneer farm in Otonabee
township became the first, though primitive,
experimental farm in Canada.
During several subsequent years the grain
multiplied through successful and bountif ul
harvests. And, thanks to David Fife and Red
Fife Wheat, Ontario eventually became a
great wheat producing province. The salvation of struggling pioneers and the economic
future of Canada were assured.
I said in the beginning of this speech that
for more than sixty years Red Fife was the
standard variety of spring wheat grown in
Canada. I ask you now, honourable senators,
what of those sixty-odd years? Had the
tarmers of Canada been compelled to get
along without Red Fife Wheat throughout
that period, the entire development of Canada would have been greatly retarded. It is
impossible to imagine the course which
events would have taken. I say to this honourable house that no one would venture to
hazard a guess as to the great contributions
David Fife's discovery has made to Canada
and Canadians in all walks of life.
1 emphasize these obvious truths: But for it
there would have been no rush of settlers to
the Prairie West, and no Sifton immigration.
The year 1908 would have found no cities,
such as Winnipeg, Regina, Saskatoon and
Edmonton. The prairies at best would have
been a ranching area. The buffalo would not
have been displaced by herds of cattle, and
agriculture would still have been an infant
industry.
But, providentially, Ontario Red Fife
Wheat found its way to western Canada,
where eventually it became the all-important
factor in rolling back the prairie grass and
establishing tens of thousands of prosperous
farmers and happy homes. It was the first
and greatest contribution to the economie
wealth of the Canadian west and other parts
of Canada. It pushed the wheat boundaries
of the prairie hundreds of miles to the north,
and opened up vast areas of new country.
The rapid development and prosperity of
the prairie provinces attracted there such
able men as the late Viscount Bennett, Sir
Frederick Haultain, Sir James Lougheed,
the Honourable Dr. W. R. Motherwell, the
Honourable Robert Forke, the Honourable
Robert Weir, the Honourable
Charles
Stewart, the Right Honourable Arthur
Meighen, the Right Honourable James G.
Gardiner, the Honourable Thomas A. Crerar,

the Honourable Charles A. Dunning, and
others who have occupied some of the
highest positions in this great land of ours.
For sixty-odd years after its discovery Red
Fife Wheat piled up tremendous wealth for
Canada and Canadians and helped to lay
strongly and well the foundation of this great
nation. And right up to 1905 this Otonabee
farmer's wheat retained its supremacy over
all other varieties in Canada. As many
honourable senators know, a number of improved varieties of wheat were developed
from Red Fife, such as Preston, Ladoga, Stanley, Ruby, etc. Last fall the Star-Phoenix of
Saskatoon reported that a considerable quantity of Red Fife Wheat was planted in 1954,
and that the results were just as satisfactory
as from some of the newer varieties.
It was Marquis Wheat, a direct offspring of
Red Fife, which made it possible to feed the
Allied nations during the First World War,
when the existence of not only this country
but of demoorcy itself was at stake and so
many brave men made the supreme sacrifice
for the sacred cause of liberty and justice.
Indeed this splendid wheat which was bred
from Red Fife enabled Canada to earn the
proud title of "the granary of the world".
However, Red Fife Wheat was a prime factor
not only in developing the West and making
Canada one of the world's chief grain producing countries, but also in establishing and
expanding many cities and in building this
relatively young land into a rich and powerful
merchandising and industrial nation.
In support of that statement it is only necessary to mention some of the classes of industry whose existence and prosperity have been
and are largely dependent upon the results
achieved from Red Fife Wheat: Farm implements, binder twine, grain elevators, rail and
water transportation systems, airborne traffic,
mining, lumbering, pulp and paper, hydroelectric power developments, aluminum, cement, iron, steel, coal, telephone systems,
motor cars, trucks and tractors, oil and gas
wells, heating equipment, household electrical and gas appliances, packing houses, the
grain trade, breweries, distilleries, flour milling companies, banks and other great financial institutions, insurance companies, etc. In
fact, one could go on and include almost every
major class of production and merchandising
in this country, for the importance of Red Fife
Wheat in the development of our economic
life cannot be exaggerated, as Canada and
Canadians have benefited by countless millions of dollars. In all humility, we must
regard it as God's blessing to this country.
To put it another way: The economic blessing that accrued from Red Fife Wheat raised
not only the prosperity and standard of Canadian agriculture, but likewise the status of

JANUARY 19, 1955
the Canadian people as a whole. Undoubtedly
it was as a direct consequence of the efforts
and ingenuity of David Fife and his wife
more than of anything else that the wheat
supplies in this country in the last two years
totalled over 983 million bushels, and that in
1953 Canada rose to the rank of the world's
third greatest trading nation.
Such, honourable senators, was the heritage
left by two humble souls, two noble tillers
of the soil, who have long since passed away.
God bless them. It was the gift of their
hearts, of their loyalty and intelligence, of
their ingenuity, of their faith, and of their
hard and unremitting toil. And the world
over, Canada's No. 1 spring wheat is renowned, providing a standard by which all
others have been judged.
Marquis Wheat, a cross between Red Fife
and Red Calcutta, for the development of
which Charles Saunders was knighted, was
first distributed in 1910, replacing Red Fife
to a considerable extent. This fact, however,
does not in any way detract from the greatness of David Fife's discovery. On the contrary, it emphasizes and enhances its
greatness.
But, honourable senators, what of David
Fife? Seriously, I repeat, what of David
Fife? Has he not been just about the most
forgotten man that ever lived in Canada?
Apparently no one was sufficiently interested
in his great discovery to honour him, except
by a proposed cairn which was going to be
placed on the side of the road at Concession 4,
in Otonabee, in 1938, when I was a member
of the House of Commons. To this I respectfully demurred, as being totally inadequate
and unbecoming such an outstanding achievement and as a reflection on the farmers of
Canada. And, honourable senators, not a
stone was turned to mark the spot.
Incidentally, did David Fife have a laboratory in which to develop Red Fife Wheat, as
did Dr. Saunders at the Dominion Experimental Farm from 1900 to 1910? Well, yes,
in the kitchen of his home with a staff consisting of himself, his devoted wife and children gathered around the kitchen table year
after year, during the long winter months,
each taking plateful after plateful of Red
Fife Wheat and deleting therefrom every
scintilla of foreign matter and every inferior
grain so that only the highest quality of seed
was either planted or sold by David Fife.
David Fife was a God-fearing farmer, one
whose innate characteristics were sincerity,
honesty, application, and devotion. He was
such a farmer as we read of in the Bible.
In other words, he was one:
Who drinks of the rills that flow from the hills,
And the land that he tills is his own.
He is happy and free wherever he be,
And needs bow but to God alone.

Canada owes more to David Fife than anyone can tell, and it is time the debt was
given national recognition. Indeed, it is an
indictment of the whole country that it should
be necessary at this late date to revive a
movement for such recognition.
However, about three months ago a national
organization, known as the David Fife
Memorial Society, was convened for the purpose of carrying the movement for an appropriate memorial to a successful conclusion. It
is intended to have the Society incorporated,
and when this is done it will be known as
"The David Fife Memorial Society Incorporated".
Honourable senators, I ask you frankly is
it not our turn now to act in the spirit of
sincere thankfulness and gratitude?
From the bottom of this vibrating heart of
mine I express the hope that we may do our
part now, for if we fail we shall be false to
our traditions, untrue to the citizens of Canada
generally, and unworthy of the name "good
Canadians" Yes, unworthy of those pioneer
men and women who came from lands across
the seas, and who with little but their hopes,
their hearts and their hands builded for
themselves primitive homes in the wilderness,
rolled back the forest, and fought the battle
of life, leaving to us who have followed the
task of making Canada as great as its
unbounded possibilities.
The great Scots poet Robert Burns said that,
once having put your hands to the plow, you
must not turn back.
We realize that our daily deeds represent
the furrows of our individual lives and that it
depends upon each and every one of us how
on our field will look when the last furrow is
turned.
The David Fife Memorial Society, of which
I am Chairman, is deeply desirous of seeing
respect, justice and honour done where they
are long past due. Therefore, I stand before
you today unhesitatingly, confidently, with the
single-minded purpose of presenting a humble
request of nation-wide importance; namely,
that the memory of David Fife at last be
fittingly honoured.
To be more specific, my humble and sincere
request and that of the David Fife Memorial
Society is that a living memorial be erected
to perpetuate the name of David Fife, in the
form of a modern school and hall, both to be
used for educational purposes.
The school, consisting of eight rooms, would
give instruction in a variety of courses,
including elementary agriculture, home economics, public speaking and the drama. The
hall would be completely equipped with a
library, and available for banquets, concerts,
lectures, debates, farm forums, 4-H clubs,
oratorical contests and other public gatherings.

SENATE

I submit this memorial is of a very practical nature, one which would pay handsome
dividends down through the years that lie
ahead, to the end that future generations of
Canadians might obtain a basic education
that will fit them to follow in the footsteps
of this early Canadian pioneer and benefactor.
At this time I wish to inform the house
that our honourable and most respected colleague from East York (Hon. Mr. McGuire),
who himself is a native son of Otonabee township, at a centennial dinner held in the city
of Peterborough, in 1929, was the first man
to recommend that a memorial be erected in
honour of David Fife, and his enthusiasm for
a memorial increases from day to day.
The Society has tentatively selected a site,
containing eleven and a half acres, in
Otonabee township, bordering on Canada's
national highway, at the intersection of Concession four, and it is proposed to have this
known henceforth as Fifeville. It is adjacent
to the beautiful Indian River, about ten miles
from the city of Peterborough, and within
view of the acres upon which the famous
Red Fife Wheat was grown.
Seven and a half acres of the site would
be occupied by the school and hall, with
plots for experimental purposes; and this
portion would be enclosed by an ornamental
fence along the front. An industrial-type
fence would be erected around the other
three sides, and the whole would be beautifully landscaped.
The remainder of the site would provide an
ample area for outdoor sports-skating,
hockey, baseball, tennis, swimming-and
children's playgrounds; besides parking space
-a very necessary adjunct, in these daysfor more than a hundred motor cars, trucks
and buses. The basement banquet room, the
bleachers and the land adjacent thereto
would be extensively used by junior farmers
and for field days, judging courses, and
so on.
The total cost of the completed project
would not exceed $300,000.
This figure
includes the cost of moving the 145-year-old
Fife log home to the memorial site. The
Society feels that if this log home were as
nearly as possible furnished as it was when
occupied by the Fife family it would, in
combination with the rest of the Memorialthe modern school and hall, and the grounds
-prove a popular attraction for tourists. I
am confident that this appropriate and reasonable proposal to honour the memory of
David Fife will have spontaneous and generous support, for sentimental reasons as well
as for the sake of justice and fair play.
I am definitely of the opinion that the
provinces, and thousands of institutions,

industries,
manufacturers,
municipalities,
department stores, wheat and stock farmers,
etc., who have profited richly from the results
of Red Fife Wheat would be delighted, and
indeed I believe their hearts and minds would
be gladdened, by an opportunity to contribute, according to their means.
Because we have proposed a memorial
which in itself would be as practical as
was the work on this sagacious pioneer, I
feel doubly sure that our national appeal
will be successful. I respectfully venture my
sincere conviction and that of the David
Fife Memorial Society that in all Canada
there is scarcely a citizen, be he farmer or
townsman, who, if familiar with the facts,
would not be delighted to see erected at Fifeville this fitting memorial to one whose inestimable contribution to Canadian nationhood
bas too long gone unrecognized.
Therefore, very feelingly, and with implicit
confidence, I suggest to honourable senators
that they assist and seek the assistance of
others from their respective provinces who
would be happy to make contributions to
help liquidate this 115-year-old debt which
we Canadians owe and intend to pay by the
erection of a memorial to adequately honour
the name of this great Canadian. May I
most humbly suggest that it is a patriotic and
national responsibility.
I would further suggest that we most
respectfully seek the assistance of our honourable colleagues in the House of Commons
from each of the ten provinces in giving and
obtaining contributions to help liquidate this
debt in the same manner.
Cheques should be forwarded to the Honorary Treasurer, c/o The Royal Bank of
Canada, Peterborough, Ontario, and be made
payable to "The David Fife Memorial Society".
When the amount required is fully subscribed we shall immediately start making
arrangements to prepare the site and erect
the memorial, which we expect will be ready
for the official opening during the latter part
of the month of August this year.
Our plan, after the official opening, is to
carry on for a week a series of varied programs of sports, tournaments, picnics, and so
forth each afternoon, and a program of concerts, plays, speeches and oratorical contests
each evening, and Divine services of thankfulness on Sunday.
Surely, surely, honourable senators, David
Fife is truly to be numbered among those
splendid pioneers and benefactors to whom
we pay the grateful and often reverent tribute that "They builded better than they
knew".
I am confident that this proper and reasonable proposal will have very generous support.
And because the memorial would be as prac-

JANUARY

tical as was the great discovery of this sagacious pioneer, I feel doubly sure that our
efforts will be successful.
If the people of Canada, who have so
richly benefited from the discovery which
David Fife gave to our country, concur in
this plea for honouring his name, who can
say but that within the walls of the David
Fife Memorial Hall and School there may be
planted seeds of intellect and of character,
which, in due season, will yield bountiful
harvests as valuable as those produced by
Red Fife Wheat.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Duffus: Referring to the matter
upon which I have just spoken, may I have
the privilege of suggesting that the proposa]
I have presented should be referred to the
Standing Committee on Natural Resources.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It cannot be.
The Hon. the Speaker: I am not sure that
the honourable senator from Peterborough
West (Hon. Mr. Duffus) is in order. It is
necessary that the house should have before it
a written resolution incorporating the honourable senator's proposal.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Gershaw, the debate
was adjourned.
DIVORCE PETITIONS
REPORTS OF COMMITTEE
CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the reports of the Standing Committee on
Divorce Nos. 6 to 16, dealing with petitions
for divorce.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck, moved that the reports
be concurred in.
The motion was agreed to, on division.
PRIVATE BILL
HURON AND ERIE MORTGAGE CORPORATIONSECOND READING

Hon. W. D. Euler: May I have the permission of the Senate to make a suggestion?
Last Thursday I moved the first reading of
a bill respecting The Huron and Erie Mortgage Corporation, a measure which explains
itself. At that time I thought I might not
be able to be present here on Tuesday or
Wednesday of this week, although I desired
to have second reading on one or other of
these days, so I had it set down for tomorrow,
Thursday. I wonder whether the house
would indulge me-for reasons which seem
to me reasonable and appropriate, since
arrangements have been made by those who
want to appear in support of the bill to bring
it before the Banking and Commerce Committee next Wednesday-by permitting me

19, 1955

to move second reading of the bill today?
I realize that for this purpose I must have
the unanimous consent of the house.
The Hon. the Speaker: Has the honourable
senator the unanimous consent of the Senate
to his request?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I move, therefore, second
reading of Bill G, an Act respecting The
Huron and Erie Mortgage Corporation.
The purpose of the bill is readily understood. Briefly, it is to give the corporation
authority to reduce the par value of its $100
shares to $20, so that any holder of a paid-up
share of the value of $100 will receive five
$20 par value shares. Some persons hold
shares which are only partly paid up, and
those who have shares on which $20 bas been
paid will receive one share.
The Huron and Erie Corporation is a
company whose head office is in the city
of London. It has a large branch in Toronto
and, I believe, branches elsewhere.
Hon. Mr. Haig: At Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Honourable members
know, I suppose, that this is one of our
strongest and most reputable concerns in its
special line of endeavour. The authorized
capital is $10 million. If this bill should
become law the authorized capitalization will
remain at $10 million, but of this amount
$5 million will be fully paid up: there will
be no partly-paid shares. There will then
be 500,000 authorized shares of the value of
$20 each, of which 250,000 fully paid-up
shares will be issued to the subscribers.
All the preliminaries and everything necessary to legalize the passing of this bill have
been fully attended to. First of all, bylaw
number 39 of the corporation was passed by
the Board of Directors. Then a fully authorized meeting of the shareholders was held,
at which more than two thirds of the shareholders were represented, and they voted
unanimously in favour of the bylaw upon
which this bill is based. Under this legislation
the debenture holders are assured that any
who so desire may have their debentures paid
in full prior to maturity, provided they give
notice to that effect.
The purpose of subdividing shares, which
has become a very common practice, is to
give them a wider distribution. This company's stock is selling at a very considerable
premium over the par value of $100, and it
has been thought that the proposed reduction
in par value would make it possible for
smaller investors to participate in ownership
of the shares.

SENATE

The bill has been approved by the Senate's
Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel, Mr.
John F. MacNeill. It has also been approved
by the Department of Finance, through Mr.
MacGregor, the Superintendent of Insurance.
Possibly that is all the explanation required
at present. As I said before, it has become
quite a practice to subdivide shares. I
think the best illustration of that was given
during the revision of the Bank Act, at the
last session of Parliament, when the shares
of the banks were reduced to $10 par value.
Honourable senators, if the bill is given
second reading I will move to have it referred
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce.

the bill proposes that the liability of the
holders who have only paid $20 on each of
their present shares shall be completely
extinguished. Al the creditors of the company are of course interested in that extinguishment, and some might object to it.
So I should like to know if the debenture
holders, who are being given the right to
receive prepayment of their debentures if
they so desire, are the only creditors of
the corporation.
Hon. Mr. Euler: So far as I know, they
are the only creditors.
Present shareholders will receive five shares
in exchange for each fully paid-up $100
share, and one share in exchange for each
of those on which they have paid only $20.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I

CIVIL SERVICE ADMINISTRATION
COMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. Marcotte, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Civil Service Administration, presented the committee's first report,
recommending that its quorum be reduced
to seven members, and moved with leave
that the report be concurred in.
He said: Honourable senators, in moving
the adoption of this report I should like to
make a few general remarks. It may be
recalled by some honourable members that
some years before the war I asked that
an investigation be made into the administration of the Civil Service Commission. I am
sure that my honourable friend from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) will remember
that occasion. After making my speech on
the subject in the Senate chamber I received
as a visitor to my room the Chairman of
the Civil Service Commission. I assured
him that I did not want to start anything,
that if anything was started it would be
by the standing committee. Not ten minutes
afterwards some officials of the Commission
came to me and said, "For heaven's sake,
Senator, keep quiet." I told them also that
I did not want to start any trouble. Then
a third member of the Commission came
to me, and I told him the same. I was
then, as I am today, a friend of the employees.
There is something wrong somewhere. I
do not know what it is, but I am going to
find out. I serve notice today on honourable
members to that effect. We are going to
find out about several things. I ask the
indulgence of honourable senators, because
what I am going to say will appeal to them,
and I know that I will get support. Every
year thousands of people outside the Civil
Service are brought into the Service and
given preference over experienced and capable employees. For referring to this I shall
be criticized, of course.
The honourable Leader of the Government
in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) is my
friend, a man I very much like, and I
know that he wants justice to be done. And
justice should be done.
Honourable senators, I hope that when the
committee meets there will be more than
a quorum present. The matter will require
consideration by all the members of the
committee.
The motion was agreed to.

SENATE
CANADIAN BROADCASTING
CORPORATION
TELEVISING OF BRITISH EMPIRE GAMESINQUIRY STANDS

On the notice by Hon. Mr. Reid:
That he will inquire of the Government:
1. What sum of money was paid by the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation for the exclusive rights
of televising the British Empire Games held in
Vancouver in 1954?
2. What was the total revenue received by the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for the sale of
the television rights of films taken of the British
Empire Games and sold to United States interests?
3. What percentage of Canadian television programs, as seen by the Canadian public, are produced
or manufactured in the United States?

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have endeavoured
but so far have not been able to obtain the
information requested by the honourable
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid). Therefore I would suggest that the
inquiry stand.
The inquiry stands.
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
DOCUMENTS ON ACCESSION TO NORTH
ATLANTIC TREATY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are proceeded
with I should like to ask a question of the
Leader of the Government in the Senate
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald). Will it be possible
for members of the Senate to have copies of
the agreements reached at Paris, the approval
of which we probably shall have to consider
next week? I know that copies of these
agreements would be useful to me, as I am
sure they would be to other members.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I can assure my
honourable friend that I shall endeavour to
obtain copies of these documents. I was under
the impression that I had already tabled the
documents, but I have not been able to confirm this from our Minutes of the Proceedings.

I notice that in the House of Commons
there was tabled on the 10th of January a
copy of the protocol to the North Atlantic
Treaty on the accession of the Federal Republic of Germany, signed at Paris on October
23, 1954, in English and in French, and also
a copy of agreements relating to Germany
concluded at Paris on October 23, 1954, in
English and French.
I see no reason why I should not be able
to obtain copies of these documents and have
them distributed to members of this house.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If they have been tabled
in the House of Commons I daresay they will
be printed in the Votes and Proceedings or
Hansard of that bouse.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: They do not appear
in Hansard. I am quite sure I can obtain
them, though.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I think we should have
them.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, I quite agree.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session
and the motion of Hon. Mrs. Hodges, seconded by Hon. Mr. Tremblay, for an address
in reply thereto.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
may I first of all congratulate the mover (Hon.
Mrs. Hodges) and the seconder (Hon. Mr.
Tremblay) of the Address on their eloquence
and on the material which they presented to
this chamber.
The Speech from the Throne indicates that
Canada is making progress toward improving
conditions in the homes of the common people
of this land; and that of course, in the last
analysis, is the object of all our legislation.
Owing to the kindness of the Leader (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) and members of this house
I had the opportunity of visiting one protectorate nation within the Commonwealth of
Nations that is not as fortunate as Canada.
In the cities of that country you cannot step
out on the street after dark with safety, and
people travelling through the district always
carry a loaded gun.
Kenya is a beautiful country. The scenery
there is lovely, just like the scenery in a
dream. But it is a troubled country. The
trouble, which is so great that economic
progress has stopped, is caused by the friction
and distrust and cruel violence that one sees
in many places there.
The hospitals in Kenya are serving the
people reasonably well. The staff doctors and
the staff nurses are mostly British, but
among the pupil nurses, ward aides and
orderlies there are of course a great number
of coloured people, who are doing a really
good work. Naturally, most of the patients
are Africans; and among them, both adults
and children, are many suffering from nutritional diseases. It is the custom in that country to nurse the children until they are two
or three years old, and from then on their
diet consists chiefly of bananas. This diet is
lacking in proteins and vitamins and causes a
series of disturbances to their bodies.
In one large hospital ward occupied by a
considerable number of young men, the lady

JANUARY 20, 1955
superintendent said that they all had been
wounded in conflicts with the Mau Maus.
There were some very sad cases of gun shot
wounds, spinal injuries, and so on, which
left those young men permanently paralyzed.
Then, going into another ward, she said that
the patients there were all Mau Maus. Walking up and down the centre of that ward
day and night is a man with a loaded rifle,
because the Mau Maus are not trusted. However, the hospital authorities were giving
them the same thorough, kind and scientific
treatment that they were giving to the other
patients.
For many years Kenya was the paradise
of the big gaine hunter. The record of one
big game hunter, Lord Delamere, appealed
to me greatly. He was a soldier of fortune,
and a giant in his day. He had a large ranch
there, extending over 100,000 acres, and be
spent a great fortune in trying to produce
something on that equator ranch. He stocked
it first with cattle and sheep, but they all
died of some tick-carried disease. He then
planted grain, but the crops were destroyed
by rust. However, after long years of trial
and error he made a notable contribution to
the production of that country.
Lord Percival and possibly other Britishers,
as well as Theodore Roosevelt, conducted
big-game hunting expeditions into Kenya and
killed many animals. Of course, the natives
killed a large number of animals too. However, at the beginning of this century it came
to be realized that the wild life of that country did not belong exclusively to the people
of the present generation, that they only
held it in trust, and should account for it
to those who came after them. And so a number of very large areas were set aside as
sanctuaries for wild animals.
We drove into the Nairobi Royal National
Park one afternoon. As we entered we saw
the skull and crossbones of a great prehistoric
animal, with these words of warning beneath
them: "Do not step out of the car." We saw
that the bouses of the wardens and the keepers were surrounded with sheets of tin and
other metal in order to keep the lions from
scratching into them. As we drove along we
saw large herds of zebra in their native state.
We saw giraffes reaching away up to nibble
on the tender leaves of the tall trees. We saw,
striding along close to the car, ostriches, with
beautiful plumes, stepping along with all
the dignity imaginable; and some baboons
jumped right up on the running-board and
then on the hood of the car. The large baboons were carrying little baby baboons in
their arms and begging for food. Along the
banks of the streams were many hundreds of

hippos in groups of twelve to twenty, wallowing in the mud, eating grass and herbs. In one
place the driver of our bus had to stop in
order to let a herd of elephants, in their
native state, pass.
And then the birds! birds we never saw in
this country: the ibis, the Egyptian goose,
the crane, the stork, and a great number of
other birds,-colourful, active, not noticeably
frightened-flying around in great flocks.
One night we spent in a but in Queen Elizabeth Park, and just across the channel the
lions had killed a buffalo and were feasting
on its remains.
Regarding the people of Kenya: there are
about 30,000 Europeans, 90,000 Indians-that
is, people from India-and five and a half
million Africans. In Nairobi is a Moslem
mosque, one of the most beautiful buildings
I have ever seen; and at the end of the day,
when "the sun's rim dips; the stars rush
out: at one stride comes the dark",
we could hear and see the priest giving his
call to prayer from the turrets; and Arabs,
of course, wherever they are, at that time
kneel down and go through their ritual. The
Indian population is largely engaged in trading. They control the entire retail business
of the city, and are going to some extent into
other occupations.
The Europeans, of course, have made the
greatest progress. They have built the Owen
Falls reservoir and dam, which was opened
by our gracious Queen just a few months
before our arrival.
This great work is
situated right at the source of the Nile river,
at the point where the Nile flows out of Lake
Victoria; and the dam will control the waters
of the river which flow north more than a
thousand miles through Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea. Lake Victoria is the largest
natural reservoir in the world. The undertaking has accomplished much, and will prove
a great blessing to the people all along the
banks of the river. It will supply power for
the textile factory, the furniture factory, and
a number of other industries which are there
to process the products of the country-sisal,
cotton, tea, coffee, pyrethrum and other crops
-for export.
Most of the Europeans, of course, drive
English cars, although we saw a few Fords
and General Motors automobiles. They live
in good stone houses and seem to be very
prosperous.
The five and a half million Africans live
under very different conditions. To build a
bouse they drive cedar posts into the ground
to enclose a circle, and put on a grass roof;
and they are well content to live in such
habitations and carry on their ordinary

SENATE
occupations from them. For the greater part
of the time they live outside, and go inside
only to sleep. The women seem to do all
the work. As one goes along the roads it is
a common sight to see a woman marching
along with purposeful gait, carrying on ber
head a large bundle of wood or a big basket
of produce, and sometimes, also, a baby
attached to her back by a blanket, while the
man with ber carries no burden, and
possibly even rides a bicycle. A great many
of the children are naked. The adults are
scantily clad, perhaps with an old shawl or
something of that kind pinned around them.
Hotel waiters wear large white gowns with
red or blue sashes; and some of the women,
particularly the younger ones, are fond of
dressing in gaudily coloured clothing.
Now to discuss the land. In driving from
Nairobi, the most interesting place we stopped
at was the great Rift Valley. The valley is
an enormous geographical fault. It starts in
the Middle East, extends to the Red Sea and
continues through a large part of Africa.
Standing at the edge of this valley you can
look down two or three thousand feet and
see the tops of trees and the roofs of houses.
The inhabitants of the valley, which, where
we surveyed it, was from twenty to thirty
miles wide, own cattle, but about the only
use they make of them is to insert a hollow
needle in their necks and drain off the blood
for drinking purposes.
Throughout our travels in Kenya we were
greatly impressed with the beautiful flowers
which grew everywhere. In the fields one
sees acacia trees and Dandy flame trees
covered with bright-coloured blossoms; and
large and very colourful poinsettias in many
places. Many cattle and goats are to be seen,
the cattle with humps on their backs. Higher
up in the mountains the plantations of tea
and coffee, but the best-paying farm operation is the production of pyrethrum-that
little flower whose blossoms are used all over
the world to make insecticide. It so happens
that, to pick the ripened beans of the coffee
plant, the tender leaves on the tea plantations, and the blossoms of the pyrethrum a
great deal of hand labour is necessary; and
it is on these tasks that most of the natives
are employed.
The natural scenery is very striking. One
sees the Kenya mountains rising to a height
of 17,000 feet, and in the distance the Mountains of the Moon, on which rest clouds in
formations the like of which are seen nowhere else on earth. Altogether the land is
one of striking beauty.
But it is a land of turmoil. I shall endeavour to explain some of the difficulties which

are so evident in that country. In 1952 the
Kenyan African Union drew up a petition
and, as the country is a British Crown
Colony and Protectorate, the petition was
sent to the government in England. The petition alleged that a large area of the most
fertile land in Kenya has been transferred
to European residents without adequate compensation to the natives, who, because their
own reserves were incapable of supporting
them, were forced into the cities and towns
to work for small wages as labourers.
On the other hand, it should be pointed
out that the British occupation of Kenya
was a great philanthropic achievement, and
a review of conditions in that country prior
to the occupation will disclose what has been
accomplished. Before the turn of this century
the slave trade was thriving in Kenya, the
slaves being forced to drag heavy carts laden
with produce from the inland centres to
Mombasa on the coast. In those days there
were many tribal wars, the victors taking
the vanquished and selling them in bondage
to the Arabs. The villages were also raided
by huge Arab caravans, and at one time as
many as 10,000 natives were captured as
slaves, and the bones of another 10,000 were
found along the caravan route. Conditions
generally were terrible and the people suffered from periodic famines and pestilence.
The natives did not produce their own food,
and they did not know how to preserve what
they obtained. The infant mortality rate was
exceedingly high, and there were epidemics.
While it is true that a white reserve of
12,000 square miles was set aside, 9,000
square miles of it had never been occupied,
and the remaining 3,000 were only partially
occupied. In 1932 the whole situation was
investigated by the Carter Commission, and
it was thought that enough additional land
had been provided for the natives. But, of
course, the grievance still continues.
Over the years many changes have taken
place in Kenya. The population has increased
with the development of agriculture and the
adoption of new health measures. Famines
are a thing of the past and to a great extent
tribal wars have been stolpped. Kenya's advance was really spurred by a railway built
by the British at a cost of £8 million from
the coast to Uganda.
A system of plural marriages has also been
responsible for increased population. When
a boy becomes of a marriageable age his parents take some cattle and sheep and buy him
a wife. After a young couple have been
married for a number of years and have a
few children, they decide that another wife
should be acquired, and if the husband is a
good provider he may have three or four

JANUARY 20. 1955
wives in the same or separate huts; but the
first wife always remains the queen bee, so to
speak, and the subsequent wives are more or
less ber servants.
Conditions in Kenya have improved generally with the coming of the Europeans, but
the natives claim that the latter have exploited them. They say, "The Europeans have
taught us to close our eyes in prayer, but
when our eyes are closed they take our land."
The natives believe a good many things of
this kind. While some European industrialists might have profited in Kenya, another
class of European has gone into the country
without any idea of making financial profit.
I refer to the missionaries who have devoted
many years of their lives to trying to teach
Christianity to the natives. They have found
this to be difficult, because the people are
easily influenced by pagan superstitions, mysticism and witchcraft. It has been difficult to
get enough white school teachers to go to
Kenya, but despite this fact the number of
children attending schools there increased
from 100,000 in 1950 to 350,000 in 1954.
Welfare centres have been established, and
we visited one which contained several fine
buildings. The welfare workers follow the
practice of inviting ten or twelve tribal chiefs
to a centre to be taught some arithmetic,
veterinary science, agriculture and carpentry.
Each chief brings a wife who is taugt how
to do laundry work, cooking and housekeeping. The idea is that the chiefs and their
wives will spread what they learn amongst
their villagers.
Since 1952 many atrocities have been committed in Kenya by the Man Maus, a segment
of a large and warlike tribe known as the
Kikuyu. Totalling anywhere from 100,000 to
200,000 in number, the Mau Maus are scattered in groups or cells in the hilly areas
surrounding Nairobi, the capital city, and a
type of warfare is constantly going on. The
first morning we reached Kenya a man was
shot by the Mau Maus right in the streets of
Nairobi, and the next morning somebody discovered that the caretaker of the golf club
had been murdered and that everything that
bad been lying around loose on the premises
had been stolen. Over one weekend alone
eighty-seven casualties were reported, and a
little school in the mountains not far from
Nairobi was burned and the teacher badly
beaten, although he managed to escape.
The atrocities which have been perpetrated
by the Mau Maus since 1952 disclose that a
very definite pattern bas been followed. In
the first place, the Mau Maus are wreaking
vengeance on what they call the moderates,
native Africans who wish to settle their
grievances by negotiation and without

violence. The Mau Maus are particularly
cruel to these people. They wish, of course,
to drive the white people into the sea, and to
burn the schools and destroy the cultivated
fields. They hamstring and destroy the
cattle whenever they can. They are antiwhite, anti-religious and pro-primitive; it is
their terrible oath that holds them together.
I have seen it, and I can assure you that it
is the most awful document you could
imagine. When a man takes the Mau Mau
oath be pledges that, if be is ordered to bring
back the head of a white person and he fails
to do so, be will give up his life. If be is
called at night naked to do something, he
will remain naked until that is accomplished,
or give up his life. If someone steals from a
European he will protect the thief. He will
drive the whites out, and will steal arms,
when he can, so as to hide the deed. He
will not attend mission schools or religious
services, and if his leader, Jomo Kenyetta, is
arrested, be will follow up and release him.
If he hears anything about Jomo Kenyetta
he will at once tell the council about it. The
oath binds the Mau Maus, because they are
superstitious and fear to break it, and, consequently they are scattered throughout the
hills, not living in one camp, but in different
cells and at different places.
I had the opportunity, with two or three
others, of going through a detention camp
where there are 1,500 Mau Maus. The leader
of the camp gave us a little talk, and then
each of us was given a guide and allowed to
go through the camp. The detainees were
divided into two groups, those who would
co-operate and those who would not. The
co-operative ones would help in working on
the roads and building huts and keeping
things clean, in return for which they were
granted a certain number of hours each day
to attend school and try to receive an education. But about half of the inmates were
unco-operative.
As we walked along we
could see them behind the bars; they wolfed
their food, would not keep clean, were savage
in action and appearance, and certainly
savage in thought; they were detained in that
camp because they had not yet come to trial.
Only three centuries ago those people lived in
absolute savagery; the women gathered food
and bore the burdens, as well as bearing the
children, while the men had the status of
warriors, were the heroes of tribal wars, but
would not settle down to work.
I wish to review the grievances of which
the natives complain. First, there is the
white reservation, of which I have already
spoken. They claim further that they are
discriminated against when appointments are
made to the Civil Service, and that if

SENATE
Africans, who are partly educated, do get
appointments their wages are very much
lower than those paid to whites. It did seem
to us that their wages were very, very low.
They also claim that they cannot get effective
representation in the Legislative Council.
This Council is composed of 26 men to assist
the Governor, who, of course, is appointed
by the Colonial Secretary. The 51 million
blacks elect six representatives to the
Council; the 90,000 Indians elect six, and the
30,000 Europeans elect fourteen. So it will
be seen that the natives have not a very
effective representation. Britain, however,
is the protector of that country and must, of
course, control its policy. Probably these
people have a grievance, but if so they are
definitely going about the correction of it
in the wrong way.
A somewhat similar situation existed in
Western Canada in its early history, when
it was without law enforcement, when the
life and property of the traders and the
early pioneers were not protected, and murders and massacres occurred. But after the
Northwest Mounted Police went in, punishment for the commission of crime became
sure and swift, and that splendid body
gained the confidence of the people; in fact,
a great Indian chief said, "These policemen
come to protect us, as the feathers protect
the birds from the frost of winter." And
twice when the American Sioux offered to
come in and drive the whites out of that
country the Indians would not agree to their
doing so, and would not join them.
It is to be hoped, honourable senators, that
a similar control will be exercised over those
savage and warlike people in Kenya who
have caused so much trouble during the last
few years. Of course, methods of control
have been tried: pamphlets have been
dropped, and magistrates have been given
the power to impose very severe sentences.
One magistrate said to me: "We cannot convict these people, because we are unable to
get evidence against them; those 1,500 detainees will never come to trial." He told me
that one day in court he was hearing the
evidence of a witness who had actually seen
a murder committed; court was adjourned
for half an hour or longer for luncheon, and
the witness never appeared again, but his
body was found in a neighbouring stream a
few days later.
In dealing with people to whom murder
is honourable, and pillage and robbery are
ennobling, in a country where tribal warfare
and feuds have long been traditional, it will
readily be seen how difficult life is for
Europeans there.

Before closing, I should like to express a
word of thanks to the Governor and the
Council of Kenya for the splendid arrangements made for our visit, and for the cordial
hospitality and welcome extended to us.
One of the most pleasant features of the
whole trip was the opportunity of meeting
members of parliament from fifty different
Commonwealth countries. We became well
acquainted with them and enjoyed varied
and interesting discussions. Among them were
cabinet ministers and ex-cabinet ministers
from Great Britain, and members of parliament from Australia and New Zealand and
other countries of the Commonwealth.
I should also like to pay a tribute to the
nurses, doctors, teachers and missionaries
who are contributing unselfish services in the
hope of doing some real good. They do not
feel at home in Africa; it seems that visions
of their childhood are ever before them, and
they long to get back to the homes which
they left. They do not wish to bring up their
children in that country. They are doing a
great work, but some of them fear that the
whites will be driven out of the country,
because primitive people there as elsewhere
are rising to assert their rights as they see
them.
Of course, all the actual conference discussions are on record. I think the people
of Kenya realize that the Commonwealth
representatives
understand the situation
more clearly than they did before their
visit. It is the hope of all that the blacks
and the whites will be able to exist together
in happiness and co-operation. As one delegate put it, "You can play on the black keys
of a piano and produce a tune, and you can
play on the white keys and also produce
a tune; but you can produce a much better
tune if you play on both the black and the
white keys."
It is our hope that prosperity and happiness
will, before long, come to that smiling land
of Kenya.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. McDonald, the
debate was adjourned.
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
DOCUMENTS ON ACCESSION TO NORTH
ATLANTIC TREATY

On the motion to adjourn:
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, earlier in the sitting today the honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) asked me if I could have copies of

JANUARY 20, 1955
the Paris Agreements made available to
honourable members. I stated I was under
the impression that I had recently tabled
these documents. I now find that the Agreements and the Protocol on the accession of
the Federal Republic of Germany to the
North Atlantic Treaty were tabled here on
January 11, but were not printed in our
records. However, the Protocol was printed
as an appendix to the House of Commons
Hansard of January 11, and the Agreements
were printed as an addendum to the Votes
and Proceedings of that house on January 19.
I wish to thank the honourable senator from
Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) for

bringing to my attention the fact that these
documents were printed in the records of the
House of Commons.
Is it the wish of honourable senators to
have both the Protocol and the Agreements
printed in our Hansard or Minutes of the
Proceedings of this day?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Then I would ask,
with leave of the house, that these documents be printed as an appendix to our
Minutes of the Proceedings of this day.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Thank you.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday,

Robert Burns, Scotland's beloved national
poet.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Reid: Robert Burns was born on
the 25th of January, 1759. No man gave more
songs or poems to the world than he did.
Thomas Carlyle said that when Scots and
their descendants forget Burns, history will
have forgotten Scotland.
The people of no other country of the size
of Scotland have given more to Canada than
have those from that land overseas. I might
add that the people who have been able to
create peace and harmony between the Lowlander and the Highlander will certainly contribute a great deal towards helping to unite
the various races in this country, with their
different characteristics.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Reid: I am not going to speak
further on the contributions of the Scottish
people to Canada. My purpose in rising was
to pay a tribute to Robert Burns, and to
point out that he enunciated a prophecy
which I think it would be well for us and
al the people of the world, in fact, to recall:
Then let us pray that come it may,
As come it will for a' that,
That sense and worth, o'er all the earth,
Shall bear the gree and a' that.
For a' that, and a' that,
It's coming yet for a' that,
That man to man the world o'er,
Shall brithers be for a' that.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I am sure we all agree with the sentiments
expressed by the honourable senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid). I am sure
also that he could further honour the day by
giving us a special program on the bagpipes
when the sitting is over.

loss of last season's crop. It costs a lot of
money to grow a crop of fruit, and to have it
wiped out overnight means a serious loss to
those people, but somehow they have a way
of making the best of things and even now
they are beginning to plan for the production
of an even better crop than last year, if that
is possible.
One reason why the loss was so quickly
assessed and dealt with so far as our Government felt that public funds could be used,
was that our authorities had a most efficient
committee to handle the matter, of which
the honourable senator from Milford-Hants
(Hon. Mr. Hawkins) was chairman.
With an increased home market and our
main market in Britain again open to us, I
believe that there is an encouraging outlook
for orchardists who will produce best quality
dessert fruit by adopting the most improved
scientific methods, by always remembering to
keep costs to the minimum and by marketing
so as to return to the growers the largest
percentage possible of the consumer's dollar.
F.A.O., or the Food and Agriculture Organization, has stated that although for the second
season in succession world food production
has.continued to rise faster than the increase
in population, yet we have continued shortages and widespread malnutrition in some
regions, with surpluses in others. Canada
has undoubtedly done well and accomplished
much by assistance through the Colombo
Plan, and we are pleased to hear there is a
suggestion that our aid will be increased to
assist countries, mainly in South-East Asia,
where not sufficient food is produced to feed
their people. I do hope that this most beneficial aid that is being given through the
Colombo Plan may be increased by sending
our trained and practical men to the extent
that their valuable services can be used to
advantage, and by sending equipment required
to help these people provide themselves with
the staff of life. Let us continue, and even
speed up, this good work. Places nearer
home, in the Caribbean area, could be helped
under a Colombo Plan to remain free of communism.
I cannot think of a more effective means of
keeping communism from spreading further
than by providing, in co-operation with the
churches, favourable conditions which would
give the people of the free nations who need
assistance a new hope and faith in the future.
I would do even more, if a practical method
of doing it could be found. The nations that
have surpluses, and can afford the expense,
should sell those surpluses, at prices which
the recipients could afford to pay, to countries
where there are undernourished people. In
some cases it might be necessary to make an

outright gift of food. The United States has
already adopted this course to a limited
extent.
In adopting this policy, the free nations
possessing surpluses would not only be doing
something humane and practical in the fight
against communism but would be helping
their primary producers in the marketing of
their surplus products. I must admit that
I do not know all the objections-if there
are real honest objections-to such a scheme,
yet I cannot but think that we should give
earnest consideration to this plan. Some of
our people have suggested that we do even
more, and I think we should honestly consider what they propose, namely, that those
members of NATO which can possibly do so,
now that some reduction of their defence
expenditures seems feasible, should take at
least part of the money thus saved, and use
it to increase the amount made available
under the Colombo Plan, with the hope that
the discouraged view of life which is fostered
by undernourishment, idleness and depraved
conditions will be more speedily reduced.
Those of us who believe that this last
suggestion merits serious consideration are
not actuated wholly by unselfish motives, for
we, with many others, though we would enjoy
a speedy reduction of taxation, feel that it
might bring a larger and more permanent
reduction in taxes, even though delayed, if
the money were used to do all that may be
practical in arresting the further spread of
communism and in making it possible for
those nations that are in danger of losing
their great freedoms, not only to successfully
resist this menace, but to more speedily
improve their standards of living. Although,
as the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) said here on Wednesday last, our defences must be kept strong,
we cannot defeat communism by arms alone.
There are a couple of other items to which
I wish briefly to refer and which I did not
include when dictating the contents of this
talk. With the permission of honourable senators I will mention them at this point.
First, the rearming of Germany. I realize
that this matter will be discussed in detail
here tomorrow, but as I am on my feet perhaps I may express in a very few words,
and without arguing for or against the proposals, my feelings concerning it. I believe,
honourable members, that although we fear
in some degree the rearming of Western
Germany, we would have even more cause to
dread the consequences of not having a
rearmed Germany. Therefore I shall follow
the advice of the minister and of those who
have given more study to the problem than
I have, and vote for the Paris Agreements.

JANUARY 25, 1955
As regards the other item, that of the
dominion-provincial agreement, I would like
to take this opportunity to congratulate the
Prime Minister and his colleagues upon the
seemingly very fair and impartial temporary
solution of the vexed and delicate federal
and provincial income tax problem. Honourable members appreciate, as I do, that it
was not easy to find an alternative to the
federal and provincial income tax agreement
to which nine provinces have consented, and
which one of our larger provinces has felt it
cannot accept. A method had to be found
whereby no province would be unable to
share the wealth given to other provinces;
yet it was necessary to have a solution which,
while as generous as possible to the provinces, would not cripple the resources of the
national treasury.
I hope that after all our urgent demands,
including further aid to the Colombo Plan,
have been satisfied, it will not be long before
the Government is able to take at least a
first step to bring our income tax exemptions
in line with those of Quebec. Also-if I may
reiterate a hope I have expressed before on
the floor of this house-I trust that our Postmaster General can arrange with the postal
authorities of the United States to make uniform the postage rates, in respect both of
air and land transportation, between the two
countries. I am sure that no person would
be more pleased if effect could be given to
these two proposals than the Prime Minister
and the Minister of Finance.
Leaders throughout Europe and the United
States are saying encouraging things these
days about our growing and progressive
nation. Believe it or not, it is only in our
own country that one finds pessimists taking
the place of enthusiasts, at home and elsewhere, in their expressions concerning Canada and its future. An editorial in the
London Times of September 11 last, under
the -title "Young and Lusty", notes that "the
place of Canadian development during the
past decade has been tremendous".
It seems to me that the record performance
of our housing industry demonstrates our
continued progress. The Minister of Public
Works, who is also Minister of National
Housing, reported in a year-end review that
"New Housing Starts, in 1954, including conversions, will be between 110,000 and 115,000,
and completions, between 104,000 and 108,000."
This will represent a substantial margin of
increase over any previous year in our history.
The present rate of starts is on an even
higher level. If one allows for the average
seasonal variation, it is in excess of 120,000
bouses per year, or about 400 houses started
every working day of the year. Starts of new
50437-5à

dwellings in October alone last year numbered
12,600, an increase of 22 per cent over October
the previous year. Besides the growth of
population the continual rise in income
among many of our citizens and the satisfactory supply of building materials, it would
seem that some of the changes made in the
National Housing Act last session are having
a beneficial effect. At the end of last year
there were 65,000 to 70,000 dwellings under
construction, a considerable increase over the
previous year's carryover. If no new commitments at all were forthcoming in 1955, we
would still be assured of a larger number of
new houses added to our stock than in any
year up to 1946. Under the circumstances it
is difficult to imagine anything but an increase
in completions for this year. We are thankful to the banks that have approached the
problem of establishing a sufficient number
of homes for our people in a spirit of co-operation, and their entry into the mortgage field
has provided a gratifying impetus to house
building. We wish Dr. Bates, the new President of Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the continued success, of his predecessor in this very important work.
May I just take time enough to introduce
another important problem; that is, how can
more of our voters be encouraged to properly
appreciate and accept their duty as good citizens in exercising their franchise, not only
willingly, but at the same time help in keeping election expenses to the minimum?
This is a subject which it would be much
easier to discuss if I were a member of
another place; but I am discussing it here
because I think it is most important that
serious thought should be given to it now
as there will likely be only two more sessions
before the next general election. This will
not allow more time than is necessary for a
thorough study in committee and to have
adequate amendments made to our act. I
would like also to say that if any fault is
found by anyone for my discussing this topic
here, I shall have to take ail the blame, as
no one knew that I was going to say anything
about it.
I am aware that some honourable members
of the Senate and probably more of the other
place will think that I am presumptuous in
bringing this matter up in the Senate; but
because of its great importance may I ask you
and them to overlook my boldness and interest in a subject which more properly belongs
in a House of Commons debate. There seems
to be less found in Hansard under this topic
than under other subjects of anything like its
great importance.
Although there was keen interest taken in
the issues of the last election, campaign, it is

SENATE
to be regretted that on the average more than
thirty voters in each of every one hundred
voters who had the privilege and duty to cast
ballots, did not put first things first and vote.
For all Canada the average percentage of
electors on the list who voted was 67. In
other words, 33 people out of every hundred
who had their names on the list stayed away
from the polls for one reason or another.
Those of you who have read about compulsory voting in Australia will know that
the number of people there who do not vote
because of illness or absence from the country
amounts to 7, 8 or 9 per cent. This indicates
that there is no known excuse for about 25
per cent of the eligible voters who do not turn
out at the polling booths to exercise their
franchise in this country.
The record by provinces of the percentage
of electors on the list who voted is as follows:
Ontario, 67; Quebec, 69; Nova Scotia, 72; New
Brunswick, 78; Newfoundland, 57. I am sorry
to say this is the lowest percentage in the
whole country. Prince Edward Island is to
be congratulated upon having had the largest
turnout of any province, 83 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Grant: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: If the other provinces
had done as well as Prince Edward Island I
would not be raising this question tonight.
The percentages in the remaining provinces
were: Manitoba, 59; British Columbia, 65;
Saskatchewan, 74; Alberta, 63; and the Yukon
and Mackenzie River, 69. As I mentioned
before, the average for the whole of Canada
was 67 per cent.
More is being done by the press, radio and
television than ever before to create an interest in public affairs, and they should be congratulated and thanked for the very competent
work that was done by their personnel in the
election campaign of 1953 as well as between
elections. It is to be regretted that interest
in political meetings is on the wane in many
constituencies. Joint public debates used to
be a most effective way of arousing the
interest of voters.
Should not this study of civics be given
more time and attention in our institutions of
learning? Are our normal colleges and universities employing the most competent
instructors in this all important subject of
civics that treats of citizenship and the relations between citizens and the Government?
Are our public schools instilling into the minds
of our youth the interest and respect that they
should have to enable them to become good
citizens? I think that question has to be
answered in the negative, for a recent poll
disclosed that only one out of every three
school children can name a single member of
the Government and describe what his work is.

A person cannot truly be said to be a good
citizen if he or she does not take interest
enough to become acquainted with public
issues of the day and take advantage of their
privilege and discharge their responsibility of
exercising their franchise.
It seems to me that we could develop a
greater interest in public affairs by having
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation record
and broadcast at appropriate times the
speeches of Government and Opposition
leaders in important parliamentary debates.
I hope the length of speeches will be reduced
in another place by at least ten minutes, for
it would be a mistake to broadcast too long
speeches.
I would like to commend those responsible
for televising the program when we had the
privilege of hearing President Eisenhower in
November 1953, and for televising the opening of this session of parliament.
We, as members of the Senate and Parliament, have a great responsibility in this
matter of encouraging greater interest in
public affairs if we are to deserve fully the
respect and interest of the public. All honourable members, I feel sure, would agree that
we should make certain that we are doing
our full duty by helping to make the Senate
an even more useful and democratic institution than it has been, if that is possible. But,
I will not now take the time to repeat my
views on this question, as I am already on
record.
Much more could be said on how best to
arouse greater interest in public affairs and
in Parliament, but I trust that the suggestions
I have made may encourage other honourable
members to give us the benefit of their views
on this important topic.
Now, honourable members, though time
does not permit, and I would not wish to
weary you with an exhaustive review of my
reading and thoughts regarding the seemingly increasing cost of elections, and what if
anything can be done to remedy the present
unfortunate situation in far too many of our
constituencies, I desire to say enough to
encourage further discussion and, I hope,
some action which will halt the increasing
cost of elections, as noted from declared
election expenses, which is the only source of
information available, aside from hearsay
or personal knowledge.
Although I cannot prove misuse of funds
at election time, many candidates will frankly
admit the high cost of elections, while others
hesitate to do so. In too few cases election
expenses have not increased. Many criticisms
are heard from citizens who earnestly desire
to arrest this evil, and they are asking if
something cannot be done to assure us all

JANUARY 25, 1955
that future elections will be carried on without the expenditure of so much money and
possibly the consequent transgression of the
law. I would hope that more constituencies
could follow the fine example set by some of
our ridings in the last election, where, I am
told, the minimum was spent for election
purposes. If this could be done, more of our
best citizens would be encouraged to take
a greater interest in public affairs. This is
a problem which Opposition parties are probably as anxious as we are to assist in doing
everything that can be accomplished, and
therefore they would be pleased to help make
a thorough study of our Elections Act, with
a hope that helpful amendments might be
made.
After having first written this talk, in
which I requested a study of the Elections
Act, I was pleased to note that the Government had given Notice of Motion that the
Standing Committee on Privileges and Elections be instructed to study the Act and suggest to the house such amendments as the
Committee deems advisable. I am in hopes
that these remarks of mine will help a little
in bringing it to the attention of committee
members that we are greatly interested in
their important work, and I hope that after
a very thorough study they may be able
to suggest some adequate amendments to the
Act which will ensure, as far as legislation
can do so, that future elections will be conducted with expenditure of funds curtailed
to legitimate purposes such as advertising,
rentals of halls, the use of radio and television, etc.
The British North America Act created
our Parliament by the simple assertion that:
There shall be one Parliament for Canada,
consisting of the Queen, an upper house styled
the Senate, and the House of Commons.

Subsequent clauses of this Act established the
privileges of the two houses; the number of
members each was to have; the constituencies
which were to return members for the first
Parliament; the electoral machinery and franchise which were to be used until Parliament decided otherwise; and the officials
who were to have charge of the machinery.
The British North America Act did little
more than to establish our Parliament as a
going concern, and arrangements for the first
general election were made. But for all
elections of the future the whole representative system, from the periodic adjustment of
constituency boundaries to post-election trials
for corruption at the polls, was provided for
in terms which gave Parliament a wide discretion to alter it at will.
Professor Norman Ward, in his book The
Canadian House of Commons Representation,

states that the first few decades after Confederation were years of bitter struggle over
election laws and that general reform of the
electoral machinery in the public interest was
a literal impossibility until well after the turn
of the century.
A review of the reports of Special Committees appointed to study the Dominion Elections
Act, with the co-operation of the former and
present Chief Electoral Officers of Canada,
shows that seemingly reasonably adequate
provisions of the law have been recommended
and adopted by Parliament for the correction
of election abuses; but Mr. Ward states"these provisions have been uniformly disobeyed". He further states--"the tale is one
of quiet but thorough law-breaking in practice, and of genteel but persistent hypocrisy
in utterance".
Although I have read everything that I can
find dealing with registration and compulsory
voting as it is carried on in the Commonwealth of Australia, where through compulsory voting legisIation they have raised from
59 per cent to 91 per cent the number of
enrolled voters exercising their franchise, it
would seem to me that we should only adopt
this principle of compulsion as a last resort,
and only then with the unanimous agreement
of all parties.
Probably honourable senators know that
the first compulsory voting legislation was
passed by the State of Queensland. The
Australian federal Government passed a
similar Act in 1924, and the last State of the
Commonwealth of Australia to adopt the legislation did so during World War II.
I trust that we can make a determined
effort to encourage larger numbers of our
citizens to take a greater interest in public
affairs, with the sincere hope that more and
more in succeeding elections will willingly
discharge their responsibility in exercising
their franchise, and do it gladly without any
special inducement, which tends to increase
the cost of elections. Let us make certain
again, after the latest experience which we
have had, that the provisions of the Elections
Act are adequate to meet the needs.
We certainly must realize that it would not
be desirable for election expenses to become
so large that only the more wealthy of our
people could affordto be candidates, and
without doubt it would not be in Canada's
best interests to select our candidates from
the class of people who have nothing to lose.
We do not mean to exclude, of course, the
occasional young man or woman who has not
had tme since leaving school to engage in
his or her profession for long, but who may

SENATE

have other qualifications which would make
such a person a very useful member of Parliament.
This plea has been made in the sincere
belief that it is in the best interests of our
nation, our constituents and candidates. What
if it fails and nothing more can be done by
legislation? Then I have enough faith in our
people, when properly aroused to the danger,
to correct it themselves, by parties getting
together and determining to have their elections contested fairly and honestly, as should
be done in any case, without being forced to
do right by law. If there is abuse, it seems to
me that one party is as much to blame as the
other.
Realizing, as I am certain all members of
Parliament do, how vital it is to retain this
great freedom of the secret ballot, let us with
renewed vigour endeavour to inculcate a
greater patriotism in young Canada, so that
our citizens will be glad to demonstrate their
love and zeal for Canada by more and more of
them showing an increased concern in matters of public interest, and showing that they
are good citizens by going to the polls and
without restraint voting for the candidates of
their choice.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Horner, the debate
was adjourned.
NORTHLAND INCIDENT
SURVIVAL OF ESKIMO PARTY
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable

senators,

may I call attention to a recent incident in
our far northland which to me is one of the
most amazing stories of survival I have ever
heard. I refer to the nine Eskimos who were
cast adrift on an ice-floe and without blankets
or equipment survived for some seventeen
days. Rescue planes flew back and forth
across the area, but because of the fog no
trace of the lost men could be found. They
had been given up for lost when one day they
walked into their own village.
To me this amazing story is proof of what
strong and courageous men can do in the face
of untold hardship. It is a lesson to us to
face whatever we may be called upon to face,
whether it be serious illness or great danger,
with a calm and determined spirit. I pay
tribute to the strength and courage of these
men.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

CRIMINAL CODE
JOINT COMMITTEE ON CERTAIN QUESTIONS
OF CRIMINAL LAW-SENATE MEMBERSHIP
The Senate proceeded to consideration of a
message from the House of Commons regarding the appointing of a Joint Committee of
both Houses of Parliament to inquire into
and report upon the question whether the
criminal law of Canada relating to (a) capital
punishment, (b) corporal punishment or (c)
lotteries should be amended in any respect,
and, if so, in what manner and to what extent.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved:
That the Senate do unite with the House of
Commons in the appointment of a Joint Committee of both houses of Parliament to inquire
into and report upon the questions whether the
criminal law of Canada relating to (a) capital
punishment,
(b)
corporal punishment or
(c)
lotteries, should be amended in any respect and,
if so, in what manner and to what extent.
That the following senators be appointed on
behalf of the Senate on the said joint committee,
namely, the Honourable Senators Aseltine, Bouffard,
Farris, Fergusson, Hayden, Roebuck, Veniot and
Vien.
That the committee have power to appoint, from
among its members, such subcommittees as may be
deemed advisable or necessary.
That the minutes of the proceedings and the
evidence of the special committee appointed last
session to inquire into and report upon the foregoing questions, together with all papers and
records laid before it, be referred to the said
committee.
That the committee have power to print such
papers and evidence from day to day as may be
ordered by the committee for the use of the
committee and of Parliament.
That the committee have power to send for
persons, papers and records; to sit while the Senate
is sitting and to report to the Senate from time to
time.
That the committee have power to engage the
services of counsel.
That a message be sent to the House of Commons
to inform that house accordingly.

He said: Honourable senators will recall
that at the last session of Parliament a joint
committee of both houses was appointed to
inquire into three branches of the criminal
law, namely, capital punishment, corporal
punishment and lotteries, and that that
committee made considerable progress in its
study of these three important subjects.
Assuming that the members of this bouse
who served on the committee last session are
again prepared to undertake the task, I think
they should be reappointed to continue the
studies undertaken by that committee.
I

have suggested that the name of Senator

Vien be substituted for Senator Beauregard,
who passed away during the recess.
I am very proud, honourable senators,
that the Senate representation on this joint
committee has been composed of outstanding
men of wide experience.
Hon. Mr. Euler:

And women.

JANUARY 25, 1955
Hon. Mr. Macdonald:
I shall mention
their names. The first is that of Senator
Aseltine, who has had wide experience in
the practice of law and for ten years was
chairman of the Divorce Committee of this
house. Senator Bouffard is an eminent
counsel, a former Batonnier of the Quebec
bar, and a man eminently qualified to serve
on the committee. Senator Farris was at
one time Attorney General of the province
of British Columbia. I need not remind
honourable senators of the numerous important cases in which he has appeared in Canadian courts, and the many occasions on
which he has represented the Government
and private clients before the Privy Council.
Senator Hayden comes from Toronto, and
is recognized as one of the leaders of the
He performed yeoman
Bar in Ontario.
service for his country in connection with
the revision of the Criminal Code. Senator
Roebuck, who also comes from Toronto, has
had an extensive practice in both civil and
criminal law, and was for a number of years
Attorney General of the province of Ontario.
Another senator who served the committee
last session was Senator Veniot, a doctor
with a wide experience in medical practice.
I am sure honourable senators agree that
there should be a medical man on this committee. Senator Fergusson, who was at one
time a practising lawyer, has in recent years
headed the social service branch of the
Government of New Brunswick. She brings
with her a very wide experience.
The late Senator Beauregard was well
known and highly respected as a member of
thé Bar of the province of Quebec, with an
extensive practice in the city of Montreal.
To replace him on the committee I am suggesting the name of another well-known
senator from the city of Montreal, Senator
Vien. For a number of years Senator Vien
was a member of the House of Commons; he
served for a time as Deputy Speaker of that
house and later as Speaker of this house. He
has practised law extensively in the city of
Montreal, and has had wide experience in
meeting the people of Canada.
As I have said, honourable senators, I am
very proud of the representation that the
Senate had on this joint committee last year.
Indeed, I do not think it would be possible
to draw from any other legislative body men
and women of such high calibre. I have much
pleasure in nominating them, together with
Senator Vien, to serve on the joint committee
this session.
I have just been reminded, honourable
senators, that in my reference to the senators
who served on the committee last year I overlooked the Honourable Mrs. Hodges. We in

this house were justifiably proud of the fact
that two of our lady senators were members
of that committee. In the motion that has
been handed to me tonight the name of the
Honourable Mrs. Hodges has been omitted.
She was a very faithful member of the committee.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not need to recall
to you her qualifications, for I mentioned some
of them the other day when I congratulated
her on the excellent speech she made in moving the Address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne. To the list of members mentioned already may I add the name of Senator
Hodges, and express my regret that it was
omitted from the motion.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, I
have no fault to find with what the Leader
of the Senate has said with regard to the
abilities of the senators nominated for this
committee we are discussing. Last year I
rose when a similar report was made because
at that time, I think, it was not proposed to
have on the committee a single lay member,
if I may so describe anyone who does not
belong to the legal profession. Among the
members of the legal profession mentioned in
the present motion are men of very great
ability in the practice of law, and they did
a splendid job last year as a subcommittee
in dealing with the technicalities of the
Criminal Code revision that was then before
the Senate. But consideration of the subjectmatter to be gone into by this proposed joint
committee does not particularly require the
knowledge and special ability that were so
valuable on that subcommittee. The joint
committee is being set up to deal with the
question of corporal punishment, and the
advisability of continuing or discontinuing
the penalty of capital punishment, and also to
consider whether we should permit the holding of lotteries or not. I contend that men
and women of ordinary intelligence can deal
with these things and that no special legal
training whatever is necessary for the purpose.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am not trying to get on
that committee, by the way. My point is this,
that while perhaps there should be some
lawyers on the committee, I do not think
lawyers have as good qualifications for a consideration of these questions as have ordinary
men and women possessed of plain common
sense. I do believe that this committee might
very well be composed of a little larger admixture of just ordinary fellows, like the
senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)
and others who are not members of the legal

JANUARY 25, 1955
Unlike my honourable friend f rom Waterloo (HIon. Mr. Euler), I have a great respect
for lawyers.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I rise ta a point of order.
Han. Mr. Haig: I think lawyers contribute
sowething because of their professional
experience.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I would like ta correct
my friend. I said nothing at all derogatory
of lawyers; in fact, I appraise them very
highly. I only contended that they have no
special qualifications for this particular job.
Hon. Mr. Haig: 1 amn not so sure of that.
Hon. Mr. Euler: You said sa yourself.
Han. Mr. Haig: There are in my city, and
fia doubt elsewhere, quite a few prasecutians
in connection with lotteries. Lawyers are
engaged in ail these cases, and their knowledge of what causes people ta participate in
lotteries is helpful in any consideration of the
subi ect. However, under aur jurisprudence,
the final decisian an these questions is made
by laymen, and 1 do not think that we should
admit technicalities in a consideration of these
matters in the Senate, of all places. I notice
that the honourable senatar from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen), who is reputedly a
lawyer of very hîgh standing, is not an the
committee. Perhaps hie has been absent too
frequently of late, but I feel better because
af his exclusion, since I also have not found
a place an the committee.

I recognize the fine character of the men
and womnen in the legal profession and the
tremnendous contribution they maIre to the
111e of our country. Frequently in aur city,
and noa doubt elsewhere, they are chosen
to be candidates for public office, chiefly
because they possess a training which some
others may not have had. But the issues

in reply ta the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), may I say that
last year the members of this committee
conducted their work very faithfully and taok
it very seriously. I have not the recoýd

occasions. They gat a little mare than haîf

as already constituted, with Senatar Vien
replacîng the late Senator Beauregard, should
be allowed ta finish its work. I think it is
far better that the same members continue
with and conclude their program than that,

SENATE
now they are two-thirds of the way through,
a new committee should be substituted.
May I add that the name of the honourable
leader of the Opposition was not included this
year because, he may remember, he suggested last year that his desk-mate, the
honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Alsetine), should take his place. I
accepted his suggestion, as I accept all his
suggestions, very gladly, and the name of
the honourable senator from Rosetown appears in the list before the house this year.
So, to conclude, and in spite of what has
been said, I am of the opinion that the committee of honourable senators which started
its work should be allowed to finish its work.

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I would amend my
motion by moving:
That in addition to the senators named in the

McDonald be appointed on behalf of the Senate

The Senate representatives on the joint
committee would then be the Honourable
Senators Aseltine, Bouffard, Farris, Ferguson,

organization of democratic countries along or
near the Atlantic-an organization of these
countries for defensive purposes and also
having non-military aspects. We take NATO
for granted these days, but we are apt ta
forget its origin.
1 arn sure that everyone is familiar with
the quotation "A prophet is not; without
honour save in his own country". Indeed,
Canadians are prone ta, look abroad either
to America or Great Britain for leadership in
international aiffairs. But I would remind
members of tis bouse that it was none
other than aur own Prime Minister, the
Right Honourable Mr. St. Laurent, with bis
characteristic clairvoyance, who first envisaged the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: You will recaîl the
reluctance of Russian representatives at the
United Nations ta approve enforcement provisions for palicing decisions of that organizatian. Mr. St. Laurent was the first ta point
out that defensive alliances among member
nations of this world group would not only
be passible within the framework of the
United Nations, but would probably become
bath desirable and necessary. Speaking on
behaif of the Canadian Delegation at the
General Assembly on September 8, 1947, he
said:
Nations, in their searcli far peace and caaperation. will flot and cannot accept indeftnitely
an unaltered council which was set up ta ensure
their security. and which, sa many feel, has
becamne frozen in futility and divided by dissension. If forced, they may seek greater safety
in an association af democratic and peace-loving
states wilng to accept mare specific international
obligations in return for a greater measure of
national security. Such associations. it has already
been painted out, if consistent with the principles
and purposes of the charter, can be formed within
the United Nations. It is to be hoped that such
a development will nat be necessary. If. it is unnecesary it will be most undesirable. If, hawever.
it is made necessary, it wiU have ta take place.

On a subsequent occasion Mr. St. Laurent
stated as follows:
The best guarantee of peace taday ls the creation
and preservatian by the nations of the free warld.
under the leadership of Great Britain, the United
States and France, of an overwhelmidng prepanderance of force over any adversary or possible
combination of adversaries. This farce must not
be only military, it must be ecanomic; It must be
moral.

0f course, those opposing the formation of
the new Atlantic Union pointed to it as evidence of failure by the United Nations and
urged that ta adopt tis measure would be
ta undermine the Worid Organization, and
that within its framework alone should be
preserved the freedom of ail nations, that is,
within the framework of the United Nations.

How wrong they were and how right Mr. St.
Laurent! Without this bulwark of defenoe
put up by the members of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, we might have already
experienced domination and possible annihilation by the forces of evil aligned against us.
I arn sure I shail be forgiven if I digress
momentarily at this time to remind you of
the magnificent contribution made by the
Minister of External Aiffairs, the Honourable
Mr. Pearson, both as President of the United
Nations and as spokesman for Canada in the
councils of the world. As the honourable the
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
pointed out sa recently, Canada can make a
worthwhile contribution in resolving international differences because, of ail nations,
we have neither an axe to grind, nar territorial desnands. Mr. Pearson, speaking for
Canada, bas succeeded in making our position clear, and deserves our complete confidence and gratitude.
It is also with pride that I refer to the
splendid raie played by the Honourable Paul
Martin as leader of Canada's delegation at
the United Nations during the past year. I
arn sure that bis plea for disarmament and
his active support of bis "'atoms for peace"
program has fired the imagination of everyone
in this chamber and that he deserves the
highest commendation for bis contribution to
a lasting and long-sought peace for mankind.
But now to return to consideration of the
matter before us.
A f ew years ago it was f elt that another
organization, not entirely apart from and
certainly in co-operation with NATO, should
be set up. I refer to the European Defence
Community, commonly known as EDC. As
its name implies, tis was intended to be
an organization of continental European countries banded together primarily for their
own defence.
Honourable members of the Senate will
recaîl that in 1952 the Parliament of Canada
considered and approved a protocol to the
North Atlantic Treaty extending to the members of tbe proposed European Defence Comrnunity the guarantees of mutual assistance
contained in the treaty. At that time the
Senate was given an opportunity to, examine
the important issues involved under the EDC
arrangements for associating the Federal
Republic of Germany and Italy with the
West, and in particular the implications for
Canada of approving the protocol to the
North Atlantic Treaty then before the Senate.
That was an important step for Canada to
take, not only because it would have extended
the area of our cornmitments under NATO
but because iA implied Canadian support for

SENATE
the EDC approach to the problems of Euro*pean unity and defence. The United Kingdom did not agree to be a party to this
organization. France also hesitated; and you
will recall that last fall, when it was pro.posed that Germany should be rearmed and
become part of EDC, France refused to go
along with that proposal, and the protocol,
which was approved in June 1952, never
came into force. The free world was greatly
alarmed and feared for any effective defence of Europe, and in certain quarters it
was seriously proposed that the United States
of America should "go it alone". This course
I think we all feel, would have been most
undesirable and unsatisfactory even if it
could have been effective.
Uppermost in our minds was the danger
that impatience and misunderstanding of
France's position on the part of ber allies
might have lead to separate direct arrangements with the Federal Republic, excluding
France. In addition the possibility existed
that in the Federal Republic the fruits of
Chancellor Adenauer's successful efforts to
encourage a wide measure of support for
his policy of friendly co-operation with
France and other free European nations
might give way to a narrow nationalist outlook and general cynicism. Here on this
continent disappointment was coupled in
the minds of some with a growing attraction
towards either continental or bilateral defence arrangements stemming from belief that
North American defences would of themselves suffice to protect our security and permit an almost exclusive reliance on the
concept of massive retaliation.
These dangers-and they were real dangers-accompanied the demise of EDC and
threatened the very existence of NATO. In
such a perilous situation, Canada welcomed
the initiative taken by the United Kingdom
whose refusal to join the EDC had increased
French unwillingness to accept the treaty.
It was with a profound feeling of admiration
and kinship in a common cause that we in
Canada followed the untiring efforts of the
United Kingdom Foreign Secretary, Sir
Anthony Eden, as he mustered support in
the main European capitals for a new
approach to the problems arising from the
failure of EDC.
In the latter part of September of last
year the countries signatory to the proposed
EDC, along with the United Kingdom, the
United States and Canada, met in conference
at London and worked out the broad lines
of an agreement for associating the Federal
Republic of Germany with the Western Community on a basis of equality. This conference also proposed measures to unify the

European democracies and to build up a
defensive structure in which all these
democracies would share. These agreements
were later worked out in detail and were
subsequently signed in Paris on October 23,
1954.
The protocol which is before the Senate for
approval is one important element in this
general settlement, all parts of which are
inter-related. They may be divided into four
main groups: a group of four-power agreements concerning the restoration of sovereignty to the German Federal Republic and
providing for the presence of foreign forces
in the Federal Republic; a group of sevenpower agreements providing for the reconstitution of the Brussels Treaty Organization
to include the Federal Republic of Germany
in a Western European Union; a NATO
protocol providing for the admission of the
Federal Republic and resolutions designed to
strengthen the NATO structure; and a
Franco-German agreement on the Saar.
May I point out some of the main features
of these agreements.
First, it should be noted that the Federal
Republic of Germany functions as an equal
partner in the Western coalition but, I would
emphasize, that this does not preclude the
eventual unification of Germany. In fact,
the NATO members subscribed to the following:
A peace settlement for the whole of Germany
freely negotiated between Germany and her former
enemies, which should lay the foundation of a
lasting peace, remains an essential aim of theirthat is, the three powers'-policy.
The final
determination of the boundaries of Germany must
await such a settIement.

And further:
The achievement through peaceful means of a
fully free and unified Germany remains a fundamental goal of their policy.

I am sure honourable senators would agree

that this statement of policy provides a firm
response to any who may maintain that,
in their efforts to bring the Federal Republic
into the Western Community, the Western
powers have lost sight of the ultimate aim
of unification and a peace treaty for Germany. As I shall point out later, the other
members of NATO subsequently associated
themselves with this declaration, which also
dealt with other important points of substance.
Secondly, the agreements actually provide
for a moderated version of the structure based
on the Brussels agreement of 1948. When
these agreements go into effect we shall have
what will be known as the Western European
Union and for abbreviation, referred to as
WEU. This will include the members of the

JANUARY 26, 1955
Brussels organization, namely, the United
Kingdom, France, Belgium, The Netherlands
and Luxembourg, to which will be added
Italy and the Federal Republie of Germany.
One of the main differences is that the United
Kingdom is included in the Western European
Union and that she has pledged herself to
provide an army of four divisions and the
second tactical air force on the continent of
Europe for another forty-four years.
The Council of WEU will sit in London, and
the Armament Control Agency in Paris, where
it will work in close co-operation with the
NATO Secretariat and, for carrying out its
duties, will use, to the greatest possible extent,
NATO personnel.
I should now like to refer specifically to the
right of Germany to rearm, and to point out
the manner in which it is limited and controlled. It was proposed under EDC and it
is agreed under WEU that Germany is to be
permitted to have a maximum number of
500,000 men under arms and these are to be
organized into not more than twelve divisions.
Her air force power is to be defensive only
and is to consist of 1,350 fighter aircraft.
This number cannot be increased without the
unanimous consent of WEU.
These forces of the Federal Republic of
Germany when constituted are to be brought
under the Supreme Allied Commander in
Europe known as SACEUR and are to be
integrated into the NATO forces. Contrary to
what has been suggested in some quarters,
there is to be no separate national army apart
from NATO and I shall repeat, no separate
German army apart from that which will be
under the Supreme Allied Commander in
Europe. Germany will also be dependent on
NATO for what is known as logistic support,
which includes such vital things as fuel, pipelines, transportation, communication facilities
and airfields.
There is also a provision which prohibits
Germany from manufacturing certain weapons of war, such as atomic, biological or
mechanical weapons, nor are they permitted
to manufacture long-range aircraft and guided
missiles, mines, large warships and bomber
aircraft and these provisions cannot be
changed except on the request of the Supreme
Allied Commander in Europe and approved
by a two-thirds majority of the Western
European Union Council. There is also a
provision for inspecting the national plants.
It will thus be seen that an effective system
of armament control has been set up within
the Brussels Treaty but at the same time
making the most effective use of the NATO
machinery which, as I shall explain later,
has been considerably strengthened to buttress
and supplement the control measures under

the Brussels Treaty. Together the arrangements under both treaties provide pretty substantial safeguards against independent military action on the part of Germany, whose
rearmament has awakened so many vivid and
recent memories of the Hitler war. On the
other hand, one must not forget that German
rearmament is a normal development in the
resumption of sovereignty. It is much better
that it take place in the West-it has long
been in existence in the Russian-controlled
zone of Germany-under controls which are
found in these agreements. In this connection, we cannot fail to recognize the crucial
importance of the historic commitment on
the part of the United Kingdom to retain on
the continent of Europe during the duration
of the Brussels Treaty the present effective
strength of its land and air forces stationed
there-four divisions and the Second Tactícal
Air Force. This undertaking, combined with
the Federal Republic's self-denyin g ban on
the production of atomic, biological, chemical
and certain heavy weapons and the French
decision to agree to German membership In
NATO, decisions all involving important
sacrifices of national prerogatives, helped to
make agreement possible.
You may ask what effect these new NATO
measures will have on Canadian forces in
Europe and, even more important what the
effect will be upon our existing commitments
of the entry of the Federal Republic of Germany into NATO, the protocol concerning
which the house is being asked to approve.
On the first point, I think I can say with some
assurance that none of the measures for
strengthening SACEUR's powers and for
increasing the mutual inter-dependence of
forces is likely to make any difference to
Canada in practice. The lst Canadian Infantry Brigade in the Federal Republic is already
closely integrated within the British Army of
the Rhine, and the lst Canadian Air Division
within the 4th Allied Tactical Air Force along
with United States and French Units.
Furthermore, it has always been assumed
that our units would be subject to this overall
authority in military matters and that any
movement of our forces would take place as
part of agreed NATO strategy. It is most
unlikely that we would have ever contemplated using these forces without consulting
NATO.
With respect to the second question, I might
explain that the situation as far as Canada is
concerned is similar to that which arose in
June 1952, when the Senate approved the
NATO protocol extending to all members of
EDC the assistance guarantee of the North
Atlantic Treaty. At that time it was pointed

SENATE
out that, since the Federal Republic was the
only member of the EDC not a member of
NATO, the effect of the protocol was to
extend the obligations which Canada had
undertaken under the North Atlantic Treaty
to the Federal Republic of Germany. It was
emphasized, however, that the extension of
our obligations was more theoretical than
real, because under article 6 of the North
Atlantic Treaty we were already under an
obligation to come to the assistance of the
NATO forces stationed in the German Federal
Republic. If that protocol had come into
effect it would have extended that obligation
to include an attack on the Federal Republic
itself. Similarly, in this case, by approving
this protocol, Canada will have, when it comes
into force, an obligation beyond those previously existing by virtue of article 6, in that
we shall be committed to treat as an attack on
Canada any attack on the territory of the
Federal Republic of Germany.
In addition to the obligations it will assume
as a member of NATO, the German Federal
Republic, in a special declaration made by
Chancellor Adenauer at the London Conference, has solemnly undertaken to conduct its
policies in accordance with the principles of
the United Nations Charter, although it is not
at present a member of the United Nations, to
refrain from any action inconsistent with the
strictly defensive character of the North
Atlantic and Brussels Treaties and-this is
important-never to have recourse to force to
achieve the reunification of Germany or the
modification of the present boundaries of the
German Federal Republic. These are reassuring promises on the part of the young
German Republic with which Canada has
entered into increasingly close and friendly
relations in recent years. They are promises
which, on the basis of our experience with the
only freely-constituted government of Germany, we have reason to expect will be kept.
They are promises, moreover, which have
been undèrwritten by the Three Occupying
Powers, by their declaration at the London
Conference, and by the other NATO countries, including Canada, by their resolution of
association adopted later in Paris. The relevant section of the three-power declaration is
as follows:
They (Le. the three powers) will regard as a
threat to their own peace and safety any recourse
to force which In violation by the principles of the
United Nations Charter threatens the integrity and
unity of the Atlantic Alliance or its defensive
purposes. In the event of any such action, the
three governments, for their part, will consider
the offending government as having forfeited its
rights to any guarantee and any military assistance provided for in the North Atlantic Treaty
and its protocols. They will act in accordance with
article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty with a view
to taking other measures which may be appropriate.

This, honourable senators would, I think
agree, is a clear warning to all the members
of NATO including the Federal Republic
that if any party to the treaty violates its
defensive undertakings, or takes any steps
to alter by force the present boundaries of
any member of the alliance or modify the
present situation, it would forfeit any benefits or any assistance it is entitled to under
the North Atlantic Treaty.
In addition to the two points I have just
covered, I think I should make it clear to
the honourable senators-and this is a very
important matter, upon which I have been
questioned, from time to time, outside of this
house that the Canadian Government did not
undertake, at either the London or the Paris
meetings, any new commitments to keep
Canadian forces in Europe at any given level
or for any given period.
As I mentioned earlier, the agreements,
resolutions and declarations of policy constitute one settlement and it is difflcult to
divorce any part from the whole, for virtually all are interrelated. There is another
outstanding issue which was resolved in
Paris, and because of its crucial importance
to the position of France and the Federal
Republic as parties to all the other agreements must be considered as an integral part
of the settlement as a whole, although it was
not formally on the agenda of the London or
Paris meetings. I refer to the Franco-German
agreement on the Saar, which was finally
concluded only a few hours before the other
agreements were signed in Paris.

The prob-

lem of this territory, which has been for so
long the source of differences between France
and Germany, can now be settled, I sincerely
trust, to the satisfaction of both countries
and the benefit of the territory itself. At the
moment there is evidence to suggest that
some further clarification of the views of the
two governments directly concerned is required, but I have confidence that the spirit
of amity and understanding which characterized the London and Paris meetings will
continue to prevail and bring about a final
meeting of minds on this question.
Now, honourable senators, I know that it
is very difficult for many of us to contemplate a rearmed Germany. Those of us who
served in either or both of the last two World
Wars know what hardships were inflicted
on the great mass of the people, and of the
pain and suffering which many of our comrades underwent, and the loss of loved ones
which many suffered through the ruthlessness of the German war lords. On the other
hand, we know that this type of German is
not the average German citizen, but rather

JANUARY 26, 1955
of the nature of the Germans who have immigrated to Canada and whom we count
amongst our most worthy and loyal citizens.
We all have friends of German extraction
and we know them to be of the highest
integrity, of great industry and men whose
words are as good as their bond. Given the
proper leadership, I am confident that the
young men and women in Germany will
develop into the same type of citizen as their
countrymen have become in Canada. That
must be our aim if we are to have peace in
the world. That aim cannot be attained if
we allow a condition to prevail in that country which will be increasingly resented by
and unfriendly to the Allied nations.
I am convinced that the alternative to
rearming Germany can only result in complete disaster to those whose aim is universal
peace. It is impossible under present circumstances to keep Germany disarmed and
neutralized for ever. The Germans are a
dynamic, powerful and proud people numbering 50 million, in the heart of Europe. The
suggestion that they should be kept disarmed
and neutralized for ever is completely impractical. The present occupational arrangements cannot continue for ever. On the
contrary, to give her unconditional sovereignty at the present time might be disastrous, but to admit her into the Western
European Union and to the Atlantic system
under the provisions and limitations which
I have set forth is the best possible means
of having her as one of our allies. In this
manner we accept her into the society of
free democracies, where she rightly belongs,
instead of driving her into the communistic
camp, which is contrary to her natural
philosophy. Proof of her feeling in this
regard is seen in the fact that in the recent
elections in West Germany the Communists
polled only 2.7 per cent of the total vote.
Honourable senators, it is my sincere conviction that all Canadians should warmly
welcome these agreements which associate
the German Federal Republic with the West
in a manner which constitutes a new advance
in the development of the Atlantic community
and a notable strengthening of the security
of free men everywhere. Most important,
perhaps, these agreements, reached only as a
result of often exacting compromises of
national interests on the part of the states
most directly concerned, preserve the unity
and confidence of the North Atlantic Alliance
during a most crucial period in its history.
The dark clouds of disillusionment and
despair which arose on the Western horizon
following the collapse of EDC have given
way to hope and a growing feeling of mutual
confidence' and trust both in Europe and on
this side of the Atlantic. The agreements

have strengthened the bonds binding ourselves and our large neighbour to the south
to our allies in Western Europe, and have
resulted in renewed prospects for continuing
transatlantie co-operation both with respect
to defence and to non-military matters. In
addition, they provide a firm foundation for
unity and strength from which I am convinced it will prove possible to work towards
an easing of international tension and the
removal of the differences which divide the
world today.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
may I ask a question of the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)? In his remarks he did not indicate
the stage at which the proceedings now
stand and what action has yet to be taken
to confirm the agreements with France, Germany and any other countries in the NATO
alliance. Could he give us any information
on that point?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I do not have information as to what stage
has been reached in the procedure respecting
these agreements with the other countries.
This protocol must be presented to the legislative bodies of the different nations concerned and be agreed upon by them. While
I do not know what further is required of
the other countries, I do know that as far as
Canada is concerned we felt this protocol had
to be approved by Parliament before the
next step could be taken. It is for that
reason that I now present it for ratification
by this house.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I
do not intend to follow the line pursued by
the honourable Leader of the Government
and review the historical background of the
agreements, as he bas quite properly done,
nor shall I go into as much detail on the
subject as I did when I spoke on the Address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne.
However, there are one or two 'remarks I
should like to make about the proceedings at
this stage.
The decision to ratify the agreements and
thereby allow Germany to rearm is a very
grave decision for the people of Canada to
have to make. We cannot forget that Canada
took her part in fighting a war in 1914-18
against the German people, for almost every
one of us had relatives who fought in that
war, some of whom never came back. No
less can we forget the war of 1939-45, which
is even fresher in our memories, and which
again required the service, and in some cases
the lives, of some of our relatives.

SENATE
As a, third milestone in this history of
events involving the German people, we as
members of the Canadian Parliament cannot
forget that during the Second World War we
deliberately took the side of Russia in ber
fight against Germany. All honourable senators who were members of this house at
that time felt that we were taking the right
side in that struggle, but, rightly or wrongly,
we along with the members of the other
house were prepared deliberately to take
the stand on the side of Russia against
Germany.
Now that the tables have turned, there
is no use in people pointing the finger at one
of us and saying: "Weren't you one of the
men who in 1942 voted to help Russia in
ber fight against Germany? And now you have
Russia on your hands." To that question I
would have to reply in the affirmative, but
I would hasten to point out that for the
representatives of the people in Parliament
that was no easy decision to make. We
were familiar with the history of Russia
throughout the Czar regime and afterwards,
yet we were prepared calmly and deliberately
to decide that from our standpoint in world
affairs at that day it was better for us to
ally ourselves with Russia than with Germany. Whether we were right or wrong in
that decision, I repeat, we did it with our
eyes open, and let no one say that their
representatives in Parliament were not well
aware of the fateful decision they were called
upon to make. There was no clear road
to follow; we had to decide in our own
hearts and minds what was best in the interests of the world as a whole, and particularly in the interests of Canada.
In our debate on the subject now before
us we are bound to recall these incidents
I have recited. If your brother, son or some
other relative was killed in the First World
War or in the Second World War, or was
one of the airmen who were shot while
prisoners of war in Germany, there is little
use of your trying to forget the history of
our struggles against Germany.
In the world today we are faced with
dilemmas more than at any other period of
time in our history. Since 1912, starting with
the sinking of the Titanic, we have had one
disaster after another, and today we seem
to be right in the centre of more of them.
However, we must do the best we can to
meet conditions as they develop.
Let me mention some other places in the
world that are in trouble. France, which is
situated close to Germany, and was until
recently one of the great powers of Europe,
is very much divided. The Premier of

France, Mr. Mendes-France, with consummate skill and judgment, has steered his
measures through the French Parliament,
and this in the face of a dwindling majority
right from the start. That is the situation be
has fa-ced right along. Certainly, one may
say, if the vote of the communist members
is left out of the picture he had a large
majority for his measures, but it must be
remembered that the communist members
are there, that they were elected by the
people, and form part of the Parliament of
that country.
In the consideration of this resolution,
however, here is a point that disturbs me:
as we are 2,000 or 3,000 miles away from
France, is our judgment as to what Germany
will do in the next twenty-five years as good
as the judgment of the French people? I
believe that is a question that also troubles
many other men and women in this country.
I understand there are certain gentlemen
in this Parliament-and I will not say to
what branch of Parliament they belong-who
are against approving the protocol. However,
I am convinced that the best judgment I -can
employ, as a senator from the province of
Manitoba and as leader of my party, is this
-and I think it is in the interest of Canada,
the interest of the free world and the interest of humanity as a whole-that we
should ratify these agreements with Germany and help if possible to bring freedom
to all the people of the world.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Now, I have one criticism
that I want to make of the Government. I
made it the other day when referring to the
United Nations, but I will repeat it. We are
just a new country in the field of world
affairs, but in the last twenty years we have
become more and more involved in them, to
the extent that we need an expanding
Department of External Affairs to look after
our interests in that field. However, I believe
that we do not give as much emphasis to
nonpartisan policies in foreign affairs as we
ought to. I have heard a good deal of criticism of the United States, but I was agreeably surprised the other day at the support
which the President of that country received
for a message that be sent to both houses of
Congress. On a division in the House of
Representatives there were 409 votes in
favour of his recommendation and only 3
against it.
Now, let me pause right here and make
a comment. That convinced me that those
men and women in the House of Representatives were familiar with the problem that the
President was dealing with. No person can

JANUARY 26, 1955
form a reasoned judgment about something
unless he or she knows all the facts concerning it-not just the transitory facts, but
the facts in relation to the period during
which the matter in question has existed. I
do not think that we can blame'our government for lack of information here, but I am
blaming it for what I think is the introduction of too much governmental responsibility
in the Department of External Affairs.
I feel there would be no opposition in
Canada to the ratification of these agreements
if the issues were clearly and completely
understood by all our people. Perhaps you
will say, "See here, Haig, you are wrong,
for the communists will influence some people
to vote against this agreement." My honourable friend who sits next to me (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) received a letter the other day
from a lady in Ottawa, and he showed it
to me as if he had just received a prized
communication. I remarked at the time
"Well, my dear Walter, I am glad your wife
is not here to see you getting that kind of
mail. However, I received yesterday a copy
of this letter which came to you today, so
you are only number two on the list, not
number one." The signature on each was
exactly the same. I only mention this to
show the kind of campaign we are up against.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What was in the letter?
Hon. Mr. Haig: All the reasons why we
should vote against the ratification of these
agreements, and thus vote in favour of the
Russians. The writer said that they are the
peace-loving people, who will save the world
for democracy if only we will vote against
ratification of the protocol, against the German people, or words to that effect. The
letter covered a whole page of closely typed
text. I thought I was the only one to whom
it was sent, until I found out that the senator
from Rosetown got a copy.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: She did not write to
the Liberals.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That illustrates the situation that we have in Canada today. In my
circle of acquaintances in western Canada I
can count families who lost a boy or two boys
in the last war, and I know of one family
that lost three. At the time of the First Great
War, in 1917, I spoke at a public meeting,
and I asked the chairman not to read the
second verse of God Save the King, because
the candidate running for the Opposition had,
by that year, lost three of his sons, and they
had been buried in France. People cannot
forget such things.
However, on taking all these matters into
consideration I believe that the cause of freedom and the cause of democracy will be

better served by our ratifying these agreements than by our voting against them. I
feel sure that the members in another place
who apparently are going to vote against
these agreements will regret so doing in the
years to come. Their action will be a mark
against them personally-I do not mean
publicly, but inwardly they will wish they
had voted the other way.
I know that the second chamber in France
has not ratified the agreements yet. Germany
also bas not ratified them yet, and may not
ratify them, so we may be doing something
here to no purpose. But I am still prepared
to go through with it and vote in favour of
the protocol.
The people of Canada place a trust in us,
believing that men or women who become
senators have something to give to the country that cannot be given in any other way.
I am persuaded that in the discharge of our
duty we should vote for this resolution, in the
hope that thereby we shall help to widen the
boundaries of the free world.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators.
the resolution now before the Senate asks us
to approve of the international agreements
which were reached at Paris in October of
last year. As the honourable the Leader of
the House (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) said. and
I think nobody will disagree with him, this
is one of the most important and in fact
one of the most vital things that this bouse
has had to consider for some years past.
This resolution and these agreements are
being submitted to us in the Parliament of
Canada because Canada is one of the parties
to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
set up in 1949, generally referred to as NATO.
What. in essence, do these agreements contain? They provide for four things. Firstly,
they establish a new community of the peoples
of Western Europe under the name of "Western European Union". Secondly, they provide
for the admission to NATO of the West German Republic. Thirdly, they create a basis
for lasting French-German co-operation.
Fourthly, they introduce the West German
Republic as a free partner in a free community of nations.
One might inquire how these aims have
been achieved. As bas been explained by
the Leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), this bas
been done by modifying the Brussels Treaty
of 1948 by admitting, as parties to that treaty,
Germany and Italy, and, in effect, making
the Brussels Treaty as so modified a part of
NATO. The original parties to that treaty
were the European allies in the last war. The
documents which we are now asked to approve

SENATE
appear in detail as an appendix to the
Minutes of the Proceedings of this bouse of
January 20 last; and I think I should read
to honourable members the declaration made
by the original members of the Brussels
Treaty, inviting Italy and Germany to become
partners:
The governments of Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom,
parties ta the Brussels Treaty of March the 17th,
1948 for collaboration in economic, social and
cultural matters and for legitimate collective selfdefence;
Aware that the principles underlying the association created by the Brussels Treaty are also
recognised and applied by the Federal Republic
of Germany and Italy;
Noting with satisfaction that their devotion ta
peace and their allegiance ta democratic institutions constitute common bonds between the countries of Western Europe;
Convinced that an association with the Federal
Republic of Germany and Italy would represent
a new and substantial advance in the direction
already indicated by the treaty;
Decide, in application of article IX of the treaty,
ta invite the Federal Republic of Germany and
Italy ta accede ta this treaty, as modified and
completed . . .

and so forth.
The second document to which I direct the
attention of the Senate is the protocol, or as
one might call it, the agreement entered into
by the original parties to the Brussels Treaty
and the Federal Republic of Germany and
Italy. The text will be found on page 7 of the
appendix. The parties to this agreement are
the heads of states of the original parties to
the Brussels agreement, the President of the
Federal Republic of Germany, and the President of the Italian Republic. In their preamble they say this:
Inspired by a common will ta strengthen peace
and security;
Desirous ta this end of promoting the unity
and of encouraging the progressive integration of
Europe;
Convinced that the accession of the Federal
Republic of Germany and the Italian Republic ta
the treaty will represent a new and substantial
advance towards these aims;
Having taken into consideration the decisions
of the London Conference . . .
Have appointed their Plenipotentiaries: . . .
Have agreed as follows:

And I point out to you that article III of
the agreement regarding military matters
says this:

Canada, and that will be found on .page 25, a
resolution of the North Atlantic Council of
the 22nd of October 1954. I venture to quote
it to the house:
Recognising that all the arrangements arising out
of the London Conference form part of one general
settlement which is directly or indirectly of concern
ta all the NATO powers and has therefore been
submitted ta the Council for information or
decision;
Have learnt with satisfaction of the arrangements
agreed between the Governments of France, the
United Kingdom and the United States of America
and of the Federal Republic of Germany for the
termination of the occupation régime in the Federal
Republic as set forth in the protocol communicated
ta the Council;
Welcome the decision of the Brussels Treaty
Powers ta invite the Federal Republic of Germany
and Italy ta accede ta the Brussels Treaty as
modified and completed-

And so on.
Welcome the extension of the Brussels Treaty
as an important step toward the achievement of
European unity; and express confidence that there
will be the closest co-operation between the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization which remains the foundation of the
security and progress of the Atlantic Community.
Take note with satisfaction of the statements
made on 29th September, 1954, in London by the
United States Secretary of State and the Canadian
Secretary of State for External Affairs, and of the
declaration by the Foreign Secretary of the United
Kingdom concerning the maintenance of United
Kingdom forces on the continent of Europe;
Finally, record their deep satisfaction at the
happy conclusion of all the above arrangements
which together constitute a decisive step in fortifying the North Atlantic Alliance and uniting the
free world.

One final quotation which I want to inflict
upon the house is the declaration made by
Canada as a party to the NATO agreement.
It is to be found on page 30. It is headed
"Canadian Affirmation", and reads as follows:
"As far as we are concerned, the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization remains the focal point of
our participation in collective defence and of our
hope for the development of closer co-operation
with the other peoples of the Atlantic community.
As such, it remains a foundation of Canadian
foreign policy.
While we. emphasize, then, our
belief in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
we welcome the proposed extension of the Brussels
Treaty.
We shall look forward ta a growing
relationship, within the framework of NATO, with
the new Brussels Treaty organization, composed
of countries with whom we are already bound by
such close ties."

That is the sort of skeleton framework upon
which these agreements have been built up.
In brief, the Brussels Treaty as amended
provides for military contributions to their
mutual defence by all the member states.
It controls the armaments and the nature of
the contributions by those states; and it places
in the hands of the Supreme Commander of
NATO in Europe, General Gruenther, farThat is the Brussels Pact end of the treaty. reaching authority in the inspection, direction.

them under the treaty shall work in close cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization".

it is a remarkable advance. It is one to be in good faith. I do not say the same, of

which bas reconciled the Parliament and negligible little communist clique in this

SENATE
country. They are impervious to discussion
of any kind and they simply follow the
instructions given them by their masters in
Moscow.
What are the two principal arguments
against these treaties which are advanced by
their opponents? First of all, they object to
the rearmament of Western Germany because
of the danger of a revival of German militarism. Secondly, they say "Instead of signing these agreements which involve German
rearmament you should make an effort to
settle your differences with Soviet Russia
around the conference table."
I want to deal first of all with this argument against the rearmament of Germany.
I do not intend to deal with the many safeguards against what one might call a runaway
German rearmament which these agreements entail. They have been deait with
very aptly and exhaustively by the Leader
of the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald); but what is the basic reason
for this argument? It is, of course, that the
people who use it fear the recrudescence of
German militarism in its extreme form.
They remember the time of the theory of the
"Master Race" that was destined to conquer
and rule the world. It is only natural that
many of us-in fact, nearly all of us in this
country, and particularly those of us who
fought in either of the two great warsshould view the proposed rearmament of
Germany with some concern.
I am going to advance an argument which
may not appeal to some honourable senators,
but I venture to state that in my belief the
danger of a recrudescence of extreme German
militarism has gone, and that it will not
return. I may be wrong in that statement,
but an examination of European history does
lend support to the view which I have
expressed. After all, the Germans are not
the first people who have threatened and tried
to conquer Europe. In the 16th century the
danger was from the armed might of Spain,
which at that time was by far the strongest
force in Europe, and it reached its apex
when the Armada sailed from the shores of
Spain in the early summer of 1588 to conquer
England. That was the apex of the danger.
But when the Armada was finally sunk and
dispersed, the danger instantly disappeared,
and from that day to this Spain has never
been a military threat to the rest of Europe.
Again, from about the end of the 17th
century to the beginning of the 19th century,
France tried at one time or another to dominate Europe. That was roughly the period
from the reign of Louis XIV to Napoleon;
or to put it into an English context, the time
between Marlborough and Wellington. But

after the final defeat of Napoleon, in 1815,
the French dream of a conquered Europe
died, and it has had no resurrection.
In the same way, I believe we can look
back upon the period from the middle of the
last century to the middle of this century,
the period beginning with Bismarck and ending with Hitler, as the epoch of the attempt
by Germany to dominate Europe. And I
think we may look upon the two world
wars which we have known in our generation,
that is, the war of 1914-1918, and the war
of 1939-1945, as constituting together the
culmination of that attempt. But just as the
dream of Spanish domination died with the
Armada in 1688, and just as the dream of
French domination died on the field of
Waterloo in 1815, so do I believe th.at the
dream of German domination died with
Hitler in the Reich Chancellery in Berlin on
the 29th of April, 1945.
I know it is going to be difficult for us to
accept this view, with our so recent memories
of all the horrors of extreme German militarism, the concentration camps, the massacres, and all the rest of it. And we must
realize that it is going to be even more
difficult for the people of France to accept
that view-the unfortunate people of France,
who have suffered the untold evil of invasion
from Germany three times in the last 85 years.
Nevertheless, I believe what I have said to
be true, and I think that future history will
bear out what I have said. But I will go
further than that. If in the future some race
should attempt to achieve military domination over Europe, which God forbid, I suggest to honourable senators that the danger
will not come from Germany, it will come
from farther east; and if that danger should
ever eventuate, then I suggest that the people
of Germany, by their history, by their
religion, and by the long story of their leadership in European civilization and progress,
will inevitably be on the side of the West.
It is for these reasons, honourable senators,
that I refuse to accept the argument that these
agreements should be rejected because they
provide for the rearmament of Germany, particularly in the limited and controlled way in
which they so provide; and I agree entirely
with what was said last evening by the honourable senator from King's (Hon. Mr.
McDonald), that the danger of not rearming
Germany, in the present condition of Europe,
is far greater than the danger of rearming
Germany.
Now I want to deal, for a few moments,
with the second argument advanced by the
opponents of this resolution. They tell us
that in place of these agreements we should
hold another conference with the leaders of

JANUARY 26, 1955
Soviet Russia in an attempt to settle our differences. In his noble speech in the other
place last week the Secretary of State for
External Affairs gave an extensive history of
the failure of the international conferences
which have been held during the past few
years in an attempt to reach an agreement
with the Soviet Union. It will not be necessary for me to repeat what he said on that
occasion and, indeed, it would be rather presumptuous on my part if I did, but I do want
to deal with this argument in a broader and
more general way.
Remember, these agreements are designed
to strengthen the forces of western democracy in NATO by the rearmament of Western Germany. I believe that those who urge
us to enter into negotiations with the Soviet
as an alternative to approving these agreements fail to realize or do not understand the
basic Russian attitude in international affairs.
It is an attitude which the Russians have
held consistently, whether they have been
ruled by Czar or by Soviet, and examples of
it are spread throughout their history, if you
care to look for them. The Russian attitude
is this: In international relationships they
will respect armed strength and armed
strength alone.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I said there are many
examples of that, and let me offer one or two
of them to the house. The first is an incident,
perhaps minor in its character, but really
rather characteristic, and it will be recalled
by many honourable senators as occurring
toward the end of the last war, during one of
the Allied conferences at which Stalin was
present. Some member or other of the conference referred to what might be the attitude
of the Pope under certain circumstances, and
Stalin immediately came back with the caustic query: "The Pope? How many divisions
has he got?"
The second instance to which I would like
to direct the attention of the house is an
occurrence now long forgotten, but which
I happened to come across only the other
day when I was reading the new Life of
Glad.tone written by Sir Philip Magnus
which, incidentally, is a most delightful and
beautifully written book.
It was in the year 1885. Gladstone was
Prime Minister. General Gordon had just
been murdered at Khartum by the fanatical
followers of the Mahdi, and in response to
a clamorous demand from public opinion in
Great Britain, Gladstone's government had
arranged for a large expeditionary force to
be organized to invade the Sudan and crush
the Mahdi. Seeing, or believing, that British
attention was thus concentrated on the

Valley of the Nile, the Russian Government
of that day thought it saw its opportunity,
and Russian forces invaded Afghanistan, on
the borders of India. Gladstone acted at
once. He countermanded the Sudan expedition. He went down to the House
of Commons and got from that house a special
vote of credit of £11 million, and he announced that the forces of the Empire would
be immediately concentrated to meet the
threat of Russian aggression. The effect was
instantaneous. Faced with that resolute attitude the Russians drew back at once, and
withdrew their troops from Afghanistan.
Now, I should like to give a third example,
which has relation to the happenings in
Europe during the last three or four years.
It cannot be so clearly pinpointed or accurately defined as the other two examples
which I gave, but I think it has its significance in the context of what I am trying
to urge. I think it is generally agreed that
in the last three or four years the danger
of a third great war breaking out in Europe
has diminished to an appreciable extent. We
no longer believe, and the people of Western
Europe no longer believe as they did three
or four years ago, that a Soviet attack upon
the West might take place at almost any
time.
I do not want to be misunderstood. I do
not say that all danger is over. Still less
do I say that we should relax by one jot
or tittle our efforts to strengthen ourselves
and the other western democracies in NATO;
but I do say that the most responsible opinion
in -international political circles holds that
there has been a distinct lessening of tension
in Europe over the past three or four years.
If that be so, honourable senators, I strongly
suspect that the reason for that lessening of
tension has been the very fact that since
1950 NATO has been in existence, and that
under NATO we and our allies of the West
are becoming stronger year by year. That is
a matter which of course is entirely incapable
of proof, but I think it is true and I think
it does support what I have already said.
I could give more examples, but I think
I have given enough in support of what
I say is the general principle followed by
the rulers of Russia, whatever form that
rule may take, that they respect only armed
strength.
Now, if that is admitted, surely that is an
effective answer to those who argue that
before we approve these agreements we
should try once more to negotiate with the
Soviets. I don't disapprove of negotiations.
Negotiate by all means, but, I say, wait until
you can negotiate from strength. Approve

SENATE
these agreements first; get the rearmament
of Germany underway first; negotiate then,
but not before, and your negotiations will
have a far greater prospect of success than
they have today.
Needless to say, honourable senators, in
what I have just said I am not in the least
degree being original. The same thing has
been said over the past two or three months
by every one of the leaders of opinion in
Western Europe who are particularly competent to advise in matters of international
relationships. It has been said by Sir Anthony
Eden, by Dr. Adenauer, by Mr. John Foster
Dulles, by Premier Mendès-France and by our
own Secretary of State for External Affairs.
Now I am sure that this house will be
willing to follow the advice of men such as
these, rather than to accept the opinions of a
few well-meaning but mistaken individuals
in this country who urge a contrary view.
Honourable senators, I have tried to deal,
I hope at not too tedious a length, with the
two arguments advanced against the adoption
of this resolution, namely, the argument
against the rearmament of Germany and the
argument for a conference with the Soviets.
I have done my best to show what I believe
to be the flaws in those two arguments. I
have nothing more to say except to express
the hope, and the confident belief, that this
house will vote unanimously in favour of the
resolution which is now before it.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Joseph A. Bradeite: Honourable senators, as it is not my intention to speak on
the Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne, I hope I am in order at this time
in offering my congratulations to the mover
(Hon. Mrs. Hodges) and the seconder (Hon.
Mr. Tremblay) of the Address. The honourable lady senator from Victoria certainly
lived up to her fine reputation of eloquence
and logic. The same compliment may be
paid to the honourable senator from Lauzon,
who gave a very interesting and practical
speech, into which he injected some of the
Irish wit which he no doubt inherits from
his mother.
I should also like to take this opportunity
to thank the Government for having appointed
as assistant to the Leader of the Government
in this house the honourable senator from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Godbout). I have
already extended felicitations by letter to my
honourable friend on his appointment. I am
confident that he will be of great assistance
not only to the honourable leader in this
house but to the Senate itself. It was my
privilege to observe for a long time his effective work and function as Premier of the

province of Quebec. In that capacity he was
instrumental in having had passed some
courageous and constructive legislation which
will remain for all years to come a monument
to his renown.
I believe, honourable senators, I hold the
distinction of having been the first to prophesy that the honourable senator from
Montarville would become the Premier of
Quebec. Shortly after his appointment as
provincial Minister of Agriculture he was
,chosen by the then Premier, the Honourable
Mr. Taschereau, to make a speech at a special
convention held at Ville Marie, which I also
attended. At that convention, which was
composed for the most part of farmers, my
honourable friend held the audience in the
hollow of his hand for a full half-hour. He
then cautioned himself that he must not
speak too long and thus tire his audience.
They implored him to continue, and he talked
for another ten minutes. Upon my return
from Ville Marie I wrote the Honourable
Mr. Taschereau, saying I was positive that
Mr. Godbout would one day be Premier of
the province. Subsequent events proved that
I had prophesied well.
I offer my honourable friend from Montarville my best wishes for the great success
he merits.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Bradette: Honourable Senators, I
speak to this resolution in all humility, for
I am fully aware of the tremendous international problems that threaten the peace
of the world today. The events involving
Formosa are fresh in our minds. Every
citizen of the democratic world is aware of
the high tension and feelings that exist in
the Eastern hemisphere today, and that it
would take only a spark to start another
conflagration. But Providence must be on
our side, for we believe almost implicitly in
the good judgment and leadership which has
been given to the world by the great republic
to the south of us since the end of the last
war.
When speaking to this resolution, honourable senators, I will try to voice the sentiments of the majority of the people in the
section of the country where I live. I say
this because there are in my district quite a
number of study clubs which have studied
intensively the North Atlantic Treaty and
the protocol on accession of the Federal
Republic of Germany, and in most cases they
came to the conclusion that for the sake of
peace this protocol should be accepted by our
two houses. I am strongly in accord with
such conclusion, which is natural to Canadian
citizens because we have always desired peace

JANUARY 28, 1955
in the world, and more ardently in our time,
as we wonder what humanity is going to do
on the road ahead now that the H-bomb is a
reality. We sincerely hope it is a road that
will take us ultimately to peace. It will
likely be a long road, but we shall have to
travel it, hoping to surmount whatever
obstacles and pitfalls are encountered, however disheartening some of them may be.
There will be many mirages beckoning us to
pleasant oases that do not exist. We shall
have to shun easy illusions, toil through
rough realities, with the hydrogen bomb our
companion and peace our compulsion. To
the present situation there is no alternative.
On the one side there is peace; on the other
side there is death and the destruction of
civilization as we know it at the moment.
Whence the hydrogen bomb? The people
of antiquity had astrologers who studied the
firmament, and tried to discover the influence
of stars on human affairs, but where they
failed, modern man succeeded. He studied
the stars and the sun and saw fusion.
Triumphantly he produced a miniature sun,
capable of destroying great cities and millions
of people. Many of the older civilizations
made the sun a god, but so far we have made
him a terribly destructive devil. How can
we chain the demon? No man and no nation
can yet answer surely, but one thing is
certain, that if all the nations now fully
aware of its immeasurable power realize that
this could be used to bring about the destruction of our world, it could then be turned to
peaceful uses exclusively, in which event it
would becomq a boon, yes a blessing, to mankind.
Certainly we do not want to live for
generations on the brink of a deadly and
fathomless abyss, precariously held by a hair
between life and death. We have to search
as never before for the way to peace. There
are many false ways but ultimately we have
to find, we must find, a true one.
One false way, which is very appealing and
seductive, is the hope for easy, quick disarmament and the outlawry of atomic weapons.
On this matter we are bound to ask ourselves
this question: Is disarmament a mirage? The
record says that it is, and it says so very
distinctly.
In 1898 the Czar of Russia, Nicholas II,
convoked a disarmament conference at The
Hague. I have not the time to go into.detail,
but what resulted from this effort to humanize war? Nothing.
Disarmament was again in the forefront
at the Washington Naval Conference in 1921
and at the London Conference in 1930. Some
limitations were put on the strength or size

89

of the navies of the attending powers, but
the bulk of their fleets remained intact and
fully able to fight-and subsequently they
did fight.
Then came years of discussion by the
League of Nations at Geneva. And what
effect did it have on the size of the armies
that started World War Il? History certainly
does not record any effect whatsoever, yet
the mirage of disarmament survived. In 1946
the delegates to the General Assembly of
the United Nations tried to establish international control of the A-bomb, and kept on
trying in vain for three years. Finally, frustrated both by the problem itself and the
attitude of the delegates from the Soviet
Union, the Assembly gave up the attempt.
Efforts made to control the H-bomb have
been similarly unsuccessful.
It has been well said that disarmament
will not precede peace. It will follow peace.
But how are we going to achieve peace?
Some think that it may be done by the exchange of promises between nations. Such
people need to be reminded of the KelloggBriand Treaty of 1929, which outlawed war
as an instrument of national policy. It was
signed by some 60 nations, including Germany and Japan. Did that pact achieve
peace? It certainly did not; and to rely implicitly on that line of action would not only
be dangerous but might prove to be fatal.
But there are advocates of even a more
drastic method. They would use world force
to capture peace. They would strengthen the
United Nations to such a point as to make
it a world government, possessing an international army to suppress all armed outbreaks.
I draw the attention of honourable senators to article 43 of the United Nations
Charter. It orders each member to agree
with the Security Council to set aside a
quota of its armed forces to be held in
instant readiness to respond to any call by
the Council. This is the paper agreement for
an international army to overcome any
nation that breaks the peace. How many
members have negotiated such an agreement? Not a single one. It became possible
for the democratic countries to send soldiers
to Korea solely because of the fact that
Russia stayed away from the meetings of the
Security Council at which the proposal of
the democratic countries was under consideration. If Russia had vetoed the proposal
it would not have been possible to send to
Korea any forces under the banner of the
United Nations.
What, then, remains? It remains for the
democratically inclined countries to work
together for the ends of peace. We must,

SENATE
however, realize that even at the present
time among ourselves we are not really enjoying peace to the full. We now have two
worlds, two distinct worlds. With all the
genius that has been put into the development of methods of transportation, making
this planet of ours so small, it is horrible to
think that we have two worlds on the same
planet, two worlds just as distinct, one from
the other, as if they were ten million miles
apart.
Even the nations of the free world are
almost continuously engaged in economic conflicts, in political recriminations, in covert or
open distrust. Sometimes we act much as
prima donnas in our dealings with one another. This is so true that in relation to the
protocol we are now debating there has been
much unwarranted criticism, recrimination
and show of temper against France. And
right here I want to compliment the previous
speakers upon the stand they took. As the
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) said,
France has suffered not only in lives but in
resources as well. In the war of 1914 France
lost nearly a generation of men. It has even
been said that most soldiers of France in the
World War II had never known their fathers,
because they had been killed in World War I.
These attacks against France were made when
that great and proud nation was trying to
play the role that she desires to play, which
role was not made any easier by the very
unfair and biased denunciations emanating
from nations that were supposed to be
friendly. Many nations, including Canada,
would have been deeply wounded in their
pride if the same attitude had been adopted
towards them.
For instance, a man very prominent in the
United States Government, who has accomplished notable deeds in the international field,
by-passed France when EDC was rejected by
that country. That was a direct insult to a
truly great nation. France, however, is used
to forgetting and forgiving. So although the
legitimate pride of the French people was
deeply wounded, this incident also was forgiven, primarily for the sake of peace and
unity. I feel certain that the adoption of the
resolution now before the Senate will have
important consequences in promoting the establishment of peace, and it is for that reason
that I so strongly support it.
There is in this country an element that
may be called "Little Canadians". With them,
whatever we do is either too little or too late.
But, speaking from the experience of visits
to various sections of the world since the end
of the last war, I affirm that there is no nation which evokes more feelings of respect
abroad than Canada; for though, numerically
speaking, a small state, Canada has proclaimed

its ideals and shown readiness to make the
sacrifices necessary to maintain those ideals.
When principles of freedom, democracy and
Christianity were in jeopardy, Canadians at
once answered the call to arms. They did not
need to be coaxed into participation either
in World War I or World War II, and they
responded quickly to the call when hostilities
began in Korea. We sought no financial or
territorial aggrandizement. We fought for
idealism, for principles which we cherish,
and we shall not be turned from our purposes by either the leaders of Soviet Russia,
or by those so-called peace advocates in our
own country who pester us with suggestions
that the Canadian people desire war. No
civilized nation desires war; and charges of
war-mongering must be resented by any real
Canadian.
Wars nowadays are not what they used
to be. For one thing, there is the danger
of enormous destruction by the H-bomb. In
the old days, battles were waged by professional armies, by a hired soldiery. Indeed,
centuries ago there was current in France the
phrase la guerre joyeuse-joyous war; and
there, as in other European countries, attacks
were launched for purposes of personal and
national aggrandisement.
But "joyous" is
about the last term one would think of applying to the struggles of the twentieth century. In future, certainly, every citizen will
be conscripted; each man and woman will
have a specific part to play. So to meet the
perils of the coming days, we must be ready,
while seeking peace, to negotiate from
strength, since that is the only language
which our opponents will resp'ect.
We live in very strenuous times. During
the week prior to Christmas, when a motion
to ratify the pact was defeated in the French
house, we had good reason to be a little
fearful. Nevertheless we should try to understand the situation. Those who followed the
reports on the radio learned something of
the tremendous demonstrations by communists, who in thousands and tens of thousands,
paraded around the headquarters of the
National Assembly. Supporting them was the
influence of hundreds of thousands of French
men and women, veterans of two wars, mutilated soldiers and sailors, and people who had
lost their all in those terrible struggles,
remembering the German armies of occupation and demanding that Germany be not
allowed to rearm. Happily, a sounder judgment finally prevailed. Some have said that
the majority of twenty-seven deputies for
ratification was not enough. But, considering
the complications of politics in the French
National Assembly, the fact that ninety communists voted solidly against the agreement,

JANUARY 26, 1955
and that many non-communist deputies abstained from voting at ail, I regard the majority as a comparatively large one. I beieve
that its decision will be respected by France
and the French people, as it always has been
in the past. When it was known, we al
became immediately elated, because we knew
it would make our cause stronger than ever
before.
As the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) and other speakers
have reminded us, dread of Germany has
been prevalent for a long time, and with
good reason. But we must consider the situation as it is today. Let us reflect that for
centuries our two great motherlands, Great
Britain and France were figbting nearly al
the time. Althougb separated by no more
than a little branch of the sea, in nearly
every decade these fine peoples spiiled their
blood in confiict with each other. But since
the entente cordiale was established at the
beginning of the century there has been no
friendsbip firmer than theirs. Again, in World
War I Turkey was our opponent; in the last
war the Turkish people supported the Allies.
In recent days Chancellor Herr Adenauer has
given outstanding leadership; he bas proved
himself a great statesman, a real friend of
democracy, and a courageous leader, who is
also a great admirer of France. I believe
that under these auspices Germany will play
her full role in the attainment of a final
peace in our time.
The fact that Great Britain bas abandoned
ils isolationist policies has bighly elated the
Allies. Her reluctance to do so was only
natural, in view of the special relationship in
whicb she and the other members of the
Commonwealth stand to one another, and the
virtual impossibility of agreeing beforehand
on what tbey will do in any emergency. But
the declaration made by Sir Anthony Eden
gave beart and hope to France and other
Western European nations. I arn convinced
that if Britain had coinmitted berself in the
critical days before Worid War I to participation by the side of France, the Kaiser would
neyer have dared to attack tbat country; for
when he discovered, after bis invasion of
Belgium, that Britain bad determined to enter
the war against hlm, he realized that his was
a lost cause. A similar example of British
hesitancy occurred before the war of 1939:
at tbat tinie the United Kingdom Cabinet
warned France that if Frencb troops aided
Czecboslovakia against the German invasion
she wouid not be supported by Britain. This
decision, I believe, was a main factor in determining Hitler to send bis armies against the
Czecbs. But again, German aggression was
eventually defeated by Britain's determinalion to resist hlm to tbe last man and the

last woman. I must pay tribute to the leadership of that great country at that time. In
the matter of leadership, ail tbrougb ber bistory, Britain bas been well served. One bas
only to look at the etcbings of those masterful
Prime Ministers wbicb adorn the corridor
leading to the Parliamentary restaurant, to
realize how wonderfully fortunate she bas
Unfortunately for
been in this respect.
France, 1939 produced no Clemenceau, but,
bappily for Great Britain, it produced a
Churchill. Mr. Churchill did a magnificent
job, and was, I believe one of the greatest
factors in the winning of the last war, because
even during the darkest bours be neyer lost
the hope of ultimate victory for our cause.
Let me now say a few words about Germany, having reference to some features of
this protocol. Article I of the scbedule states
that the three powers wiil terminate the
occupation regime in Western Germany,
revoke the occupation statute, and abolisb the
offices of the land commissioners. The Federai
Republic is accorded "the full autbority of a
sovereign state over its internai and externai
ai! airs."
That is a message wbicb every German
will fully understand. It will do mucb to
free tbe bearts and souls of the people and to
increase their confidence. We cannot keep
indefinitely in the chains of occupation the
entire German nation. This decision will
bave fateful repercussions, by no means confined to West Germany. One bas only to
remember the revoit of the workers in the
eastern section of Germany a year ago, wben
tbey tried to figbt tanks with their bare fists,
to realîze the temper of these people and their
unconquerable hope of reunion. It was a
sign of the times.
The protocol provides the following:
Declaration by the Government of the Federal
Republic of Germany.
The Germnan Federal Repubie has agreed to
conduct its policy in accordance with the principles
of the Charter of the United Nations and accepts
the obligations set forth in article 2 of the
Charter.
Upon her accession to the North Atlantic TreatY
and the Brussels Treaty. the Germnan Federal
Republic declares that she will refrain fromn any
action inconsistent with the strictly defensive
character of the two treaties. In particular the
Gerinan Federal Republic undertakes neyer to
have recourse to force to achieve the reunification
of Germany or the modification of the present
boundaries of the German Federal Republic, and
to resolve by peaceful means any disputes which
may arise between the Federal Republlc and other
states.

At first it would seem, that these provisions
are unnecessary, for surely the German
people realize that tbey cannot match Russia's strength. As a matter of fact it is
doubtful wbetber at the present time the
united efforts of ail free countries could

SENATE
force Russia out of East Germany and her
satellite countries. However, one thing the
leaders in the Kremlin know is that the ill
feeling engendered in the hearts of al Germans over the partition of Prussia will remain
forever with them. No matter how much
Russia endeavours to inculcate communism
into the German people she will never meet
with real success, for the Germans will
always maintain that there never was any
justification for the communists taking part
of Germany and giving it to Poland after
world war II.
History shows how the people of France
and Germany have felt over the problem of
Alsace and Lorraine. In 1871, by virtue of
a peace treaty signed at Frankfort, the French
provinces of Alsace and Lorraine were ceded
to the German Empire, and the French
always resented this partition. Then in 1919,
by virtue of the Treaty of Versailles, the
Germans were forced to cede Alsace and
Lorraine back to France. This embittered
the Germans, and their feeling in this regard
has not quite disappeared. I am sure that
the attitude of the Germans over the partition of Prussia, though it may take a long
time, will eventually have the effect of
eroding the steel of communism. And it
must be realized that most countries share
Germany's sentiment over this issue. You
cannot mutilate a country like Germany and
not expect it to have a lasting effect on its
people, and they will eventually succeed in
their legitimate aspiration.
Honourable senators, I place a great deal of
trust in the present leadership of Germany.
There is no doubt that Herr Adenauer is a
wonderful person and a stalwart of democracy. At this time I should like to refer to
an address which former American President
Herbert Hoover made to the German press in
Bonn, in December, 1954. We must respect
the words of ex-President Hoover. We all
know the magnificent humanitarian work he
did in Europe following World War 1: in
various places on the continent of Europe
monuments have been erected to commemorate that work. A man of vision, he was
not always fortunate in politics but he bas
long been recognized as a true statesman. In
a newspaper article headed "Europe Bastion
is Strong Germany", he is quoted as having
said in Bonn:
The tensions of military conflict with Russia
seem to have abated in these recent months.
I
believe we can have at least a gleam of hope.
Moscow bas made many declarations of "peaceful
coexistence".
I would rather they had spoken
of "peaceful co-operation". It may be that they
want more time to consolidate their gains.
It
may be that internal forces are working to restrain them from within. Some revolutions have
the bad habit of devouring their young.
At
least their successors are less violent.

But from our many years' experience with the
communists, we must await works rather than
words. We should not be lulled into the abondonment of our means of defence.
The German
peoples have before now been the bastion of
Western civilization which deterred its destruction
by the Asiatie hordes. My prayer is Germany may
be given the unity and freedom which will restore her that mission in the world.

Honourable senators, a little over two
years ago I visited many sections of Germany, even spending two days in East Berlin.
While staying in West Berlin I made it a
point to ascertain the attitude of the young
Germans, those of military age, towards the
building of a new German army. I must confess they were not very enthusiastic about
the idea of being called up. There is one
thing you can be certain of, however, and
that is that from their experience of two
world wars they look upon war as a terrible
thing. There is no getting away from that.
In particular, these young people vividly recall the effects of World War II. German soil
escaped invasion in the first war, but not in
the second one. Even now, although some
ten years have elapsed since the end of hostilities and great reconstruction has taken
place, German cities and towns still bear the
scars of the terrific devastation they suffered.
Germans do not like conscription any more
than Canadians like taxes. I asked these
young people if they would be satisfied to
see Germany remain divided in two, and
immediately you could see the blood rush to
their faces. I further asked them if they
would be satisfied if the full sovereignty of
Germany were never recognized, and again
their faces turned red. It must be remembered that all Germans, whether from the
West or East, will never be content as long
as their country remains divided. I have seen
Germans who live in Bavaria and Northern
Italy pray for the unification of the German
nation, and for the return of the lost part of
Prussia. These are facts which even Russia
will have to realize it cannot ignore in
attempting to impose its authority over that
part of the world indefinitely.
Honourable senators, in con.cluding my
remarks I wish to thank you sincerely for
your kind attention. I have spoken with feeling because I believe the people of the world
should try to understand one another. I
think Canadians have a pretty balanced outlook. While it is true that we are not perfect
and are sometimes open to criticism, we are
tolerant and have accepted things as they
have corne. Canada has entered into three
major conflicts without expecting remuneration of any kind, her people unquestioningly
answering a call to duty. During World War
II, when I was Deputy Speaker of the House
of Commons, I often watched the changing

9

JANUARY 26, 1955
of the guard in front of our Parliament
Buildings. I clearly recaîl the youthful faces
of our soldiers, airmen and sailors who carried out these colourful duties. They were
fine young men who had no personal quarrel.
with anyone and who were satisfied with
their way of if e. They joined our forces, not
to fight on Canadian soul but to fight in
Europe, Africa, and Asia for principles which
ail Canadians cherish. Since then I hae
often wondered how many of those fie
young men who were just at the threshold
of life and would naturally be thinking of
love and building homes of their own, neyer
returned to their homeland. In our own
family we iost three fine boys, and one was
made an invalid for life. That is why I appreciated what was said by the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) about how we
have ail suffered. Surely the world has had
its hesson. I think that if at least fifteen of
the total delegates at the United Nations
were chosen from the ranks of mutilated
war veterans-armless, iegless, blind, crippied for life, incapable of fuifilling duties in
the armed forces-everyone attending the
meetings of that organization would be
vividly impressed with what war really
means, with the futility of it and the fact
that even the victors do not benefit fromn the
bloodshed and destruction brought about by
martial conflict. During the last war, the
magazine Life contained some actuai pictures
of corpses of young Canadian, American,
Australian, British and other soidiers, iying
mutilated, their bodies were bioated, and one
could see the magots in their flesh. The
memory of those things should be in the
minds of ail people. There is no real glory in
war.
Honourable senators, I feel positive that
the Russian people themselves do not desire
war, and I think that if we are to believe in
civilization at ail we should try to build monuments to peace rather than to war. War is
calamitous, and repugnant to 'God as well as
to man. I believe the United Nations are
doing a wonderful work toward establishment
of peace. In terrninating, I want to say this:
The aggressîon part of the Kremlin's mind
we must resist to the death. The co-existence
part we should encourage, b>ecause, speaking
candidly, we ourselves also want co-existence,
and we believe that sooner or later, knowing
the horrifying power of destruction of the
H-bomb, we shahl find a way to live side by
side with our present enemies. I am convinced that when that day comes we shail see
that our true enemies were not the millions
of Russian people, but the handful of men
who ruied them.

A littie more than a month ago the Christian
world was celebrating the birth of our Lord.
On that night, heavenly hosts gave to mankind a wonderful message:
Glory to God in the highest; peace
to men of good will.

on earth

That message meant to the world that God's
good will is always with us. But it is not
only God, it is also men, who must have good
will; and when this great gift of the soul,
heart and mind animates the actions of mankind, then and then only shall we have peace,
that goal we ail so ardently desire to obtain.
Han. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Euler, the debate
was adjourned.

DIVORCE PETITIONS AND STATISTICS
REPORTS OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Divorce, presented
the committee's reports Nos. 62 to 87 dealing
with petitions for divorce, and moved that
the said reports be taken into consideration
at the next sitting.
He said: Honourable senators, I wish to
add a few words which I think will be of
interest to the house.
Notices of intention to proceed have been
published in 424 cases, and petitions have
actually been filed in 368 cases, which will
no doubt be completed before the time limit
has expired. These figures indicate that we
shall have a very heavy docket. Up to date
the committee has heard and disposed of 112
cases, none of which have been opposed. So
far we have been sitting five days a week,
Monday to Friday, but next week we shall
sit only on Monday, Tuesday and Friday.
The motion was agreed to.
TRANSCONTINENTAL

RAIL SCHEDULES

ANSWER TO INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, before the Orders of the Day are proceeded with, may I refer to a question asked
of me yesterday by the honourable senator
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) with
respect to the reduction in travelling time
on Canadian Pacific transcontinental trains.
The honourable senator asked whether it
was the intention of the Canadian National
Railways to make a similar reduction, and I
replied that I so understood from a press
dispatch.
I have since had an opportunity to read
the dispatch again, and in all fairness to my
honourable friend I must say that it does not
state the number of hours by which the
Canadian National time schedule will be
reduced. I will read the first two paragraphs
of the press announcement of January 25
respecting the Canadian National Railways.
The Canadian National Railways today confirmed
that it will fully dieselize its transcontinental
passenger train services concurrent with the next
tirne table change on April 24.

At that time the new transcontinental passenger
train will considerably reduce the running time
of the Montreal and Toronto section of the Canadian National Railways run to Vancouver.

The honourable senator also asked me
another interesting question, and that was
why there was a difference between the running times of the eastbound and westbound
transcontinental trips.
I find that under the time tables now in
effect on the Canadian Pacific Railway, the
westbound running time-that is the scheduled time the train is on the track-from
Montreal to Vancouver is 87 hours and 10
minutes. The eastbound running time, under
the same schedule, is 82 hours and 50 minutes.
So the eastbound train, under the present
schedule, does the same journey in 4 hours
and 20 minutes less than the westbound
train.
Under the new schedules to become effective April 24, the westbound running time
has been reduced from 87 hours and 10
minutes to 71 hours and 10 minutes: in other
words, by 16 hours. Also, under the new
schedule, the eastbound running time has
been reduced from 82 hours and 50 minutes
to 70 hours and 20 minutes: in other words,
by 12 hours and 30 minutes. Therefore,
whereas under the old schedule the difference
between the east and west run was 4 hours
and 20 minutes, the difference will now be
only 50 minutes.
There are a number of reasons why the
running time cannot be the same. For
instance, the eastbound and southbound trains
are superior to trains in their own class
going in the opposite direction, so that the
westbound and northbound trains must wait
at what railroaders call "meets". If it is a
single track and there are sidings the northbound and westbound trains must go into the
siding and wait. The fifty minutes difference
allows for a slight cushion on the "meets".
Trains are scheduled to arrive, wherever
possible, at hours most convenient to the
travelling public. Under the new schedules
this has been made possible, and other operating adjustments have been made so as to,
reduce the differential from 4 hours and 20
minutes to 50 minutes.
I hope that explains, in strictly layman's
language, just why there is this difference.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It does explain it, but not
satisfactorily.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I was not endeavouring to make the explanation satisfactory, but
I hope I put it in words which the honourable
senator will understand.

FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
APPROVAL 0F PROTOCOL ON ACCESSION TO
NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Macdonald, seconded by Hon. Mr. Godbout:
Resolved-That it is expedient that the houses
of Parliament do approve the protocol to the
North Atlantic Treaty on the accession of the
Federal Republic of Germany, slgned by Canada ai
Paris on October 23, 1954, and that this House
do approve the same.

Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourabie senators, it
is with a certain degree of hesitancy that I
rise to take part in this discussion. Fîrst,
because there is a certain futility in discussing this any furtler on account of the fact
that the resolution wlll carry, and probably
unaruimously. Secondly, because it may be that
in wlat I am going to say I shall meet with
a certain degree of disapproval. But that is
of no real importance. After ail, there is no
forum in ail the world in which a man or
a woman can state lis or her- views more
frankiy and more cleariy than in the Senate
of Canada, so I arn going to try to discuss
certain questions-without prejudice, I hope,
and with a sense of objectivity throughout.
I should like to tell the house why I
intend to support the resolution. Let me say
at once that it is flot entirely for the same

reason as was given by the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and by
others who have spoken. 1 also desire to
declare my absolute abhorrence of war-war
with its slaughter, its suffering both on the
battlefield and at home, its waste, and the
hatreds which it foments and which so often
in the making of peace treaties resuits in the
sowing of the seeds of another war. WhMen
I say that, I arn thinking particularly of the
Treaty of Versailles, in some features of
which I believe the second World War had
its origin.
During the course of my brief remarks I
should like to discuss a few things which
have been on my mind for some time, and
quite possibly, although I hope not, I may
express views with which some members of
the Senate wîll not agree.
I listened with much interest to the speech
made by the Leader of the Government. He
gave a technical explanation of the agreements, and I must compliment him on doing
it very well. I should also like to compliment
the other speakers, notably the senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen). I did not
agree entirely with his remarks, but in essence
I arn in accord with most of what he said.
Later on I shall make some reference to his
address, especially to the points with which
I did agree.
Among other things, he suggested that
NATO s0 far las lad a strong influence in the
prevention of war; and, inferentially, I suppose he feit the inclusion of Germany in NATO
would strengthen that influence. I believe
there is trutl in that statement, but I f eel
there are two reasons even more important
than that. It may surprise you to hear this,
but I think the first one-and I arn goîng to
deal with it more fully later on-was the
death of Stalin. The second is the atomic
bomb. I believe both of these, especiaily the
existence of the atomic bomb, las had more
to do with the prevention of war, if there
was a real danger of war, than any other
factor; because surely ail nations, including
Russia, must lesitate to engage in war-war
of aggression, if you like-when aware that
it would mean the certain destruction of the
world as we know it today. That knowledge
has been the greatest deterrent.
NATO, into which Germany is being
invited-althougl I cannot say that she will
be altogether welcome-is an alliance. History
has shown-and I have said this before-tlat
alliances are not always preventive of war.
In fact, one could prove that alliances have
sometimes led to war. An alliance, therefore. is not particularly encouraging. An ally
in one war may becorne an enemy in a future
war. One needs only ta look to the last two

SENATE
wars for proof of that. When the First Great
War started, Germany, Austria and Italy were
allied but almost as soon as the war began
Italy abandoned her allies and joined their
enemies. Similarly, in the First Great War
Japan was an ally of the western nations,
but in the Second Great War she became an
ally of the nation which opposed her in the
First Great War. Turkey was on one side in
the first war, and on the other side in the
second war. Coming down to the present
day, our bitterest enemies of the last two
wars become our allies under these agreements.
I support the resolution, though not entirely
on the ground given by at least two others
who spoke before me.
Allow me to digress for a moment. In the
treaty made at Yalta, certain provisions were
laid down, one of which specified that there
should be no alienation of territory to any of
the countries taking part in the war. Well,
Russia immediately broke the agreement, and
annexed East Prussia, as well as the three
little Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. She also took the eastern part of
Poland, compensating that country by giving
her the eastern part of Germany-the fertile,
agricultural part, upon which Germany depended for her food supply. While speaking
of this deprivation of Germany, may I say
that while it was entirely justifiable to destroy
her munition plants, I think it was a grave
mistake to bring about almost wholesale
destruction of her other factories, most of
which were in Western Germany. However,
perhaps it was a blessing in disguise to the
Germans, because it made it necessary for
them to install entirely new plants, with new
and up to date machinery, which enabled
them to compete with the rest of the world
in an ever-increasing degree. It may be said
that Germany deserved to have her factories
destroyed, but I will not discuss that. The
destruction created in the minds of the German people a feeling not only of injustice, but
of unnecessary and wanton waste, for in
addition to losing their main source of food
supply-since East Germany was the only
part of the country reasonably rich in agricultural production---they were, by the razing
of their factories, deprived of the means to
work and live. This led later on to the necessity of the United States and the United
Kingdom-I do not know about Canadaspending literally hundreds of millions of
dollars to keep alive the people whom they
had recently defeated.
I support the motion, not because the agreement necessarily increases greatly the strength
of NATO, for I do not think that the addition
to the NATO forces of half a million German
soldiers would be the deciding factor if war

occurred, but because it puts Germany in with
the Western nations. More than that, it will
avert any possible danger of Germany ever
joining with Russia.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I think that is the great
significance of the treaty. I do not need to
dwell upon the disastrous results that might
flow from the joining of Germany wholeheartedly and entirely with Russia.
Some compliments have been paid to German efficiency. I think they are merited.
Had another war broken out, I hesitate to
think what might have taken place in Europe
if the skills and scientific powers of Germany
had been placed at the disposal of Russia,
and German forces had joined wholeheartedly with Russian forces. That is my
chief reason for supporting this resolution.
May I now turn to the question of German
rearmament? I know there is certain opposition to it, and I can understand quite well
why the people of France and members of the
National Assembly are fearful of the prospect of the rearmament of Germany. I can
also understand the feelings of those who
lost sons and other members of their families
in either or both of the two great wars.
But, while the hatreds engendered by war
arouse opposition on the part of some, and
even the thought of an alliance with Germany is distasteful to others, nevertheless,
I think we ought to be realistic when speaking of a rearmed and dangerous Germany.
My friend the senator from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) said yesterday he believed that
the danger was non-existent. I myself believe the danger is negligible. Not long ago,
I visited Germany.
I know something
of the German language, and I made it a
point to discuss world affairs as affecting
Germany and the -est of the countries of
the world. I spoke to people of all classes,
and found, rather to my surprise, first, that
they were not particularly concerned with
communism as such, but that in their unarmed state they were definitely afraid of
Russia. Secondly, there seemed to be an
abiding hatred of the thought of getting
into another war. While the German people
are not satisfied-they are a defeated nation
-I
believe that they are, in the language
of the street, sick of war and want nothing
further to do with it.
It should be noted that while these agreements are now before our Parliament and
will no doubt be approved, they have not
yet been entirely agreed to by the legislative
body in Germany. There are, I think, some
obstacles in the way, such as the uncompleted so-called agreement on the Saar, and
some other things that the German people

JANUARY 27, 1955
do not like. The paramount fact is that
their hearts are set on having one day a
reunited Germany, and quite naturally so.
Chancellor Adenauer bas always fixed that
as one of the ultimate. goals, although not
one for which he would resort to war.
Those who have spoken before me have
made reference to people of German origin in
our own country. I know something about
these people; indeed, I need not say that I
myself am of that race. My father was born
in Germany, came to this country when he
was three years old, and remembered nothing
of Germany, and I have no known relatives
in that country. I know many people of German origin, particularly in the district from
which I come, and I know of no better Canadians than those very people.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I think a similar statement
applies as well to people of German origin
who live in other parts of Canada, such as
Manitoba and farther west.
I thank my friend from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) for what he said in this
respect, for it is only the truth.
The German people have been described as
a warlike race. While everyone will admit
they make good soldiers, I do not believe
they are warlike, or that they like war for
war's sake, or wish to dominate their neighbours. Indeed, I believe that none of the
common people in the world today, whether
they live in Germany, Russia, France, or the
United States, want war. Can you imagine
fathers and mothers who have sons of military age, enjoying the prospect of sending
their sons or going to war themselves to be
almost certainly slaughtered or maimed for
life? I cannot.
I have before me a rather lengthy article
written by a columnist for the Toronto Globe
and Mail which I would ask permission to
read. Omitting the earlier paragraphs of the
article, I quote:

young, who for many years had made his
living from people of German extraction.
When stories came back from the war, which
did not go very well at first, he said that if
he had the authority he would kill every
person who had a drop of German blood in
his veins. I have never forgotten that incident, and it is in line with what is said in
this article:

I suggest that a contributing element has been
the reckless and unlimited use of propaganda as
an instrument of "total" war.
Before the First World War, nations at war
never presented enemy peoples as a collection of
congenitally tainted beasts. Belligerents were restrained by the attitude that wars were lamentable
interruptions of normally congenial relations.

Such propaganda as "psychological conditioning"
for war is a terrible newcomer upon history's stage;
it makes any aim except unconditional surrender
impossible; and it cannot easily be obliterated from
men's minds by later appeals to reason and realism.
It prolongs wars. It makes reconciliation-which
is peace-all but impossible.

When the war was over, I suppose, they
returned to their congenial relations.
But during the First World War-largely by the
campaign of Lord Northcliffe-the whole German
people were presented as lacking every human

virtue.
I hesitate to mention this, but by way of
illustration may I relate an instance of how
extreme hatreds develop in time of war?
During the First World War there was in
my constituency a professional man, no longer
50437-7

The doctrine of exclusive guilt went into the
Treaty of versailles, and propaganda reached the
summit of systematically indoctrinated hatred in
the Second World War. Without that wave of
blind hatred, no state could have called its people
to war for "unconditional surrender", nor could
there have been support for the lunatic proposals
of the Morgenthau plan.

That plan, as we know, contemplated the
complete destruction of German industry and
the reduction of German people to hewers of
wood and drawers of water. However, such
steps were never seriously contemplated by
those who retained any sense of sanity.
Propaganda presented the Germans as a "paranoid" race, incurably warlike, that must be
exterminated.
The Scoreboard of Wars
Yet the fact was that since the Renaissance and
the modern era, 278 wars involved European
countries; that-as a measure of relative bellicosity
-Great
Britain
fought
twenty-eight,
France
twenty-six, Spain twenty-five, while Germany, including Prussia, fought only eight-one more than
Denmark.

I was surprised to read those figures.
Further:
The excesses of the Nazi revolution were allowed
to eclipse those of the Russian revolution whose
casualties vastly exceeded the German.

I do not apologize here for what took place
in Germany during the Second Great War,
but I say that I have no belief whatever that
the German people, apart from their leaders,
desire to dominate and to kil their neighbours. I regard the German people as pretty
much like the citizens of all other civilized
countries.
The writer concludes:

I apologize, honourable senators, for having
read at some length, but I think it leads to
something we must recognize.
Hatred still exists, as I can well understand, but fortunately it is becoming less and
less as the years pass. But if we need-and
I think we do-the support of the German
people, situated as they are in the heart of
Europe, then I think we should accept them
wholeheartedly; and while perhaps many wil
never completely forget the things which

SENATE
took place during the two Great Wars, so
far as our practical action goes we must let
bygones be bygones and go on from there.
The full value of Germany's membership
in NATO cannot be had unless we change
our attitude towards her. It may be difficult,
but we must restore some sense of good will,
equality and sovereignty towards her. Perhaps
it cannot all come about now, but ultirnately
it must be so.

My friend from Inkerman (Hon. Mr Hugessen) said yesterday that the Germans are a
proud people. I am not at all sure that pride
is of any particular value. But if that statement be true, then we have to reckon with
it. We shall have to give thern equality and
sovereignty in the end. It may be a calculated risk, as the military men say, but it
must be taken. I believe, though, that the
danger of Germany rearming and again going
to war with her neighbours is pretty nearly
negligigle.
One more thing I think is necessary for
the peace of Europe. We must ultimately
have a united Germany. Now, I do not know
that the Western powers have it within their
power to bring that about, but the German
people naturally will never be satisfied until
they are reunited. We had a lesson on that
fact after World War I, when under the
terms of the Treaty of Versailles a corridor
was cut through East Prussia.
Perhaps I have said too much about Germany, and I notice my friend the Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) is getting
almost as tired as I am. I shall go on to speak
of Russia, if I may.
Perhaps the expression of distrust of that
country is not as strong now as it was some
tirne ago-as, say, before the death of Stalin
-but if we are ever to make an arrangement with the Russians, which ultimately
we must do, we certainly are not starting on
the right road if we call thern names and
say: "We do not trust you. We won't talk
to you. You are lying and deceiving us, and
we have no use for you at all." It may be
true that they are not worthy of trust, but
I am reminded of an old saying that I heard
a long time ago:
Always teIl the truth, but don't always be

telling it.

I think that is a good thing to remember
with regard to Russia.
Now, I spoke of the death of Stalin as
being perhaps one of the reasons why Russia
has not become aggressive. Is it perhaps just
barely possible that under the new dispenation the expressions of apparent ýconciliation, if you like to call it that, may be
genuine? And if that be the case-my friend
from Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard) is smiling at that-should not the Western nations

explore every possibility by which another
war can be avoided, by at least giving careful consideration to every Russian approach?
As I said the other day to my room-mate
(Hon. Mr. Baird), "I would sit down with
the prince of darkness himself if that meant
giving the world any opportunity of avoiding another war."
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: As I see it, there are only
three courses open to us. One is to continue
as we are doing now, maintaining a condition sometimes referred to as the cold war.
The second course is to go to war and
destroy the world as we have it today. The
third course is to try to get along with the
Russian people and the communist nations.
We have done this for years. Russia is a part of
the United Nations, and we get along with
her there, though not very well. And let me
add here that although China is controlled
by communists, I believe we should recognize her government and that she should be
admitted into the United Nations. To me, the
third course is the only one possible, and
we shall have to ýcome to it anyway. Certainly, the first one, of continuing what we
are doing now, means living in a state of
dread which our statesmen say could continue for a generation or longer, with the
expenditure of billions of dollars each year
and consequently high taxes. Taxes in Canada are too high anyway, and should be cut
by half a billion or a billion dollars a year.
However, I will not go into that now, but
perhaps the Minister of Finance would agree
with me, judging from the remarks he made
some time ago.
The third course seems to me to be the
only one that it is possible to follow. I
believe Sir Winston Churchill is for it, and
I think Sir Anthony Eden is too. They make
this stipulation, however, that they are not
going to negotiate with Russia until after
the NATO treaty has been signed and sealed,
after all the countries that are contributory
to it are in agreement. But I am not going
into that either.
I believe that ultimately we must try to
negotiate a state of co-existence. I am not
sure who coined that phrase. Perhaps it was
Sir Winston Churchill, for he is a past master
at that sort of thing. We have got to live
with Russia. As against that we have just
the two alternatives I mentioned: to go to
war with them, or to continue in a state of
uncertainty, expense and worry for perhaps
another generation or longer.
I always like to look at things, if possible,
from the other fellow's point of view, but I
hope nobody here will say I am defending
Russia, for I am not. I am as far away from
communism as perhaps anyone in this cham-

JANUARY 27, 1955
ber. Russia has been accusing the United
States of being a war monger. We know
that is not true. We know that the United
States has no desire to extend its territoriesnone whatsoever. We know that that country
has given billions, yes, literally billions of
dollars to the nations in Europe, much of it
perhaps because it was in the interest of the
United States to do so, but much of it also,
I think, came from the generosity of their
hearts, and all credit should be given to them
in that respect. Now suppose I try to put
myself in the other fellow's place by imagining that I were a Russian, how would I feel
if I saw my country surrounded by air fieldsair fields in the United States, in Canada,
Iceland, Greenland, Britain, France, Spain,
Turkey, the Philippines-with bombers able
to reach any part of my country within a
few hours? Well, with the propaganda that
is being put out today I might easily be
inclined to believe that all this bodes no
good for my country and ask what is the
purpose of it? However, as I said before, it
is not being done for any purpose of aggression at all, but I can well believe that in
Russia there might be some alarm, just as
there would be in this country if Russia took
possession of some of the islands in the
Caribbean or Newfoundland-provided my
friend from St. John's (Hon. Mr. Baird) would
allow them to do so. That is why I always
feel that we must make a little allowance for
Russia's attitude.
One other matter, and I shall be through.
Two or three years ago I moved in this house
a resolution for the calling of a convention
or a conference to explore the possibility of
Atlantic union. That meant not a military
alliance but ultimately a federation, a real
federation for nearly all purposes of the
countries bordering on the Atlantic, and at
that time I said I felt that such an organization would surely tend to the preservation of
peace in at least half of the world, and if
the common people of another country-say,
Russia-ultimately should want to come into
the Atlantic Union, that would mean the
salvation of the world. I admit it is visionary,
but things must be seen first in a vision and
later translated into reality. As to just how
visionary this idea is, let me read an item
from Philadelphia:
Only by uniting immediately into one great
state can Europe end the wars and trade struggles
that are destroying ber, the grand old man of
American politics declared here today. The sole
solution, he declared, is for Europe to call at once
a constitutional convention which would combine
all ber different states and kingdoms into one
federal union.

Who, do you suppose, said that? The "grand
old man of American politics", Benjamin
Franklin, who urged a union of Europe on
the American model, in 1787--one hundred
50437-71

and seventy-five years ago. Well, we have
not got to it yet. But if the will of the
people favours it, ultimately it will prevail.
I will only say in conclusion that if from
this organization, NATO, can be developed
ultimately into a world government that will
for ever make war impossible, it will be
the greatest boon to the people of the world,
who, I am convinced, have no desire to
dominate their fellows but who want to
live in harmony with their fellow-men everywhere.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
you have listened, as I did, with much interest to the excellent speech delivered by
my desk-mate (Hon. Mr. Euler). I venture
to express the hope that he will speak more
often in this chamber.
Hon. Mr. Haig: He has not had much
experience yet: he will speak more frequently after a while!
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Probably the resolution
we are discussing is the most important that
will come before us this session. Its effects
may be very far-reaching. When the war
was over everyone hoped that a long era of
peace would be ushered in for a poor distracted world. That hope was particularly
strong in all the western countries that
believe in freedom and liberty and have
governing institutions which give expression
to that ideal. It is almost ten years since
the war ended. At that time Europe had
been almost destroyed. With the exception
of Sweden, Spain and Portugal, every country
of Europe had suffered either occupation by
the German forces or devastation through
bombing and otherwise. The loss of life was
in the millions; the loss of treasure and
happiness could hardly be measured; so
it was natural that, following that catastrophe,
the minds of the people should turn to
ideas of permanent peace. May I sketch
briefly, but I trust with some effect, the
reasons why that hope has not been realized.
I am not going to discuss today the responsibility of Germany for the last war.
It has, I think, been made, clear and unmistakable to the world. The great misfortune of the German people was the kind
of leadership they accepted. I do not feel
too critical towards them on that account. I
wholly agree with the statement of my honourable friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) that the Germans are a people with
great qualities; and I cannot believe in my
heart that the German workman or the
German farmer loves war any more than I do.
When the power of Hitler was destroyed,
efforts were made by the leading allied

SENATE
nations to frame a basis of peace. It was
recognized that Russia had been wandering
outside the great comity of nations, and that
she gave adherence to a philosophy of life
alien to our ideas of freedom. But she had
been an ally in the war, and I believe I am
within the bounds of reason when I say
that throughout Canada, the United States
and Western Europe there was a strong feeling of hope that Russia would live up to
the expectations which people held of her.
In the various conferences held before the
end of the war that opportunity was given
to Russia. It was recognized that there were
innumerable problems to be solved, but at
the famous Yalta Conference a decision was
reached by Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin,
representing their respective great powers,
as to the procedure that would be followed
in the smaller countries in Europe. It was
decided that Poland could settle her own
future by free elections, choosing a communist government or a government of a
different stripe. The saine was true in the
case of Rumania, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
Did Russia honour those obligations? The
first doubt that arose in the minds of western
statesmen was caused by the fact that she
did not. All those countries to which I have
just referred were occupied by Russian troops.
What has been the result? I do not need to
sketch the sorry story for this house, for it
stands naked to the light of day. Every one
of those countries is under communist domination today. Is that because their people
believe in communism? Do you think that
the Czechoslovakian people, who have been
among the staunchest believers in freedom
and liberty in Europe, have lost their love of
freedom and liberty? Do you think the Poles
who for 150 years, despite the domination of
Russia on the one side and of Prussia on the
other, kept alive their love of freedom, liberty and country, have suddenly changed? It
cannot be.
When, according to arrangements, Germany
was divided after World War II, Russia occupied the eastern sector of that country. It
was then understood that ultimately a peace
treaty would be reached with Germany, but
every effort made in that direction has been
blocked and stopped. Take the problem concerning Trieste in Italy. Russia refused to sit
in with the other powers and reach a settlement, hoping to keep alive existing frictions
and jealousies concerning that question. At
no time in the last ten years has Russia shown
a disposition to sit down and talk with
other powers and settle these international
disputes, excepting upon her own terms; and
those terms cannot be accepted.

Russia, to my mind, is dominated today
more by the spirit of imperialism than by the
philosophy of communism. If she had honestly wanted to test out the communist theory
of life and of government she could have
done so within the confines of her own territory. No one was going to say "Yea" or
"Nay". She had an opportunity to develop
a socialist state of her own in accordance with
all the beautiful theories of Karl Marx, but
that was not the purpose of the Russian
leaders. As my honourable friend from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) said yesterdayand there was never a truer thing said-the
guiding principle of Russian foreign policy
today is almost the same as it was in the days
of the Czars. It is a desire for domination
and expansion, and until that desire ceases
to exist in Russian government circles we
shall be faced with the possibility of trouble.
It became quite apparent that Russia was
not going to live up to her obligations when
she intervened in Czechoslovakia and upset
the Government of that country, the head of
which was President Benes. It was my good
fortune to meet Mr. Benes on one or two
occasions and to have considerable conversation with him. Never was there a man more
opposed to the idea of communism and communist philosophy. He was struggling to
maintain a measure of independence in his
country and his Foreign Minister at that time
was Mr. Masaryk, a son of the great Czech
patriot of the First World War. There is no
doubt as to what happened to those two men.
The idea that Masaryk committed suicide is
now wholly discounted, and we know that
Benes was imprisoned in his house. The
Government which he headed, and in which
indeed there were a few communists-was
done away with and a pure communist regime
was installed in Czechoslovakia. Does that
look like co-operation on the part of Russia?
Take Poland today. The Minister of Defence in the Polish Government is a marshal
in the Russian army. Has he any more right
than a Canadian general to hold that position?
But Poland is not an independent country.
The web has been woven around these nations, which are satellite countries in every
sense of the term, and as far as we can see
Russia will not relax ber grip upon them.
When the menace of atomic energy, that
dreadful engine of destruction, first became
apparent, efforts were made in the United
Nations to control its use. It was agreed by
the representatives of all member countries
of the United Nations to ban atomic warfare,
but it was recognized that this could only be
done by ensuring an adequate system of inspection in every country of the world. This
would mean that the inspectors of the United
Nations would be free to go into Russia, the
United States, Britain and Canada, and so on,

JANUARY 27, 1955

and measure the degree of activity taking
place in connection with the preparation of
atomic warfare.
Did Russia agree to that? She threw every
obstacle possible in the way of it. She said,
"Yes, we will agree to a system of inspection,
but we will do our own inspection." Is it
reasonable to expect that the Western powers
would accept that? The question of disarmament, when it came before the United Nations,
was discussed at great length, and plans were
submitted in an effort to bring about disarmament among the nations. What was the
obstacle in the path of progress toward disarmament? It was Russia, together with her
satellites, who sat at the council of the United
Nations. Why did Russia take the position
she did? Was it because she feared that some
scheme might be worked against ber? I cannot believe it. As the result of Russia's opposition, prudence dictated that the Western
powers rearm, which they decided to do with
reluctance. And, honourable senators, it is
worth noting, in passing, that when World
War II ended the Western powers demobilized
their forces. The United States army, which
participated in the war, was dissolved and
her soldiers went home. Britain did likewise, and so did Canada. Did Russia demobilize? Was there any reduction in the
number of her military personnel? Absolutely
none! She maintained ber forces. And in the
light of these events, the only thing left for
the Western powers to do was to draw together and formulate the Atlantic treaty, as it
is known in Western Europe. Out of that
combination grew NATO, and from NATO
developed the building up of military strength.
The purpose was not to attack Russia. It is
absolutely absurd to think that the forces of
the Western powers as they stand today could
successfully attack the forces of Russia. Russia proper has 175 divisions; she has 500,000
men on the western side of her western frontier in Europe, in Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland, and a vast total of
400,000 in East Germany. The people of East
Germany do not like communism. A year ago
last June they raised the standard of revolt
against their communist government, and they
would have succeeded in upsetting that regime
if the Russian army had not been there. It
was only when Russian tanks and machine
guns rattled through their streets and cities
that the uprising against the communist government collapsed.
I repeat that there is nothing for the Western powers to do but combine in their own
defence.
Russia says that the United States is
imperialistic. Russia bas endeavoured everywhere to poison the minds of people in
Europe and Asia against so-called United
States imperialism. Well,. we have lived

alongside the United States during ail our
years of experience and history, and we know
that the United States are not imperialistic
and that they do not covet a foot of territory
anywhere. But they do want to see order and
peace in the world. They do want to see
civilization built on a solid foundation so that
their institutions in the future may not be
challenged or attacked. In furtherance of
that fine design they have given unbounded
help to the world. What would have happened, in 1948, for instance, if the United
States had not given the Marshall Plan to
the world? A few moments ago I pictured
Europe broken, its commerce gone, its people
disspirited and almost helpless. Into that
broken Europe came the offer of help from
the United States through the Marshall Plan.
I assure honourable senators that that great
gesture of help from the United States to
Europe prevented Italy and France from going
over to the communistic idea of government.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: And it gave encouragement to all the freedom-loving countries of
Europe to reassert themselves. I know there
are times when American foreign policy is
difficult to understand, and when there appear
to be inconsistencies, but I state here that the
underlying principle of American policy is
peace, and that the American people want
peace above everything else. Is it a pleasant
thing for the United States to contemplate
keeping armed forces in Europe indefinitely?
Was it pleasant for Britain to decide to maintain four divisions in Germany, as well as a
secondary air force? Why have the United
States kept their forces in Europe? And why
has Canada kept its forces in Europe? May I
say that I am proud of the fact that Canada
has done so. Honourable senators, these forces
have been maintained there to give courage
and hope to the Western Europeans, not only
to build up military power and strength, but
also to build up economic, spiritual and moral
strength, which are just as important to wage
war as are guns and tanks.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: There is a great deal of
fear prevalent that the rearming of Germany
may again bring to the surface dangerous
militarism in Germany. Well, I do not believe
it. Our colleague from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) gave some very good reasons
yesterday, I thought, as to why that might
not happen. Germany has tasted of war,
make no mistake about that; she has lost a
substantial amount of territory; ber country
bas been occupied for the last ten years; ber
cities have been destroyed; her people for
years have been compelled to live in any

102

SENATE

place where they could find shelter. Do you
think those experiences have not seared the
hearts of the German people? They have
paid very, very dearly for going to war. I
can understand the reluctance today of German young men and women to have anything
to do with war. That is one of the obstacles
Chancellor Adenauer bas had to overcome.
And here, in passing, may I pay my tribute
and respect to that great German leader, who
today is one of the outstanding public men
on the continent of Europe.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I have no fear that the
rearming of Germany will lead to a restoration of German military power. May I give
a few reasons for thinking so, in addition to
those given to the house yesterday by our
colleague from Inkerman.
In the first place, the German General
Staff bas been completely obliterated. It is
worthy of note that that great body, which for
a century exercised a most unwholesome influence upon Germany, dated from the time
of Frederick the Great.
In the second place, these agreements
which we are asked to ratify would place
upon Germany very definite limitations.
While they would give her almost complete
sovereignty, they limit the extent of her rearmaments. For instance, she cannot have a
military strength of more than 500,000 men;
she cannot engage in any chemical, atomic
or biological warfare activity; she cannot
manufacture large guns; she cannot manufacture warships of more than a certain
tonnage. These limitations are there, and
Chancellor Adenauer gladly accepts them.
But when these agreements are ratified
Germany will become a part of the western
European Community, and will sit not in an
inferior position but in an equal position
with the other members of the community,
thus having her self respect restored.
I can, apreciate the arguments advanced
against German rearmament, though in passing I am bound to say that they proceed
wholly from emotion and not from reason.
As I say, one can understand the opposition
to such a move. But if these agreements are
not ratified, what will happen? We have
given Germany back her sovereignty. She
is now the arbiter of her own policies with
respect to foreign affairs. If we do not bring
her into the family of Western powers, what
may happen to her?
Without any question at all, the hope of
Russia has been that Germany could be kept
out of this community of Western powers.
Russia tried at the outset to defeat the move,
by playing on the French fears of Germany
and thus causing the French Assembly to

refuse ratification of the arrangement. Russia
is adopting much the same strategy with
Germany today. If she succeeds, what will
be the result? Germany bas been a great
power, and situated as she is in the heart of
Europe, may again be a great power. As
Chancellor Adenauer has said, if these agreements fail, the temptation will be very
strong for German statesmen in the future to
play the East off against the West and to
make the best deal they can with both
worlds.
We can never escape the truth that Russia
holds some strong cards in her dealings with
Germany. First, there is the reunification of
Germany, which is uppermost in the heart
and mind of every German, and which must
sooner or later be brought about. Secondly,
every German wants the restoration of eastern territories taken from Germany and
given to Poland. Russia made a cyni.cal
arrangement in that connection: she took a
slice of Eastern Poland for which she compensated Poland by giving her a slice of
Eastern Germany. But a cynical government
in Germany might well sit down with Russia
some day and decide to partition Poland, as
was done before. If Germany and Russia
are allowed to be drawn together, make no
mistake, there will be trouble for Europe.
Indeed, there may be trouble between these
two countries in the long run, for as the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) has so well said, alliances very often
lack a stable and permanent quality.
Nevertheless, honourable senators, there is
not the slightest doubt in my mind that the
sensible thing to do is to pass this resolution,
ratify these agreements and hope that the
countries of the new alliance will get along
together; that they will build up their
strength, not for aggression, but to hold their
place against further domination by Russia.
If that happens, the organs of the United
Nations may come fully into play, its prestige
and its power may be increased and established, and through that organization we may
find the way to ultimate peace.
I am under no illusion that today the outlook for the world is anything but bright.
Every country is spending enormous sums
on armaments. We know the burden of taxation that defence costs impose upon us here
in Canada, and I do not like to look forward
to that prospect indefinitely. But, we must
face up to the fact that every other Western
power is in the same position, and there is
no possibility of escaping it. But away in the
distance is the goal of peace.
In our travels towards peace I sometimes
think that we are not unlike Bunyan's pilgrim
in his travels towards the celestial city. Those
of you who have read that great allegory will

JANUARY 27, 1955
recall the troubles and difficulties that he met
on the way and had to overcome. So it is
with us: the dangers are many, and we face
a long pull that will test the quality of our
people. If we rely only on a materialistic
philosophy of life we shall sooner or later
fail. We must, therefore, drink deeply from
the moral and spiritual sources of strength,
and falter not though the way be long and
hard. We must have a reasonable confidence
that in the end we shall win through all
these troubles and come at last to the sunlit
valleys of peace.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, I feel it only fair to state at the
outset of the few remarks I have to make,
that no treaty on foreign affairs has created
so much interest throughout Canada, and in
Parliament, as has the present treaty by
which we propose to accept Germany into
NATO and to make her a separate power.
I can well understand, as other speakers have
said they do, with what hesitation many
people in Canada look upon admitting Germany into NATO and allowing ber to rearm
again. I have a great deal of sympathy for
them and I can understand their viewpoints
because-and this is something we should
never forget-in the two world wars 98,626
young Canadian men and women gave their
lives because Germany set out to conquer
the earth. I am not going to emphasize the
amount of money which the Canadian people
paid out to prosecute those wars, for in my
opinion money is secondary to the great loss
of human life. But it could be mentioned that
upwards of $20 billion was expended by the
Canadian people to help defeat the military
aims of Germany.
As I say, I can well understand what is
in the minds and breasts of those who lost
their beloved ones, but I have no sympathy
with the group of people in this country who
follow a directive from Moscow to oppose
this ratification. In the Tribune it was stated
by Tim Buck that a directive had been sent
out to all members of the LPP for nationwide action against this protocol. I am
not going to include within my severe criticism all those who oppose the treaty, but
some of the letters which I receive and
some of the statements sent to me make me
rather suspicious that some of the writers are
connected with the LPP and are not urging
us to oppose the protocol from a practical
point of view. Rather, they are playing the
Soviet game.
I have read carefully the discussion in the
House of Commons and have listened to the
splendid speeches in the Senate, and I notice
that most of the speakers dealt with the

sole question of rearming Germany but have
soft-pedalled or left out of their speeches
entirely any statement on the reasons why
we are compelled to have a military force
in Europe and why we believe it will be to
our advantage to have the help of German
troops. After all, why should we not expect
the help of German troops? If the Western
powers had no troops in Europe today no
one knows what steps the Russians would
take to bring still more of Berlin, if not of
other parts of Germany, under ber orbit. As
mentioned by the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) there are almost
a million Russian troops in Europe west of
the Soviet borders, distributed right around
Germany. And I want to ask any person who
opposes this treaty what does be think Russia
has built 4,000 submarines for? Why does
Russia need that many submarines today?
In fact, she has the largest submarine fleet
the world bas ever witnessed. It is not for
peace.
At the San Francisco Conference, in 1945,
when Stalin and all the leaders of the
Western powers met, Stalin did not talk
peace even then, as you will see if you
will read his speeches. And when the
Western powers reduced their armaments
after that conference, which nation went
ahead feverishly building up its military
might? It was Soviet Russia. All who have
read Russian history will realize why there
had been no peace or agreement reached
between Soviet Russia and the Western
powers. The Kremlin, under Stalin's regime,
looked into history and realized that in all
the wars Russia had engaged in for the
past 200 years she had been defeated, and
that for one particular reason: she did not
have sufficient military might. So she adopted
two things from the western world, and she
has been using them against us to gain advantage for herself in this cold war. She
Communism came
adopted communism.
from the west, for Karl Marx lived in London. And do not overlook the fact that
although the Soviet Republic, or a large
part of it is an Eastern power, it has been
using the Western philosophy of Karl Marx
against the Western powers, and fairly successfully at that. Then in searching for the
reasons why the Russian forces had been
defeated, the Kremlin came to the conclusion
and believed that while the Russians are just
as good fighters as those of any country, their
one lack was mechanical military power,
and so they have made use of Western knowhow to build modern military weapons. Thus
today the world finds Russia highly mechanized from the military point of view, and
equipped with the atom bomb as well.

104

SENATE

I think that should be kept in mind by
those who charge that the Western powers
are always talking military might. There
would be no need for military might at all
were it not for, shall I say, the motive or the
policy of the Kremlin, which is seeking world
domination. Until that aim is discarded there
will always be trouble.
I am not so much alarmed today as I was
in 1939. J think it was Churchill who said,
after the end of the last war, that if the
Western powers are ever caught again in as
poor a military condition as they were in
1939, they will not survive. But we are
better prepared than in 1939, and not so
easily fooled. Russia may have quite a force
of military power. However, the eyes of the
Western nations are open now, and we have
some measure of preparedness and are not
going to be caught napping in the future.
Looking through a magazine the other day
I came across a most interesting article, and
I think some of it is well worth being placed
before this honourable bouse. I am prepared
to accept the statement of the author, Leon
Volkov, because of his past experience. He
fought in the Red Air Force against the Germans in World War II, and he is now a correspondent for Netosweek, a magazine published
in the United States. Volkov says.
The fear of the Russians is real fear against
the arming of Germany. What we do not understand is how painfully Soviet Russia was scared by
the blitzkreig in the initial stages of the last war.
As a member of the Red Army at that time I
saw it and felt it.
We Russians suffered a
traumatic experience on a national scaIe. We got
the feeling that we were no match for the Germans.
And we didn't fully recover from this sense of
military inferiority even in our ultimate triumph...
There was good reason for this. The Germans
in their initial assault had 2,400 tanks to throw
against the Soviet's 20,000.
On defence, the
German Army was sometimes outnumbered 12 to
1 by the Red Army. The Germans did not hesitate
to mount attacks even when they knew that they
were outnumbered by 3 to 1.

But here is the most striking statement, and
I think we can take heart from it in passing
this resolution:
Certainly nothing that the western powers have
donc since the last war has so frightened the
Kremlin as this latest, most promising plan for a
start toward the restoration of German military
power.

I say again that that is a very heartening
statement; and, coming from a man who
fought with the Russians against the Germans
in the last war, and one who certainly understands the people of Russia better than most
of us do, it carries more weight than many
utterances we hear from time to time from
others who know little of the Russian people.
It has been suggested in various quarters
that we should negotiate with the Soviets.

I wonder, if we did, how much longer it
would take. I find on checking the records
that since October 1950, on sixteen occasions
the Western powers have sought for a settlement of the East and West Germany question.
Russia is definitely against any settlement.
May I say, in passing, that it was most
unfortunate that President Roosevelt was ill
at the time of the Yalta meeting and accepted
the counsel of some advisers who, it has been
proven since, were friendly to Russia.
Churchill stood out against Stalin and Roosevelt, but finally had to give in. Had the
British statesman's will prevailed, the troubles
which followed the division of East and
West Berlin would never have occurred. Perhaps I am repeating myself, but I think it
should be emphasized that Germany cannot
be kept down for all time; her sovereignty
must be restored sooner or later. In making
the choice now, doubt and bewilderment are
in the minds of many as to what will happen
with a revitalized and well-equipped German
army. But there can be no question that,
with the increase of western power, the
Soviet leaders have become a little less
aggressive. Besides, if Germany regained
ber sovereignty outside NATO, she could not,
in the prosent state of world affairs, long
remain neutral; so it is certainly much better
and safer to admit her into the North Atlantic Organization than to take the chance
of ber siding with Soviet Russia.
I have not much more to say honourable
senators. My particular purpose in rising
on this occasion was to draw attention to a
group of people who are acting for and
directed from Moscow, while they enjoy
all the benefits of our free deocratic country. I do not think it has been made clear
enough to our people what the dominance
of Sovietism would mean. This is a time
to stand up and be counted. I for one am
for a society in which each of us can enjoy
his rights as an individual citizen, not one
in which he is reduced to a mere number.
I agree with the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) that if Russia
had confined ber ideas to ber own country
we might not have objected, but what she
is trying to do is to encircle the world and
subdue it to ber Communist philosophy. If
anyone doubts this he should read the February number of Reader's Digest and observe
what bas taken place in Guatemala through
the activities of Communist agents. It is an
appalling record, and difflcult to understand,
but there it is for all who want to read.
I intend to support this motion, and I am
very glad that its support, at least in the
Senate, will be unanimous. In closing, I
want to compliment all those who have taken
part in this debate.

JANUARY 27, 1955
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I
intend to take no more than a few moments.
My chief reason for speaking at this time is
that the member of the House of Commons
who represents the largest city near my home
has astonished me very much by making a
bitter attack on this protocol. Personally I
shall vote for it, in spite of some personal
reasons to the contrary, and I hope it will
I warmly
have our unanimous support.
compliment those who have taken part in the
discussion. We have had some very fine
addresses and a worth-while debate.
The honourable senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) recalled some facts of recent
history which help us to realize that nowadays
there can be no victor in war, and that the
winner may suffer to a greater extent than
the loser. Formerly wars were waged by
armies of limited size, and all the participants
were men; the women and children, generally,
were unharmed; but the practices of modern
war have changed all that. We recall the
mass destruction at Nagasaki and Hiroshima
which was caused by atomic bombs, and that
it was our allies who used them.
On the particular question before us: while
I understand that fear, and possibly hatred,
influence some people in their opposition to
German rearmament, I do not share their
attitude. We look back at the events which
followed the First Great War, and think on
what might have happened if President Wilson, when he returned to his own country
after sponsoring the League of Nations, had
been able to secure approval for his plan of
enforcement. What bloodshed might have
been spared, and what immense expenditures
would have been avoided! Even Canada has
to accept its share of blame. What did the
Canadian Government do when Mussolini's
forces attacked Ethiopia? Our representative
at the League of Nations was one of those
who moved to apply economic sanctions
against Italy, but the Canadian Government
was quick to say that he was not speaking on
its behalf.
Despite the circumstances surrounding
World War I and World War II, and all the
adverse propaganda about the Germans, I
believe Canada should approve the protocol
to the North Atlantic Treaty on the accession
of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Let me give an illustration of the use of
propaganda to build up hatred in people and
to imbue troops with a fighting spirit. One
time when I had occasion to visit a war
memorial in Kansas City, I saw a huge advertising display which was part of a recruiting
campaign. There was a lot of propaganda,
and among other things that I remember seeing were pictures of what were alleged to be
German soldiers in the act of cutting off the
50437-8

hands of little Belgian girls. However, the
fact of the matter is that no Belgian child was
ever produced who had suffered in this fashion
at the hands of German soldiers. A similar
form of propaganda, I believe, was adopted by
both sides in order to build up a spirit of
hatred.
It is apparent that the Russian people have
not begun to appreciate what a civilized
approach to international problems can accomplish, but together with others who have
participated in this debate I believe that the
German people have reached this stage. West
Germany would be a valuable ally in the
defence of Europe, and indeed it is absolutely
necessary that the Federal Republic of Germany and the present members of NATO
should co-operate in this respect.
Honourable senators, there is just one other
matter I should like to touch upon. I like to
see credit given where it is due. I do not
wish to detract in any way from the many
fine qualities of the present Prime Minister
of Canada. I was wholeheartedly in support
of his tour of occidental and oriental nations
last year, for I knew he was taking to the
people of these nations a message of peace,
good will and co-operation from Canada.
However, yesterday the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) said that it
was none other than our own Prime Minister who first envisaged the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization. I do not think that is
so. The idea was first propounded by Sir
Winston Churchill in his famous speech at
Fulton, Missouri. He claimed that Russia
was refusing to co-operate in any way in
international matters, and he advocated a
union of Western Atlantic nations.
Honourable senators, I am fully in accord
with the resolution before the house and I
have no doubt I can justify my actions to
the people of my part of Canada.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The Hon. the Speaker (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
left the Chair to address the Senate.
Hon. Arthur L. Beaubien, in the Chair.
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators,Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
the subject matter of this resolution has been
so thoroughly covered that I would not
undertake to add anything, were it not that
one aspect of this question seems to have
a direct bearing upon the honour of the
Senate. I would therefore crave your indulgence for a short time while I refer to it.

SENATE
In May of 1950 the honourable senator
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) moved the
following resolution in this chamber:
That the Senate of Canada do approve of the
calling by the United States of America of a
Convention of delegates from the democracies
which sponsored the North Atlantic Treaty and
representing the principal political parties of such
democracies, for the purpose of exploring how far
their peoples and the peoples of such other
democracies as the Convention may invite to send
delegates, can apply among them within the framework of the United Nations, the principles of
federal union.
Many will recall the discussion which that

resolution provoked in the Senate. For the
benefit of any honourable senator who was
not here then, may I say that the debate on
the resolution reached heights of clarity,
eloquence and foresight which I am sure

would do credit to any parliamentary assembly. As an illustration of the quality of the
speeches made on that occasion, I would refer
to those of this afternoon by the honourable
members from Waterloo

(Hon.

Mr. Euler)

and Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), who moved
and seconded the resolution of May, 1950.
I should like to trace the circumstances that
surrounded us at that time, shortly after the
bringing into existence of NATO. Experienced parliamentarians in this house realized
at once that desirable as NATO was, features
of it were in direct violation of the principles
of democratic government which had been
part and parcel of their existence. It was
natural for them to comment on the inevitable
consequences of such departures.
First I refer to the military clause by which
Canada and the other signatories bound themselves for fifteen years to an agreement that
an armed attack against one or more of them
in Europe or North America would be considered an attack against all of them. Since
its inception other nations have been added to
the membership of NATO, and at the present
time it is comprised of thirteen countries.
This number will be increased to fourteen if
Germany is added.
Anyone who can recall public opinion in
Canada prior to 1939 knows that in those days
we did not accept the idea that the entry of
Britain into war called for an automatic
declaration of war by Canada. At least that
was true of the party to which I belonged,
and I am sure it was the general feeling of
all political parties in this country. Our logic
may have told us that a declaration of war
by Canada in such an event would be an
almost inevitable consequence, but nevertheless we stoutly maintained that the final right
of declaring war rested with our own Parliament.

The second feature of NATO to which I
wish to refer is that to a greater or lesser
degree the NATO agreements called for the
creation of a supra-national army.
This
meant that for the first time in our history
the control of our armed forces was being
taken away from Parliament and placed in
the hands of another organization.
Before
1939 Canada would never have agreed to
hand over the control of its armed forces to
any outside body, not even to a Commonwealth country, despite the fact that those in
command or control there were subject to the
same Sovereign as we were.
Yet, it bas
become an accomplished fact, and now
scarcely ever evokes comment. Honourable
senators will no doubt recall the thread which
ran through the speeches at that time. It
was felt that so radical a departure would
demand new ideas, and some of the elements,
at least, that are necessarily incorporated in
a federal state like Canada or the United
States of America. It was also felt that the
control of armed forces by a centralized body
should be subject to the approval of Parliament. I well recall that four years ago members of this house pointed out that difficult
problems might well arise by our taking so
radical a step, though a desirable one, and
thus departing from the school of thought in
which we had been reared, and from principles we felt to be essential to our system of
government. I say this because the questions
that have arisen from the resolution before us
have a direct bearing on that viewpoint
expressed in this bouse four years ago. The
views expressed here have almost inevitably
followed the same pattern. Instinctively, our
thoughts have turned in two opposite directions, and we have had to decide on whether
it was desirable to take this action or not.
As far as I can sec, there is no difference
between the entry of Germany into NATO
and the entry of any of the other member
nations which have contributed to the armed
forces of that central organization.
In one respect, however, there is a radical
difference. I have always been surprised that
derocratic
countries, particularly Canada
and the United States, have not been more
deeply concerned about handing over control of their military forces te someone outside, particularly in peacetime, but I think
some countries had the impression that they
were only delegating token forces to NATO,
perhaps 5 or 10 per cent of the total force.
But in the case of Western Germany, as the
honourable Leader of the Government bas
quite properly pointed out, as have also the
honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) and others, every endeavour is

JANUARY 27, 1955
being made toward absolute equality, so that
in future there will be no feeling of inferiority on the part of Western Germany. The
treaty states definitely that Germany shall
have no national army, and that her other
armed forces, of which she has a total of
500,000, shall be under the control of NATO.
That means all of her army, token forces and
others. That is in the bond. But I venture
to predict that as time elapses and public
opinion develops-while governments come
and go-almost inevitably Western Germany
will say to her other partners: "Why are
we putting in all our armed forces, when
you are putting in only 5 per cent of yours
and keeping the remainder under national
control?" And I would think that the only
argument could be, "That is in the bond."
You could not answer it logically otherwise.
So, a point might be reached, it seems to me,
when one of two things would inevitably
happen. Either you would have to agree to
control by the national government of Germany-not as in the bond, but on a basis of
equity, with Western Germany having control of her own army-or else you would have
to put in all of your own army.
What the future trend will be, I cannot say.
But I can say this, that the idea behind the
resolution was well expressed by Lord Ismay,
who said that NATO was a revolutionary
experiment in international relations. Such
a radical departure from anything we know
will, in the future, demand at least some
element of the principles of federal union,
if it is to work and to continue to work.
Again, I draw to the attention of honourable senators the foresight displayed by the
mover and seconder of the resolution made
in this house four years ago. When the subject comes before the United States Congress
again, I hope the honourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), or someone else,
will address this house again. I am confident
that whoever speaks when the occasion arises
will display the foresight, clear thinking and
eloquence which so important a subject
merits.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The Hon. the Speaker resumed the Chair.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: I would remind the
house that if the honourable senator speaks
now, he will close the debate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I wish to associate myself with members who
have complimented speakers who took part
in this debate. The debate bas been on a
very high plane. I think both yesterday's
and today's issues of Hansard, together with
504.7-84

the earlier issues to which His Honour the
Speaker referred, will become valuable historic documents, and interesting to read, ten
years hence. I am sure all honourable senators have reason to, feel highly gratified that
this subject has been thoroughly canvassed.
We have not all been able to agree as to
why we should support this agreement. In
fact, the honourable senator from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) does not agree with
me as to who first conceived of the Atlantic
Community. By way of compromise on the
question as to which of two great statesmen
is entitled to the credit, I am willing to say
that Sir Winston Churchill and our own
Prime Minister shared in its creation. My
wish is that when these two great statesmen
are in conference in the United Kingdom
during the next two weeks they will again
conceive of big things which will work for
the benefit of all mankind. I am sure all
honourable senators join with me in extending to our Prime Minister, as he leaves for
the United Kingdom to meet with the Prime
Ministers of the other Commonwealth countries, our very best wishes and prayers that
much good will come fron the conference.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not intend to
review the debate of yesterday and today.
My remarks upon opening the debate constituted a factual statement in which I tried
to trace the history of the United Nations
from its birth, coming down to the creation
of EDC. I referred to the fact that EDC
finally did not receive the approval of
France; and I discussed the agreements made
in London last fall and the resulting Paris
Agreements, which are now before us.
The speeches made by honourable senators over the past two days have contained
further excellent reasons' why this house
should unanimously agree in its support of
the protocol. I had -not the slightest doubt
that the support of this house would be
unanimous, and it became absolutely certain
when His Honour the Speaker, for the first
time in my experience in the Senate, left
the Chair and spoke in support of the resolution. As the house is aware, His Honour does
not ordinarily vote, so honourable senators do
not always know just how he feels about a
subject under discussion. But fortunately on
this very important occasion there is no doubt
at all.
I should like at this time to thank all
honourable senators whô have taken part in
the debate, and to congratulate them on their
excellent speeches. Also, I would express the
hope that in spite of all our misgivings,

world peace will eventually come about and
that the action taken today will be one more
step towards that end.

for a long time, his unexpected demise at this
time saddens all of us in this chamber tonight.
I first became acquainted with Senator
Hurtubise in 1935 when I entered the House
of Commons, where he had then been a member for five years. In that house, and as well
in the Senate, to which he was appointed in
1945, be made a notable contribution to Canadian public aff airs. It is a great pity that
his distinguished career was to some extent
restricted in his declining years by continuous ill health, and unfortunately during
those years our deliberations were deprived
of his wise counsel.
The late Senator Hurtubise was born at
Ste. Anne de Prescott on July 1, 1882, a son
of Joseph and Casilde Lamer Hurtubise. He
received his Bachelor of Arts degree at Bourget College, in Rigaud, and then went on
to Queen's University, from which he graduated in medicine. He subsequently practised
at Sudbury, and was surgeon at St. Joseph's
Hospital there. In recognition of his achievement in his chosen career he was made a
Fellow of the American College of Surgeons,
a distinguished honour which comes to only
a few.

the House of Commons. Those of us who
knew him well-and a good many of us didliked him. We knew him to be a real gentleman, and one who represented to a marked
degree the distinction which attaches to a
medical man who is "tops" in his profession.
Honourable senators, I visited Sudbury two
years ago-not in the capacity of a senatorand I learned from the people up there how
Dr. Hurtubise was beloved as their doctor.
From one end of the district to the other,
every person I met inquired about his health
and about his life in the Senate. As the
honourable Leader of the Government has
said, we have lost a great Canadian. The
French-speaking people of Canada have lost
one of their outstanding medical men, who
for many years to come will be remembered
as one who contributed tremendously to the
medical profession in Canada, especially in
New Ontario.
I join with the Leader of the Government in
conveying to his brothers our feelings of
profound regret in the passing of so great a
Canadian.
(Translation):
Hon. Joseph A. Bradeite: Honourable senators, I feel deeply moved in expressing my
sympathy on the occasion of the death of
senator Joseph Raoul Hurtubise, because
I know that his demise is a great loss
not only for the Senate but for the
whole province of Ontario as well, and
especially for the large area of New Ontario where
he was universally known
and admired. I, myself, have had the privilege of knowing him and of enjoying his
friendship since his arrival in Sudbury in
1910, and I will find it difficult to get used
to the idea that he has gone forever. He
was truly a master in the exercise of his
profession, and his reputation as a prominent
surgeon extended far beyond the confines of
his own province. He exerted himself unstintingly and his services were always available
to his patients, rich or poor. As is also
true of several doctors now listening to me,
he amassed no fortune, but be earned the
gratitude of many people.
He was always interested in public affairs
and simultaneously contributed to numerous
charitable or educational organizations.
He was president of the Separate School
Board of Sudbury for 25 years. He gave
much of his talent and time to the foundation of the orphanage and also to the establishment of new parishes in that part of the
province of Ontario. He was always, from the

moment of its establishment in 1910, one of
the strong supporters and leaders of the
French Canadian Educational Association of
Ontario. He was one of its directors until
1933, when be became its vice-president and
added the latter duties to those of director,
until illness forced him to retire.
(Text):
Senator Hurtubise always had a high
sense of duty, and when convinced of the
justice of the causes he sponsored he would
give the best of himself, regardless of any
personal sacrifices. When the late senator
entered the House of Commons, in 1930,
after having been requested to run as a candidate, he felt that to discharge his responsibilities as a member of Parliament be should
discontinue his large and lucrative medical
practice. From that time onward, until his
serious sickness of some three years ago, he
gave all his time to public affairs, and no
member of Parliament was more meticulous
in attention to duties than was our late colleague. Throughout his fifteen years as a
member of the other house he never left his
office until every letter was answered and
every duty performed. When the late senator
came to this house be brought with him that
same sense of responsibility and attention to
duty.
Senator Hurtubise's activities in the FrenchCanadian Association of Education of Ontario were far reaching. He was fully
convinced of the justness of the cause of
his compatriots in the separate school question. His voice was respected by all, because
not only did he work for unity among his
supporters but he strove to bring his viewpoints before the other sections of the population of the province of Ontario. He was
open minded in his views, and he realized
the necessity of having friends and supporters among the majority of the citizens
in the province. If a better understanding of
this important question has been achievedalthough it is not yet completely settledSenator Hurtubise deserved very much credit
for that result.
Fairly early in his last sickness, an incident occurred which I regard as typical of
the sincere respect and admiration in which
the late senator was held. As I stated a few
moments ago, he was the leading medical
doctor in that fine hospital in Sudbury,
which is operated by the Grey Nuns of the
Cross. When they heard of the serious nature
of the sickness of Senator Hurtubise, out of
gratitude for what he had done for their

SUBSIDIES ON FEED GRAINS
INQUIRY

Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called may I
direct a question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate? It has to do with the
recent reduction of subsidies on feed grains
moving, I think, both east and west. This
action has raised a considerable storm of
protest in British Columbia, as it affects
hundreds of producers, particularly poultrymen and dairymen, and there is much confusion as to the extent of the reduction and
what the effects will be. My question is:
Will the honourable Leader be good enough
to bring in a statement as to what is actually
taking place in this connection?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I shall endeavour to
get the information.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, January
25, consideration of His Excellency the
Governor General's Speech at the opening of
the session and the motion of Hon. Mrs.
Hodges, seconded by Hon. Mr. Tremblay, for
an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
as I have remarked previously, for me to take
part in the debate on the Throne Speech is
almost an annual occurrence; but because of
the smallness of our group, and the seriousness of the problems which face this country
and the world at large, I believe I should take
advantage of the present occasion to express
our ideas and opinions on conditions within

our country, and beyond it. For that reason
I much appreciate the opportunity of taking
part in this debate.
First of all, I would like to congratulate
the mover (Hon. Mrs. Hodges) and the seconder (Hon. Mr. Tremblay) of the Address.
I particularly envy the ability of the seconder to speak with facility in both English
and French. Both the mover and seconder
deserve particular commendation in view of
the fact that, to my mind, the Speech from
the Throne provided meagre material with
which to initiate a debate.
During this debate some honourable senators referred to various functions held in
Ottawa last November on the occasion of
the Queen Mother's visit to Canada. I regret
that I was unable to attend those functions,
but in 1939 I had the pleasure and privilege
of meeting Her Majesty in Ottawa and in
Saskatoon, the nearest city to my home. I
should like to suggest to the Government
that the Queen Mother be appointed the next
Governor General of Canada, to represent
her daughter, Queen Elizabeth, in this senior
dominion and largest of Commonwealth
countries. I think this would be pleasing to
practically all Canadians.
The honourable senator from Victoria
(Hon. Mrs. Hodges) made particular reference to a part of the Speech from the Throne
which indicates that the Government intends
not to do something, but to prevent something from being done, in her native province. That seems rather strange to me. However, I can assure the honourable lady that
she has my sympathy, for I too live in a
province that has dared to vote for a provincial government of a political stripe other
than that of the high and mighty government
in Ottawa, and I have suffered disabilities
in many ways, just as she has. However, in
this instance, I think it is a piece of purely
political spite work. All the people in thé
district concerned speak of the valuable land,
and the desirability of a low level storage
dam which has been proposed. Honourable
senators, I have been in that territory, and
I know that there is immense power available for development; there is no shortage
of power available at all.
In this connection, it is worth noting that
we are on the verge of great developments
through the use of atomic power. The world's
first atomic-powered submarine has recently
been completed in the United States.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: At a cost of $55 million.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Since this session started
that submarine has left a New Jersey dock,
gone on a cruise of several days, made a

Columbia:
Dear Sir:
A number of letters have appeared in your
paper recently why the proposed Kaiser Dam should
not be built on the Arrow Lakes. Now let us look
at a few points why it should be built and right
away, too.
Two main points against it seem to be that
certain farm lands will be flooded, and that it will
supply industries across the line with power rather
than having the industries in Canada.
Let's look at the farm first. Our member of
parliament has said that "thousands of acres will be
flooded". This seems to be greatly exaggerated for
there will be relatively few settlements that will
be affected. A great number of those affected are
not being farmed anyway, as the owners obtain
most of their revenue from logging or outside jobs.
Some of the so-called farms would not produce
enough to keep a gopher alive anyway, so their
loss would not harm anything and the owners
would be compensated for the loss in any case.
Considering what these farms might produce if
worked, would it mean a revenue to the province
of a million dollars a year as the dam will do?
Certainly not.
Then again, we do not know when nature will
flood these farms again as it did in 1948.

Some of Yeu may say "Listen to that Social
Crediter talking, and it is certain that lie has
nothing to lose."
You are quite wrong there,
because I am not a Social Crediter and I will lose
my home and business if the Kaiser dam is built,
but I realize that with every advancement, someone must suffer and I am big enough to put up
with the trouble that it will cause me for the
benefits that it will be to the province and the
industries that it will bring in.
Let's get along with the work on the Kaiser
dam and eut out this idea of making a political
football out of it, for it seems to be what some
are trying to do.
Yours truly,

H. W. Stones.

The writer of the letter apparently lives

the letter?

Hon. Mr. Reid: Maybe, but do not think that
I don't.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I am suspicious that it is
purely a political move on the part of this
Government and nothing else.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I will tell you more of that
tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Well, you will have to
do quite a bit of explaining to convince me.
The argument of the honourable senator from
Victoria (Hon. Mrs. Hodges) is that the
United States gets the benefit. Furthermore,
she boasted, and rightfully so, of the great
aluminum development at Kitimat, but it bas
been macle possible only through the investment of United States capital and the purchase by the United States Government of
aluminum under a five-year contract.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: But the aluminum plant
was established in British Columbia and not
in the United States.
Hon. Mr. Horner: As I say, it was made
possible only through the Government of the
United States contracting to buy five years'
production of ýaluminum. The Westcoast
Transmission Company's pipeline that the
honourable senator (Hon. Mrs. Hodges)
boasted of will be feasible and possible only
if the Government allows that company to
sell natural gas to the United States.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: What about your wheat?
Where do you sell your wheat?
Hon. Mr. Horner: I could tell you about
that-that is something I do know about.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: It is all right to co-operate with the United States in these schemes,
but, according to some people, we are not
only co-operating but we are being ordered
about by the United States.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: You do not believe that,
do you?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Well, I .sometimes doubt
if we are doing things on our own or not.
Let us take the development of the St.
Lawrence Seaway.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: What about it?
Hon. Mr. Horner: An extensive area will
be flooded, and from what I know, it will
include some really good farm land. May I
say that I was perhaps the only one who
objected to, or, to say the least, who was not
enthusiastic about the development of the
St. Lawrence. Grand old farmsteads along
that river. villages and towns in that pioneer
section of the country, are to be submerged.

Furthermore, there is a stipulation in the
agreement covering this development that a
toll is to be levied on ships passing througha sort of toll-gate on the Rhine, if you willto pay the costs. I would like to know what
that is going to mean. I expect it will be
like a number of other things, that we in
the West will be paying the piper to build up
industry in eastern Canada.
On the eve of atomic power development

electric power on the St. Lawrence.
course, a deep seaway is to be built in connection with this power development: the
plans call for a 27-foot depth of water in
the canals. Now, so far we have been getting
along very well with existing facilities on
the St. Lawrence. Foreign ships have come
up the river, proceeded through the canals
and across the Great Lakes as far as Fort
William, unloading their cargoes en route, and
then loaded wheat at Fort William and
returned to Liverpool; and the cost of transporting wheat in that way from the head of
the lakes to Liverpool is, I would say, onethird of what we pay to move wheat down to
Montreal. I am told that to build the canal
three feet deeper-that is 30 feet, instead of
27 feet, as proposed-would increase the cost
by $400 million. What about these costs?
They will have to be paid some day. But
all we hear in the meantime is "Let us get
going, let us spend the money, even if we
do go into debt", and if anyone offers a word
in criticism he is told, "Oh, you are not progressive".
The St. Lawrence Seaway interests me for
another reason altogther, and that is in its
relation to the Hudson Bay route. I am
afraid that that route will become neglected.
May I say, though, that I am glad to have
some praise to offer the Government.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: A large addition being
built to the elevator at Churchill will increase
its capacity by 2,500,000 bushels. I made a
trip to Churchill last fall, the second that I
have made there, and I am sorry that what I
learned then I had not learned on my first
trip. I found that the elevator facilities for
loading, cleaning and so on are capable of
handling 10 million bushels per year. While
I was there work was going ahead on the
building of the addition, and I thought what
a pity the elevator had not been made large
enough in the beginning, because this added
space would have cost very little extra then.
However, we are thankful for what we have.

SENATE
Weather has a great deal to do with the
movement of ships through Hudson Bay.
While I was there I learned that the most
modern means of forecasting are employed,
including radar. In spite of all that we are
simply not making the use that we should
make of that port. It is well known in western
Canada that a crop can be insured provided it
is seeded between April 15 and May 15. However, in the West, seasonal weather varies as
much as a month, so much so that in some
years we would quite prudently seed on April
15, whereas in other years we would not seed
a bushel until May 20 or 22. Now, similar
variations in seasonal weather occur in Hudson Bay. Besides that, the winds play a great
part in the operation of ships across Hudson
Bay. Wind blowing from a northerly direction
moves loose ice to the south shore of the bay,
whereas a southerly wind will drive the loose
ice and icebergs into the channel. The one
will leave a clear channel, the other a channel
cluttered with ice floes. Last fall the bay was
open for navigation for three weeks, but I
firmly believe ships could have safely made
the harbour at Churchill three weeks earlier
than they did, because a south wind had been
blowing for a wveek and moved the ice and
any icebergs into the channel. I saw in that
port some fine looking ships, which had
brought in a considerable variety of goods
and which later took away large cargoes of
grain.
While I am on the subject of Churchill, I
have another request that I would like the
honourable Leader to bring to the attention
of the Government: that is, that a customs
office be located at Churchill for the convenience of firms which might and should import
through that port. Western Canadian business
firms should import more goods through
Churchill, and I believe they would do so if
customs could be cleared at that port. The
Hudson Bay route is a thousand miles shorter
than the St. Lawrence route, and I understand
that the masters of ships using the Hudson
Bay route like it very much.
A customs
office, I am told, would be a great boon and
convenience to that port. A port authority
is located there, and it seems to me that it
would not be too heavy a burden for the
government to establish a customs office there.
I would like now to say a few words about
the railroad. I was talking to the superintendent of that line and I was told that for two
hundred miles going down to Churchill the
road is on a gradual slope and is perhaps the
easiest piece of railroad to maintain in all
Canada, because the land there is covered
with muskeg with a perma-frost base underneath. I am firmly convinced that the road
should be used for three months every year,

and that if it were we could easily ship 100
million bushels of wheat annually through
Churchill.
There is another matter. On these trips
there are a man and a woman, very capable
people, interested in the On-To-The-Bay
Association. They sell badges at two dollars
apiece; and to boost their project they have
issued a book, but some of the material in it
is not very convincing. For one thing, they
urge the Alberta government to co-operate
with them in the assumed interest of Alberta
farmers.
Again, they want the Canadian
Pacific Railway to be granted running rights
over the road to Churchill in order that it may
carry grain there. The first suggestion seems
to me rather ridiculous, because for most of
Alberta the natural grain outlet is the port of
Vancouver. Also there is no point in granting running rights over the Churchill road to
the C.P.R., because 150 million bushels of
grain are raised in the areas served by the
Canadian National Railways. I see that Eastern interests still voice objection to the Hudson Bay route. The president of the Montreal
Corn Exchange Association is reported, in an
article headed "Grain ships may bypass
Montreal", as lamenting the fact that thirtysix vessels deserted Montreal for Churchill
last year. These Montreal interests seem to
think they are entitled to handle our grain
whether or not the eastern route is more
expensive. They opposed shipments by the
west coast: I remember how strongly it wvas
contended at one time that grain could not
move through the Panama Canal because it
would heat.
I believe it would be for the general good
of Canada if a railroad were constructed
from Flin Flon to serve the great area in the
pre-Cambrian shield which is loaded with
minerals of all kinds: This is an outlay
which would benefit Canada a great deal
more than huge expenditures on the St.
Lawrence route. To my thinking, one of the
most precious of our assets is good land; we
have not too much of it, and it is deplorable
that fertile farms should be flooded. There
are high hopes that with the increase of
power, heavy machinery and all sorts of
other manufactures will be produced in great
quantities; but remember that, while there
is a saturation point for manufactures, the
growing of food ministers to an everincreasing demand.
I will now refer for a few minutes to some
statements of the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald). In reply
to a question by the honourable Leader on
this side (Hon. Mr. Haig) with regard to the
employment situation in Canada, he said that
a current news release showed that in the

FEBRUARY 2, 1955
week ended December 11, 1954, a total of
5,167,000 people were employed. This figure
seems to me rather surprising. It represents
a very large proportion of a total population
of 15 million people, and, if correct, it is very
gratifying. It seems to me that the total must
include persons self-employed as well as
those who work for others.
The honourable Leader of the Government
went on to produce figures in relation to
what the honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) calls taxation at all levels
of government. The Government Leader
seems to have thought that, by citing some
lower rates of personal income tax applicable
to Canadians as contrasted with persons in
similar income brackets in the United States,
he had completely answered the criticisms
of our leader. But the fact is that the reply
was very partial and incomplete. One reads,
for instance, that exchange teachers from
Great Britain, though they receive on this
side salaries larger than they get in England,
have to resort to baby-sitting in order to
keep going, and this, in spite of a bonus;
while Ontario teachers temporarily transferred to England benefit from the much
lower cost of living there. As regards the
lower income tax levied on married Canadians, if they are cigarette users the increased
cost of cigarettes entirely wipes out the tax
benefit. If they have an automobile-and most
married couples want to own a car-the
differential in favour of Americans is $500;
a refrigerator costs $100 more here than in
the States; and for almost any electrical
appliance used in the home, the price here
is much higher. I know what conditions in
the United States are, and I say that the cost
of living there is less right across the board.
The other day I mentioned this to a Liberal
member of Parliament who lives close to
the border; and he said, "I have to admit
you are right." We shall have to look very
seriously into the matter of a reduction of
our cost of living.
I see also in the Speech from the Throne
that measures are proposed to provide for
the establishment of standards for all agricultural products. If I had the authority,
I would standardize a provision of a sufficient
amount of the products of the farm which
are served to the public. In that regard, two
Ottawa restaurants deserve some favourable
publicity for including a fair amount of meat
in the portions they provide. One local
restaurant serves for 98 cents half a pound
of T-bone steak; another-which I think is
known as the Golden Grill-serves threequarters of a pound of steak. But generally,
in respect of meals, the Canadian working
man who depends on public eating places
for his food is much worse off than his

brother in the United States. That is the
verdict of practically all Americans who
come here as tourists.
Our Government takes pride and claims
some political prestige because the Canadian
dollar is at a premium over the American
dollar. But this achievement is costing us
a lot of money. The psychology of the thing
is that when our dollar is worth more, Canadians tend to travel south in much larger
numbers; but when the advantage is in
favour of American currency, large numbers
of Americans come over here and buy freely.
I have just been reading an article which
describes our difficulties in the field of textiles, electrical appliances, and other branches
of manufacturing. It refers to a special report
recently issued by three university professors, wherein it was stated that with the
depreciation of the pound sterling it is now
possible for a British manufacturer, incurring the sterling equivalent of a Canadian
dollar's worth of wage costs, to cover those
costs by receiving 56 Canadian cents.
I believe I have made it sufficiently clear
that a comparison of the income tax figures
in Canada and in the United States represents
only part of the overall picture. In arriving
at comparative costs of living it is necessary
to know all the factors that enter into costs,
not merely income tax. Let me repeat that
the higher cost of cigarettes in Canada would
in itself equal any saving made by a Canadian in income tax.
I am concerned about Canada's present
unemployment situation, and I am really fearful about the future. Last year I expressed
alarm when the Government undertook to
guarantee 98 per cent of the money loaned
by banks on real estate under national bousing programs. At that time I feared the ordinary investor who advanced money in the
field of speculative home building would
soon find himself caught. Well, this is happening right now in several cities across
Canada. Buildèrs, unable to sell their houses,
are up against it to recover the money they
have invested. Where is this all going to lead?
Canada is badly in need of a vigorous
immigration program. Immigrants are needed
to fill some of these bouses, to work on the
land and to become consumers. But not a
word was mentioned about this in the Speech
from the Throne. We express concern about
labour problems, yet all the while we are
being driven down the socialistic road. It is
all right for the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) to say to our Leader
(Hon. Mr. Haig) "Would you take away these
social benefits?" Well, I have said it before
and I say it again: once you go down this
slippery road there is no climbing back. And

SENATE

as for asking, "Would you take away baby
bonuses and old age pensions?", you might
just as well ask a person how popular he
would be with a child if he gave him a piece
of candy and then took it away-no matter
how injurious he thought the candy might be
to the child. We are being driven down the
road of socialism, and much faster than is at
all necessary in a country like Canada.
I spoke earlier about living in a province
whose Government is of a different political
party from the one in power in Ottawa. Not
too long ago we were treated to some fine
entertainment in Saskatchewan when the
Liberals held a convention there.
Unfortunately the occasion was marred by the
death in a plane crash of a leading candidate.
I followed the convention activities from the
sidelines, and judging by newspaper accounts
it appeared that there was more criticism
from the ranks of the Liberals themselves
about "Gardiner" and other political machines
than ever came from my own party. It was
fine entertainment while it lasted. They had
L. B. Thomson, Director of the Prairie Farm
Rehabilitation Act, resign his position to contest the provincial leadership of the Liberal
party, and when he lest out in that endeavour he was reappointed to his former post
with the P.F.R.A. It reminds me of the old
words: "Off agin, on agin, gone agin, Finnigin". It has been said that be was the only
person with his qualifications available for
the post. Well, it always wearies me when I
hear the old story that a person cannot be
replaced in his job. It is pure nonsense.
Honourable senators, all the political fun
that is being had over the South Saskatchewan River Project is good for at least another
election or two. The supposition is that if the
electors are good people and vote Liberal the
project will not cost them too much money,
but if they vote contrarywise it will cost
them dearly.
An Hon. Sena±or: Order.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I certainly hope our
province never puts up too much money for
that purpose. I remember some thirty-six
years ago seeing an irrigation project at
Bassano, Alberta. They were exhibiting some
tall clover in a glass container to show what
could be achieved by irrigation, and so on.
A terrific boom was predicted for the area,
but Bassano is still no bigger than my own
home town of Blaine Lake. In some areas
where ditches were dug the water still lies
in the natural prairie, and the land has been
used for ranching purposes. Of course, some
of the trouble might be due to alkaline elements which make the land difficult to flood.

Honourable members, I want to refer again
to Canada's unemployment situation. Any
good farmer looks ahead at least one year.
If he summer fallows his whole land in one
year be will have no crop to harvest, and be
will be preparing for the next year. Now,
what about industry? I am fearful of what
will happen when ail the present housing
contracts have been completed. We have to
stop somewhere. Our population is not increasing, our export markets are falling off
and there will be a further shortage of jobs.
How are we going to sell our manufactured
products? The producing power of the farmer
has diminished, because of inadequate prices
for his products, and the farmer is the main
purchaser of manufactured goods in Canada.
I am sorry the honourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) is net in his place,
for I think we are approaching the time I
predicted when I would win the last round
in my battle with him over the prohibition
of margarine. Incidentally, I am glad to be
able to commend the Government and the
Minister of Agriculture for making surplus
Canadian butter available at a reduced price
to our hospitals and other institutions. I
think it is a very sensible thing to do. I would
continue to offer them butter at a reduced
price if they, in turn, would promise to discontinue the purchase of margarine.
Basically, Canada is an agricultural country. Now I note that we are importing cheese
from New Zealand again. The Liberal Government, if it is not careful, is apt to take
a great slide-perhaps not as slippery as on
butter-as it did in 1930. New Zealand has
a mild climate all the year round. Farmers
in that country do not need barns for their
cattle; all they need is a cheap shed with a
thin roof to shelter the cows, which are
milked by machine. The farmer drives
around in his big automobile and opens up
the paddocks to let his cattle graze from one
field to another. No summer fallowing is
required, and there is no problem of seeding.
When the land is neutralized, or converted
from its wild state, some expense and labour
are entailed, but the grass, once grown, becomes permanent pasture. The Canadian
farmer, on the other hand, must house and
provide feed for his dairy cattle for six
months of the year. This keeps him busy
doing chores for almost seven days of the
week. And, honourable senators, I want te
say this, that if the Canadian farmer were
paid in relation to the labour ho expends,
he should receive about $1 per lb. for butter.
However, I think it might be wise on the
part of the farmers, and also good for the
country, if they said, "We farmers will take

FEBRUARY 2, 1955

fifty cents a pound for butter." I do not say
that it would bring the farmers any profit.
We spend great sums of money training our
young people in universities, but I do not
know of a better "university" for training
young folks than the farm, where they can
look after milch cows. Farming has compensations which far outweigh the making
of profits.
On the question of which is to be preferred
-work or idleness-I should like to read an
article entitled, "The wheat under the stone",
which appeared last fall in the Saskatoon
Star-Phoenix:
"Is it true that over-worked men are less happy,
less healthy, and shorter-lived than others?"
This question was once asked by Sir William
Robertson Nicoll, the celebrated editor of The
British Weekly. It is an important question.
He said:
And what was Sir William's reply?
"I do not believe it . . . There are three or four
of my friends who might fairly be described as
work-drunk. They are always busy and always
ready to take on more. Two of them are not
physically robust . . . They never brood, they
are generally helpful; they have little relaxation,
but what they have is relished with an intensity
of joy. They are people who keep young in the
true sense."
Then Sir William turned to the others whom
he knew-those with a too abundant leisure. "I
think of those who are under-worked, and I will
not say that I have not sometimes envied them
their leisure, but I have never envied them long,
nor have I ever felt that the envy was rational."
And Sir William Robertson Nicoll was very right.
Quite apart frcm the usefulness work may have to
others, it is an excellent means of preserving the
soundness of life itself. Work holds a person's
life together. By its very demands, it drives out
much of the worry and broodings and trifling
irritability that might otherwise enter in and take
possession.
Of cour e, there is always the disturbing feeling
that work is consuming one's time. And there
is, even at best, so little time for anyone on this
The weeks pass rapidly for the hard
earth.
worker, and it is Saturday again before he knows

becomes, the more he is aware that time is slipping
by too quickly for his own ease of mind.
Yet work is not something that is stealing one's
life away. It is part of life, and a good part. It
heightens the pleasures of such change and leisure
as may come. For the leisure is earned. And
there is something wonderfully precious about it,
from the very consciousness that work must be
resumed.
It can easily become an illusion that if only we
didn't have to work, we might really get down to
the busines; of living. But working and living are
so close together that they are not easily separated,
at least not for long.
It is the idle, or the indifferent worker, who is
most likely to be full of complaints, and grievances,
and nervous apprehensions. There is nothing new
about this. It was all thoroughly well understood
by the quaint old writer of the 17th century,
Robert Burton. In his book on the "Anatomy of
Melancholy", he analyzed all the causes that contribute to man's unhappiness.
He recognized idleness for what it is. "Idleness",
he wrote, "is the bane of body and mind, the nurse
of naughtiness, the chief mother of all mischief,
one of the seven deadly sins, the devil's cushion,
his pillow and chief reposal . . ."

These are strong words. But old Robert Burton
went on to say, with a great deal of plain wisdom:
"Thus much I dare boldly say: he or she that is
idle . . . they shall never be pleased, never well
in body or mind, but weary still, sickly still,
vexed still, loathing still, weeping, sighing, grieving, suspecting, offended with the world, with
every object, wishing themselves dead or gone, or
else carried away with some foolish phantasie or
other."
Back in the 17th century Robert Burton was
considering the same question as Sir William
Robertson Nicoll was considering in the 20th
Work
century. They found the same answer.
is not a thief, stealing away life itself from those
blessing
who cannot escape. It is, rather, a vast
giving taste to the bread, order to the mind, zest
to leisure, and a useful soundness to the days
that pass.
More than a century ago a very wise Archbishop
of Mayence, who knew the human heart well,
used to say: "The human heart is like a millstone.
If you put wheat under it, it grinds the wheat
into flour. If you put no wheat, it grinds on, but
then 'tis itself it wears away."

Honourable senators, I believe that is true.

I may get a good calling down for suggesting it, but I think that the introduction of
margarine has done a great injury to the
economy of this country, and bas discouraged
many a farmer from keeping a herd of cattle.
The honourable senator from Medicine Hat
(Hon. Mr. Gershaw) related an entertaining
story of his trip to Kenya, and of his impressions of that severely troubled country. I
found his speech most interesting.
The honourable senator from Peterborough
West (Hon. Mr. Duffus) also told a very
interesting story, of the life of David Fife, to
whom we owe the discovery of Red Fife
Wheat. For many years I was in that part
of the country where David Fife had carried
on his experiments, and I was pleased to have
the fact brought back to my mind. Admittedly, Red Fife was a wonderful wheat. I
recall that on one occasion I had a crop of
it ripen in less than one hundred days, thanks
to a warm wind. To this day any western
farmer will tell you that Red Fife was a good
frost-resistant wheat. In our part. of the
country it suffered little from rust and generally stood many of the calamities better
than the wheat we are growing today.
Certainly, we could seed Red Fife earlier
than we now seed Thatcher, a type which
almost always results in a poor crop if seeded
before the ground is thoroughly warm. I can
recall sowing Red Fife so early that the horses
had to be turned around in a snowbank at
the end of the field, but the wheat grew in
spite of the cold weather.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: What about Marquis
Wheat?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Well, Marquis was a
wonderful wheat too. As the honour able

SENATE
senator from Peterborough West (Hon. Mr.
Duffus) told us, that wheat was developed
from Red Fife.
I can recall an experience in my early days
of farming when I went to my neighbour
and tried to buy enough of his nice bin of
Red Fife to plant some thirty-five acres. I
told him I did not have enough money to take
a full bushel to the acre. He had found himself in the same predicament, he told me,
and had planted only a half bushel, but it
produced forty bushels to the acre. I said,
"I will try it, and hope for the best." I
recall that was a dry year, the land had been
broken with oxen and the next Spring the
catch in the low spots was quite good but
on the high land it was very poor. It was
not until the fifth of June that there was suffi-.
cient moisture to give full germination to
some 80 per cent of that field; nevertheless,
that Red Fife wheat, planted at a half bushel
to the acre, produced thirty-five bushels to
the acre.
As honourable senators may know, we at
one time thought Red Fife had a tendency
to shell, and in the earlier days it was a
common sight to see any number of binders
going out to cut wheat by moonlight to avoid
loss. The harvesting was done at the time
when shelling was likely to be most severe.
But it has since been found that Red Fife
grain that is missed by the binder along the
fences can remain on the ground all winter
and still be quite firm in the spring. With
the use of combines today it could be
harvested with no fear of loss from shelling.
One often hears people in Western Canada
today express the wish that they could again
get a bit of pure Red Fife. In places where
they do not suffer from rust, I am sure they
would be glad to go back to it.
Hon. Mr. Howden: What about rust?
Hon. Mr. Horner: I think the average
farmer would tell you that it is more subject
to rust than some other wheats. I recall back
in 1916 that the rust in my part of the
country was a very serious factor in wheat
growing, and the southern parts of both
Manitoba and Saskatchewan have often been
harder hit than the northern areas. Last
year the farmers thought that in Thatcher
they had a truly rust-free wheat. However,
the variety of rust that hit it had a tendency
to weaken the straw, so that the grain broke
down and lay some six inches above the
ground, making it very difficult to harvest
by combine.
Hon. Mr. Howden: We now have a rustproof wheat, Selkirk.

Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes; I have seen some of
it and its head appears to resemble that of
the Red Fife. I understand there were places
where the rust hit the straw but did not
seem to affect the head. However, it must be
kept in mind that new types of so-called
rust-proof wheat must be introduced from
time to time to meet the ever-changing
character of the rust which attacks it.
Honourable senators, I should like now to
discuss for a few minutes the subject of toll
roads, a devi.ce which I favour very much.
I have been over the New Jersey Turnpike
and some 175 miles of toll road west of
Washington, and I never met anyone who
objected to paying the toll. To me tolls are
an eminently fair way of meeting the cost
of road building, because the huge truckers
and other people who use the road most pay
the larger portion of its cost. In other words,
it is built and maintained by the people
who use it.
To my way of thinking, toll roads would
be a good thing for the province of Saskatchewan, and if we had the right Government
we might obtain them. We also need toll
bridges. As honourable senators know we
have in that province two branches of the
Saskatchewan River and crossings are made
for the most part by ferry. I recall last
summer seeing some twenty-five cars lined
up at one point waiting to cross by ferry.
A further serious problem is that when the
water is low there is a sharp drop from the
ramp down to the ferry boat, which often
tears the rear bumpers off cars as they go
aboard. Still further there is the serious
inconvenience of a six-week tie-up between
the time when the ferry stops running and
the ice becomes safe for travel. Occuring, as
it does, in both the spring and fall, there is
a crossing tie-up every year of some three
months. Needless to say, the people living
in these areas would welcome the opportunity
to pay a reasonable toll charge to meet the
cost of a bridge.
Honourable senators, I should like to touch
for a few minutes on the much discussed
subject of narcotic drugs. In this connection,
I may well comment on the question of a
wider examination of food products. I should
like the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) to make some comment about, for instance, the need for
removing the poisonous colouring from brown
bread. Further, I think our liquors should be
examined more closely for drugs. We are
sometimes inclined to think because they
come to us bottled and sealed that they are
free of any contamination.
I recall visiting San Antonio during the
drought season, and being shown a row of

FEBRUARY 2, 1955
bottles, one of which was a type of gin
bottle with the fine writing on it which the
British were sure no one could imitate. So
I said to a fellow "How do you get that in
here?" His reply was that all the bottles and
the stuff in them were made right in San
Antonio, Texas.
In a United States periodical I read that
governments today are collecting excise
revenue on about half the liquor that is consumed. What does that mean? That must
mean that some of it, a considerable part of
it, is made with drugs, and I am pretty sure
that a great deal of the liquor consumed in
Canada is made in that way. In the olden
days when men logged this Ottawa valley
they did not go crazy and kill one another
after consuming liquor. Alcohol at that time
was cheap, and what they consumed was
distilled alcohol, distilled whisky, which
caused them no harm. But when drugs are
put in it, the effect is to send men wild. Our
governments are exacting such a high toll
of taxes on liquor that there is a strong
temptation to adulterate it, and I believe that
some people are not resisting this temptation.
Now, honourable senators, I have covered
most of the ground that I intended to cover,
and I appreciate very much your kind
attention.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. George H. Ross: Honourable senators,
in following the honourable member from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) I do not
propose to discuss the Kaiser Dam other than
to say that I do not share his view with
respect to it. Nor do I share his view with
regard to the comparative importance of the
St. Lawrence Seaway and the Hudson Bay
route.
Rather, this afternoon I propose to discuss
the Indian problem in the prairie provinces.
In the early years following Confederation,
Canada treated the prairie Indians and Metis
not as human beings in a neighboring colony,
but as wild animals to be hunted and
exterminated. Since then Canada has mellowed a great deal towards them, particularly
in the last few years. There is still much
room for improvement.
On July 15, 1870, Canada purchased from
the Hudson's Bay Company the Canadian
prairies, and acquired from Great Britain
the right to govern the same. For some time
prior to that Fort Garry and the adjoining
territory constituted a separate British colony
known as Red River, which exercised selfgovernment under the sovereignty of Great
Britain. Canada then had no interest in any
part of the Northwest Territories.

Self government in Red River came about
in this way. In the year 1670 King Charles II
granted to the Hudson's Bay Company ownership of all the territory drained by waters
flowing into the Hudson Bay and the right to
govern the country under the sovereignty of
Great Britain. In 1869 William McTavish
the governor of the Hudson's Bay Company
abdicated as governor of the territory, leaving
it without any government. Anarchy then
prevailed.
"No matter how anarchy is produced, it is
quite open by the law of nations, for the
inhabitants to form a government, ex
necessitate, for the protection of life and
property," as Sir John A. Macdonald wrote
in a letter to Governor designate William
McDougall, who from the village of Pembina
in North Dakota was attempting to override
(Strange
the Red River Government.
Empire, by J. K. Howard, p. 154.)
In accordance with that principle, the
residents of Fort Garry and of the territory
extending in every direction for 50 miles
therefrom had elected a Legislative Council
which governed this area until it became a
part of Canada. (Howard, p. 122. Life and
Times of Louis Riel, by W. M. Davidson. n. 35)
The membership of the council was made
up of the best intellects in the country, including Judge Black, Chief Justice under
Hudson's Bay rule; Henry Cochrane, a full
blooded Cree Indian who was in charge of the
Anglican Mission of St. Peter's; Henry Prince,
an Indian Chief of the Saulteux Indians;
James Ross, a Scotch Metis who had graduated with high honors from Toronto University, was an able lawyer and was formerly
on the editorial staff of the Toronto Globe;
John Sutherland who was afterwards a member of the Canadian Senate; Dr. Curtis J.
Bird, who had been educated in London and
had gained a reputation for professional
ability, and other distinguished citizens. Louis
Riel, a brilliant, practical and highly educated young Metis, was their first secretary.
He later was elected president. The Imperial
Government notified them how far they could
go without breaking the law. (The Northwest
Mounted Police, by J. P. Turner. P. 44.
Howard, p. 154. History of Manitoba, by
Gunn and Tuttle, p. 381.)
By the late 1860's wild life on the prairies
was becoming scarce and it became necessary
for the residents to look to ways other than
hunting and trapping to supplement their
means of living. Acting on the advice of
Louis Riel, hundreds of natives and settlers
had purchased river lots for which they held
legal titles from the Hudson's Bay Company.

SENATE
The river lots were surveyed according to a
plan which gave the lot a small river frontage
and appurtenant water rights, and extended
back two miles on the open prairie. On these
lots the owners built their homes, churches
and schools and tilled the soil. (Howard, pp.
94, 147.)
The trouble in the Northwest Territories in
1869 and 1870 is often referred to as the Red
River rebellion. The term rebellion connotes
armed resistance from within a country to
the established government. There was no
such resistance in Red River (Howard, p. 113.)
It is true that a minor revolt was stirred ue
largely by an insolent ruffian named Scott,
who mustered 100 men at Portage la Prairie
to march on Red River to destroy the Government. But as the marchers neared Fort
Garry and learned the facts, nearly all of
them disbanded and returned to their homes.
A few carried on. Scott and a few followers
killed a half-wit Metis youth named Parisien
who was suspected of being a spy by slicing
open one side of his head with an axe, and
binding him with two sashes and dragging
him head first through the snow. But the
murderers were soon rounded up and subdued.
Scott was tried by court-martial, found guilty
and shot by a firing squad. (Davidson, p. 40.
Howard pp. 175, 182.)
The treatment of the Indians and Metis
by the Imperial Government was at all times
worthy of the best traditions of British
statesmanship. It recognized Indians and
Metis as human beings having unquestionable rights to life, liberty and property. The
trouble arose by reason of Canada invading
their territory. The residents defended themselves, their homes and their country's rights
against the unprovoked, cruel and vicious
attacks of the Canadians who were foreigners in the Red river and had no greater
rights there than they had in the State of
New York. This was not rebellion. It was
simply a matter of free men defending themselves and their homes against the unwarranted attacks of foreigners.
May I now refer briefly to the many
wrongs committed by Canada against the
natives of Red River while it was a self-governing colony under the British Crown and
before Canada acquired any rights therein.
In July, 1869, Colonel J. S. Dennis, a land
surveyor, was sent by the Government of
Canada to the colony with a crew of land
surveyors and equipment to make a survey
according to a checker-board plan.
They
ignored the survey already made, under which
river lots had been sold, and refused to
recognize the titles issued by the Hudson's
Bay Company to purchasers thereof. This
stirred up much hostility among the natives

towards Canada.
(Howard p. 93. McDougafl
of Alberta, by John Maclean, p. 133. Between
the Red and the Rockies, by Grant MacEwan,
p. 50.)
In September, 1869, Canada appointed
William McDougall, its Minister of Public
Works, Governor of the Northwest Territories.
He and his staff appeared at the border with a
display of pomp and trappings like a great
satrap. He had 60 wagons and carts carrying
him and his retinue, their baggage and 300
rifles. The Government of Red River did
not allow them to enter the country. (Howard,
p. 194, 112.)
MeDougall thereupon undertook to govern
the colony from Pembina. Some days later
he produced a fraudulent proclamation describing himself as "our trusted and well
beloved William McDougall" and giving him
authority to govern; to it the signature of the
Queen was forged. (Davidson, p. 24. Howard,
p. 141.)
On the same day MeDougall isued a commission appointing surveyor Dennis "Conservator o1 the Peace," authorizing him to
raise, equip and use an army to overthrow the
Government of Red River. Armed with that
commission Dennis made his way to Winnipeg, enrolled an armed force of 40 or 50
men, and took possession of Fort Garry. But
they were quickly rounded up and imprisoned. (Davidson, p. 24. Howard, p. 141. Gunn
and Tuttle, p. 365.)
In 1869 Donald A. Smith, the future Lord
Strathcona, appeared at Fort Garry as Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company but not of
the territory. He recognized the Riel government and gave a pledge that he would take
no step to upset it. (Davidson, p. 31. Howard,
p. 173.
Macoun, p. 464.) On behalf of the
Government of Canada he appeared before
the Red River Assembly and urged them to
send delegates to Ottawa with a bill of rights
to negotiate with the Canadian Government
in the event of Canada acquiring the Northwest Territories.
The Assembly agreed to
do so upon Smith, "speaking on behalf of the
Government of Canada", undertaking that the
delegates would receive a "cordial reception".
(Gunn and Tuttle, p. 382. Davidson, p. 45.)
Judge Black, the Reverend Mr. Ritchot
and Alfred Scott were sent. At the Ontario
frontier delegates Ritchot and Scott were met
by a magistrate who offered them an escort
to Ottawa. They accepted and were escorted
to jail and charged with complicity in murder.
As no case could be made out against them,
they were released. (Howard, p. 190.)
At that time Canada was negotiating with
the Hudson's Bay Company for the purchase

FEBRUARY 2, 1955
of the Northwest Territories, and with Great
Britain to take over the government of the
country under the sovereignty of the Queen.
The terms had to be acceptable to the residents of the territory. A plan was worked
out, satisfactory to the delegates, under
which the Northwest Territories was to become a part of Canada as of July 15, 1870;
the province of Manitoba was created on the
basis of the Bill of Rights presented by the
delegates; a general amnesty was to be
granted to every one implicated in the movement to defend themselves against the unprovoked attacks by the Canadians; the
Government of Canada undertook to respect
the rights of individuals and to settle Indian
claims "in conformity with equitable principles which have uniformly governed the
British Crown in its dealings with the
aborigines", (Howard, p. 70); and the Riel
Government should carry on until a new
Lieutenant Governor should arrive at Fort
Garry. (Howard, p. 192.)
On May 17, 1870, 1,200 troops had left
Toronto for the West, allegedly only for
police duty, under Colonel Wolseley, who
issued a proclamation which Riel had printed
and broadcast. It said in part, "our mission
is one of peace". As the army neared Red
River, Wolseley sent one Butler out to interview Riel. Riel told Butler that Red River
would receive Wolseley's army on its "mission of peace" with a friendly welcome and
that he, Riel, would resign his authority to
the new Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba
upon his arrival.
As Colonel Wolseley's army came in sight
of Fort Garry, Riel received reports from
reliable sources that Wolseley's plan was to
capture Fort Garry by surprise, and capture
or kill Riel in the battle. Learning of this,
members of the Riel Government drifted
away. Riel and two of his friends left for
Pembina until it could be determined if they
would be safe in Manitoba.
On entering Fort Garry, Colonel Wolseley
paid off his troops and issued a proclamation
praising their fortitude. In it he denounced
the Métis. His noble force, he said, had
routed the "banditti". Ten days later, on
September 2, 1870, the new Governor, Adam
G. Archibald, arrived at Fort Garry. In the
interval the settlement was without any government. The troops went wild. The massive
gates of Fort Garry were battered down by
the excited soldiers. (Howard, p. 361) A
number of natives were killed; many suffered injuries; others fied for their lives.

(Howard, p. 208; Davidson, p. 245) Governor
Archibald, the new Governor of Manitoba,
in reporting to the Canadian Government,
wrote:
Many of the half-breeds were so beaten and
outraged that they feel in slavery. The oppressors
seem to feel as if French half-breeds should be
(Davidson,
wiped from the face of the globe.
p. 51).

Though Red River and Ontario were two
separate colonies, neither having any right
or control over the people in the other, nevertheless the province offered a reward of $5,000,
which it ultimately had to pay, for the
capture of Riel, whom it branded as a
"murderer". Many soldiers released from
military discipline were anxious to win the
reward, to finance them in their start in the
new country. Their ruthless searching for
Riel caused intense excitement among the
residents who looked upon him as their hero.
(Howard, pp. 186, 208.)
The amnesty was not granted as promised.
Instead, Riel, the Colonial Treasurer, and a
member of the Legislature were banished
from Canada for five years and their political
rights forfeited for that period. (Davidson
In the excitement
p. 63. Howard, p. 246.)
the fugitives fled westward; many of them
located on open prairie land near Battleford
where they built homes, improved their land
and applied for title. Their applications were
ignored. In 1883 they were told they could
not stay on their locations. They also pleaded
for a measure of self-government, similar to
that which the Riel Government got for Manitoba. Instead of listening to their pleas the
Government reinforced the Mounted Police
and raised an army which subdued them by
force. The survivors were obliged to migrate
and make another fresh start. (Davidson,
p. 69. Howard, p. 371.)
Many of Riel's associates fled to Montana.
They urged him to flee with them. He refused
saying he would surrender and answer for
their alleged sins. To his cousin, Nault, he
said:
Cousin, you must go, but I am going to surrender.
After my enemies get me they will be joyous and
satisfied, and my people will get justice, and be
safe. If I do not, then the others will be caught
and punished for me. (Davidson, p. 94).

Riel surrendered and was tried. In preparing for his trial, the defence asked for a
month's delay to permit them to bring witnesses from Montana. The witnesses were
willing to appear if they would be guaranteed
immunity while they served as witnesses
and be given safe conduct back to the boundary. This was refused. The witnesses did
not come. Without his witnesses Riel was
found guilty and hanged. "This was the most

SENATE
unkindest cut of all." Canada took the life
of the people's hero. He sacrificed his life
in advocating security and fair play for the
natives. They mourned his death; they were
overwhelmed with grief. (Davidson, p. 94.)
Meanwhile, the trial of the other alleged
culprits proceeded. Eighteen Metis were convicted of treason, felony or they pleaded
guilty, and they received prison terms ranging from one to seven years. Eleven Indians
were sentenced to hang for murder, but three
won commutation. The other eight, including Chief Wandering Spirit, were hanged,
all at one time, on a single scaffold, in the
Mounted Police courtyard at Battleford on
November 27, 1885.
(Howard, p. 545.)
A
large number were imprisoned in Stoney
Mountain penitentiary (Maclean, p. 153);
some sought refuge in Edmonton, Calgary and
Macleod; (Maclean, p. 143): and many fled to
the United States. (Maclean, p. 229.)
Louis Riel was the brain of the movement
in Red River in building up and protecting
the homes of the natives and in preparing
them for self-government. He was unselfish
and humane. The forlorn people, facing the
loss of land and livelihood, learned from him
that their struggle for freedom, justice and
self-government was significant. Out of that
struggle he emerged a symbol and spokesman
for the oppressed.
Nova Scotia had its Joseph Howe, Quebec
its Louis Joseph Papineau, Ontario its William
Lyon Mackenzie, and the prairies their Louis
Riel-all renowned reformers who devoted
their lives to a great cause and resisted
tyranny with courage, energy and decision.
Great reformers are great people. During
their active lives, history is often fabricated
against them. They are best seen at a distance when unprejudiced judgment becomes
possible. All four of these men were in their
day regarded by inany as traitors. Today,
Howe, Papineau and Mackenzie are given
credit for having been great statesmen. We
are too close to Riel fully to appreciate his
sagacity and farsightedness. When prejudice
vanishes, writers of history will, no doubt,
place him in the front rank among the most
eminent of Canadian statesmen.
At the time Canada invaded the Red River
and made the unprovoked attacks upon the
natives to which I have referred, the Indians
and Metis were a strong, healthy and vigorous
people, proud of their race. They had imagination and were not deficient in natural
understanding. They abhorred restraint.
Given a chance, they would have well worked
out their own salvation.
But Canada treated them at the time in a
treacherous and barbarous manner, and has

since treated their descendants as an inferior
race.
They have been humiliated; their
spirits are broken; and they have in a large
measure lost their self-respect.
A few years after ceding the Northwest
Territories to Canada, they were huddled off
like so many cattle to reserves. By treaty
they surrendered a vast territory to Canada.
Up to that time they were prosperous and
happy. The treaties left them in poverty. The
compensation given them was wholly inadequate. Canada has not to this day compensated
them for having confiscated the homes of
their ancestors at Red River and, fifteen years
later, near Battleford. By treaty Canada also
undertook to educate the Indians. The parties
no doubt intended that the Indians should
receive as high a standard of education as the
whites. They are not receiving it. Canada has
not lived up to her agreement with them in
that respect. The mind is an important part
of every human being and should be fully
trained.
In view of the maltreatment the Indians
received from Canada in the past, we can well
afford to be generous and spend much to help
them and the Metis, who have been brought
up as Indians on reserves, to become rehabilitated. Financial assistance should be given to
Indian families by Canada sufficient to induce
the more ambitious to become emancipated.
The present generation of Indians, having
been brought up and treated through their
lives as children, without having business
experience to fit them to manage their own
affairs, should not be given a free hand to
dispose of land, working tools or equipment
provided by Canada, as they would in many
cases sell the property and waste the money.
The Superintendent of Indian Affairs on a
reserve would have to co-operate with them
in disposing of their products. But they should
be given to realize that they would benefit
from all such sales.
In 1910 the Indians of British Columbia
said to the Canadian Government: "Today
the Indian people of British Columbia ask
to be put on the same level as the white
man". They said: "Corne, let us settle the
title to these lands. Then give us title to land
in fee simple, family by family. Take away
your Indian reserve system; put us into your
citizenship and we will rise or fall even as
other men do". (Maclean, p. 248.)
Yet until the last Indian on a reserve is
emancipated the tribal organization should be
retained and the power of the chiefs supported in order to preserve contact with
reality while preparing to embark on a new
and strange existence.
I have confined my remarks to the Prairie
Indians. Do the same or similar problems

exist in respect to Indians living in other
parts of Canada? I am not familiar with
their plight. But I understand that they, too,
are huddled together on reserves where they
are looked down upon as an inferior race.
If so, they should receive sympathetic consideration to build up their self-respect, initiative and incentive to free them and put them
on the same plane as non-Indians. All humans
crave freedom.
We should strive to build up a desire in all
Indians to become emancipated and proud of
their race. It is cruel to sit idly by while the
Indians sufTer for the necessities of life; it
is economically unsound to have that great
body of potential creators of wealth continuing to live largely in idleness; it is inhuman
to have a portion of our population cooped
up on reservations and treated as a lower
race.
Much progress has been made during the
past twelve or fifteen years. Much remains to
be done, involving tremendous expenditures.
I hope the Government will do more in
the way of educating the Indians and training them towards reviving their morale, building up their spirits and fitting them to
become fully emancipated citizens.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

SENATE
evidence should go to the House of Commons
until we have seen it, because no time is
gained at all by that procedure. I think we
should have the evidence available so as to
be able to read it if we desire to do so.
If I am disposed to act as a "dumb Dora"
and be lenient, that is my responsibility, but
when the Senate itself takes that responsibility, I do not sanction it. I have every
confidence in the Chairman of the committee
and its members, but I think that as a senator
I also have a duty to perform.
As I said the other day, I am not in favour
of divorce-I really am not, in my own
heart-but I am willing to vote on these
divorce bills, because I feel it is my duty as
a member of this ýchamber to do so. If the
committee recommends a bill of divorce, and
the evidence warrants it, I will do my duty
by voting, even though I am against divorce.
I do not go so far as some other members,
but I go that far. However, I think I should
at least have the evidence before me, so
that when I vote I know what I am voting for.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
as Chairman of the Divorce Committee I
think I should say a word or two. Up to the
present time we have heard about 135 divorce
cases. We do not print the evidence; that is
done by the Printing Bureau. The committee
has received back from the Printing Bureau
three, four or five printed reports, or thereabouts. These printed copies came in yesterday, and the committee is waiting to receive
the remainder. At the meeting of the main
committee yesterday a resolution was passed
to ask the head of the Printing Bureau to
appear before the committee on Friday next,
when its next sitting will take place. We
shall then be able to discuss the situation,
so far as the printing is concerned, and obtain
an explanation of why more printed reports
have not been received. I have no axe to
grind in this matter. We are just doing our
job to the best of our ability. All we can do
is to call before us those who are responsible
for the printing and ask for their explanation.
At one time I had thought of advocating that
divorce bills should not be sent to the Conmons until the printing is in hand, but the
more I thought of it the more difficulties
I saw ahead. We are not the 'printers, and
if we took that responsibility we would leave
ourselves in default, whereas if we pass the
bills and send them to the Commons, it then
becomes their responsibility, just as much as
it becomes ours, to get the bills printed.
But do not overlook this, honourable senators, that every divorce bill we send to the
Commons is accompanied not by a printed
copy of the evidence but by a typewritten
copy. If any member of the committee to

which a bill is referred wishes to inform
himself on the evidence, he can read the
typewritten copy.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I ask the honourable senator whether a typewritten copy
of the evidence in each case is available for
us to read?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, it is.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Where is that typewritten
copy?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The reports of the conmittee, with a typewritten copy of the evidence in each case, are now on the table, and
the Clerk will, I arn sure, furnish any honourable senator with a copy of any evidence
he wishes to read.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That information is
most enlightening, and should be helpful to
any honourable senator who may be interested in reading the evidence taken in a
particular case.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Do I understand that I can
protect myself by asking that a typewritten
copy of the evidence in every divorce case
be placed on my desk in my room, so that
I can read them all, even if it takes me three
weeks or a month to do it?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Of course you can.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Then I now ask the Clerk
to deliver to my room the typewritten copy
of the evidence in each case. We appear to
have no other business ready for consideration by the house, except divorce bills, and
there is no reason why I should not read
through the evidence in each case. If that is
the way honourable senators want the matter handled, I am prepared to spend whatever time is necessary to read the evidence,
but my own thought is that the printed
evidence in each case should be available for
honourable senators to read before we are
asked to pass the bills.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Would the honourable
Leader of the Opposition consider a suggestion? It is perfectly all right for him to read
the evidence in its present typewritten form,
and it will take no longer to read it in that
form than in print. He will have along with
the evidence a copy of the report of the
committee, the papers with respect to service
and the other material.
If I may, I would suggest that the house
pass these bills now before us. In view of
the fact that the honourable Leader of the
Opposition is a member of the Divorce Conmittee, and has been for many years, perhaps
he would be good enough to attend our
meeting on Friday morning and discuss with

FEBRUARY 2, 1955
the officials of the Printing Bureau the
matter of the printing of evidence.
As I have said, honourable senators, I have
no axe to grind. I am as concerned about the
delay in printing as is the honourable Leader
of the Opposition. But would it not be satisfactory to let the matter stand until we have
had an opportunity to discuss it with those
responsible for the printing? I would just
point out that this series takes us up to the
118th bill. We have already passed some
88 bills which have been sent to the House
of Commons.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, in
reply to the suggestion of the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), may I say that I am much obliged to
him, as Chairman of the committee, for the
invitation to attend the meeting on Friday
morning to discuss the question of printing.
But let there be no misunderstanding, I am
not at all satisfied that bills should go from
this house to the other house before the
evidence supporting them bas been printed.
I am quite sure that some members of the
other house who, like myself, are lawyers
will ask me whether I have read the evidence
in each case. When I admit that I have not,
they will immediately ask me why I voted to
pass the bill, to which I can give no satisfactory answer.
I have had this problern on my mind for a
month now, and I want to say that to me our
present procedure is most unsatisfactory.
However, I accept the invitation to attend the
committee meeting on Friday morning and,
health permitting, I will be there.
C
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Then the matter can be
discussed further at a later date.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes; when that committee
again reports I understand I shall have permission to discuss the question if I wish to.

50437-9

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I do not want to prolong this discussion unduly, but I do not think all members of this
house feel it their duty to read the evidence
in every divorce case. We have set up a
committee to hear petitions for divorce and,
in my opinion it is just as competent and
as thorough in its review of the cases which
come before it as is any court in Canada. I
have complete confidence that the committee
would not recommend passage of a bill for
which there was not ample evidence to support it. Therefore, I am prepared to receive
the reports of the committee and to pass on
them without reading the evidence in each
case.
Not all honourable senators are members
of the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, and some do not attend the meetings of that committee. Yet, when a bill
that has been before that committee is reported, the record is not even presented to
the house. I am sure all honourable senators
do not feel it encumbent upon them to read
the record of all the proceedings before that
committee before they approve the passage
of such a bill.
I repeat that, as far as I am concerned, I
have full confidence in the Divorce Committee.
I do not think it would recommend to this
house the granting of any petition that was
not amply supported by evidence.
The motion was agreed to, and the bills
were read the second time, on division.
The Hon. The Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall these bills be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Next sitting.

THE ESTIMATES
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called, I
rise on a question of privilege which concerns
the entire membership of this house. This
same issue arises every session. Usually near
the end of March the Minister of Finance
delivers his budget speech in the House of
Commons; then the members of that house
carry on a budget debate for some two or
three weeks, after which the house goes into
Committee of Supply to deal with the various
items one by one. Eventually the estimates
come to the Senate, usually about ten days
before the end of the session. This, of course,
does not give members of this house any real
opportunity to discuss government expenditures, taxation and so on. I may be overconcerned about the importance of the

FEBRUARY 3, 1955
Senate-though I do not think so-but I
believe the experience of the men and women
in this chamber is a valuable asset to Canada,
and that if it were directed to a complete
examination of the estimates and our taxation
system we could render a greater service to
the Parliament and the people of this country.
I do not say this with any thought of
criticism in mind, and I do not wish my
remarks to be used as an instrument of
criticism at all. The Opposition groups in the
House of Commons are free to criticize
ad ininitum. I merely wish to impress upon
honourable members of the Senate the fact
that we get no real chance here to understand
the budget and its workings, or how the
national debt is arrived at and how it is
paid off. Under the present crucial conditions
existing in the world, it is most important
that we should understand these things.
I want to suggest that the Leader of the
Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) call in conference half a dozen members of this bouse, both men and women, who
have had experience in parliamentary life,
either in the House of Commons or in legislative assemblies of the provinces, in order
to see if some system cannot be worked out
for our giving rmore consideration to the
estimates. I have no intention of trying to
provoke political discussion; I am not at all
desirous of anything like that in the Senate.
After all, it should make no difference to
the members of this bouse whether "Brown"
or ".Jones" or someone else is Prime Minister
of Canada. or whether the Prime Minister
is a Liberal or a Conservative, or what he
is. As senators, we represent the people in
all parts of the country, and we were summoned here to protect their interests.
There is a good deal of agitation in my
province by people who feel that we should
give more attention to the Government's
economic policies. They feel this is a fundamental matter. They want to know how these
policies affect the commercial and industrial
life of Canada, and unemployment; and what
impact they have on farmers, fishermen, lumbermen and other industrial classes in our
society. After some thought on the subject,
I have come to the conclusion that the
honourable Leader of the Government in
the Senate (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), for whom
I have great respect-he bas wide experience
in the other bouse and is now in his second
session as leader in this house-should call
together perhaps six or seven honourable
senators to consider with him what should
be done. When the matter bas been thoroughly studied it could then be referred to
the house for further consideration, and I
am sure that in this way we could devise a
satisfactory course of action.

Hon. James H. King: Honourable senators,
I would remind my friend the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
that in 1943 I moved in this house a resolution
authorizing our Standing Committee on
Finance to examine the estimates after they
had been brought down in the House of
Commons.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Correct.
Hon. Mr. King: I took the position that
senators had the same right as bankers,
farmers, merchants, representatives of labour
and others to discuss either privately or publicly the budget as brought down in the
House of Commons. We began our examination of the estimates after the Minister of
Finance had delivered his speech on the
budget, but I may say that I had some
difficulty in convincing Dr. Beauchesne that
the Senate had the right to review the
estimates at all.
As I understand my honourable friend's
suggestion, he would like to discuss the
estimates in the chamber rather than in
committee.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. My suggestion was
that the Leader should call together a few
other senators and discuss how we might
best deal with the estimates, and that after
they had come to a conclusion it should be
submitted to this bouse for consideration.
I am not committing myself definitely as
to whether their recommendation should be
considered in the bouse or in a committee,
but my preference is for consideration in
the house itself.
Hon. Mr. King: I had misunderstood my
honourable friend. Of course, to discuss
the estimates in this chamber would be
quite different from discussing them in committee. My resolution of 1943 was for examination of the departmental estimates by
our Finance Committee. We called before
the committee such officials as Dr. C. J.
MacKenzie, then President of the National
Research Council, various deputy ministers,
and even some ministers. The committee
spent some weeks on a study of the estimates,
and, generally speaking, we had most interesting discussions.
I doubt that it would be wise for us to
discuss the estimates in detail before the
Minister of Finance presents his budget
speech, and I think those discussions should
be in committee. I am in accord with the
suggestion that the Leader of the Government in this bouse should consult with a
few senators in an endeavour to devise the
most practical means for us to study the
estimates.

me. If so, then I certainly must express
my appreciation of his kindness-I will not
say of his good judgment.
Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It strikes me, Mr. Speaker,
that this discussion is a little bit out of order.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) was perhaps quite right
in raising the question on the Orders of the
Day, but I would have preferred it if he had
moved the adjournment of the house so that
every one here could have taken part in the
discussion without any violation of the rules.
But now that I am on my feet, may I say
that I sympathize in large measure with
the point raised by the Leader of the Opposition, and with the observations made by the
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and our colleague from Kootenay
East (Hon. Mr. King).
Honourable senators, we are not proceeding in a way to earn the respect of the country. Members of the Senate, like members
of the House of Commons, have to earn the
respect of the country by the manner in
which they conduct the business of Parliament. I have been here for nearly three
weeks, and I do not believe that during that
period this house has sat "five hours a week.
This state of things is very convenient for
honourable senators who are only an overnight journey from their homes. They can
arrive here on Tuesday evening in time to
take part in our deliberations, spend Wednesday here, come into the chamber on Thursday afternoon, and by 4.30 p.m. be on their
way to the station to catch the train home.

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I am much interested in the suggestion
of the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig), and very pleased that the
honourable senator from Kootenay East (Hon.
Mr. King) has given us the benefit of his
experience on this subject.
I have heard rumours, in fact I read in the
press, that there are likely to be changes
in procedure in the House of Commons.
Those changes may, for all I know, affect
the bringing down of the budget or the
method of consideration of the estimates. I
recall having read in the Votes and Proceedings of the House of Commons a motion in
the name of the Prime Minister to set up a
committee on estimates, and it occurs to me,
therefore, that the procedure in connection
with the consideration of the estimates might
be changed.
I agree that it is most unfortunate, most
unbusinesslike, that the Supply Bill should
come into this house in the dying days of
the session. I do not like it any more than
anyone else here likes it, and if a plan can
be devised for having it brought down earlier,
so that we can give it proper consideration,
I think it would be most advisable to adopt
that plan.
I shall be glad to consult with a number
of my colleagues in the Senate on this very
important matter but I do feel that before
coming to a decision we might wait to ascertain if there is to be a vital change in respect
to the bringing down of the budget, and
consideration of the budget proposals and
the estimates in the other house.

FEBRUARY 3, 1955
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
it was not my intention to take part in this
discussion, but I am moved to do so after
listening to the remarks of the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar).
Ever since I became a member of this chamber, the existence throughout the country of
a feeling adverse to the Senate has given me
a good deal of concern. I have noticed that
every little critical remark of the kind to
which we have just listened is magnified from
one end of the country to the other, and the
impression is fostered that unless the members of the Senate are in session in this chamber they are doing nothing. Now there are
just as many drones in the House of Commons as there are here.
Hon. Mr. Duffus: Are there any drones
here?
Hon. Mr. Reid: As far as I am concerned, I
am as busy as any other member of Parliament; and whenever I hear an honourable
senator make the statement that we senators
sit in our offices from Thursday to Tuesday
doing nothing, I am going to rise in my place
and express strong resentment. I am willing
to bet that very little of what I am saying
now will appear in the newspapers, but
plenty of notice will be taken of the statement that senators do nothing from Thursday
afternoon until Tuesday evening. The fact
is that we are at work and carrying on our
duties. I do not deny that this house could
sit Fridays and transact some business. But,
I repeat, I shall rise every time it is stated
that for half the week honourable senators do
nothing. It is an unfair reflection upon us,
especially those of us who are doing fully
our duty to the people of the provinces from
which we come, and doing it just as conscientiously as any member of the other
house.
Hon. Mr. Duffus: I think the honourable
member from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) should name the "drones" he speaks of.
I would like to know who they are.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I can give the honourable
senator two dozen names.
EMPLOYMENT IN CANADA
On the orders of the day:
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Before the Orders of
the Day are proceeded with, may I answer
a question which was asked indirectly of me
yesterday by the honourable senator from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner).
In the
course of his very interesting address, be
referred to the fact that there are employed
in Canada at the present time 5,167,000 people,

and was very gratified to know the number
was so large. I can assure him that the
figures I gave are correct. The honourable
senator stated that he assumed the number
included those who are self-employed. That
is so: they include everyone in Canada who
is employed.
Probably the house would be interested to
know that there is today in Canada a working
labour force of 5,414,000 nf which number,
on January 19th, only 247,000 were unemployed; so that, as I have stated, 5,167,000 are
at work.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Can the honourable
leader give us the percentage of unemployed?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The percentage of
unemployed is 4·6.
Honourable senators will also be interested
to know that an additional 4,939,000 Canadians are not in the labour force. This total
includes those-most of them women--engaged in housekeeping, adults taking advanced
educational courses, persons retired or voluntarily idle, and others too old or unable to
work.
In round numbers, the population of Canada is approximately 15 million. Of these,
roughly speaking, 5 million are employed, and
5 million, for various reasons, are not
reckoned as employed, yet are not unemployed: among them being, for example,
those who keep house.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: Unpaid employees.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: "Unpaid employees"that is a better expression. There is no doubt
that those who keep house work very hard;
I would not want to give a contrary impression. The remaining 5 million of the population consists mainly of children.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Thank you.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session and the motion of Hon. Mrs. Hodges,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Tremblay, for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
in rising to speak on this occasion I intend
to deal with one or two matters before
coming to the proposed legislation outlined
in the Speech from the Throne. First of all,
I should like to inform the honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)

how pleased I was when some days ago he
intimated that the Government was agreeable
.to the appointment of a special committee
to inquire into the traffic in opium and narcotic drugs in Canada. It is said that honest
confession is good for the soul, and I must
confess that on April 7 last when I proposed
that such a committee be set up and the
honourable Leader promised he would take
the matter up with the Government, I was a
little sceptical, shall I say, that such a committee would ever be organized. Once again
I want to tell him how pleased I am that a
committee is going to be appointed. I feel
sure that this action will meet with approval
right across Canada.
Honourable senators, judging by press
accounts from one end of the country to the
other I believe many people approve the
Government's decision to allow the Canadian
Pacific Air Lines to fly the Polar route from
Vancouver to Amsterdam, Holland. Many of
us have been concerned about this matter,
for we were wondering if the T.C.A. was
going to monopolize and control the entire
field of aviation; so the decision of the Government to allow the C.P.A. to fly from Vancouver to Amsterdam, a 17-hour flight, has
pleased many interested people. The citizens
of Vancouver are particularly gratified, because it means that Vancouver will become
one of the great central airports of the world.
Honourable senators, I am going to draw to
the attention of the Government something
that took place in British Columbia last summer, as I think some particular notice should
be taken of it. Sometimes in my quiet
moments I come to the conclusion that education occasionally breeds foolishness among
certain groups of people. I have in mind the
hiring of an American firm to make rain fall
on the British Columbia mainland around
the district of Powell River. As a matter of
fact, the Powell River Company did the hiring, and of course we may assume that the
money it spent on this venture will be written
off as an item of expense, so that probably
the whole thing will not cost the firm very
much. Dr. Gordon M. Shrum, head of the
Department of Physics of the University of
British Columbia, warned that man-made
efforts to produce rain should not be carried
out in British Columbia without the approval
of competent government authority. In any
event, this American company was hired to
make rain, but it so happened that last year
was one of the wettest that British Columbia
has had in a long time, and not only did the
Powell River district get all the rain it
wanted but other areas also were deluged.
Of course, the people of those districts did
not have to pay the American company. If
the company actually produced rain-which

FEBRUARY 3, 1955
I doubt-it certainly was not able to restrict
the downfall to the area around Powell
River.
I should not have thought any Canadians
would bother to hire rainmaking outfits after
the experience some people of Alberta had
with them years ago, but I would suggest that
if this foolishness continues the federal
Government should take steps to control it,
just as it controls the air for radio and flying.
This sort of thing could have serious repercussions. Suppose a certain group hired rainmakers to bring down rain in the summertime
and, as a result, a cloudburst ruined some
cherry orchards. Damage claims would be
filed, and some authority would be appealed
to. I maintain that the Government should
investigate the activities of companies which
are advertising that they will produce rain
if hired to do so.
Honourable senators, a couple of weeks ago
I inquired of the Government what sum of
money was paid by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for the exclusive rights of
televising the British Empire Games held in
Vancouver in 1954, and what was the total
revenue received by the C.B.C. for the sale
of the television rights or films taken of the
Games and sold to United States interests.
I had several reasons for asking these questions. I alse inquired of the Government what
percentage of Canadian television programs,
as seen by the Canadian 'public, are produced
or manufactured in the United States. In
answer to the inquiry I have been told that
during a sample week in December, 1954,
approximately 30 per -cent of the programs
on the C.B.C. television, English and French
networks, originated in the United States live
or on film.
I do not intend to go into this particular
question now, but I want to draw the attention of honourable members to the great
event which took place in Vancouver last
summer, the British Empire and Commonwealth Games. Officials of the Games Committee have stated that the Games might not
have been held in Vancouver except for the
fact that two tentative host cities, Montreal
and Toronto, got into quite a squabble as to
which of them should be honoured by having
the Games. Vancouver filed a request, and
the authorities ultimately conferred this
honour upon that city.
The holding of the Games in Vancouver
climaxed a four-year effort on the part of
many men and women. I am told by those
who spearheaded the move that a distinguished senator who sits in front of me
(Hon. Mr. McKeen) had a lot to do with
bringing the Games to Vancouver.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Reid: At first those who sponsored
the idea received little support, but eventually things began to roll, and as it turned
out the Games proved to be an outstanding
success and brought great credit to Canada,
British Columbia and Vancouver. Incidentally, it is not likely that any Canadian city
will be eligible to hold the Games for another
twenty-five years.
The Games were immensely enjoyed by
both spectators and athletes alike. A tent
city was erected on the grounds of the
University of British Columbia to house the
1,100 athletes from twenty-six Commonwealth countries who participated. It was
indeed a memorable occasion to visit the tent
city and observe the athletes of many races
and colour living together in such complete
harmony. The holding of the Games certainly
fostered much good will. In my opinion it
exceeded the amount of good will that bas
so far been created by the United Nationsin fact, I have not observed much good will
proceeding from them. The good will from
the Games was spread far and wide by the
participants. They appreciated the wonderful treatment they received here, and I feel
quite sure that when they returned to their
various countries they sang loud the praises
of Canada and of the Canadian people.
There were present at the Games 400 radio
and television newsmen from all parts of the
world. It is interesting to note that TransCanada Air Lines passenger revenues were
increased by some $300,000 for transporting
the visiting teams.
The one man who spearheaded the great
project was Mr. Stanley Smith, of Vancouver.
I understand that he did so wonderful a job
that the British Government wished the
Queen could have knighted him; but, as
honourable senators are aware, Canada has
frowned upon knighthoods for Canadians,
and therefore he was debarred. However, I
believe that all honourable members, and
particularly the honourable senator from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McKeen), will agree
that Mr. Smith deserves some outstanding
recognition for his wonderful work in organizing and directing the Games. I saw him
a few days before I left Vancouver for
Ottawa, and he told me that his health was
completely broken as a result of the hard
work he had done over a period of three or
four years in this connection. Truly, his was
a great accomplishment.
Unfortunately, the British Empire Games
suffered a financial deficit. The Government
of Canada contributed $200,000 toward the
project; the Province of British Columbia,
$200,000, and the City of Vancouver about
$200,000. Total revenue from all sources was
$2,370,000. Yet a deficit of $155,000 has been

he had read a letter written to the Editor of
the Arrow Lake News. I interjected:
·The writer of the letter knows nothing about
the matter.
I should have said: "The writer of the letter
knows little if anything about the matter."
Obviously, if lie lives in that district, he
should know something about the project.
Hon. Mr. Horner: That is what I thought.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I have taken a great interest in this proposed project because of my
position as Chairman of the International
Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission. In that
capacity I am concerned about the effect
which dams on the Fraser River have on the
salmon fisheries. We have devised methods of
allowing the salmon to by-pass a dam on their
way upstream, but we have not yet solved
the problem of clearing the young fingerlings
safely over dams downstream on their way
to the sea. For two years or so the commission made tests of the mortality rate among
fingerlings passing over dams and through
electric turbines. The result of the tests of
flngerlings passing over a two-hundred-foot
dam showed a mortality rate among the
Sockeye of 37 per cent, and a lower rate for
other varieties of salmon.
I may say, perhaps with pardonable pride,
that the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission is the first body on the North
American continent to compile accurate scientific data as to the mortality of fingerlings
over dams. Our chief reason for assembling
the data was our fear that if we challenged
a company which proposed to build a dam on
the Fraser River, they might take action
against us, and some smart lawyers-and
of course most lawyers are smart-might
question our information on the mortality
rate. Now we are prepared to meet them
with scientific data on that point.
We are, however, endeavouring to find
ways and means of saving the fingerlings
while passing over dams. I may say that we
have been experimenting with a method
which involves the use of electricity to guide
the fingerlings away from the dam and down
the chute. No publicity has been given to
this experiment, because we fear that unless
it is a complete success it may be used as
an argument by people who want to build
dams anywhere on the Fraser River. Personally, I doubt that we will ever completely save
all the fingerlings which pass over dams and
through turbines, but we still keep working
on the problem, in the hope that we will.
It is for that reason, honourable senators,
that I am always on the watch as to what
is going on in any proposed dam building in

British Columbia. People may ask why I
should interest myself in the Columbia
River when our jurisdiction is limited to the
Fraser River. I have been told by our engineers, and they are very competent, that
the potential water power of the Columbia
River on the Canadian side is around 9 million horsepower. We are hopeful that with
full development of that energy on the Columbia River there will .be no need for the
construction of any power dams on the
Fraser River. Our commission feels that the
Columbia River is capable of producing
enough power to meet our province's wildest
dreams of industrial advancement for the
next one hundred years. In that respect it is
notable that British Columbia's entire consumption of electricity today, apart from that
used by Alcan, is 1,280,000 horsepower. If
our present expanded industrial and domestic needs require only that amount, one can
easily visualize the extent to which an additional 9 million horsepower would provide
for future industrial development.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Would the honourable
senator permit a question?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Does he have the mortality rate of fingerlings going through the
turbines?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes, I have that information. The mortality rate of fish passing
through turbines is almost equal to that of
fish passing over dams. It took some years
to find out what killed fingerlings in the turbines: strangely enough, it was not the
swirling of the water but the vacuum created
in the water. We now feel that the combined
mortality rate as a result of going through
turbines and over dams is sufficient to cause
the salmon fisheries of the Fraser River to
disappear entirely. We cannot stand idly by
and see an annual revenue of $50 million
and this much needed source of food supply
completely wiped out. Indeed, as time goes
on, there will be a greater need for fish and
fish products.
The honourable senator from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) in his address yesterday
was sceptical about turning the waters from
the Columbia River into the Fraser River.
I must confess that when I first read the
article about this I was inclined to believe
it was just a highly-coloured story, so I took
time since I came here to Ottawa to spend
an hour and a half with the Chairman of
the Canadian Section of the International
Joint Commission, General McNaughton, and
let me say that when the story he told me
is made public there are going to be many

SENATE
red faces. I was greatly enthused about the
scheme after listening to the story he had
to tell and following the complete investigation which had been made.
It is an interesting fact that the content
of water varies, and surprisingly enough fish
actually choose certain waters. The water of
the Columbia is glacial in origin and contains
no plankton or food for fish, so if water from
the Columbia is spilled over into the Fraser
I wanted to know what effect it would have
on that river. I was anxious to know also
whether it would drown out the salmon
spawning beds, and also-as the honourable
senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)
posed the question-"What would happen to
the Fraser Valley from the point of view of
flooding?"
Before one speaks about a subject like this
it always pays to go to the place where the
best information on it can be obtained. I am
very glad that I did so, for now I know some
of the answers to these important questions.
The information I now propose to give comes
from General McNaughton, and as he has
made speeches on this subject I do not believe
any objection can be used to my using the
information today.
To begin with, it is a very feasible scheme.
A distance of only fifteen miles separates
the Columbia river from the Fraser river.
It happens that that separation is at the
divide or highest elevation, so it is all downhill from the Columbia to the Fraser. I
asked General McNaughton what would be
the effect on the salmon fishing, and he
replied: "Oh, Senator Reid, we have had
a fishery expert with us all the time we
have been studying this. We cannot allow
the salmon to be destroyed, and we are going
to take care of the salmon fisheries." General
McNaughton went on to say that the idea
behind the scheme is to use the waters of
the Columbia river in Canada for industrial
development in British Columbia and not
in the United States. No Canadian will say
nay to that. The water that will be let loose
after we build the dam on Mica Creek will
develop an enormous amount of electrical
energy. The water to the Fraser will be
released in the months of November, December, January and February at a time when
that river is at its lowest level. Rather than
develop all the power at Mica Creek, which
is three hundred miles distant from the cities
of Vancouver and New Westminster and
which would involve transmitting the power
that distance, it is proposed to raise the
level of the Fraser river when its waters
are low and, in the process, develop hydroelectric power close to the cities where it
is going to be used.

I think, honourable senators, you will immediately see the feasibility and the reasonableness of this proposed scheme.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask the honourable
senator a question?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Horner: What opposition will
develop internationally when the course of the
river is changed from its original bed?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am pleased the honourable
senator has asked that question, for it calls
to mind a most interesting story.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I should think it would.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The Americans are now
going to find themselves "hoist with their
own petard," so to speak, because back
in 1908 there was some discussion over a
little river in New Brunswick which crossed
the boundary between Canada and the United
States at several points, and the Americans
at that time dominated the position to such
an extent that-I will not say they forced
a treaty upon Canada-a treaty was signed
between the two countries by which the
principle was established that each country
was to be permitted to use the water in
the river in whatever way and for whatever
purpose it wanted, to within its own boundaries, irrespective of the effect it might have
in the other country. At that time any
development of the Columbia river was undreamt of; it was not considered important
then. We may well remind the Americans
of the treaty they signed and of the principle
established in 1908. Under that principle
we propose to use the water of the Columbia
to meet the power requirements of British
Columbia and not those of the United States.
Now, to come to the point that those not
in favour of this development are playing
politics, let me say-and I say it without fear
of successful contradiction-that if the provincial Government were allowed to get
away with this it would be one of the biggest
steals ever heard of. Further, it would have
a very damaging future effect for it could for
all time stop further development of the
Columbia River in British Columbia.
I cannot be accused of being backward in
pointing out what I believe to be wrong.
Honourable senators will remember that I
took a strong stand against the development
of the Nechako by Alcan. I said about Alcan,
and I still say, that we never got what we
could have got out of that deal. However,
the industry is located in British Columbia
and I have no great complaint on that score.
Canadians are being given employment there
and the province is being developed in that

FEBRUARY 3, 1955

region. But when it comes to the question
of the proposed Kaiser Dam, I wonder if
honourable senators or those who are charging that we are making a political issue out
of the question realize that if the construction
of the Kaiser Dam is allowed to go ahead
it will interfere with the building of a dam
at Mica Creek, and so interfere with any
development of the Columbia at that point.
Hon. Mr. Horner: It is claimed that it would
not.
Hon. Mr. Reid: You may know more about
it than General McNaughton does, but of
course you cannot get me to believe that.
I am going to issue an invitation to honourable senators to hear the complete story in
detail when our International Pacific Salmon
Fisheries Commission meets here in Ottawa,
some time in June, at which time General
McNaughton bas kindly consented to appear
to describe the whole scheme to us and
explain how in his opinion the fisheries will
not be damaged. He has told me of the
heights of dams proposed to be built on the
Fraser River if this scherne goes into effect,
of the proposal for storing water behind the
Mica Dam and pouring it into the Fraser, of
how the level of the Fraser will be raised in
the four months when it is naturally at its
lowest, and of the extent to which our salmon
fisheries will not be affected. All of this will
be gone into more fully when our Commission
meets here in June, at which time we will
have engineers and biologists in attendance
to enlarge on these points.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Is there any salmon
spawning when the river level is low?
Hon. Mr. Reid: When the water is low the
fish eggs are on the gravel bar, and they do
not hatch out until the beginning of April.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: You say that when the
river level is naturally at its lowest, waters
from behind the Mica Dam will come
tumbling into the Fraser. What I would like
to know is, if this fast moving water will
dislodge the eggs lying on the river bed.
Hon. Mr. Reid: No. Once the eggs are laid
on the gravel bar they become covered up by
gravel, and the flowing water above them
will not, I believe, disturb them at all. If
the water is high when the salmon come up
to spawn, it may and will affect the eggs,
though not, I think, in the months of November, December, January and February. That
is the story. General McNaughton says he
would like to know, if anyone can tell him,
what is the agreement between the provincial
Government and Kaiser. The provincial story
has been changed at least ten times, and we
have given up hope of learning the exact
50437-101

truth about the agreement. I notice that
since the opening of the house nothing so far
has been said about the Kaiser dam. Of
course we may get some information later
on, but after listening to General McNaughton
I am convinced, I repeat, that if the agreement is permitted to go into effect it will
result in one of the biggest steals ever known
in British Columbia, and hamper the development of our province in the days to come.
I also repeat that no clear statement on the
matter has so far been made by the provincial
Government. I am not altogether astonished
that that is so, for what can one expect from
the premier of the province, a former Tory
who jumped on the band-wagon of Social
Credit, and who, when the Archbishop of
Canterbury, during his visit to British Columbia asked him "What is Social Credit?"
replied, "To the Jews it is a stumbling block,
to the Greeks foolishness, but to millions of
people throughout the world it is life eternal".
I think that is one of the most sacrilegious
statements that have been made in my time.
He says "To the Greeks it is foolishness":
I can tell him that to the Scots or English it
is foolishness, and to most people in the
British Empire it is all foolishness. Where
are the "millions" in other lands who support
Social Credit? And even assuming there are
that many Social Crediters, how does the
doctrine become to them "life eternal"? I
am amazed at the shenanigans of the present
Government of British Columbia. I am not
going into that subject today, but if I were
called upon to do it I could make the subject
very interesting.
I had not intended to speak at such length.
There is one other subject I should like to
deal with before I resume my seat. The
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) dealt in his speech with labour in
relation to the income tax, and stressed the
impact of this tax upon labour as one of the
I
great problems which face us today.
admit it is quite a problem, but I do not
believe it is the most serious one with which
we are' concerned, between capital on the
one side and labour on the other. I am
one of not so large a group who saw
what were practically the beginnings of
unionism in Scotland. I knew men there in
that early day who had to flee the country
because of their advocacy of the rights of the
workers. The pendulum had gone far in
one direction: those who had capital, and
businessmen generally, treated the people who
worked for thern almost as slaves, and by
paying them a mere pittance, denied them
any opportunity of saving for their old age.
How could a man who got the equivalent of
$5 a week, and had to raise a family on it,

SENATE
hope to put by any money? But I have lived
to see the pendulum swing far in the other
direction, and I wonder how much farther
it can go without prejudice to the interests
of all- our people, including labour itself. The
situation rather troubles me. This afternoon
the honourable Government Leader (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) quoted some figures regarding
unemployment. In this connection I would
suggest that one government authority only
should be responsible for these statistics. It
creates a great deal of confusion to have one
set of figures issued by the Unemployment
Insurance Commission, and another set of
figures, based on different returns, produced
by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics. Labour
takes these returns and uses the one against
the other. This serves only to throw ridicule
on the official reports.
Perhaps I am wrong, but I think a cold
war is going on, and I do not know who
will win it. I wonder whether many of those
in high positions realize how serious it is
becoming. I am not finding any great fault
with the labour unions. I understand their
objects; I could point out many injustices
with which they have to deal. But I think
every honourable senator will agree with my
statement that today most if not all the
union leaders must demand more and more
for their membership or risk the loss of their
positions. In the nature of things they cannot do otherwise. If all was quiet and peaceful, the workers might ask, "Well, what are
we paying you for?" Not so long ago I asked
an official of the carpenters' union, "You have
now got a rate of $2.20 an hour: if you were
granted $10 an hour would you call an
industrial peace for ten years?" He replied,
"We would have to take that under consideration: I doubt that we would". Speaking
of income taxes, I would point to the value
of the fringe benefits which have been
obtained by labour. There are many smart
and highly educated men in the unions today.
If anyone doubts my word, 'et him take it
on himself to argue with some of them, and
he will soon find out how little he knows.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Are not the personnel
representatives of the companies in exactly
the same position with regard to getting
something for their side as are the representatives of the unions in trying to get something
for theirs?
Hon. Mr. Reid: The honourable senator
should wait until I complete my speech. I
could not deal at one and the same time
with both sides. I have been speaking about
the unions. As I said before, a cold war
exists, and you cannot have any kind of
a war without having at least two opposing
parties.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There are two sides
to every quarrel.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes, and I am coming to
that. I believe I appreciate the viewpoint
of labour as well as, if not better than, most
honourable senators, for I joined a trade
union when I was only fourteen years of
age, and that was at a time when you
pretty well had to be a hero to belong to
one. There were not many unions at that
time. I still hold my union card. I know
the make-up and psychology of union members, and understand their outlook. Having
been asked about the other side of the matter
I will immediately proceed to deal with it.
Those who invest money in industrial
companies are well aware of labour's demand
for higher wages. And so company personnel are always going through their plants
trying to find ways and means to cut down
on manpower, and today Canadian factories
are using all the technological devices they
can find in order to reduce the number of
their employees. Indeed, many plants employ scientists and inventors just for this
purpose. Labour persists in its demands for
higher wages, and at the same time company
owners keep taking steps to stay in business
and make profits. We are beginning to live
in an all-out push-button age. Incidentally,
push-button gadgets do not always give the
best service. This afternoon I had occasion
to use one of the new elevators in the
Senate wing of this building, and I had
to wait for what seemed like six or seven
minutes before I was able to get on to it.
I told the operator that the old elevator was
much faster than the new one. The thing
is that we have taken away much of the
operator's responsibility. It is a push-button
machine, and although it runs more smoothly
and looks more attractive it does not give
the same degree of efficiency as the old one
did. However, I do not think you would
find industry cutting down on manpower if to
do so meant less efficiency and reduced
profits. If you visit an up-to-date sawmill
you will get an idea of how fast modern
equipment can turn out work.
On the point of industry cutting down on
labour, I might mention that the British
Columbia Electric Company employs a special
staff to think up ways of reducing manpower, and in my home town many of the
women employees in the telephone exchange
have been warned that in the near future
their services will no longer be required because the company is bringing in new equipment. Telephone equipment is becoming so
modernized that if you dial a number and

FEBRUARY 3, 1955
the line is busy you simply hang up, and when
the line becomes free your own set will be
buzzed to let you know.
As another illustration of industry's attempt to cut down on labour by using ultramodern equipment, I heard the other day that
there are only 1,900 employees in Canada's
brewing industry. Much of the work is
done automatically by a comparatively small
group of men who spend their time watching
dials and little clocks and pushing buttons.
As this sort of trend continues more people
will be thrown out of work, and this will
place a most serious burden on the country
and on the Government in power. I would
urge that both industry and the Government
give careful thought to the huge displacement
of manpower which is taking place in industry today.
I can sympathize with any Government
which has to face the responsibility, as it
occurs to me that Governments will, of seeing
to it that there is a job for every married
woman who has a husband and family and
who wants to work. It could prove to be
quite a problem. I do not believe our Unemployment Insurance Commission officials have
experienced such a situation as arose in
Britain some two weeks ago. It seems that
two ladies agreed to hire each other to do
each other's washing, and after six months
they fired each other and applied for and
obtained unemployment insurance.
Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I do not know of what
nationality these people were, but it occurs
to me that it might take a Scot to think up
something like that. I believe it was said
to be legal, too.
I trust no one will think that I am finding
fault with the idea of married women being
employed, for I realize that many of them
feel they have to work in order to augment
their husbands' incomes. On the other hand,
many married women work for other reasons.
I am excluding, of course, widows who must
of necessity go out and work. There is a
growing class of women, however, who have
husbands and homes to look after who go
out and work, contribute towards unemployment insurance, and then periodically quit
or get themselves fired and sit back while
they draw unemployment insurance. This is
one of the problems of our age. I am merely
drawing attention to it, not taking sides
at ail.
In commenting further on technological
advancement in industry, I would point out
that Donald Gordon, in speaking about the
difficulties of operating the railroads, rather
supports my view about industry endeavouring to find ways and means of curtailing

manpower. In an address to a joint meeting
of the Canadian and Empire Clubs of Toronto
in November, 1954, Mr. Gordon said, in part:
Broadly speaking, I see two lines of approach
the reduction of our labour costs per unit
transport service: Technological development,
new "tools of the hand"; managerial progress,
new "tools of the mind".

to
of
or
or

Mr. Gordon has come to the conclusion
that perhaps one way to reduce operating
expenses on the railroads is by introducing
more gadgets and by cutting down on the
number of employees. What will that mean?
It will result in more unemployment; and
so the burden is becoming increasingly heavy
on Governments today. More and more we
are hearing the cry to the Government, "I
am out of work, it is up to you to provide
employment". Something has to be done. I
have drawn attention to the employment of
married women in business and industry, to
emphasize the extra burden that is being
placed on the Government to provide employment for all our people. And, of course,
I am speaking of married women who have
husbands and homes to look after. In this
new age they are joining the ranks of industry in increasing numbers.
Honourable senators, that is about ail I have
to say. I appreciate the kind attention which
I have received, and I hope that some good
will be derived from the remarks I have
made.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. James P. Mclntyre: Honourable senators, it is always difficult to address this house
after the honourable gentleman from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) has made a
speech, but I shall do my best.
One purpose of the Speech from the Throne
is to forecast the legislation that will come
before Parliament in the current session, and
the debate on the Address in reply provides
honourable senators with an opportunity to
take part in a general discussion on matters
they consider to be of public interest, particularly as they apply to those parts of Canada
from which honourable senators come. As
honourable senators know, I come from the
province of Prince Edward Island, but that
does not mean that I am not interested in ail
other parts of Canada as well.
In following the long established custom,
let me congratulate the mover (Hon. Mrs.
Hodges) and the seconder (Hon. Mr. Tremblay)
of the Address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne delivered by His Excellency the
Governor General at the opening of this session of the present Parliament. I wish also
to congratulate the honourable the Leader
of the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) on his splendid address at the
opening of this debate.

SENATE
May I compliment the Honourable the
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) for
the able manner in which he delivered his fine
address. Of course, it is usual for him to
speak well in debate.
In congratulating all the other members
who have spoken, may I say that I was particularly interested in the speech of my
honourable friend from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) on the resolution to rearm Germany, and what happened to those countries
which tried to conquer Europe, namely,
France, Germany and Spain. He mentioned
the Spanish Armada, which reminded me of
my boyhood and school days, and the old
English history which related how the Spanish
Armada sailed up the English Channel, stretching for several miles across the blue waters.
So sure were they of victory, that they called
it the "Invincible Armada." But one dark
night, Lord Howard sent eight fireships among
them, threw them into disorder and put them
to flight. Many of them were lost in the
Orkney Islands, and few of the great ships of
the Armada ever returned to Spain.
As I have already said, I am interested in
all parts of Canada. I am particularly interested in the St. Lawrence Seaway, which
when completed will be of great benefit to
Canada. Half a century of negotiations had
passed between Canada and the United States
before the Government of Canada announced
its decision that Canada would construct the
Seaway alone. As a result of that decision the
United States passed enabling legislation to
co-operate with the Government of Canada in
constructing this all-important project. Although the project had been under consideration by the authorities of both Canada and the
United States for many years-in fact, an
agreement was signed thirteen years agoyet it was not until 1951 that information was
tabled in the House of Commons to the effect
that the two countries had tentatively agreed
in principle to make the St. Lawrence Seaway
development self-liquidating by means of a
toll charge.
From the head of the Great Lakes to the
Atlantic Ocean, a distance of 2,000 miles,
there is a drop in the waterfall of 580 feet,
which when harnessed is capable of developing 9 million horsepower of electric energy.
According to estimates of prominent engineers, this great potential possibility, of which
the greater part is on the Canadian side,
follows from the head of the Great Lakes,
St. Mary's Falls, Lake Huron, Lake Erie,
Niagara River, Lake Ontario, the International Rapids, Lachine Section and from Montreal to the Atlantic Ocean, a distance of
1,000 miles. This section from Montreal lies
wholly on Canadian territory.

I understand this great project will be
financed partly by New York State and
Ontario for power purposes, and by the
United States and Canada, and I believe the
major part will be paid by the taxpayers from
all parts of Canada.
In the Maritime Provinces we have a project that has been talked of not for one-half
century, not for one century, nor two centuries, but for 260 years, since the days of the
first Acadian settlers-the Chignecto Canal;
but it was not until 1822 that the first practical steps were taken. A survey was made
in that year, and according to competent
engineers of that day the project was feasible
and desirable. However, nothing came of
this until the pre-Confederation negotiations
of 1864 and 1866. This was one of the inducements held out, along with others, if the
Maritimes would join Confederation.
The
idea of Confederation was initiated by Ontario and Quebec, and it was done for the
purpose of settling a long outstanding dispute
between those provinces. The statesmen of
Ontario and Quebec knew that Confederation
could not be complete without the co-operation of the Maritime Provinces, so they
resolved themselves into a delegation and
proceeded to the Maritimes.
Among the
delegates were Sir John A. Macdonald, Sir
George Cartier, George Brown, Sir Charles
Tupper and other notables. The convention
was held in Charlottetown on September 1,
1864.
The delegates were well aware of the
adverse conditions under which they were to
meet. They knew that the Maritime Provinces had established a satisfactory trade
among themselves, that their markets were
close at hand and easy of access, and that
traffic to these markets was mainly by sea.
Our American neighbours bought all the
lumber, fish and agricultural products that
the Maritimes had to offer. In fact, before
Confederation the United States was not
only our nearest but our most profitable
market, and after Confederation these markets would be lost. To offset this, certain
inducements were held out to the people of
the Maritimes to consent to Confederation:
a better and more profitable market, that
of the central provinces, might be substituted
therefor; the coal of Nova Scotia was to find
a market in Toronto; the fish, lumber and
agricultural products were to find a market
in Quebec and Montreal.
But as time went on it was found almost
impossible to fulfil these promises, and it
turned out that the coal of Nova Scotia did
not find a market in Toronto, and that the
fish, lumber and agricultural products did not
find a market in Quebec and Montreal. In the
meantime, the New England markets had

FEBRUARY 3, 1955

-

been lost. And this is one of the reasons
why the Maritime Provinces are lagging
behind the rest of the provinces of Canada.
With the construction of the Chignecto
Canal, the markets between the Maritimes,
the central provinces and New England,
would be shortened by an average distance
of 568 miles: for instance, from Charlottetown to Boston, 442 miles; from Montreal to
Joggins, Nova Scotia, 640 miles; from Summerside to Portland, Maine, 511 miles; from
Saint John, New Brunswick, to Pictou, 553
miles; from Newcastle to Saint John, 612 miles,
and so on. This would provide cheaper water
transportation for the products of these three
provinces. In fact, construction of the Chignecto Canal was a definite pledge prior to
Confederation.
In 1887, the Government led by Sir John
A. Macdonald called for tenders for the construction of the Chignecto Canal. The Government of the Honourable Alexander MacKenzie included the project as an item in the
budget on two occasions, but nothing was
done.
Again, in 1930, a Royal Commission was
appointed by the Mackenzie King Government to inquire into the project, but in that
year his Government was defeated, and
nothing was done. About a year later the
Government led by R. B. Bennett appointed
-its -owi con-mission of inquiry, but stili
nothing was done; and nothing has been done
up to the present time.
Now that the St. Lawrence Seaway is
assured-which when completed will be of
incalculable benefit to the central and western
provinces-is it not reasonable for the 'people
of the Maritime provinces to demand that the
Chignecto Canal be constructed without further delay, as an extension of the St. Lawrence Seaway?
The building of the Chignecto Canal in
conjunction with the St. Lawrence Seaway,
on which a large amount of money is to be
spent, would give the Maritimes a short route
to the New England States. I think it is up
to the members of the House of Commons
and Senators from the Maritime Provinces,
to stand together and fight to have this long
overdue and important project, promised at
the time of Confederation, made a reality.
As I have said, I am interested in all parts
of Canada. I am especially interested in
provincial Governments, having been a member of one for a number of years, and I still
follow their activities. At the end of 1952
or the first part of 1953 I was much disappointed to read in a publication by the
Dominion Bureau of Statistics that the
provincial debt of Canada's ten provinces
rose in one year by $279,622,000 to a total of

$3,145,044,000. On a population basis this
works out to $218.33 for each person in
Canada, an increase of $13.37 for that year.
As the population has increased since that
time, I presume the provincial debt is now
much higher. Perhaps the provincial governments will say that this is none of our concern. But the members of the House of
Commons and of the Senate represent all
the people of Canada. If the Bureau of Statistics sees fit to publish it, I see nothing wrong
in referring to it in this chamber.
It may be that the tax rental agreements
should be revised to give the provinces morE
rent. According to the statistics I read,
British Columbia, with a population as of
the last census of 1,165,000-the honourable
mover of the Address (Hon. Mrs. Hodges)
gave the figure as 1,200,000-has a total debt
of $280 million, or a per capita debt of $240.
Alberta, with its great source of wealth
from oil and natural gas, one would expect to
have no provincial debt at all. But that
province, with a population of 939,000, has
an indebtedness of $111 million, or a per
capita debt of $118.
Saskatchewan, that great wheat-producing
province, from which the honourable senator
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) comes,
is by no means free of debt. It has a population of 831,000 and a provincial debt of $164
millinn, or aper capitaudebtùof $198.
Manitoba, another good grain producing
province, the home of my friend the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig), has its provincial debt. According to
the statisties I have, with a population of
776,000 it carries a total debt of $140 million,
or a per capita rate of $181.
That great manufacturing province, Ontario, which pays 48 per cent of all the
corporation income tax, is by no means free
of debt. In fact, its debt amounts to onethird of the total of the other nine provinces.
With a population of 4,500,000, at the last
census, but which is now more than 5 million, it carries a total provincial debt of
$1,376 million, which works out to a per
capita rate of $299.
I now come to the province of Quebec,
another great manufacturing province, and
it too is in debt. I read recently a statement
by a prominent public man of that province
that Quebec was different from any other
province. I do not see how it can be said
that Quebec differs much from any other
province. It has its provincial Government,
its law courts, judges and lawyers; It has
rivers and lakes, cities and towns, as all
provinces have. True, the majority of its
people are French speaking. They are a very
fine race of people; indeed, they measure up
with the best people in any part of the

SENATE
world today. There are French-speaking
people in every province in Canada. Some
15 per cent of the population of Prince
Edward Island are French speaking, and
many of them have reached positions of
prominence. One French-speaking gentleman
was a professor at the Prince of Wales College;
another is a judge of our Supreme Court,
and a recent Lieutenant-Governor was a
French Canadian. I can never understand
why it should be claimed by some persons
that Quebec is any different from the other
provinces of Canada. Her population of 4
million carries a provincial debt of $660
million, or a per capita debt of $162.
I come next to the province of New Brunswick which, from a financial standpoint,
appears to be worse off than any other province. With a population of 515,000, it has a
provincial debt of $176 million, or a per
capita debt of $340.
Nova Scotia is not quite as badly off as
New Brunswick. It has a population of
642,000 and a provincial debt of $180 million,
or a per capita debt of $280.
Next, I come to the small province of
Prince Edward Island with practically no
industries, except its agricultural products,
particularly seed potatoes, and its fisheries.
With a population, according to the last
census, of 98,000, it has a provincial debt of
$18 million, or a per capita debt of $181.
Lastly, I shall deal with that great fishing
province, Newfoundland. Despite the fact
that the greater part of its provincial debt
was taken over by the federal Government
when that province united with Canada, its
population of 361,000 people carries a provincial debt of $36 million, or a per capita
debt of $101, the lowest of any Canadian
province.
As I have said, the provincial governments may feel that we have no right to
discuss their financial position. However, as
representatives of the people in all parts of
Canada, we must realize that this situation
cannot go on year after year. If it does the
inevitable result will be either that the provinces will be unable to sell their bonds or
they will have to realize greater revenues
from increased taxation.
I was listening to my honourable friend
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner), for
whom I have great respect, not to his speech
of yesterday, but to his few remarks here
about a week ago, when he said that, while
be did net want to detract from any of the
credit due to the present Prime Minister of
Canada. it was Sir Winston Churchill who
initiated the Atlantic Pact, at a speech in
Fulton, Missouri. Well, that is not what Sir
Winston Churchill says himself. At a banquet
in the Chateau Laurier the last time Churchill

was in Canada he gave sole credit to our
Prime Minister. My friend the Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) told this
house that the present Prime Minister of
Canada was the man who initiated action for
the making of the Atlantic Pact, and I am
going to quote his words, knowing that he
will not mind. They are to be found on page
340 of the Senate Hansard of April 28, 1949:
The Progressive
Conservative party in
this
chamber and in every part of Canada stands
four-square behind the Atlantic Pact.
I congratulate the present Prime Minister of Canada on
the distinguished part he played in initiating
action for the making of this agreement; and
whether or not he continues in his present office
after the election, his advocacy of the Atlantic
Pact will be one of the greatest achievements of
his life.
Canadian Liberals and Conservatives
join wholeheartedly in acclaiming the pact.

Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. McIntyre: That does not bear out
the statement of the honourable member from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner).
Hon. Mr. Horner: It does not alter my belief
at all.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: No conversion!
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: My honourable friend
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) spoke
about the cold war and said that we are living
in a troubled time. We are living in the time
of a cold war and also of a shooting war.
Do honourable members not think it is time
that the people of the whole world looked
somewhere for divine guidance
Should we
not look to the leadership of the Pope, the
head of the great Catholie Church; to the
leadership of the great Protestant Churches;
to the leadership of all the other churches?
Let them bind themselves together and tell
the warring nations to stop their wholesale
slaughter of men, women and children, stop
their racial and religious intolerance before
the whole human race sinks into the common
grave of disease, death and destruction.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE

next

60 for women, and the lack of employment
opportunities for unemployed people of 40
or 45-or, in the case of women, even of 35
years of age. I certainly endorse the statement of the honourable senator from Victoria
when she says we are not doing all that we
might for the aged, and for those who are too
old at 45, and those who have to get out
at 65. I believe, with her, that we shall
have to change our present estimate of old
age and base our estimate, not on chronological age or the number of birthdays an
employee has had, but on his ability to do
a job efficiently.
Because I have taken a very special interest during the past year or so in the problems
of Canada's senior citizens, I would like to
discuss some of the things that have been
done for them and some that might be done.
As we all know, the normal span of life
has been greatly increased. In 1900, in the
western world, life expectancy was 49 years.
Now it has increased to 65 years. This is due
to improved medical services and nursing
services, better sanitation and higher nutritional standards, all of which have lowered
the death rates to about one-half of what
they were 100 years ago.
According to the 1951 census the working
population in Canada-that is, those from
20 to 59 years of age-is much more heavily
weighted with people in the higher age group,
from 55 to 59, than in the group from 20
to 35.
In the older age group, those of 60 or over,
there has been a very great increase since
censuses were first taken, in 1881. In 1881
the total population over 60 was 275,988, but
in 1951 it had increased to 1,592,025; and it
is estimated that in 20 years' time-that is,
in 1971-the number over 60 will b2 2,200,000.
This represents an increase of 477 per cent
in the number of people of 60 years and
over between 1881 and 1951, whereas the percentage of increase in the total population
was only 154 per cent. Referring to this,
Dr. O. A. Lemieux, Director of the Census
Division of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics,
in a speech to the Annual Meeting of the
Canadian Public Health Association, which
is published in the December 1954 issue of
the Canadian Journal of Public Health, says:

MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Thursday, February 3, consideration of His Excellency the
Governor General's Speech at the opening
of the session and the motion of Hon. Mrs.
Hodges, seconded by Hon. Mr. Tremblay,

Canadian. But I was particularly interested
in the references made by the honourable would like to quote from a paper by Frank W.
Notestein of the Office of Population Research of
senator from Victoria (Hon. Mrs. Hodges) to Princeton University to the American Philosophical
the problems of the older worker regarding Society. He states: "Viewed as a whole, the
problerm of aging is no problem
is only
compulsory retirement at 65 for men and the pessimistic way of looking atata all. It triumph
great

FEBRUARY 8, 1955
The population of the United
of civilization.
States, and of the Western World in general, bas
grown older because it bas learned to be efficient
in the renewal of its life". Today, one thousand
births yield about twice as large a fund of life
as they produced in Colonial times, and as they
produce today among more than one-half of the
world's population. We are a relatively old population partly because so many of us have been
successful in achieving our goal of individual
survival. So, with a perversity that is strictly
human, we insist on considering the aggregate
result of our individual successes as a problem.

Then he goes on:
To suggest that the aging of the population is
to be viewed as an asset is, of course, not at all
to suggest that there are no problems of economic
and social adaptation to be faced.

As Dr. Notestein says: Some of these
problems are economic ones, such as employment of those members of the older population who want to work and who are capable
of doing so; other problems are social, such
as housing for older citizens and the providing of occupation, recreation and education
for the older citizens.
Because our nation is relatively young, we
have placed a premium on the attributes of
youth, such as speed, aggressiveness and
acquisitiveness. In employment, as in other
fields, we have placed the "accent" on
"youth", have tolerated maturity, but have
frequently regarded as negligible the abilities
and capacities of those who have passed into
what is looked on as the older-age group.
In a country that is committed to the principle of non-discrimination, is it logical that
in the field of employment we should accept
practices that discriminate against a large
and ever-increasing class of our population?
This problem of employment of the older
worker is one that has been of great interest
in other countries, in many of which considerable research has been done to determine if such discrimination is justified.
We, too, through our Department of Labour
and our Department of Veterans Affairs, have
studied the problem of the older worker,
and efforts have been made to encourage
employers to appreciate the value which
the services of such older workers may have
for them.
To illustrate some of the efforts made in
this direction: in 1951 the Information Branch
of the Department of Labour prepared an
original script entitled "Date of Birth", which
was produced by the National Film Board
and shown more than 750 times throughout
Canada, to more than 57,000 people, most of
whom were of the executive class and directly
concerned with hiring policies. The purpose
of the film was to bring to the attention
of the Canadian people the problem of the
older worker, with a view to expanding
employment opportunities for these workers.

A report on the film was most encouraging
and revealed that, after showings in Halifax,
a number of employers who had previously
stated an age limit in their request for
employees, called the employment office to
amend the age qualification. They had been
sufficiently impressed to think that the limitation was unnecessary.
Here is another instance. In Alberta, a
sales manager of a large firm reported he was
hiring thirty salesmen in Western Canada.
After seeing the film, he decided to insert in
his advertisement that "age is no barrier".
These are typical of the results listed in the
report as having been achieved by the film
showings.
You will be interested to know, honourable
senators, that besides having been shown in
Canada, this film has been shown extensively
by the United Kingdom Ministry of Labour
in the British Isles.
Also, in 1952, an extensive memorandum on
the problem of the older worker was prepared by the Department of Labour for the
National Advisory Council on Manpower.
This memorandum gave figures drawing
attention to the great increase among Canada's population, since 1881, of persons over
40 years of age, and it was pointed out that
the tendency of employers to reject applicants
over that age involved a serious problem. The
memorandum points out that from the point
of view of the national economy, if the trend
towards rejection of older people from the
productive section of society continues, while
at the same time young people tend to require
more years of education before they reach
earning powers, the decreasing working force
may not be able to achieve for all of us as
high a standard of living as we might otherwise hope for.
The memorandum quotes statements by
well-known authorities on geriatrics. One of
these claims that not all changes that come
with age are decline; that speed of reaction
does not diminish but that endurance increases. He points out that it is not without
significance that in foot racing the records
for all sprints are held by youngsters, but
the marathon records are held by men of 38
to 45. As speed declines, he says, skill is
increased and, as strength declines, judgment increases. Another authority on these
matters is quoted in this memorandum as
saying:
It should be pointed out that no differences in
efficiency in the performance of moderate work
are observed between 17 and 71 years.

This finding, he says, is of considerable
importance, since most work of an industrial
nature falls in the classification of moderate
work.

SENATE

Honourable senators, we know that all
through life there are compensations and if
we lose one faculty other faculties will become
more acute. Workers will try harder to concentrate on the things they can do when they
realize that there are some things which they
cannot do. To illustrate, let me tell you the
story of a man who applied for work in a
dockyard. He was told by the employer, "I
am sorry, but I don't think you can do the
hard work that these young fellows here can
do." The man replied, "Well, maybe that
is right but I am sure I can do as much as
they intend to do".
Some specific points raised in the memorandum as reasons for not hiring older workers
are the supposed inability of older workers
to learn and adapt themselves to new techniques. During World War II this argument
was found to be unsound. An experiment at
Columbia University dealing with training
and retraining workers found that intellectual
power does not change from about 20 to 60
years of age. The often-repeated theories
that older workers are more prone to accidents and are more often affected by absenteeism, have been proven to be false. A study of
accident frequency shows that the highest
accident frequency is between the ages of
20 and 24, and the lowest between 30 and 55.
A survey by the United States Bureau of
Labour Statistics shows that the absenteeism
rate is the same for those between 65 and 74
as for those between 35 and 64.
Reference is made in the memorandum to
other unsound beliefs held by employers, such
as that the public prefer younger workers for
jobs requiring public contacts, which belief,
on investigation, appears to have no basis in
fact.
The greatest objection raised by employers
to the employment of older workers is that it
is impossible to absorb older workers into
health and retirement pension plans. Investigation and study of rates reveal that this is
not an insurmountable barrier. One large
Canadian life insurance company quoted rates
for group insurance as $6.5 per $1,000 annually at age 25, and $7.85 per $1,000 annually
at age 40. The addition of a percentage of
older workers would not change the overail
costs very much. At the present time, a
number of studies are being made to determine if pension plans can be worked out that
will be acceptable and will overcome this
objection that has been raised.
In an article in the January 31, 1948, issue
of Saturday Night, Seymour Pennycuick
quoted a prominent insurance officer as
saying:
I know of no pension plan which, in itself,
makes impossible the employment of older men.
To say that it does, is sheer nonsense. Yet, the

use of
poliey
sound
is, by

that threadbare argument to bolster up a
of discrimination which originates in unempIoyment practice and person prejudice
no means, uncommon.

On the question of the attitude of the unions
towards this matter, I would like to quote
from an article entitled "Should Retirement at
65 be Compulsory?" which appeared in the
Canadian Unionist of March 1952. It reads
in part as follows:
In an article entitled, "Union Policies and the
Older Worker", Solomon Barkin, Research Director
of the Textile Workers Union of America, states:
"Unions have resisted the compulsory retirement of workers when they have passed a partieular age, even where there is a pension program.
Several strikes have centered about this issue.
The unions have contended that the worker has
a right to his job at least as long as he is
qualified. Where there is a pension program, the
worker should be able to retain his job at his
own discretion, and carry the normal rights to
the job. Pension programs are designed to provide
an adequate alternative to aged workers, who do
not desire to continue their employment."

Honourable senators, to return to the
memorandum of the Department of Labour: it
mentions the work done by the Department
of Veterans Affairs to secure employment for
older veterans. The memorandum points out
too that, in the work of this department there
bas been no attempt to over-emphasize the
importance of the older person to the detriment of other groups, but officers have tried
to treat these older people as individuals with
abilities which employers can still use. Fitness for employment and ability to do a day's
work have been stressed, rather than the
chronological age of the applicant. This is
the treatment which applicants for work
should receive if the theory of non-discrimination is applied to our citizens.
The National Advisory Committee on Manpower bas a subcommittee dealing with
"Employment problems of older workers."
This subcommittee has been keeping the subject of older workers under continuous review,
and recently worked with the Canadian
Manufacturers Association in a survey of the
attitudes of employers to this question. The
result of that survey will be very interesting.
The Canadian Welfare Council and some of
its affiliated societies have also made a study
of the question. Because of the importance
of this matter to women, studies of the problem have been carried on by various women's
organizations.

I am

familiar

with two of

these, namely, that of the National Council
of Women and the Canadian Federation of
Business and Professional Women.
In the decade from 1941 to 1951 the labour
force in Canada increased in size by about
23 per cent, but during that period the female
labour force increased by 37 per cent. This
number is increasing rapidly, and I think at
present amounts to 1,200,000 plus. Because

FEBRUARY 8, 1955
the prevalent discrimination against older
employees bears most heavily on women,
causing them to be considered too old at an
earlier age than men, I am very particularly
interested in this problem.
Honourable senators, this is a field where
our newly-organized Women's Bureau in the
Department of Labour can do a great deal
of valuable work, if the Bureau is supplied
with adequate funds. Women's organizations
are very interested and anxious to know that
such funds will be made available.
If any honourable senators do not already
know it, they will be interested to learn that
the regulations under the Public Service
Superannuation Act now make it possible
for employees of 65 to postpone retirement
until 70, if the employee wishes to continue
to work, is efficient, and his work is satisfactory to his Deputy Minister. Then, too,
the fixed maximum age limit for entrance to
the Civil Service was abolished in 1953 in
the large majority of entrance competitions.
Al these things show that, in Canada, we
recognize that we are faced with a problem
in regard to our older workers and are doing
our best to solve it, but because it is evident
that prejudice still exists in many places, I
feel more should be done to make our citizens
generally aware-and particularly those that
hire and deal with staffs-that many of the
current beliefs regarding older workers are
not based on facts, that a person's age cannot be determined chronologically but should
be judged rather by his ability to do a job.
We need wider education of the general
public on this matter.
There are other problems connected with
the increasing number of older citizens in our
population which require consideration and
action. One of the chief of these is the matter
of supplying housing for this older group. In
earlier times in Canada, when our population
was predominantly rural, older members of
the family, such as grandparents or aunts,
did many of the lighter family chores and
there was always space for them to live in
the family home. Because of the help they
could give, their presence was welcomed,
and they felt they were making a contribution to the upkeep of the home. Now, with
our population living mostly in towns and
cities, where mechanical devices do away
with many of the former family chores and
houses are too small for more than the immediate family, there is a great need for
suitable housing for older people, particularly
for those who have retired and are living on
a reduced income.
A large number of older people live in
quarters far from healthful or comfortable,
such as attics or basements, because of the

high cost of suitable space for rent. Many
room and board in private homes, where
they share inadequate quarters with lowincome families who use this method to supplement their incomes. Others live in institutions, although they would be happier in
small homes where, with little assistance,
they could look after themselves and have
more privacy.
Older countries realized many years ago
that the increasing number of older people
in their population made special housing for
the aged necessary. It was as early as the
1920's and 30's that the Danish Government
arranged to give financial assistance to various forms of housing, including housing for
the aged. In that country now more than
one-third of all municipalities have provided
small homes, devoid of institutional atmosphere, for old-age pensioners. In some places
modern apartment blocks containing lowrental apartments for aged persons have been
constructed through public funds.
In the British Isles, provision for the aged
has been part of the general housing program,
which has been organized on a national scale.
In England, too, an interesting experiment
which has been tried, is the attaching of a
small, self-contained housekeeping unit to the
single family dwelling, called the "plus
Granny flat". If it is no longer needed by
the older members of the family, it can be
rented and bring in a return. On the retirement of the occupants of the larger dwelling,
or if either of them should become widowed
and need additional income, a move can be
made into the "plus Granny flat" and the
larger accommodation can be let. It is an
idea that might well be adopted here.
Sweden, Switzerland, The Netherlands and
Germany have recognized the need of housing
projects to provide for the special needs of
older people. In Canada some interest has
been aroused, in the last few years, in plans
for providing suitable living accommodation
for able-bodied, older people at a rent they
can afford to pay. These are usually small
apartments, or cottage-type accommodation,
of not more than two or, at most, three
rooms. The National Housing Act, under
section 16, provides for liberal loans to
limited dividend companies for such persons.
The loan may be for 90 per cent of the
lending value of the project, and repayment
may be spread over 50 years. Some provinces
have legislation that makes it possible for
them to supplement the assistance that can
be secured under the National Housing Act.
According to an article in the September
18, 1954 issue of the Financial Post, under
the heading "A New Deal for our Senior
Citizens", it is stated that, up to that date,
sixteen projects for senior citizen housing

SENATE
have been approved under the Housing Act.
It might be interesting for honourable senators to know that, of the sixteen projects,
eight are in British Columbia.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: I presume the reason
is, as the honourable senator from Victoria
(Hon. Mrs. Hodges) told us, that British
Columbia had a larger percentage of older
residents than had other parts of Canada.
Another reason might be that that province
is more alive to the urgent need of those
residents.
Most of the projects referred to by the
Financial Post are sponsored by municipalities and by such service clubs as the
Lions, Kiwanis and Kinsmen. The article
mentions several similar projects which are
being planned. A few have been undertaken
by national groups. In this field the pioneer
work was done by the Danish people when
they established their home, "Dania", in
Burnaby, British Columbia. The Icelandic
and Norwegian people have followed with
similar projects, as have several church
groups. These projects are scattered from
Victoria, British Columbia, to Ottawa, and
although they are encouraging we have
barely scratched the surface of the great need
for such accommodation for our senior
citizens.
The Financial Post article states-and of
this I am not so proud-that "the Maritimes
have been a little slow in developing possibilities." While this is to be regretted, the
possibilities that have been used to advantage elsewhere open ways for others, and
we hope that with increased publicity about
them they will be adopted in many other
parts of Canada, including the Maritimes.
The article further states that, with the
lengthening average life, in 1975 there should
be more than one million people over- 70
years of age and something like 600,000
between the ages of 65 and 70. It can be
taken for granted now that in our urbanized
society a great many of these people cannot
be fitted into the homes of their families;
and, if they are to be safely and comfortably
housed-that is, neither in attics that are
fire hazards nor in basements that are damp
-many more projects must be undertaken to
provide for them.
Of course, besides the economic and housing problems in connection with our increased
population of senior citizens, there are social
problems which must be faced. In Canada
we have provided a considerable amount of
financial security for our older citizens
through our progressive Old Age Security
and Old Age Assistance programs. No one

could know better than I, who have administered the Old Age Security program in one
province, what a boon these pensions are
to our senior citizens. However, we have
to remember that, though it is very essential
to have bread, "man cannot live by bread
alone." For that reason in the lives of all
older citizens who are no longer employed
there must be some occupation, whether it
yields a financial return or not; there must
be some recreation and there must be a
sense of "being wanted"-a sense that they
are important to someone.
It is recognized as better economy to provide the retired older citizen with interests
than to have him lapse into physical or
mental illness which is much more costly to
the community and which, in many cases,
seems to be the alternative. To provide
recreational and educational interests, local
communities in many countries have organized for their older citizens clubs such as
Cleveland's "Live Long and Like It Clubs",
and "The Golden Age Clubs" sponsored by
business and professional groups. In Canada
we have some such groups-I think of the
"Over Sixty Club" in Hamilton-but they
are all too fev.
In some countries, Day Care Centres for
older retired citizens have been established.
Last year I visited one such centre in New
York City and became most enthusiastic
about the work they do and the change they
make in the lives of those who attend. The
centre, sponsored by the Department of
Welfare and a local voluntary board, was
open five days a week. I understand the
department supplies only professional services by way of leadership and that the
local board does everything else. The members, I found, enjoyed friendly companionship with people of their own age, learned
new hobbies and played games. Many, for
the first time, took up painting or the playing of musical instruments. Here I would
remind honourable senators that these are
not all indigent people; indeed, some of them
are quite able to live in homes of their own,
but nobody was particularly interested in
them and they had no interest in others,
so they had been spending long days by
themselves in their homes.
At the centre I visited lunch is served
every day and the members take turns looking after it. It is a very simple lunch, but
the older people feel important when they
have this responsibility.
I was told that an actual survey revealed
that before the opening of the centre many
of the regular members had been frequent
and some had been regular attendants at

FEBRUARY 8, 1955
clinics and had considered themselves semiinvalids, but after they became interested
in the centre their visits to the clinics had
ceased completely. In other words, they found
the Day Care Centre more entertaining than
the clinic. That in itself results in a great
saving of both money and the services of
trained medical people.
There are fourteen such centres in New
York City alone, and the idea bas spread to
other cities in the United States, to England,
France and Australia. A very few such
centres are operating in Canada; for example,
the "Second Mile Club" in Toronto, which is
for people over 60 and is open seven
days a week. But we need many, many more
to serve the thousands of older people of
Canada.
The National Council of Jewish Women
sponsors a number of weekly workshops providing occupations for retired men. The
things they produce are usually given for
use in community projects, and this makes
the men feel they are still contributing to
community life. The Soroptimist Clubs have
done commendable work in this field. One
outstanding contribution is that of giving
scholarships so that social workers can learn
more about the science of aging and how to
treat it.
The recreational and educational projects
for older citizens which have been tried out
in different places are numerous; I could not
even list all of those about which I have
read. The reason why communities in Canada are slow in organizing projects, most of
which are started locally, is that we do not
have sufficient knowledge about what has
been done by other people who have been
faced with problems similar to ours. Older
countries have met these problems earlier,
and it might well be helpful to us to know
what they have done.
It is imperative that more publicity be
given to the experiments which have already
been tried, and the satisfying results in
happiness and improvement of physical and
mental health for older citizens. If these
things were known, more of our communities would, undoubtedly, copy them or adopt
them to their own local situations. The Canadian Welfare Council has recently set up a
committee whose terms of reference include
acting as a clearing house for general reports
on this subject.
The necessity of making the problems regarding aging population widely known, has
been recognized and faced in many countries.
Various methods have been adopted to meet
this need. In the United States a National
Conference on Aging was held in Washington,
in 1950, under federal auspices. Since then

there has been, under the Federal Security
Agency and its successor, the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare, a Committee
on Aging and Geriatrics.
State governments have recognized the
problem and have set up committees and
commissions to make surveys and do educational work. The best known is that of
Senator Thomas Desmond of New York
State. Other states doing work in this field
include Michigan, Rhode Island, Florida,
California, North Carolina. I have read
reports of these bodies, but not of those in
other states.
The problem is so universal that three
international gerontological congresses have
been held. The last one, held in London in
July 1954, was attended by representatives
from more than fifty countries, so it is evident that interest in this matter is widespread.
Honourable senators, our own national
problem in this field is one that we will have
to solve, and its solution will require the
combined efforts of governments at all levels
as well as the help of our many voluntary
agencies and service groups. Part of our
difficulties lie, I think, in the lack of understanding of the nature and scope of the problem and the lack of knowledge concerning
the financial assistance that really is available to assist in solving certain aspects of the
problem.
With regard to the employment problem
of the older worker, we need to develop a
much better understanding of this question
among employers and organized labour, and
especially among the public at large.
A great deal has already been done by the
Department of Labour in pointing up the
nature of employment problems of the older
worker and in dispelling a lot of misunderstanding concerning his abilities and disabilities. Much remains to be done, both
within and outside the Government, before
we can solve this very stubborn problem. I
think it is only by making employment opportunities available to older workers that we can
ensure a greater economic gain for the country
as a whole and a more effective and happy
life for our senior citizens.
In this country, of course, a large sector of
older workers find themselves in a position
where they have adequate housing and satisfactory health and welfare services to meet
their individual needs, but a very large group
in our population-which group will probably increase in size as our population ageshave not satisfactory housing accommodation
nor adequate provision for health care and
certain other welfare services. The needs of
this group are considerable, particularly in

SENATE
view of the large number of people involved,
and it will certainly tax the ingenuity of governments-federal, provincial and local-as
well as of voluntary agencies, to make even
minimum provision for their housing and
social welfare.
It would appear, honourable senators, that
the most urgent need at this time is to focus
attention on the nature and scope of this
problem and to cultivate a better understanding of ways and means in which some of
these difficulties can be solved.
A number of possibilities come to mind:
for example, it might be possible to create
interest in and draw attention to this question
through the establishment of a parliamentary
committee to consider the aspects of provision for old age security other than maintenance, in the same way that, in 1950, the
Joint Parliamentary Committee of the Senate
and House of Commons on Old Age Security
considered the problem of old age pensions in
regard to maintenance.
Another possibility might be the establishment of a Commission on Aging, such as has
been established in many of the American
states. These bodies have permitted legislators at State level and other interested persons and groups to assess the problem as it
affected their own particular State and to
come to some decision as to how they would
meet it.
Again, while governments have a real
responsibility in this area I do not think it
can be denied that there is a governmental
responsibility-it is traditional in Canada for
voluntary agencies to spearhead movements
for improvement in welfare in new fields and
to carry an important share in the development of the necessary welfare services.
The Canadian Welfare Council, which is a
co-ordinating agency, gives leadership in nongovernment fields and seems to be the focal
point for advancing study and promoting
publicity of a non-government nature. This
work the Council, through its Committee on
the Aging, would gladly do in this field, but
at present it is hampered by a lack of funds
to permit the employment of a full-time staff
to carry on the work of a committee. Its
progress, therefore, would be very slow as it
would have to depend upon what its members
and others could do in their spare time. One
tangible way of helping the council to make
progress would be to provide sufficient funds
to enable the committee to operate efficiently.
If our government is not prepared to take a
lead itself by appointing a parliamentary committee or a commission to study this matter,
and to hold meetings at which publicity would
be given to the problem, financial assistance

to the Canadian Welfare Council would be a
token of the Government's interest in this
matter.
Honourable senators, I have taken the
privilege of asking to have placed on your
desks a pamphlet on aging entitled Everyone
grows old, prepared by the Canadian Welfare
Council. It is just off the press, and I hope
you may find it interesting.
We all agree, I am sure, with the statement
by Professor Notestein, which I read to you
earlier, that the increase in our span of life is
a "triumph of civilization". But, honourable
senators, this "triumph" will be a defeat
unless we see that every person in Canada
gets the most he or she possibly can out of
the added years, for of what value is this
"triumph" if these added years are to be
empty and meaningless?
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt, the
debate was adjourned.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION

FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session
and the motion of Hon. Mrs. Hodges, seconded
by Hon. Mr. Tremblay, for an Address in
reply thereto.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, my first words in rising will be to pay
tribute to our gracious Sovereign. May God
protect her and her family, and give her a
reign of peace!
May the Queen Mother, who visited us
lately and by whose charm we were captivated, live a long and happy life!
To the Governor General, who, with such
remarkable dignity, represents the authority
in our country, I express my heartfelt greetings.
To our distinguished Speaker, I extend my
very best wishes.
To the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) I can think of no other wish than
that he should long direct our discussions and
keep forever his friendly smile. May I congratulate him upon his appointment of the
senator from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Godbout)
to assist him. My best wishes to our Leader
and to his assistant.
(Text):
I wish many more years to the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig),
so that he may continue to tell us often, with

FEBRUARY 9, 1955
the enthusiasm of youth, about his wonderful city of Winnipeg. May his criticisms
always be of a constructive nature.
And now, may I say a few words concerning the mover of the Address, the honourable
senator from Victoria (Hon. Mrs. Hodges).
The city of Victoria is known as the city of
flowers. Well, we have among us the prettiest flower, which is not by any means on
the verge of wilting.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: At what age does
one become old, I wonder? One may be old
at 20. I know people of 20 who are old because they no longer believe in the future;
they are pessimists who see nothing good or
beautiful around them: they are old because
there is no love, no ideal, no beauty in their
hearts. But I know people of 80 who are
still young, young with all their hopes, their
faith in life, young because their hearts are
filled with love and devotion toward their
compatriots and their country.
In other words, one may be young at 80
and old at 20.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: The mover of the
Address, the honourable senator from Victoria, has shown us how to stay young. She
illustrated this best when she expounded the
potential economic development of her
province.
And concerning the honourable senator
from Fredericton (Hon. Mrs. Fergusson),
may I say that after listening to the splendid
speech delivered by our honourable colleague
last night I know why she was selected by
the Canadian Welfare Council as Chairman
of its very important Committee on Aging.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
(Translation):
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: The seconder of the
Address, who comes from my own section of
the country and who is utterly fearless, 'bas
raised a most interesting point with regard to
the whole social economy of the nation when
he spoke of housing.
Social security is one of our most popular
topics. But can social security be provided
unless the family is made secure at the same
time? One of the surest ways of ensuring
family security is to see that every family bas
its own home. I hope some day we will
realize that therein lies one of the greatest
factors of security and prosperity for the
nation. That is why I sincerely hope that
the Housing Act, and section 35 thereof in
particular, will be approved in my province
as soon as possible.

Taxes have been discussed, and the Leader
of the Opposition has said that they are too
high. I would not say that taxes are too
high, but I agree with him that they are very
high. Is it not better, however, to have high
taxation so as to keep our economic life going
and at the same time to organize the defence
of our country? Most assuredly, if we fail
to organize our defence and tomorrow our
enemies realize our weakness, the outcome is
easy to predict. We will then be required to
pay a much heavier tax, the tax of blood, of
bondage and of slavery. Is that what we
want? I do not think so.
Some years ago, I visited one of the
smaller centres of our province in order to
attend a series of lectures given by wellinformed personalities. On a Sunday afternoon, hundreds of people congregated at the
meeting place to take part in a forum on the
theme of inflation, deflation, taxation and
unemployment insurance. At the end of the
discussion an honest fisherman rose and said:
"Tell me, is it better to pay taxes, have an
income and work as we do today, or to go
back to the conditions which prevailed in
1932-35?" The question required no answer
and the audience broke into applause. It
seems to me that that good man's conclusion
was wisdom itself. When the wheels stop
turning, there are no taxes to pay, but it is
better to pay taxes with the money you earn
than not to pay any and starve.
The Leader of the Government has informed us that a committee will be appointed to study seriously and thoroughly
what concrete means can be taken to stop
As honourable
the trafflc of narcotics.
senators know, that is one of the Communists' means of propaganda, for they hope
in this way to weaken Western nations. They
seek to spread the use of these drugs to the
four corners of the world because they
weaken men physically as well as mentally.
They would thus undermine the very basis
of all Christian culture.
I congratulate our Leader upon this step.
But I would ask him to extend the scope of
his inquiry so as to find some way of putting a stop to another kind of narcotic, as
nefarieus as the first. I mean licentious
literature and all the, crime comics which
are about to pervert our youth and will tomorrow cause the moral and spiritual downfall of our nation.
Over the past few years, and especially in
the last few months, I have seen these filthy
sheets appearing weekly and reporting the
lewdest crimes, especially sexual crimes.
These pocket books or digests explain in
detail every kind of debauchery. An effort
is made to awaken in the hearts of our young

SENATE
people every perverted sexual instinct, to
place man's intelligence at the service of
organized vice, and to lower him to a level
below that of the beasts which, at least are
guided by their instinct. Marriage, moreover,
is degraded; it is no longer considered as the
union of two bodies, of two hearts and of
two souls.
And when I see editors and printers thriving on such a display of vice, I wonder if
they are not paid by the devil's own henchmen, who are bent on destroying Western
democracy. There is no escaping it, tomorrow we will have anarchy, and confusion.
The unbridled pursuit of pleasure can not
serve as the foundation for an institution
such as the family, the basic cell of society,
where any normal social life is born.
Let not marriage be debased, for it associates man to God's creative work and, for
that reason, it is a worthy and sacred
institution.
Mr. Leader, why could not this inquiry
bear on both these narcotics? For both these
drugs are about to pervert and destroy our
young people.
(Text):

Honourable senators, I should like to say
a few words now about national unity, which
is becoming more and more desirable for the
welfare and the greatness of our country.
Above all, I wish for this unity, and I hope
that everyone in this chamber wishes for it
too and acts accordingly, but I regret to say
that some people in either places act to the
contrary.
Nobody in Quebec requires that Englishspeaking Canadians should speak French.
However, the fact is that some of them learn
French. Good! I am pleased to say that in
the province of Quebec a good many of the
people speak both French and English. This
bilingualism enables the French-speaking and
English-speaking citizens to have a better
understanding of one another. Is it possible
to bring about such an understanding by
telling the people of the minority group in
Canada that they have no rights? I would
point out that the minority group has been
in this country for over 350 years, and during
150 of those years it had the hardest kinds of
work to do as pioneers. Both majority and
minority groups have rights, but at this time
I wish to point out some facts about the
minority.
Honourable senators must recall that on
two or three occasions the people belonging
to the minority group in this country saved
Canada for the British Empire; because had
it not been for their courage and loyalty
Canada would not now be a part of the
Commonwealth.

Insults and other such acts will not obtain
the national unity so much desired. Majority
and minority in Canada may speak two different languages; but both love their country
and live together harmoniously and peacefully. An orchestra is formed of many instruments, and they produce harmony only in
so far as each performer plays the right
notes.
Jules Méline, a French statesman who, as
honourable senators know, was Minister of
Agriculture in France at the end of the last
century and during World War 1, gave a
striking and clear definition of the fundamental role played by agriculture in the national
economy, and of the interdependence which
exists between the major sectors of economic
activity: agriculture, manufacturing industry,
commerce and finance. He compared national
prosperity to a tree whose roots are agriculture, and whose stem and branches are industry and commerce. If the roots suffer and are
not treated properly, poor circulation of the
sap develops in all parts of the tree, it is
slowed down, the leaves fall, the branches
dry up, the tree loses its value and becomes
sterile or useless. The prosperity of agriculture is essential to the prosperity of the
national economy.
Our agriculture is undoubtedly the most
important basic industry of Canada, notwithstanding the prodigious industrial expansion
of our country during the last fifteen years.
Although we do not yet have the official and
complete figures for 1954, we can assert,
without any risk of error, that the financial
income of Canadian farmers has considerably decreased since 1951, when it reached
its peak in the history of the country: $2,812
million. In 1953 it was down to $2,731,200,000.
The figures for the last three months of 1954
have not yet been made public; those for the
first nine months of 1954 are considerably
lower than the corresponding ones for 1953.
The federal Bureau of Statistics has temporarily estimated the financial income of Canadian farmers
for the year
1954 at
$2,408,600,000, which is a decrease of 12 per
cent from 1953, in which year the income was
already 15 per cent lower than in 1952.
It is plain that the position of Canadian
agriculture has worsened during these last
years. The index of prices paid farmers for
their produce has constantly decreased since
1952. From 274-5 in 1952, it went down to
247-6 in 1953; in September 1953, it was
227-3, and it has continued to decrease ever
since. Although we do not yet know the complete figures for 1954, in September of that
year it was set at 227-3.
A first fact which nobody will deny: the
income of our Canadian farmers was lower

FEBRUARY 9, 1955
in 1954 than in 1953; and lower in 1953 than
in 1952. This is true also of the United States,
where the net income of farmers bas constantly decreased since 1951, and in the proportion of 14 per cent from 1951 to 1954.
A second fact which is equally true: the
prosperity of agriculture is necessary and
essential to the prosperity of industry and
commerce as well as to the general economic
prosperity of the country. The more prosperous that agriculture is, the greater are the
possibilities that all branches of the national
economic life will also know an era of
increasing prosperity, or at least of economic
and social stability.
Agricultural income must remain at the
same level, and even increase, if we wish to
maintain and increase the general economic
prosperity and social welfare. A reduction of
agricultural income soon brings about a
decrease in industrial purchases, and also
a decrease in production; unemployment
results therefrom, and if it spreads it may
cause an economic slump with its ensuing
social problems. In the present world situation -we cannot afford a serious economic
depression. Necessary measures must be taken
to maintain Canadian agriculture at its
highest level of prosperity, which is the basis
and the essential condition of a healthy and
progressive national economy.
In pleading for agriculture, my purpose is
to defend the interests of the whole nation.
Social classes, as well as the various sectors
of economic life, are interdependent; therefore, they must co-operate to bring about
the common prosperity of the country. The
Canadian government proved on several occasions, through its legislation, that it clearly
understands the economic and social solidarity existing between the agricultural and
industrial domains, particularly when it enacted the Agricultural Prices Support Act,
which bas rendered invaluable services to
the whole of the Canadian nation, although
it has cost very little so far: fron 1946 to
March'1954, a little higher than $80 million.
Nevertheless, some people claim it is a
sound policy that agricultural products should
be sold at a lower price and be allowed to
stabilize at a lower level. To support their
thesis, they say that Canadian farmers are
already well paid, that they enjoy their fair
share of the national income, and that stabilization of the prices of agricultural products
at a lower level than that of 1951-when
the prices were at their peak-would result
in reducing to a certain extent the general
cost of living in this country. To those individuals, I may reply that I think such assertions are not confirmed, but refuted by the
facts. If we restrict our figures to statistics
covering the last thirty years, we find that

the agricultural population-which, according
to the national census, formed 28 per cent
of the Canadian population in 1921, 22-5
per cent in 1931, and 20 -2 per cent in 1951received during that period of time an average of only 10 per cent of the national income. According to national accounts in
Canada, the income and expenditure figures
for 1926-1950 and 1950-1953 establish that
in 1953 the net income per person living on
Canadian farms amounted to $565, whereas
in the sarne year the net income per person
not living on farms amounted to $1,382. This
comparative survey, covering a period of
approximately twenty-five years previous to
1953, established the fact that in 1933 the
net income of persons living on farms was
as low as $32 per person. There is nothing
amazing about that, for we were then at the
lowest point in the economic depression.
When the farmer cannot sell his produce, or
sells it at a ridiculously low price, he can
no longer buy anything, and consequently
there is a slump in trade and industry; it
means chronic unemployment, and an econonic and social crisis, such as we experienced
in the years 1930-38.
A comparison of the net incomes of Canadians living on farms and of those not living
on farms during the years 1928-1953, shows
that the net income of those living on farms
amounts generally to half the income of
persons not living on farrns, and that during
a period of economic depression farm income
soon drops to a low level. It also shows that
during the depression of the early 1930's the
net income of persons not living on farns also
decreased, but more slowly, and that in 1933,
in the darkest days of the depression, it was
still twelve times more than the net rural
income in Canada. As a matter of fact, in
1933 the average net income of persons not
living on farms amounted to $407-the lowest
level reached by this class during the depression-whereas the net income per person
living on farms went down to $32.
Farmers, therefore, must be very careful
whenever they make any purchases for their
farms; as far as possible they should avoid
buying on the instalment plan; and before
making any large loans for the purchase of
agricultural equipment such as high-priced
tractors, they must seriously consider the
matter, for they might have to repay the
loans with devaluated money. If the income
of non-farmers decreases very slightly or
not at all, while the net income of farmers
goes down to a great extent, this means that
industrial salaries remain at a constant level,
that the cost of industrial production remains
almost as high as before, and that consequently the cost of the goods which farmers
must purchase out of a much lower income

SENATE
will also remain at a high level or will not
go down to any appreciable extent.
Furthermore, we know that this reasoning
is based on facts. Data obtained in a study
made in the United States, by economist
Gardiner C. Means, points to the unfavourable position of agriculture during a period
of economic regression. For ten groups of
products whose price variations he computed
against the decrease in production for the
years 1929-32, and a decrease of 6 per cent
in agricultural production, the prices of agricultural produce went down 63 per cent;
while the cost of agricultural implements
suffered a decrease of only 6 per cent against
a production decrease of 80 per cent. In
other words, during an economic regression
agricultural prices go down considerably and
at a quick tempo; whereas, on the other hand,
prices of industrial products show a relatively
slight and slow rate of decrease, and then
farmers must pay for their purchases with
devaluated money.
Canadian farmers, I repeat, should be
cautious about investing money on their
farms, and should as far as possible avoid
purchasing goods on the instalment plan or
borrowing money for purposes of mechanization of agricultural equipment. The many
who have incurred debts would be well
advised to reduce them as soon as possible
if they do not wish to be compelled, in the
event of an increasing agricultural economic
regression, to pay their debts with devaluated
money or to abandon to their creditors pieces
of equipment on which they have already
paid considerable sums of money. In the
past few years requests for new loans have
become more numerous and urgent despite
the fact that it is evident that agriculture is
not as prosperous as formerly. Instead of
trying to borrow in the face of such economic
contingencies, would it not be more advisable
to avoid new loans and endeavour to pay
our debts?
As to the influence of agricultural prices on
the cost of living, it is unfair to claim that
what the Canadian farmers now get for their
produce helps to maintain the cost of living
at an excessively high level. On this point,
a distinction must be established between the
price the consumer pays for agricultural
products and the portion of the consumer's
price actually received by the farmer. To
show how false the claim is, let us look at
some figures which show the proportion of
the consumer's dollar that the farmer really
gets for his products. The August 1954 number of the Agricultural Economist contained
a compilation covering twelve agricultural
products, for the years 1949 to 1953, inclusive.
In 1953, out of each dollar spent by the consumer the producers of natural milk received

53 cents; potato growers, 41 cents; raisers of
first-grade cattle, 58 cents; butter producers,
77 cents; and so on.

From those figures honourable senators will
realize the margin between the prices paid
by the consumers and those paid to the
farmers. Yet in 1953, the income from the
sale of agricultural products, $413 million,
and from the sale of cattle, $775 million,
amounted to approximately half the total
agricultural income, $2,731 million.
Before passing judgment on the influence of
agricultural prices upon the high cost of living, is it not therefore very important to
consider the spread between the prices paid
to producers and the prices exacted from consumers?
Honourable senators, I have explained to
you, the economic problem of the nation, as
I understand it, particularly the agricultural
economic problem, in order to prove to you
that we can never do too much for the agricultural class, because the basis of our
national prosperity rests upon that class.
Some economists-like Malthus, in the
nineteenth century, and others who are members of UNESCO- have wondered whether
in the year 2000 we shall produce enough to
feed the human race. If things continue going
as they are at present we certainly shall not
produce sufficiently, not because of an excessive increase in population, but because not
enough people will be engaged in production.
The land will be deserted; and then we shall
be better able to understand the great truth
which René Bazin has expounded in his excellent novel intituled La Terre Qui Meurt"The Dying Land". If the land dies the
people will die, and the nation will die, because of a lack of food, for a hungry people
is ripe for revolution. But, on the other hand,
if the farming class is stable, the nation and
the world will be stable.
With our present means of production
there is no danger of the human race lacking
sufficient food. We can increase a hundred
fold our agricultural production, but in order
to do so, we must have workers. Therefore,
let us organize the life of our farmers in such
a way that they will be happy to live on
their land, and that their sons also will be
happy to remain on the land; let us act in
such a way that another book may be written,
but this time a book of life, which could be
intituled Le Blé Qui Leve Sur La Terre Qui
Vit-"The Rising Wheat On The Living
Land".
Hon. Sena±ors: Hear, hear.
Hon. George H. Barbour: Honourable
senators, first of all I want to join those who
have already spoken in this debate in congratulating the mover (Hon. Mrs. Hodges)

FEBRUARY 9, 1955
and the seconder (Hon. Mr. Tremblay) of
the Address, not only upon the fine material
of their speeches but also upon the splendid
manner in which they were delivered.
The Speech from the Throne announced
that there would be a meeting of the Prime
Ministers of the Commonwealth in London
in the month of January. I am sure I speak
for all honourable senators when I say how
proud we are to have had men of the stature
of our Prime Minister and our Secretary of
State for External Affairs to represent us in
London at this conference.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: We are, I am sure, in
agreement with the sentiment expressed by
the London Evening News that few who have
been presented in recent years with the Freedom of the City of London have merited the
honour more than Mr. St. Laurent.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: We are glad, I am sure,
to welcome him back to Canada today.
In the Speech from the Throne it is stated
that the construction of a new ferry to
operate between Prince Edward Island and
Nova Scotia would be undertaken early in
the present year. This is indeed welcome
news for the people of Prince Edward Island,
even though it is long overdue. From the
time of Confederation transportation has
been one of our troubles, and it still is our
No. 1 problem. We have at the present time
operating between Borden and Cape Tormentine one of the finest icebreaker-ferries
in the world. It is a large boat, designed to
carry passengers, automobiles and railway
freight cars. During the summer months this
large ferry has to make the crossing day and
night in order to avoid traffic congestion, and
even then long lines of automobiles are often
waiting for their turn to go across. I think
it would be the part of wisdom for the Department of Transport to provide a ferry
designed to transport passenger automobiles
and trucks only, a boat that could be built
for not more than one-third as much as the
icebreaker cost, and which could be operated,
I am sure, at one-third its cost. Such a boat
would carry as many motor cars as the larger
ferry does, and as a result we would get many
more years of service out of the larger ferry.
For quite a number of years the Canadian
National Railways and the Department of
Transport kept the rate for trucks on the
ferry so high that it was really prohibitive.
I suppose their idea was to get as much business as possible for the railway. In 1939
another ferry commenced operating between
Wood Island, P.E.I., and Caribou, N.S. That
ferry carried trucks more cheaply, so we

were able to get a reduction in the rate on
the car ferry, and this has been very important
to our farmers and fishermen. All the fresh
fish is now moved in trucks.
Before Confederation there was no railroad
on the island, and I believe that construction
of a railway was one of the deciding factors
in bringing Prince Edward Island into Confederation. The railroad is still there, of
course, but it has now lost the largest part of
its passenger business. After dieselizing the
island section of the railway first, the Canadian National are planning now to take off
all the passenger trains except one between
Charlottetown and Borden, at which point
connection is made for the mainland. That is
the way things have gone, and it is not much
wonder, because the trains are so much slower
than automobiles On the island there are no
two points that I know of between which you
cannot go and return in a car in the time that
it takes the train to go one way.
I have noted lately that the running time
of trains between'Montreal and Vancouver
is to be cut by eleven hours one way, and by
fourteen, I think, the other way. I will tell
honourable senators the time it takes to travel
between Charlottetown and Moncton by the
Canadian National. We leave Charlottetown
at 7 a.m., and leave Moncton for Montreal at
2.10 p.m. The elapsed time amounts to seven
hours and ten minutes. Then on the return
trip we arrive at Moncton at 9.50 a.m. and at
Charlottetown at 6.10 p.m., an elapsed time
of about eight hours. The trip by automobile
from Moncton to Charlottetown is roughly
100 miles, and the drive can be made easily
in two and a half hours, plus one hour on
the ferry.
It is not greatly to be wondered at that
so much passenger traffic has gone to the
Maritime Central Airways that the railroad
has been left with very few passengers.
A good deal has been said by representatives of labour about the existence of hard
times and unemployment. In a cold country
like Canada, with a very heavy snow-fall, it
is difficult to have everybody working continuously. But I do not think it can be said
that conditions are so bad when, according to
returns, at the end of 1954 deposits in our
banks reached a total of $5,218 million, an
increase of $462 million on the previous year.
This is not a bad achievement for a country
of 15 million people.
One disturbing feature of our national life
is the prevalence of automobile accidents.
In 1951, the last year for which I have been
able to get the record, this type of accident
caused 2,686 deaths, injuries to 41,691 people,
and total damages of $162,157,978. I think the
Senate would render a service to Canada if

SENATE
it set up a committee to try to determine the
causes of so many casualties. I believe-for
one thing-that big trucks which when
loaded weigh around 20,000 pounds should
not be permitted to run on two-way highways
at speeds of fifty miles and more. On a railroad track that speed is high enough; yet
in many places large transport trucks move
along the highways at fifty to fifty-five miles
an hour, and when they get on a grade, are
dangerous to passenger cars which try to
pass them.
In some respects-two, particularlyPrince Edward Island has changed very
little since Confederation. The rural population still constitutes about three-fourths of
the whole population. Many of our young
people leave the island for other parts of
Canada and the United States. There are
41,151 people in the age group between one
year and 19 years, but only 31,515 between
the ages of 35 and 69; so,,assuming that onahalf of the latter are females, the working
population in that age group is only 15,756.
The remarks made yesterday by the honourable senator from Fredericton (Hon. Mrs.
Fergusson) as to the need of providing work
for citizens over 65 years old hardly apply
to Prince Edward Island, where most elderly
people live on the farms and work as long
as they can. In the St. Peter's district is a
medical man who is 96 or 97 years old,Hon. Mr. McIntyre: He is 98.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: -and last year he was
attending to his practice and driving his own
car.
In looking over some official reports I
noticed that last year the Prince Edward
Island Government provided for public
relief and welfare nearly $2 million, as
against similar expenditures of not more
than $35,000 only a few years ago. With this
provision, plus family allowances, old age
security payments, widows' pensions, and the
rest, I think it can be said that our people
are being fairly well taken care of.
But for the fact that I was served with
a summons, I would not have occupied any
of the time of this house. However, not only
has this summons been served on me, but I
was warned that very likely other senators
would get similar treatment. I know that
most members of this honourable body were
never served with a summons in their lives,
so they may be relieved to know that they
will not be compelled to answer within eight

days, but will have a little longer to attend
to it. My copy reads as follows:

you have this day been charged and
Whereas,
information laid in Charlottetown aforesaid before
the undersigned, on behalf of the Charlottetown
Centennial Committee, for that you the said
G. H. Barbour have not visited the said City of
Charlottetown, in the County of Queen's, Province

These are therefore to command you, in the
name of the Charlottetown Centennial Committee,

months of June, July, August or September, 1955,
or before such old friends as shall then be there,
to answer to the said charge, and be further dealt
with according to law. Herein fail not.
Given under my hand and seal, this lst day of
September A.D. one thousand nine hundred and
fifty-four at the City of Charlottetown aforesaid.
J. David Stewart
Mayor
On behalf of the Charlottetown
Centennial Committee.

Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: Perhaps honourable
senators will receive a copy of this summons
through the mail. There will be street dancing
and other gay festivities to mark the Charlottetown Centennial. At this time I would
personally extend a very warm welcome to
honourable senators to come along and participate in the celebrations. And may I add
that all who come to Charlottetown should
be sure to visit the Confederation Chamber
there. Among other places, I would recomment a visit to the excellent beach at Cavendish, and the nearby house "Green Gables,"
which was once the home of the famous
author Lucy Montgomery.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Stanley S. McKeen: Honourable senators, in rising to take part in this debate I
should like to deal with a subject referred
to by the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) when he spoke on this
motion. He said that we were not getting
the best possible service from the United
Nations, and he proceeded to make a suggestion to the Government, through the Leader
of the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald).
I had thought that the procedure at the
United Nations was better known, but just
in case it is not I wish to take a little time
this afternoon to explain that what is going

FEBRUARY 9, 1955
on there now is the same as when the
honourable Leader of the Opposition was a
delegate.
As honourable members are no doubt
aware, the Senate of Canada has been represented at the United Nations by quite a few
senators, including His Honour the Speaker
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) and a highly-esteemed
former Speaker (Hon. Mr. King). We have
also been represented by the honourable
Senators Lambert, Turgeon, Wilson, Hugessen, Isnor, Haig, Howard, and myself.
One of my most stimulating experiences
at the last United Nations Assembly was
seeing delegate after delegate stand up in
the Economic Committee room and express
gratitude to the United Nations for its technical assistance to their under-developed
countries. This technical aid, they declared,
demonstrated to their peoples that the United
Nations did more than debate, pass resolutions and make reports. It was, they said, a
live and forceful implement for helping them
to answer their needs and realize their
aspirations.
It is the disagreements of United Nations
delegations which make the headlines. But
equally significant, to my mind, is the fact
of virtually complete agreement among those
same delegates on the value of technical
assistance. I am sure that the honourable
senator from Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard)
can report that this was the fact during the
last session of the United Nations.
Here is one procedure followed by the
Canadian party at the United Nations. At
9 o'clock each morning all the Canadian
delegates, observers and alternates, whether
they be members of the Government or the
Opposition in the House of Commons or the
Senate, meet in a conference room. Each
delegate makes a report as to what happened
in the committee he was serving on the day
before, and all the members discuss what
attitude should be taken. Canada's Department of External Affairs is represented at
the United Nations by a permanent staff,
which is in constant communication with
Ottawa, conveying the different viewpoints
back and forth. When I was there these
discussions took place every morning before
the sessions started, and it did not matter
whether you were a Government or Opposition supporter, you had just as much to say
as anybody else in these discussions. The
honourable senator from Wellington has told
me that this procedure was followed last
year, just as it was when the Leader of the
Opposition was one of our representatives.
Honourable senators, I have spoken about
the differences of opinion that arise at United
Nations meetings. It must be remembered that
50437-11

not sixty but eighty countries are represented
on the Committee on Technical Assistance.
In other words, there are twenty countries
that are not members of the United Nations
as such but are participants in the technical
assistance program of the United Nations.
That was the case last year, but I am not
sure whether the number has been increased
this year. Perhaps my honourable friend from
Wellington could supply me with that information.
Hon. Mr. Howard: The number has been
increased by five.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: These eighty-five countries are all contributing something to the program in either a financial or technical way.
It is the purpose of the committee to raise the
standard of living all over the world. In order
to keep Canada's standard of living at a high
level we must have export markets for our
goods, and one of the best long-term ways to
protect our present status is to help raise the
standard of living in other countries. Just
the other day I read a press item about the
amount of paper that is produced and used in
Canada, and the report referred to the amount
of paper that could be used in China if the
people of that country used paper cups as we
do in Canada. Just this one small item
would possibly treble the demand for the
world's supply of paper.
This technical assistance program is popular
with every country in the world, because it
represents action speaking louder than words
and because the impact of that action is felt
at community levels, where we have to get in
order to keep our way of life, as opposed to
the communistic system.
The under-developed countries of the world
want more of this aid. To the advanced
Western countries, such as Canada, they say
in effect: "You speak much of the need to raise
the world's standard of living, to increase
democratic freedoms and achieve political
stability. Well, this is one way you can help
us to do it-by technical assistance."
Sometimes we are tempted to resist increased support for this great United Nations
program, by recalling the size of our military
defence costs. But the sums involved are very
small by comparison. In fact, Canada's contribution last year amounted to less than the
cost of one modern bomber. There was no
increase made in our contribution this year.
Last year the United States' contribution was
kept at about $13 million, but this year I do
not know whether it will be up or down or
remain the same. The budget is operated
about half a year behind time. Therefore the
technical assistance program for this year has
not been finally approved yet, but it looks

SENATE
as though their requirements will amount to
some $25 million to $27 million. That seems
to be a very small amount to contribute towards raising the standard of living all over
the world.
Under this program the countries themselves supply part of the financial aid, and
quite a bit of the resources. Last year, owing
to lack of UN funds for technical aid, the
under-developed countries received only onefourth of the help they would have been prepared to use. This means, in effect, that the
United Nations is condemning many of its
less fortunate members from using their own
resources to the fullest extent. Each outlay
on expert advice and service by the United
Nations Technical Assistance Administration
and related UN agencies is matched, often
many times over, by local capital or other
investment in a particular project. Consequently, lack of aid or diminution of it slows
down investment by countries in their own
improvement.
For the information of honourable senators, may I say that the Secretary-General of
the Technical Assistance Program is a Canadian, Hugh Keenleyside, who at one time
was with the Department of External Affairs,
and prior to his present appointment was
Canadian Ambassador to Mexico.
The Technical Assistance Program, under
the aegis of the UN, is a collective and cooperative effort in sharing skills for mutual
gain. It carries no partisan overtones such
as sometimes jar national pride. It is a program which speeds a country's own efforts
to make significant advances in behalf of its
own people. This is why so many nations
measure the intentions of industrially advanced nations with the technical-assistance
ruler. We must understand this fact to appreciate the importance of the UN program to
our own country's welfare.
It is the view of Secretary-General Dag
Hammarskjold that UN economic and social
work around the world has more significant
reality than the political resolutions of the
General Assembly. Certainly, there can be
no argument that evolution is preferable to
revolution. And technical aid provides the
base for evolution towards democratic
objectives.
Let us examine the program in operation,
and see how this is so.
There are today nearly 1,800 men and
women working, under UN auspices, in some
fourscore countries and territories. One-third
of them are specialists on training missions
under UN fellowship grants. Two-thirds are
experts sent on missions by the UN Technical
Assistance Administration or one of the specialized agencies, such as the Food and
Agriculture Organization or the World

Health Organization. Between 60 and 70
nationalities are represented in this corps,
which right now includes about 50 Canadians. Their activities touch the basic concerns of the people they aid and consequently
affect the outlook of those people and the
society in which they live.
Housing, industry, food, social welfare,
health, education, transportation, productivity-these are the central concerns of the
peoples of the world and of the UN program.
A UN expert recently recorded the sad
fact that Neolithic bouses, discovered at the
bottom of a Swiss lake, were more comfortable and efficient in their day than most
20th century housing in Asia. He expressed
the view that the political future of Asia
may very well turn on what is done about
housing and food. Whether or not his view
is correct, it is an observable fact that most
governments of the region are using every
UN facility to give a sound basis to their
housing efforts and to speed them up. As in
many other phases of development, the main
effort is to organize in such a way as to use
the main asset of the region-under-employed labour.
It is staggering to the Western mind how
much partially-used manpower there is in
the East. Our industrial societies shudder
when unemployment approaches 5 per cent,
but studies of Asia suggest that most countries in that area could give up one-half to
two-thirds of their rural population without
cutting crop yields. Technical assistance
experts are aiding governments to utilize
that labour in a way that is similar to the
Nova Scotian system, which allows ownerbuilders of bouses to count their labour as
capital investment. A similar system is in
operation in Hull, and it is also followed by
the Newfoundland co-operatives.
The rest of the problem is organizing and
financing a flow of such materials as are not
at hand, and providing such skilled direction as may be necessary to supervise and
assist community house-building.
In this connection, it might be worth
noting that UN experts have pointed to a
considerable business opportunity for the
developer of a chemical antiseptic that would
serve as a binder for thatching. More people
in the world live under thatch than any
other kind of roof. Most thatched roofs have
to be replaced every four years, because of
infestation and deterioration.
I would recommend that manufacturers of
shingles and other building materials help to
raise Eastern living standards. Then they
would find a good market in Asia for British
Columbia shingles.
Hon. Mr. Howard: And galvanized iron!

FEBRUARY 9, 1955
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Yes, and galvanized iron.
In relation to food, UN technical assistance
covers a wide scope. It includes protection
of plants and animals against disease, discovery of water resources, fish farming for
proteins, crop selection, river control and
use, population movement into lands newly
freed from malaria, use and care of heavy
machinery imported to uproot growth too
heavy for local methods, and battling the
recurrent locust plague. Victory for the locusts
has meant famine in the past. But co-ordinated international attacks against the locusts
in the past two years have done much to
reduce crop damage. The present level of
control efforts, however, has not been sufficient to stop the spread of the plague into
thirty countries and territories. There are
still uncontrolled breeding areas, and swarms
sometimes escape even from areas that are
thought to be under control. Air-to-air combat has been introduced, and in an experiment last fall, planes sprayed a new chemical
on a swarm of locusts that covered thirty
square miles and was so dense it could be
seen sixty miles away. The swarm was
wiped out. This feat led several countries
involved to train pilots for their own services,
with the result that this year the locusts
should get real air battle.
I tell this story because it involves a vast
area and because the locust control measures
are a distinct by-product of the Technical
Assistance Program. By utilizing facilities,
the menace can be attacked by joint efforts
rather than piecemeal. Equipment, specialists,
and locust poison are moved across national
boundaries. Previously, a country would try
to control the locusts single-handed, but it
was found that the pests were breeding in
other countries as well. A much better job
is now being done by international control.
The strategic points across which these movements are made are identified by the Food
and Agriculture Organization. All countries
benefit, since the size of the attack on the
home country is reduced.
The Food and Agriculture Organization
staffs a similar regional locust control centre
in Central America. It reports that $100,000
spent regionally now achieves better results
than $1 million used to when the countries
confined themselves to national efforts.
Increasing of food supplies depends, in
many cases, on changing the entire living
pattern of the growers. In some such cases,
all the UN agencies work together under a
program described as "fundamental education". Under this rather formidable label
50437-111

experts pool and co-ordinate community efforts to get across ideas on sanitation,
water supply, control of pests, new crops,
new handicrafts and local industries, co-operative marketing, literacy, etc.
Such a project is under way in an area of
Ceylon. In passing, I must say that in Ceylon
we have both the UN Technical Assistance
program and the Colombo program, which
is the Commonwealth plan, working together.
Eight hundred years ago an invading army
destroyed the area's intricate irrigation system of 5,000 lakes and canals. Jungles moved
in to replace a once-lush rice granary. The
cultural level sank.
Ceylon began, twenty years ago, an effort
to recapture the area. When the UN Techrincal Assistance program came into being,
she called for international help. A fundamental education centre was set up and
its influence started fingering out into many
fields.
Today, in that area men who never saw a
book before are reading crop manuals which
the Centre prepared and taught them to read.
Boys are excitedly demonstrating to their
fathers the value of controlling snails in their
rice paddies and using new, improved seed
strains. Many of the boys have been allotted
small demonstration plots, given them by
their fathers under a Junior Paddy Club plan
organized by one of the technical assistance
experts. Mobile libraries and film strips teach
women more healthful methods of food
preparation and how to protect their families
against intestinal and other diseases. Soap
is now being used because technical assistance experts devised a way to make it with
local supplies.
I should like to note, incidentally, that
these UN experts frequently find themselves
in rather trying situations. Two of those
in Ceylon were reported in the Ceylon
Daily News as having been chased by a herd
of wild elephants while making their rounds
with one of the mobile libraries. They
jumped into their jeep and managed to outdistance the elephants only to have their
road blocked by wild buffaloes which forced
them into a ditch. Fortunately, they escaped
with minor injuries, but undoubtedly they
were badly scared.
Increased productivity, another major concern of underdeveloped countries, is ap-.
proached from many technical assistance
angles. One is health. Indonesia gained 2j
billion man-hours of labour by having one
million of her people cured of yaws, a crip-'
pling skin disease. Malaria control measures
in Greece added 30 million man-houfs of
labour to that country's farms.

SENATE
In the industrial field, the introduction of
new techniques pays off. Some Israeli factories, with UN technical aid, have doubled
their output without the addition of a man
or machine. As the result of a brief visit by
a UN specialist, production in every steel
rolling mill in Pakistan has increased by 40
per cent.
Some of these examples may seem peripheral to the main problems of underdeveloped economies. But we must remember that economies are made up of people
and shaped by people. Since most of the
world's people live in small villages, they
are for the most part influenced by those
things which touch them at the community
level.
Furthermore, the UN is also engaged in
major and fundamental aid projects. For
example, the Technical Assistance Administration is providing the international staff for
a regional training center in railroad traffic
control, now operating at Lahore, Pakistan.
This training program grew out of a tour
of rail operations in Europe and the United
States made by regional rail specialists under
Technical Assistance fellowships. Now a
number of governments have contributed
life-size switches, electronic-control systems
and the like to the Centre. Increasing the
productivity of present trackage and rolling
stock is cheaper and faster than doubletracking Asiatic rail lines, 90 per cent of
which are single-tracked. A comparable process is under way in mechanizing Asiatic
inland water transport.
A basic need for economic progress in
Bolivia is government stability, that country
having averaged one revolution every two
years for more than a century. Here we see
a remarkable UN test-tube in the field of
development. In addition to receiving the
usual technical experts, the Bolivian government, at the suggestion of the UN Technical
Assistance Administration, has employed nonBolivian experts in government posts to
strengthen the services on which economic
life depends. These men exercise authority
in that government, subject of course to
cabinet control. Bolivia is enabled to pay
them through a UN grant which covers part
of their salaries.
On the basis of advice from this international team, the Government has undertaken land and monetary reforms that required considerable political courage. The
Government's tenure has already exceeded
the average of two years-I think it is now

four years. This experiment is expected to
prove an important guide in aiding other
underdeveloped countries with similar needs.
The co-ordinated efforts of technical assistance within a country can be the key to unlocking a nation's potential when its people
are already tackling their own problems. For
example, let me sketch a profile of U.N.
aid in Indonesia.
On February 1, 1954, the Technical Assistance Administration had in that country
twenty-four experts, of ten different nationalities. Two were Canadians, working in the
fields of migration and demography. Other
basic fields being serviced were public administration, budgetary control, industrial
development, agricultural resources, natural
resources generally, national income, housing
and labour relations.
In addition, there were experts working in
small industries, glass manufacture, ceramics,
cottôn textiles, leather processing, building
materials and starch processing. The corps
also included a mechanical engineer, a chemical engineer, and a motor-vehicle maintenance man.
Sixteen men from the International Civil
Aviation Organization were helping Indonesia
to integrate ber 3,000 islands by air communication and transport. The World Health
Organization had fourteen specialists working on yaws, malaria, insect control, a nutrition institute, sanitation, maternal and child
health, and a tuberculosis centre. In the
educational field, five UNESCO experts were
helping with the organization of primary,
secondary and general educational services.
The International Labour Organization was
doing a related job in vocational training,
occupational health and labour statistics. And
from the Food and Agriculture Organization
had come specialists in crop production, agricultural economy, forestry, and land and
water use.
Altogether there were more than three-score
U.N. experts on the spot. In addition a dozen
Indonesians were studying abroad as U.N.
fellows, another twenty-one had completed
such training opportunities and more were
scheduled to start on them.
Indonesia, like most countries making sizeable use of U.N. facilities, has a resident
representative of the Technical Assistance
Board whose job it is to co-ordinate the
inter-agency program and U.N. relationships
with the Colombo Plan, Point Four and other
national programs. This eliminates duplication of effort and stretches each dollar to the
maximum.

FEBRUARY 9, 1955
The success of UN technical assistance is
attested by the tributes I mentioned earlier.
Indeed, it is the program's success that makes
the people who have profited from it want
more. And so should we, for we profit too
by helping to direct the pace and the nature
of change in the world. This is a direct move
towards peace throughout the whole world.
We cannot escape the fact that the world is
changing. This is due, in considerable measure, to the technological development we
in the West initiated. How this movement
evolves will be influenced greatly by the
extent to which the under-privileged nations
feel that we, the more fortunate ones, are
concerned about their needs. They are in
revolt against hunger, homelessness, ignorance
and injustice because they have learned from
us that these evils are not necessary.
This is why we appreciate the UN Technical Assistance Program. It is the reason
nearly one hundred countries and territories
have asked for aid on projects involving
more than 3,000 experts and an equal number
of training opportunities since the program
began.
The 1954 total of pledges to the UN Technical Assistance Program was, as I mentioned,
$24 million. This money is provided by the
eighty countries, Canada's share being $1·5
million. The countries receiving aid will, as
I have indicated earlier, more than meet this
amount in local expenditures in addition to
being also contributors to the fund themselves. An indication of the relationship may
be seen in Pakistan, which has had 245
experts in the past four years working on
projects on which Pakistan itself is spending
$800 million.
The wide demand for more UN Technical
Assistance reflects a growing concern for
human welfare as well as for economic
progress. Our Canadian appropriation should
reflect the same awareness of the humanitarian aspect of this enterprise. And it should
be made in fuller reflection of the gain to
Canada from association with countries increasingly able to buy our goods, to meet
our needs and march with us towards the
fulfilment of our common human aims.
The good that the United Nations is doing
in this connection is extensive. True, we
need peace in the world so as to have time
to carry this program to its conclusion. This
is possibly a hundred-year program at least,
and unless we lay the foundation well the
program will never be completed. I feel that
our Government, along with all other "have"
countries, should contribute to the greatest

possible extent, because, after all if we can
help to feed and clothe the under-developed
countries they are not going to worry about
communism.

(Translation):
I would like to congratulate also the honourable senator from Lauzon (Hon. Mr.

pleasure I derived from hearing his first
speech in this house. His knowledge of the
problems of government reflects his long and
useful experience in Parliament. His contribution to tlhe debates of the Senate is in
line with our best tradition. His admirable
mastery of both languages is for us all a
source of pleasure and inspiration.
(Text):
Honourable senators, in part the Speech
from the Throne stated:
While there is hopeful evidence that the increasing strength of the free world has lessened
the likelihood of aggression, the terrible destruc.tion that war would bring to North America and
indeed to all mankind has been magnified by
the increase in the number and effectiveness of
atomie and thermonuclear weapons and the means
of delivering them.
. . . while the resources of diplomacy must
never be neglected in the search for peace, the
efforts of the free nations in building their deterrent forces must be maintained.

To further this policy, the Government also
announced that it would continue to support
the United Nations, that it had accepted its
responsibility for the armistice commission
in connection with the settlement of the war
in Korea, that would continue to support
the Colombo Plan and that it would continue
to honour its obligations under the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
It may be useful at this juncture to review
some aspects of the defence policy of Canada
over the past ten years. It will be ten years
this summer since the war in Europe and
in Asia ended. The period has not been one
of global war comparable to the previous
six years. In those six years death, destruction and well-nigh dissolution were rained
upon combatants and civilians both in Asia
and in Europe, and at the end of the period
new atomic weapons struck terror into the
hearts of people everywhere. But if the past
ten years have not been a period of'global
war, they have not been a period of idyllic
50437-12

peace. The decade has been described as
an era of cold war. Certainly, it has been an
era of rather cold peace. There have been
isolated active hostilities like Korea, and
threats of more active hostilities in nearby
areas in the Far East. There have been pacts
between iron curtain countries and countries
on the fringe of the curtain which bode no
good to the peace of the world. There bas
been sporadic trouble in other places. Even
a casual look at the expenditures undertaken
by the Canadian Government for the present
fiscal year shows how far removed we are
from peace. This year the total Government
spending will be $4,390 million, and 43 per
cent of this figure, or $1,889 million, will be
for defence.
Just a few days ago we concluded a debate
in this chamber on the advisability of admitting the Republic of West Germany to membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. I think the debate which was conducted
here on that occasion was a memorable one.
The argument, that to negotiate successfully
with the Russians, the Western powers must
negotiate from strength, was, I think, irresistible in the form in which it was put by
most senators who participated in the debate.
After hearing the speeches made by the
senators from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
and from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), I
thought that to complete the record it might
be useful to have something said in this
debate which would set out what has been
done and what is being done in this country
to build up the strength from which negotiations must be conducted. I think for this
purpose it might be useful to look, first, at
the financial aspects of the armed truce
which has obtained over the ten-year period
now ending; second, to inquire as to what
these gigantic expenditures have produced;
and, third, to determine if the accomplishment promotes and has promoted the best
interests of Canada.
I may say that my remarks will contain
nothing new. They are based upon available
records, but the material, perhaps, will be
assembled in a manner somewhat different
from what is usual. One could find it in
speeches made in the House of Commons by
ministers of the several departments responsible for this program.
It may be useful to review the extent of
the defence expenditures since the end. of
the war in the background of the Canadian
economy as reflected in our gross national
product.
Just before the war our gross national
product was $51 billion. By 1950, five
years after the end of hostilities, it was $15j
billion. At the present time it is over $24
billion.

SENATE
In the year before the war, Government
spending on defence was $34 million. In
1944-45, which was the highest year of war
expenditures, it was $2,938 million. By 1950,
five years after the war, it had fallen to
about $385 million. This year it will be
$1,908 million.
Let me give the proportion of defence
expenditures in these years in terms of
gross national product. In 1938 the defence
expenditures were much less than one per
cent of the gross national product. In 1950,
five years after the war, it was 2-3 per cent;
and this year, ten years after the war ended,
the Government will spend on defence, nearly
8 per cent of the money represented by the
gross national product.
With the permission of the house I should
like to place on Hansard a table giving this
information which, I think, might make a
perusal of my remarks a little more easily
understood. Also with the permission of the
house I should like to place on Hansard
a further table showing Government expenditures for the services, defence research and
mutual aid for the eight fiscal periods beginning with 1946 and ending with 1954. The
total spent for defence in this period of
so-called peace is over $7 billion-

tables of this kind have ever been placed on
Hansard in the manner now proposed. It may
be that I am wrong in that view, but I do
not think so.
Hon. Mr. Farris: The honourable senator
can read the statement.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Of course he can read it,
if he wants to, and if he does so, it becomes
his own statement. To place it on the record
in the manner he bas suggested would make
this material look like an official pronouncement, and I do not think our practice ever
intended to allow that.
I dislike being the only one to object to
this procedure, honourable senators, but I
do not want to see an undesirable precedent
established. It is quite all right for the
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) to place a statement on the record,
since the government is responsible for such
a statement. There is considerable difference
of opinion as to the estimates, and we have
never in this house had a full opportunity to
discuss the finances of the government in
any one year since I have been here.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: All he bas asked is that
in order to save the time of the bouse he be
allowed to place the statements on Hansard
without reading them figure by figure.
While the honourable leader opposite is
careful, as he should be-and I give him
credit for that-in trying to prevent the
establishment of a bad precedent, I am concerned about the right of a member of this
bouse to place on Hansard a statement of his
own. He needs no authority higher than himself to do so, and we accept his figures because he gives them to us; he does so from
his seat in this house, with the responsibility
of a member of the house.
Hon. Mr. Howard: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Therefore, I think nothing should be done that would prevent him
from achieving his aim, namely, to include
as part of his speech a statement which he
does not read in detail, but which we may
read later at our leisure.
I think the honourable senator from Ottawa
West is within his rights, and that to sacrifice
those rights would not be in the interests of
any member of 'this house.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Mr. Speaker, in view of
the remarks just made by the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck), I object to these statements being
placed on the record.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Then the honourable
senator must read them word by word.
Some Hon. Senators: Read them.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not propose to go that
far, but the senator from Toronto-Trinity
challenged my opinion.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Honourable senators,
may I say that in the figures I have supplied
so far, I have given information for certain
years only, and I thought it might be of
convenience to honourable senators if the
figures for some other years were also available on the record.
In proposing, as I did, to place this information on Hansard, with the consent of the
house, I did not think I was creating an undesirable precedent. I may say that these
figures were taken in p.art from the report
of the Department of National Defence for
the year ending March 31, 1953, and they
can be supported from reliable sources. However, as I believe my speech is clear enough
without the addition of this information, I
will withdraw my request. May I continue?

may I make just one observation, and perhaps
the honourable Leader of the Opposition will
reconsider his stand?
I realize that the honourable senator from
Ottawa West must have the unanimous consent of the house to place the tables on
Hansard. However, if he makes it clear that
they contain figures which he has gathered
and that they appear in an official statement
issued from a department of the Government,
I wonder whether the honourable leader
opposite might in this instance consent to
their going in. I think the statements contain
considerable information which might be useful to the house. It is information which the
honourable senator has gathered, and to avoid
his taking up the time of the house in reading
all these items we should, I feel, unanimously
consent to the placing of it -on the record so
that we can review it. We may or may not
accept it as correct, but I think we would all
like to see it. I agree to some extent with the
honourable Leader of the Opposition, but
when an honourable senator says he has prepared tables which he would like to appear in
Hansard, I think we should consent.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I thank
the honourable Leader. He bas made a
gentlemanly and very fair appeal, and I cannot refuse to accede.
In order that there may be no misunderstanding, perhaps I should tell the house what
started me on this line of thought. I do not
like to see so many senators reading speeches.
Some of them may say to me: "That is al
right for you, Mr. Haig, because you can
make a speech without reading it-in fact
you are a better speaker than you are a
reader". That is what my honourable friend
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) tells me
all the time; he says, "You are a good speaker
but a very poor reader, and it is no wonder
you do not read your speeches". I do not
think that anybody who reads a speech speaks
from the heart in the same way as be would
if he were speaking directly. I believe that
most people in this country feel we ought to
make our speeches from the heart and not
read them off a piece of paper. Anybody can
get a ghost writer to prepare his speeches for
him, but of course I do not suggest that was
done in this case. I know the honourable
senator from Ottawa West (Hon. Mr. Connolly), and I know that he writes his own
speeches. But I do not like the practice of
reading speeches at all, and it is getting worse
in this house.

SENATE
Honourable senators, as the honourable
Leader of the Government has suggested, I
will withdraw my opposition as long as the
honourable senator from Ottawa West makes
it clear that the figures hie intends to submit
have been prepared by himself.
Hon. Mr. Cannolly: Honourable senators, I
have already made it clear that these are
figures I have gathered from officiai sources,
but they are figures on which. I have built the

argument which. I propose to make today. If
honourable senators will consent, I will only
be too pleased to put these tables on the
record.
The Hon. the Speaker: Has the honourable
senator the unanimous consent of the House
to do so?
Hon. Senalors: Agreed.
The tables referred to are as follows:

FEBRUARY 10, 1955
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Honourable senators,
it may be curious to observe that in this fiscal
year 1954-55 more money will be spent on
defence than was spent in the fiscal year
1945, which was a war year.
I have extracted some figures from a publication called Canada's Defence Program
1954-55 to show the division of the defence
expenditures in the present fiscal year. Personnel costs are 21.3 per cent; procurement
of equipment 42-3 per cent; operations and
maintenance 21-2 per cent; construction 9.2
per cent; civil salaries and wages 6 per cent.
We are all aware that the basic problem
for the Government of Canada today is to
relate the size of this defence program to
Canada's ability to support it. This means
that defence spending must be related to the
development of the resources of the country
and to the economy of the country as a whole.
Economy in all departments of government
and on all levels of government, as these
have been discussed in this chamber and in
the Senate's Standing Committee on Finance,
plays a most important part in these considerations. Moreover, the defence program
must be one which we can maintain for a
period of years without overtaxing our economie strength. This is a matter of concern
to all of us at home but, since the defence
program which we have undertaken is a joint
one, conducted with other countries in NATO,
the same basic economic problemý confronts
those other countries. If the North .Atlantic
Treaty Organization is to be a successful
deterrent to aggression, none of the member
countries should overreach themselves in
their spending for defence. I will have something to say a little later about the importance
which the NATO organization itself, attaches
to this consideration. It is vital to the issue
if the strength from which NATO countries
are to negotiate or to defend themselves is
not only armed strength but economic
strength as well.
This is the background of cost of the defence effort of Canada. Obviously the cost
is enormous. In our last four fiscal periods
we have spent more on defence than all of
the government spending on al accounts in
the present fiscal year, which amounts to
$4,390 million. When 43 cents of every tax
dollar goes for defence, the taxpayer must
be assured that the expenditure is wise and
the money is not wasted.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
ion. Mr. Connolly: It is natural therefore
to ask what Canada is getting for this money.
At present the Navy has an active strength
of nearly 19,000, the Army of nearly 49,000,
and the Air Force of nearly 49,000. The total

active strength of our forces is, therefore,
117,000 personnel, and the target, I am informed, is 120,000. This is a considerable
drop from the peak enrolment of the war
period for the year 1944-45. At that time
the Navy strength was over 92,000, the Army
strength was over 577,000, and the Air Force
174,000, the total number in the services
that year having been 844,000 personnel, or
more than seven times the present over-all
strength. I do not here discuss the size of
the reserve forces which play a part in the
present defence organisation.
I am informed that the total number of
aircraft of some twenty types now in service
with the RCAF is some 2,800. In the past
six months the Royal Canadian Navy had
an average of 59 ships in commission.
The employment of these forces has varied
with the requirements of the times. In the
first period under the NATO organization the
requirement was to build up defensive
strength in Europe. This country has twelve
squadrons of the Air Force involving some
5,000 men and 300 planes in the European
sector. The role of the Navy in the NATO
organization has been to assist in supporting
the supply line between Europe and North
America. The role of the Army has been
to supply the ground forces now so highly

brigade group is now in Europe and its
complement is some 6,000 personnel. In
adçlition to the European commitment Canada
accepted a conmitment in Korea which involved the employment of all three services.
It goes beyond, saying that the contribution
made there was in the highest of the high
tra.ditions of Canada's armed forces. Some
2,000 personnel still are in Korea.
Honourable senators will remember the
visit paid to Ottawa last June by General
Gruenther, the Supreme Commander in
charge of NATO forces in Europe. He then
spoke in glowing terms of the value of
Canada's assistance in his Command.
The Minister of National Defence spoke
in the House of Commons on January 28 last,
and he indicated there a change in emphasis
in planning within the NATO organization. If
the build-up of strength in Europe and the
maintenance of the life-line on the North
Atlantic was the first target; the second, and
now almost as important as the first, is
continental defence in North Anerica. This
shift in emphasis, hé said, has. arisen from
the emergence of improved Russiari thermonuclear weapons and of the capacity of the
Russians to deliver these weapons against
this continent. Warning lines of extensive
chains of ,radar stations are now impôséd
upDn -the NATO.-strategists for: thè defence

SENATE
,of North America and with them goes ail of
the organization, especially in air power and
costly communications, required to utilize
these radar chains to the full.
In this context it is perhaps useful to
observe the remarks of Field Marshal Lord
Montgomery in a lecture he gave to the
Royal United Services Institution in Britain
in October, 1954. This is what be said:
The Air is coming to the front as the decisive
arm. This is going to introduce difficult problems,
and in solving them do not let us bother unduly
about the colour of our uniform,-khaki, dark
blue, light lue.

To paraphrase this great Army Leader,
it now appears to be an accepted element in
defence strategy to employ the various units
of the armed services together as a defensive
or offensive force with closely knit liaison
under a supreme strategic commander. Coordinated or combined operations which were
so successfully used in the late war are now
a commonplace for overall defence planning.
I may say that Canada recognized this
need some time ago. The unification of the
Department of National Defence under one

Minister was one step in this direction. I am
informed there is a tri-service policy in effect
within the Department for administrative
matters as well as for supply, personnel and
related problems. The combined training
afforded by general service colleges is another,
and the training programs within the services
has followed the same pattern.
If I have the unanimous consent of the
house I would like to place upon Hansard
another table, which sets out the proportions
in which Canada's defence dollar is distributed
among the various branches of our armed
services. A perusal of the table will show
that for the past five years Canada's defence
spending on ber air arm has been increased,
with the exception of one year, in proportion to the spending on the other arms. I
think it would be a matter of convenience
for honourable senators to have this information, and of course I place it on Hansard on
my own responsibility.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

dollars of less value than were available
before World War II, and perhaps less valuable than dollars that were available during
the war.
The Navy is building the most modern
destroyer escorts it can devise in shipyards
on both coasts and in the St. Lawrence area.
Some honourable senators may have visited
some of these naval shipyards; if so, they
know how fully justified I am in making
that statement. The Navy is also modernizing
its frigates and mine sweepers with the idea
of providing a fast, powerful fleet for convoy
duty and to meet the challenge-the terrifie
challenge-of the new submarine. Turbines
are being built in this country and, with the
development of new fighting and naval equipment, the costs of all these vessels, whether
they are built in Canada or elsewhere, have
mounted greatly since the building program
of the war came to an end. A mine sweeper
now costs about $5 million. The average cost
of a comparable vessel built during the war
was $1.7 million. The Navy has eight of these
in commission, and six building. In commission also the Navy has eight destroyer escorts,
nine frigates, two training cruisers and a
light fleet carrier.
The cost of providing the Army with its
mechanical requirements and its new weapons
for the atomic age has increased likewise.
Today, I am informed, a Centurion tank costs
about $150,000.
So much for the defence forces. I think,
however, I should say a word about NATO.
The Secretary General of NATO, Lord
Ismay, has recently published a book on the
history of the present set-up of the fourteen
country alliance. While Lord Ismay considers NATO to be revolutionary in its conception, as we do, he thinks it essential to
our defence requirements and to the defence
requirements of the Western world.
I shall not attempt to outline either the
political or the military organization of
NATO, but perhaps I should say that one
of its problems bas been to evolve a formula
for expressing accurately the relative capacity of each country to bear defence burdens, and to study the points of special strain
in the economy of each country. How successfully this can be done is one thing, but
the fact that the problem is receiving continued attention is reassuring. In 1949 NATO
had about twelve divisions, 400 aireraft and
a proportionate number of naval vessels.
Today the NATO forces number some 100
divisions, both active and reserve, and the
air forces and the navies have increased
proportionately both in numbers and in
quality.
I note with satisfaction that extensive
liaison on the military level is maintained

by this country on its own account with the
United States and the United Kingdom in
particular, and with many other countries
as well.
I shall make no extended reference to the
substantial mutual aid program which Canada has conducted since 1950 and upon
which she has spent over $1,100 million.
This bas been part of the defence expenditure and is related to the NATO program.
Armament, ammunition, aircraft engines,
transport vehicles, communications equipment, and aireraft, as well as training facilities in Canada, have been accorded to
countries like Belgium, Denmark, France,
Italy, Holland, Portugal, Turkey and others.
I say little, however, about other efforts
made to promote peace and the means
whereby peace can be maintained by our
active participation in the work of the
United Nations and by our contributions to
the Colombo Plan. There has been criticism
of the allegedly small extent of Colombo
Plan participation by Canada. The contributions which have been made-and I know
we all approve of them-have been worthy
ones and have been deeply appreciated by
the recipient countries, but again the question of our ability to pay must always engage
the active attention of those who are concerned with maintaining the strength of our
economy-and that includes every member
of our Parliament. We cannot afford to overstep our defence spending or our mutual aid
spending.
I believe the Defence Research Board,
which was established in 1946, merits mention. It has particular regard for the best
employment of Canadian resources in defence
and for the unique defence requirements of
this country as a North American nation. It
co-operates closely with similar boards in
the United States and in the United Kingdom.
In the past five years we have spent $187
million or more for this work. The Board is
under the direction of an eminent scientist,
Dr. O. M. Solandt.
When Mendes-France spoke in Ottawa to
the Canadian Club last fall he singled out
for special praise the importance of Canada's
contribution in the field of atomie energy.
Honourable senators will recall the very
informative discussion by Mr. W. J. Bennett,
President of Atomie Energy of Canada Limited, and of Eldorado Mining & Refining
Limited, before the Banking and Commerce
Committee of the Senate last session. He
discussed not only the defence aspect of the
program but as well the peaceful or civilian
uses of atomie energy. The atomic energy
program, of course, is in addition to the

SENATE

defence expenditures. The report of the company has already been circulated to the members of this house and a perusal of that
report will show not only the parliamentàry
appropriation of over $8 million last year,
but other aspects of the company's financial
undertaking.
In passing may I make this additional
observation. The magnitude of our defence
expenditures over the past decade has been
very great. I think, however, that we must
realize the contributions it has made to the
strengthening of our economy. Through the
Department of Defence Production, just as
through its predecessor, the Department of
Munitions and Supply, impetus has been
given to the development of industrialization
here, to the establishment of new plants and
plant facilities, and to the development especially of new skills. These have, been essential for defence purposes, but they have also
added greatly to the economic power of the
country. During the past four or five years
the total new private and public investment
in Canada has represented some 22 to 25
per cent of the gross national product. At
the present time it is estimated that some
25 per cent of the total investment in durable
physical assets like new plant, housing, machinery and equipment, is devoted to outlays
on strategic resource development, including
hydro-electric power, petroleum, natural gas,
minerals, pulp and paper, and chemicals.
Support for this statement can be found in
the budget papers attached to the House of
Commons Hansard of April 6, 1954.
In view of the high level of debate we had
in this chamber on the West German Treaty,
it would be tedious were I to elaborate on the
third branch of this speech-namely, the
justification of this country's defence effort
this year and for the past decade. We cannot
shut our eyes to the fact that behind the iron
curtain men are at work, resourceful in the
pursuit of their ambition and ruthless in their
methods. Physical science has given to them,
as it has given to us, weapons'of a terrifying character; weapons which can destroy
the materials of our ancient civilization, force
which can disperse our cultural heritage.
Scientific progress is a great achievement for
a people, but of itself it exercises no influence
of control or moderation. Technology must
be modified by morality, or the people perish.
Government cannot legislate morality. It can
legislate defence. It can legislate for war.
Morality must spring from the minds of the
people. It must be based upon a sound ethic.
But in the interests of self-preservation, and
perhaps of the preservation of the human

race, we must be prepared, with those who
think as we do, to defend ourselves.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators,
the subject of my observations this afternoon
has not been mentioned in this debate, and I
realize that what I shall say may be quite
controversial. Perhaps that will be a good
thing, if it leads to a further discussion of
a vitally important matter.
My sole purpose in taking part in this
debate is to voice my concern-and I believe
the concern of many Canadian citizens-at
the newly announced policy of our neighbours to the south with regard to what might
be termed "the Formosa question"-a policy
which carries within it, I believe, the risk
of war, which in this atomic age might mean
the destruction of civilization as we know
it. And I hope that the Canadian Government, as well as the British Government, will
set their faces against it.
Although I am a great admirer of the
United States-as I believe all Canadians
are-I am inclined to think we are just a
little too prone to follow their lead on too
many occasions; in other words, that we
are a sort of tail to their kite. Upon second
thought, perhaps that is not a very good
metaphor, because the tail of a kite at least
influences the course of the kite, and I think
that Canada's influence upon United States'
policies is practically negligible. If I wished
to give an example, I would say this: I
believe Canada would have followed the
example of Great Britain-or acted on ber
own initiative-in recognizing China diplomatically, had it not been that she feared
the displeasure of the United States.
Thus to criticize the policy of a friendly
country may, by some, be regarded as an
interference in what is none of our business;
but today, with the world as it is, the business
of almost any country, in an international
sense, is the business of every other country.
I say that for this reason: If as a result of
the policy which it has announced the United
States got into a war with China and a
general war ensued, Canada would almost
inevitably be drawn into it. True, we might
perhaps delay for a while our entry into a
war started by the United States, or in which
the United States took part, just as they
delayed their entry into the previous two
wars.
What is the situation with regard to this
policy of which I speak? The President
threatens military action if Red China attempts
to occupy the coastal islands or Formosa.
I read in a magazine the other day that the

FEBRUARY 10, 1955
United States has been on the verge of war
within the last ten months-I need not give
instances-and that it has been only through
efforts of the President himself that the country did not get into war. He now seems to
have reversed his position.
Many of us well know that some of the
leading statesmen in the United States have
advocated the dropping of bombs immediately-I think on either China or Russiafor the purpose of starting a "preventive" war.
I remember that when World War I was
near at hand I did not believe it would really
happen, for I did not think the world was
foolish enough to go to war. But it did. When
World War II became imminent, I said,
"Surely the world has learnt its lesson, and
will not repeat the folly." Well, the world
did go to war again, and we know the condition it was left in when hostilities ceased.
This time, I hope I am wrong when I say,
in reverse, that I fear that out of this policy
of the United States there is a risk of another
war getting started.
I was talking with some of my colleagues
last evening, and we discussed this matter
of the danger of war. One of them said,
"There is no danger of China going to war;
she is afraid to go to war against the United
States". Then something, perhaps in the
nature of a simile, came to my mind. I am
not a poker player myself, but I think I am
right in saying that the game was invented
in the United States. Possibly my friend
across the way could tell me if that is so.
'The American people are good at poker, but
there is just a possibility that the United
States is starting a poker game with the
wrong people, as so often has been the case.
The world forgets that the China of today
is not the China of 25 or 50 years ago, when
she was weak, disunited, corrupt, after having
been exploited for years by the Western
nations. China today is united as never before. She feels her power and thinks she is
backed up by Russia. It was reported in this
morning's papers, I believe, that Russia has
stated that she is behind her ally, China.
Whether we like it or not, we have to
reckon with that situation.
China, having driven Chiang Kai-shek off
the mainland, is convinced that she is entitied to incorporate as part of China the
islands along the coast and Formosa as well,
for without a doubt these islands inherently
belong to China. She believes that intervention by the United States is interference
in China's affairs; that is, in what she regards
as a civil war. That being her sincere conviction, is it not possible that she will persist in her efforts to take possession of what

she naturally regards as her own? Then, if
the United States carries out the policy proclaimed by the President, the United States
will start a shooting war; possibly Russia
will come to the assistance of China-and
there will be another world war, with all
that an atomic war portends, a suicidal world
war in which we ourselves will become involved, for we will not be able to escape it.
I cannot understand why the United States
is so insistent upon Formosa. I sat in a
theatre the other day and saw projected on
the screen a picture of President Eisenhower,
who stated, among other things, that Formosa
was necessary for the security of the United
States. With all due respect to the head of
a great nation, 'I thought that was a most
far-fetched statement. Formosa is 10,000
miles away from the United States, on the
other side of the world. It is entirely unnecessary for the United States to have possession of Formosa in order to prevent China,
or Russia, from using that island as a
jumping-off place, if you like, to make an
attack on Australia or any other country.
China can launch an attack from the mainland. To try to substantiate the position that
the United States needs Formosa for that
purpose would be like saying that for her
own security she ought to have possession of
the island of Newfoundland, or Vancouver
Island or perhaps the Queen Charlotte
Islands. Similarly, Russia might say that if
the United States needs an island 10,000 miles
away from her borders, when she already
has Russia ringed about with airports, then
for her protection Russia ought to have possession of Cuba or some other island near
the United States.
Hon. Mr. Reid: But Great Britain still
believes she should hold on to Gibraltar.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Yes, but two wrongs
do not make a right, nor are the two situations quite comparable. The point I have
been trying to make is, that if the United
States thinks this is the time at which communism should be arrested, I would say she
is a little bit late. Further, it is my conviction that communism will never be stopped
by acts of war.
Perhaps I have not expressed myself
clearly, but my further point is that whether
or not we belleve that China has a valid
claim upon these islands, the challenge to her
involves a risk for which the possession of
Formosa cannot even remotely compensate.
I have with me an article from the last issue
of Life magazine which states clearly what
an atomic war in these days would mean.
I would like to quote from it, and I hope
the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) will not think I am reading

SENATE
my speech. The article, which includes a
statement by General MacArthur, whom we
all know, begins in this way:
On his 75th birthday last week Douglas MacArthur made perhaps the most eloquent address
of his eloquent career. His subject was war and
He traced the
the necessity of abolishing it.
history of this evil old institution from David and
Goliath to the modern "triumph of scientific
annihilation." War has so developed, he said, that
nobody can win one any more. . .

So why start one?
I continue reading:
"Science has clearly outmoded it as a feasible
arbiter." He then went on to list the glorious
results if war could in fact be abolished-"the
greatest advance in civilization since the Sermon
on the Mount."

And further:
"Must we fight again before we learn? When
will some great figure in power have sufficient
imagination and moral courage to translate this
universal wish-which is rapidly becoming a
universal necessity-into actuality?" . . . "We have
had our last chance. If we will not devise some
greater and more equitable system, our Armageddon will be at our door."

And there was this editorial comment:
Now MacArthur is not only quite right, but
in very good company in repudiating modern war.
The Pope agrees: "a war of annihilation", he bas
said, "is not permitted for any reason whatsoever."
Eisenhower agrees: "this horror must
not be."

I fear he has gone back a little in his
attitude.
Churchill agrees: it

"would leave us victorious,

but victorious on a heap of ruins."
son agrees:

Adiai Steven-

"no physical peril greater than atomic

war has confronted mortal man since the Flood."
Even Malenkov agrees: "a new world war would
mean the destruction of world civilization."

We can get no higher authority for what
atomic war would mean.

In view of these

declarations, I say we should avoid even the
slightest risk of getting into a holocaust which
would destroy the world.
Perhaps it is not necessary to read further,
but may I include these words:
Thus the novelty of MacArthur's speech was not
in what be said, but in how and when be said it.
He said it in a way that placed the blame on men
in office: "The leaders are the laggards.
The
disease of power seems to confuse and befuddle
them."

The reading of that article should bring
home again to senators the enormity of
atomic war, the serious results it would have,
and the fact that we art not justified, for
the sake of the possession of Formosa, to
take the risk of throwing Canada into a
war. If we support the policy proposed by
the United States, we are literally playing
with fire, small as the risk may be in the
minds of some people. I realize that the
United States has taken a position from which
national pride will make it difficult for her
to retreat. We can only hope that China will
not take up the challenge, and that, if she
does, both parties will come to their senses
before it is too late.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Thursday, Febmuary 10, consideration of His Excellency the
-Governor General's Speech at the opening of
the session and the motion of Hon. Mrs.
Hodges, seconded by Hon. Mr. Tremblay, for
:an Address in reply thereto.

Hon. Calvert C. Pratt: Honourable senators, I would like to speak at this time to the
motion for an Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne.
First, may I offer a word of congratulations to the mover (Hon. Mrs. Hodges) and
the seconder (Hon. Mr. Tremblay) upon their
very fine presentation to the House of the
various matters arising out of the Speech.
The Speech covers a very wide range of
duties of Parliament, both as applying to
matters of provincial interest and those of
national concern. At the beginning of these
remarks, I would particularly like to refer
to the meeting of the Commonwealth Prime
Ministers, which has just concluded in London. During the period of those meetings the
world was shaken by events which were not
anticipated when the meetings were proposed. The importance of these events can
only be appraised as time goes on. It was
singularly fortunate that the leaders of our
Commonwealth of Nations were together and
able to consider the momentous issues that
with dramatic suddenness commanded world
attention. It is gratifying that Canada has
reached a place of high recognition in world
affairs, and we have every reason to be
grateful for the self-sacrificing services of
our representatives. I am sure that the high
honour which was paid to the Prime Minister
of Canada recently by the great City of
London, in recognition of his valued and
devoted service, finds a grateful and appreciative response from all the people of Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Prait: I am sure that feeling
prevails irrespective of race, creed, or political
affiliation.
These are indeed serious times. Things that
happen today may be causing, even in the
near future, repercussions of a magnitude
which no one today can estimate. This is a
time, honourable senators, for balanced
thought and speech, and for balanced planning
and effort. It is a time for right perspectives.
If we become too absorbed in local issues,
and allow them to dominate our thinking,
we can lose the opportunity to render our
full measure of constructive aid in this world
of misunderstanding and conflict. Similarly,
if we pass up the obvious duty to resolve
our local difficulties, and fail to plan and
legislate for the progress and advancement
of our people in every part of Canada, we
deprive ourselves of a solid foundation for
contributing unitedly to the advancement of
justice and freedom throughout the world.
We are indeed fortunate that in Canada
tradition, practice and the outlook of our
people safeguard us from being torn asunder
by extreme and fanatical approaches to

SENATE
national and social problerns such as we
observe in so many places throughout the
world.
I think the Speech from the Throne preserves a balance which is commendable. It
emphasizes the great part that Canada is
playing in the council of the nations, and,
while it strikes a note of world responsibility,
at the same time it covers a wide range of
needs at home.
I have spoken before in this house of the
need for greater encouragement to the fishermen of my province; in fact, it is probable
that every time I have spoken I have mentioned one phase or another of the fishing
industry. The Speech from the Throne anticipates legislation to provide facilities for loans
to fishermen similar to those provided for
farmers by the Farm Improvement Loans
Act. While the appropriate time to comment
in detail will be when the bill comes before
us for second reading, I would like to say
now, however, that the general conditions
applying to fishing are so vastly different
from those applying to farming, which that
Act is designed to serve, that I really do not
think the sane pattern will work for the
fishing industry and particularly not in
Newfoundland.
The farm loans are made through the
chartered banks, and a maximum amount of
any one loan is $4,000, with the banks being
guaranteed by the Government up to 10 per
cent of the total amounts that are loaned. In
other words, all the loans are pooled and 10
per cent of the total pool is guaranteed.
That is as I understand it. I presume the
limit of $4,000 was fixed because of the
purchases of farm implements and such like,
but I think that loaning facilities with a
maximum of $4,000 would be of very little
use where deep sea fishing boats are employed.
Investment in the industry has been turning
more to the larger and expensive craft.
Another aspect I would mention is that
the fishermen of Newfoundland are scattered
in a thousand settlements over perhaps 4,000
miles of coastline. The areas most prominently
engaged in fishing are not well provided with
connecting roads.
There are, I think, forty-five branch banks
in the province, and only a small number of
those are situated where such service is most
needed to help the fishing industry. Prospective borrowers will no doubt get to the banks,
but it will be almost impossible for bank
managers and inspectors to be in touch with
the borrowers for the purpose of overseeing their collections and supervising their
security. I feel certain there will not be the
coverage which the fishermen should get. I
do not know what the feasible approach is,

but it seems that some guarantee to a loan
board under the auspices either of the provincial government or some other agency with
personal contact and inspection facilities, will
be the more practical means. There is no
use in building up people's expectations of
assistance of that nature unless it is made
available in a widespread and practical manner. Perhaps in areas other than Newfoundland such a plan as used by the farmers may
be feasible in the fishing industry, but if
so it is simply another case of Newfoundland
requiring special treatment for special circumstances. As I have pointed out on other
occasions, Newfoundland is an area for
special consideration in many matters because
geography, history and other factors have
made it so.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I interrupt the honourable senator to ask whether the Government
guarantee to the banks is not 15 per cent
rather than 10 per cent?
Hon. Mr. Pratt: As I understand it, the
Government guarantees 10 per cent of the
loans.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My understanding is that it
guarantees 15 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Prait: If I am wrong in that
respect, I stand to be corrected.
Last week I listened with great interest
to the honourable senator from Kennebec
(Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) speak of the great
value to Canada of the agricultural industry.
It is indeed of great importance. All the
primary production industries must have
watchful care and guidance and, where essential, varying forms of assistance. Fisheries
is the one production industry more than
any other that until recent years has been
in the background. Science has only lately
come into this sphere of activity. It was the
earliest industry in North America established
from Europe and perhaps the most neglected.
The honourable senator spoke of the great
future need for increasing food production
because of increasing populations. I cannot
think of any means of food supply which
should be more carefully guarded -and progressively developed than the fisheries around
our coasts. The great fishing centre of the
Grand Banks of Newfoundland, as well as
the areas along the coasts of Newfoundland
and Labrador, are amongst the most prolific
sources of food with rapid reproduction in the
world. Unfortunately, the most precarious
condition in the industry today in Newfoundland arises from the difficulty of holding the
fishermen to their occupation. By reason of
low returns, particularly in the salt fish
industry which occupies most of the Newfoundland fishermen, the younger men are

industries and agencies which are circularizing, members of Parliament we would find
ourselves in a tight pocket of the world andworse than living by ourselves-we would
starve by ourselves. The greatest things of
life are acquired by sacrifice. It is true we
must apply that thought in moderation and
with care, but it is a factor in human life,
and always will be. We must give if we are
to receive.
I for one feel that we have not done enough
in this country to cultivate wider understanding and improved trading relations with
our neighbours to the south. I know how
tariff-protection-minded they can be, as we
can be also. We should constantly be trying
for a closer economic policy of mutual benefit.
We should be preaching it so as to reach
down to the average citizen, and they on the
other side of the border should be encouraged
to do the same. Here again, if I may say
so, we need balanced thought and balanced
effort. We need more balance in our approach
to this subject than we seem to have here.
One sometimes hears this subject discussed
in Parliament and outside-everywhere, in
fact-as though we had to decide between
Commonwealth affiliations and loyalties and
American associations and neighbourliness.
To my mind that is sheer nonsense, and it
does an immense amount of harm. Unfortunately there appears to be throughout the
world a growing misunderstanding and misrepresentation of the motives of America. It
is becoming increasingly prevalent in countries that are near and dear to us; and this,
I consider, is a world misfortune. It is true
that it does not come out prominently on
top official levels, but it is increasing on the
street level-if I may put it that way-which
is more important.
Now I don't think there is any fear that
Canada will be drawn into adverse feeling
against our neighbour, but there is a danger
of our going along in a neutral position.
There is no place for neutrality marked out
by a boundary across this continent. There
is only a place for the cultivation of mutual
helpfulness and understanding and for more
recognition that from benefits which are
mutual come the greater good.
I do not say that we should go along with
our neighbours hand in hand in all matters.
Even their states differ, as do our provinces,
in policy and outlook. That, however, does
not lessen the need and value of our working
together toward the closest possible understanding, both in the sphere of foreign responsibilities and of what I might term interdomestic matters.
I would like for a moment to comment
on the remarks of the honourable senator from

Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), who was the last
preceding speaker in this debate. I really
think some of the things he said have not
helped in the mutual understanding which is
so essential. Knowing the honourable senator, I am sure he spoke his honest convictions,
as he has a right to do, and with the deep
feeling and desire to see what is the best and
wisest course to pursue. As reported in
Hansard, he used the words:
Then, if the United States carries out the policy
proclaimed by the President, the United States
will start a shooting war.

These words of the honourable senator
were, I assume, his interpretation of the
professed fears of Communist China.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is exactly what the
President said.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: I don't agree with that
interpretation. And, without taking anything
out of its context, I think it will help to
clarify that issue if I quote from President
Eisenhower's message to Congress of January 24, 1955, as reported in the New York
Times of January 25:
The most important objective of our nation's
foreign policy is to safeguard the security of the
United States by establishing and preserving a
just and honourable peace. In the Western Pacific
a situation is developing in the Formosa Straits
that seriously inperils the peace and our security.

Another quotation from the same address:
In the interest of peace, therefore, the United
States must remove any doubt regarding our
readiness to fight, if necessary, to preserve the
vital stake of the free world in a free Formosa,
and to engage in whatever operations may be required to carry out that purpose.

Still further, and finally, I would quote:
Again I say that we would welcome action by
the United Nations, which might, in fact, bring
an end to the active hostilities in the area. This
critical situation has been created by the choice of
the Chinese communists, not by us. Their offensive
military intent has been flaunted to the whole
world by words and by deeds. Just as they created
the situation, se they can end it if they so choose.

Now that policy was overwhelmingly endorsed by the Congress of the United States.
The House of Representatives proved that by
a vote of 409 to 3, and the Senate by a vote of
85 to 3. It is my conviction that if war breaks
out over the Formosa question the blame will
lie, not with the United States but with the
government of Communist China.
The United States has issued a warning,
not in order to threaten war but in order to
maintain peace-to maintain peace by making
it absolutely plain to the Chinese Government that aggression against Formosa and
the Pescadores will mean war with the United
States.

FEBRUARY 15, 1955

In other words, without that warning the
Chinese Communist Government could precipitate a major war by attack, in the mistaken belief that her aggression would not be
taken seriously. If she does attack now she
will be the aggressor in a major war, and she
knows it. The fact that those islands are ten
thousand miles away, as the honourable senator put it, does not, as far as I see, greatly
affect the case. Australia, New Zealand, The
Philippines-to mention a few of what I
might term "near home areas"-are just as
far away geographically. Distance on the
map doesn't mean much today.
Science-and it may be for the ill fate of
the world-has eliminated distance as a factor
in human relations. Whether we like it or
not we are unable to travel country roads
any more to avoid the crowds.
It wasn't so many years ago that the great
criticism of the United States in some areas
of the world stemmed from what was regarded as its policy of isolationism. It is
ironical that its abandonment of that policy
and its active pursuance of a policy of participation in world affairs is now the cause of
growing prejudices in the same areas of the
world.
Without attempting in any degree to present more than the most elementary facts in
the matter of Far East policy, I would like
to say the United States has adopted a conciliatory attitude as compared with the bellicose attitude of the Peiping Government. The
United States has bent over backwards, in
my opinion, to avoid war out there in the
East, if possible. First, by its influence, Chiang
was induced to surrender the Tachen Islands
to Peiping, and then the United States rendered assistance to the Nationalist Government to evacuate the islands. Then again,
and what was most important, the United
States voted in the Security Council for the
New Zealand resolution to invite Communist
China to participate in a United Nations debate to discuss ways and means of establishing a cease fire agreement in the Formosa
area and of finding a peaceful solution to the
Formosa question. That was on January 31,
but the invitation was rejected by China on
February 3-notwithstanding that Russia as
well as America allowed it to go through.
I have just been reading the report which
the honourable senator from Cariboo (Hon.
Mr. Turgeon) gave to this house on February
8, 1951, on the work of the Canadian Parliamentary Delegation-of which he was a member-to the General Assembly of the United
Nations just previous to that time. It would
be well worthwhile for all of us to refresh
our minds on the conditions then prevailing
at the height of the Korean issue by reading

that most comprehensive and enlightening
report by the honourable senator.
To show how true to present pattern ran
the attitude of the communist Government
at that time, I quote from the statement of
the honourable senator:
Acting as head of the Canadian delegation, Mr.
Pearson presented a motion, which was adopted
by the General assembly, to set up a committee
to study the question of what group should represent China in the General Assembly; that is,
whether the representatives of Nationalist China
or Communist China should be recognized.

The quotation follows on:
But the Chinese communist group
meet this committee.

refused

to

The same attitude has been repeated time
and time again. As I see it the alternatives
are: Is the world to be allowed to be dragged
into a war on a flood tide of appeasement,
which will whet the appetite of the aggressor, or isn't it better for the whole world to
know where in such extreme cases the border
lines of peace and war are, also where the
defences are, but above all pray and hope and
work without ceasing for understanding and
reconciliation of the difficulties?
Honourable senators, I have referred in
this talk to the benefits of more intimate
association with our neighbour to the south.
I have tried to indicate how they can extend
and make even more valuable our loyalties
in the British Commonwealth. Now that
doesn't mean we have to go along just as a
mouthpiece for the United States. Such an
attitude would not be useful nor dignifled.
Neither is the often repeated expression of
fear of falling under American domination
useful or dignified. To my mind such an expression is sheer folly. I think it reveals an
individual weakness of thought and I certainly hope it is not a national attitude.
Yes, honourable senators, our Commonwealth relations, our Australia and New Zealand members out there in the East
particularly, will be helped in these times
by the growth of the greatest possible degree
of understanding between us and the United
States.
May I close by mentioning a personal incident which I feel will be of interest as
illustrating a growth of friendliness. Last
year I spent a few days at Atlantic City, and
while there I noticed the press announcing
"Canadian Day". It puzzled me, but not for
long, for I received and accepted an invitation to attend the ceremony of hoisting the
American and Canadian flags in a public
square of the city. It was done in a thrilling
ceremony, with a band playing national music
of both countries. I was then asked to attend
a luncheon with many other Canadians. The
big banquet hall was filled with guests. The

SENATE
mayor of the city spoke of the significance of
"Canadian Day", and quite unexpectedly I
was asked to receive the honours of the occasion on behalf of Canada and was presented
with a key to the city, symbolie of their
hospitality.
I found that "Canadian Day" is an annual
event in that city. I was told some other
places observe it also. In my response to the
honour I said I hoped the example of Atlantic
City in having an annual "Canadian Day"
would spread throughout the entire United
States and that we on our side in every city
and town of Canada would have an annual
"Our American Neighbour Day". It is an
idea that I hope will spread widely through
both countries. The example would do good,
far beyond the bounds of the American continent. There is no other way, honourable
senators, to resolve international difficulties
than by cultivating international friendships.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. B. Baird: Honourable senators, this
is the first time during the present sessionperhaps fortunately-that I have risen to
express my opinions and to discuss the very
important matters that are before us.
Quite naturally, I believe that the defence
program that has been suggested will have
the full approval of the Canadian people,
who, after all, are nobody's slaves-and have
no desire to ever become slaves.
I have listened with a certain amount of
pleasure to the speeches by honourable
senators on the motion for an Address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne, and
particularly to the definite tone of approval
that has permeated the entire discussion as
to our defence program. However, somewhat
to my amazement, I have also listened perforce to what has sounded to me like suggestions of appeasement.
I have a vivid memory of former appeasements, particularly that of Munich, which as
we well know did not prevent Great War IL.
Although it is a matter of record that our
friends in the United States were very slow
to take up arms in both Great War I and
Great War II, I well remember a cartoonI think it was published originally in St.
Louis-which was reproduced far and wide.
Like all good cartoons it was very simple. It
merely showed Mr. Chamberlain's umbrella
staked across the road, but the caption read,
"They shall not pass".
Now we are asked, sixteen years later, to
repeat the appeasement performance. An
article has been quoted to us from Life-a
magazine definitely noted, not for its sane
pronouncements, but rather for its picture
propaganda directed to men and women who,

even if they cannot read or understand, can
look at pictures. On the other hand, I have
taken some trouble to find out exactly what
the intelligent Press has to say on the subject
and on the pronouncements of President
Eisenhower himself. Many people will agree
with me when I say that I believe the communists will keep trying to add peoples and
territory to their empire by internal subversion, as long as their efforts are profitable,
as they have been both in Europe and Asia.
The United States and its allies, on the other
hand, will keep trying to counter these tactics
by perfecting their system of alliances and
by helping underdeveloped countries.
The Formosa crisis provides a good example
of what the President's basic thinking and
policies are designed to do. It looks to me
as if he is playing for a stalemate in Formosa. He hopes, by moving up his air and
naval strength, to make it impossible for the
Chinese communists to launch a successful
attack on the island. In the meantime he
will do everything in his power to work for
peace through diplomatic channels. And I,
for one, pray to God that his efforts will be
crowned with success.
Honourable senators, I believe those words
are a true estimate of what is happening,
and I for one must refuse to agree to or
have any part in another appeasement program which in fact could be as disastrous as
that of Munich.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Aseltine, the debate
was adjourned.
PRIVATE BILL
ROMAN CATHOLIC EPISCOPAL CORPORATION
OF PEMBROKE-SECOND READING
Hon. Charles L. Bishop moved the second

reading of Bill A-6, an Act respecting The
Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of
Pembroke.
He said: Honourable senators, The Roman
Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Pembroke
was incorporated by chapter 105 of the Statutes of 1884, under the name of The Roman
Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Pontiac.
The only amendment to the original Act of
Incorporation is contained in chapter 108
of the Statutes of 1899, where the name
of the corporation was changed to that of
The Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of
Pembroke.
The corporation's purpose in requesting the
present amendment is to enable it to give its
guarantee to bodies like religious organizations, institutions, schools or school boards and
the like. Frequently, such organizations, operating in the diocese, and with the approval

FEBRUARY 15. 1955
of the Episcopal Corporation, require support
for financing their enterprises in the manner
contemplated by the amendment. Section 2
of the bill is designed to give the corporation
these powers of guarantee. A later part of
section 2 is a provision which will by retroactive operation permit the Episcopal Corporation to guarantee certain financing
already accomplished by a school board.
There is a parliamentary precedent for
giving retroactive effect to a statute in a simi-"
lar case in "An Act Respecting the General
Synod of the Church of England in Canada
and the Missionary Society of the Church of
England in Canada", which may be found in
the Statutes of 1951, chapter 34, section 7.
This, of course, was approved by this bouse.
The other provisions of section 2 and the
provisions of section 3 of the bill are designed
to facilitate and bring up to date the procedure of the corporation in the management
of its temporal affairs, and they deal with
the appointment of committees, the passing
of by-laws and the like.
These provisions are similar to the provisions contained in "An Act to Incorporate
the Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Whitehorse", Statutes of 1945, chapter 48.
If the bill should receive second reading,
I shall move that it be referred to the Committee on Banking and Commerce. The representatives for the Episcopal Corporation
will be available then to supply the committee with whatever additional information it
requires.

FARM LOANS
GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE TO BANKS
On the orders of the day:
Hon. Mr. Prait: Honourable senators, before
the Orders of the Day are proceeded with I
should like to make an explanatory statement with reference to a point that came

up last night when I took part in the debate
on the Address.
In referring to the Farm Improvement
Loans Act, which was amended in 1953, I
said that the banks are guaranteed by the
Government up to 10 per cent of the total
amounts that are loaned. The honourable

Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
then suggested that the Government guarantee was 15 per cent. Not having a copy of
the act before me, I conceded that my
honourable friend might be right. Now I
have a copy of the act, as amended in 1953,
and in order to keep the record straight I
will read the new section 4(1):
The minister is not liable under this act to pay
to a bank, in respect of losses sustained by it as
a result of farm improvement loans made by it
during any of the periods set out in subsection two,
a total amount in excess of ten per cent of the
aggregate principal amount of the guaranteed farm
improvement loans made by the bank <during that
period.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, what
the honourable gentleman says is correct, but
I would like to point out that there are in
existence two acts having to do with farm
loans. Under the Farm Improvement Loans
Act, which authorizes loans on building improvements and so on, the Government
guarantee to the banks is limited to 10 per
cent. But under another act, which I think
covers farm machinery, I understand the
Government guarantee is 15 per cent. I have
written to a bank for detailed information in
this matter, and when I receive it I will
raise the point again, on a question of privilege. If it is proved that I am wrong I shall
be glad to acknowledge the fact.

FEBRUARY 16, 1955
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session and the motion of Hon. Mrs. Hodges,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Tremblay, for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senatorsHon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I thank honourable
senators for the encouragement they have
given me. It took me some time to make up
my mind whether I should take part in this
debate, but finally I came to the conclusion
that as there are so few of us on the Opposition side of the house, perhaps I should say
something.
Honourable senators, I am not going to
congratulate the mover (Hon. Mrs. Hodges)
and the seconder (Hon. Mr. Tremblay) of the
motion, because I am afraid that if all of us
congratulated them it might go to their heads
and destroy their usefulness in this chamber.
However, I wish to say that in my opinion
they conducted themselves in a very creditable manner and as ably as those who have
followed them.
A few days ago the honourable senator
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) made what
I think was a very courageous speech. Of
course, he had every right to express the
views that he expressed at that time; certainly the Senate provides facilities to all
honourable members for the expression of
their views. I had fully intended to reply to
the honourable gentleman, but in view of
the remarks made yesterday by the honourable senator from St. John's West (Hon. Mr.
Pratt) and the honourable senator from St.
John's (Hon. Mr. Baird), I do not feel that
I need say anything on this matter.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is a great relief
to me.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: By my concurrence in
the remarks of the honourable senators from
Newfoundland my position will be understood, and I need not commit myself further.
I should like to thank the honourable senator from Prince (Hon. Mr. Barbour) for his
invitation to all senators to visit Prince
Edward Island this summer and to attend the
centennial celebrations at Charlottetown. The
"summons" from the mayor which the honourable gentleman read out to us, was a neat
bit of advertising. I read it again in Hansard
with much interest.
May I take advantage of this opportunity
to remind the house that just fifty years ago

Saskatchewan ceased to be a part of the
Northwest Territories and became a province.
This summer my province will be celebrating
its golden jubilee, and I would extend to my
friend from Prince and to all other honourable senators from outside the province a
very cordial invitation to come along and
join with us at that time. I might add that we
have not yet found it necessary to use a form
of summons to compel anyone to attend, but
if it becomes necessary we will no doubt do
so. At any rate, I trust that some honourable
senators from the central and eastern provinces will make the trip west and give us
the pleasure of showing them around Canada's great wheat-growing province.
Another event to take place this year in
Saskatchewan is the Dominion play-offs for
the Macdonald Brier Canadian Curling
Championship trophy, at the Regina rink during the first week in March. lIy honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Haig), who is Chairman of
the Board of Trustees of the organization, will
be attending. I of course would like to
attend too, but he tells me that I should stay
here and look after things in the Senate during his absence. I hope he will have a good
time at the games and come back in better
shape than ever.
When the honourable Leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) spoke in this
debate he said that the total number of
people employed in the week ending December 11, 1954, was 5,167,000. The honourable
senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner),
during his speech in the debate, questioned
that figure and suggested that if it was correct it must include self-employed persons.
I took the trouble to secure the breakdown
of those figures, which honourable senators
will find in Table 5 of the December issue of
The Labour Force, a publication of the

Hon. Mr. Reid: Have you any idea how
the Bureau of Statistics obtains those figures?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Do not ask me. The
other day I passed the new Dominion Bureau
of Statistics building, located in Tunney's
Pasture, and noticed that it was a very large,
imposing place, so full of people that perhaps
they counted themselves in the statistics.
Hon. Mr. Reid: They were able to tell us
how many balloons were manufactured in
Canada last year.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Another subject I wish
to touch on at this time is the amount of
income tax paid by the farmers of the
Dominion of Canada. That has long been a
pet subject of mine. I brought it up on two
previous occasions, and I showed that in
1950 the wealthy potato growers of Prince
Edward Island altogether paid only $5,000 in
income tax, and that the farmers of the
Province of Quebec paid only $50,000. I
wondered how that could be, and so I followed up the subject again this year to see
if there was any improvement. I stated
previously that the western farmers, who pay
most of the income tax collected from Canadian farmers, wanted to know why this is
so. They felt that either the other farmers
were not taxed sufficiently or that the western farmers were over-taxed. Honourable
senators will understand that they had no
objection to paying the tax, but they wanted
to make sure that other farmers were being
taxed accordingly.
I know the senator from Kennebec (Hon.
Mr. Vaillancourt) will say that in the East
the farms in general are small and the farmers do not make much money, and that is
why they do not have to pay much income
tax. I was surprised to hear him say the
other day that the average yearly income of
all Canadian farmers was only $565.
However, there bas been some improvement in the matter of taxation of farmers
since I gave the house figures previously.
The taxes paid by farmers in the various
provinces for the taxation year 1952, the
latest year for which figures are available,
as given in Taxation Statistics 1954, were as
follows:
Newfoundland .................. . nil
Prince Edward Island .......... $
70,000
Nova Scotia ....................
40,000
New Brunswick .................

Saskatchewan ...................
13,268,000
Alberta ........................
8,350,000
British Columbia ................
1,075,000

six times as much income tax as all the rest
of the farmers put together; and that those
in Saskatchewan, who pay $13,268,000, contribute almost half the total income taxes
received from Canadian farmers.
Hon. Mr. Euler: They should not make so
much money!
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: May I ask the
honourable senator a question? It is very
hard to make a fair comparison between
people engaged in the same occupation but
living in different places. For instance, one
cannot, I suppose, compare a large city chain
store with a little store in the country.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: What is the question?
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Farmers in New
Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and elsewhere down east who cultivate a little land,
are in a different position from the large
farmers of Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That is not the question.
I understand the honourable senator's argument; I have heard it before; and I appreciate
his viewpoint. I think one of the reasons
why farmers in the West pay so much more
than farmers elsewhere is, not that they make
so much more money, but that they are
checked up more carefully than are farmers
in other parts of Canada.
Some Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I am told that some
fifty revenue officers-we .call them tax
inspectors-are continually moving around
the province of Saskatchewan. Of course,
when a farmer sells a load of grain, it goes
to the Wheat Board, whose officials have a
record of the transaction; so the revenue
officer finds out exactly how much income
the farmer has received, and taxes him
accordingly.

Hon. Mr. Euler: Perhaps these people need
a little more watching!
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: I wish the department
would send some of our fifty inspectors to
Ontario, Quebec and other provinces to see
what they could find down there.

FEBRUARY 16, 1955
is followed by another small one this year,
we will flot be able to pay our taxes. Federal
demands should be kept to the minimum,
but from past experience I fear that this is
too much to hope for.
Another feature of income tax I would
like to, stress is the effect of the so-called
arms-length clauses of the act. At the time
of their adoption, when tbey were fully
explained in this chamber by the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden),
some of us took strong objection to tbese
provisions. As far as the western farmer is
concerned tbey are not working out very
well. Let me give an example. Suppose an
elderly farmer, say, between 65 and 70, who
wants to retire, seils bis macbinery and
equipment to bis son. As the parties are flot
at arm's length, the deal is scrutinized very
carefully. The son, let us say, bas depreciated
tbe value of tbe machinery so purchased to
the amount he paid for it. Tben the income
tax officer comes along and says: "You cannot
do that, you are not at arm's length; tbe
depreciated value of that macbinery is tbe
value it bad when you bougbt it." Taugbt
by the experience of bis neigbbour, wbat
does the next farmer do? He bauls bis
macbinery to the local implement agent, who
purchases it, and turns round and seils it
to the son, so avoiding tbe arm's lengtb
provision. It should not be necessary to go
to all that trouble. The same procedure
operates when a farmer selis bis land to bis
son or some other relative. There is no way
of fixing the value for purposes of taxation.
Many people who bave contemplated doing
that kind of thing bave consulted me to find
out how tbey could protect themselves.
"Well," I said, "the director of income tax
will flot belp you; he won't tell you wbetber
the deal you propose would be approved; tbat
is, whetber be tbinks you bave got enougb
for your land. Ahi you can do is get affidavits
from real estate men and others as to tbe
value of your property, and you sbould hohd
'those affidavits, maybe for years, because
you cannot tehh wben some official may corne
ahong and say: "This was a deal flot at arrn's
lengtb; the land was sohd for less than its
value, and you must pay gif t tax on tbe
difference." I shouhd hike to see some method
evohved wbereby a farmer or other person
who makes a deal flot at arm's length can
be sure that it wihl "stand up" and be
approved by tbe taxation authorities of this
,country. I recali a recent case where a soni
made a deah-a bona fide deal-with bis
father, wbo was retiring, to buy bis equipnient. After six years the transaction was
Teopened by the department, which took
exception to the amount of the depreciation,
-with the resuht that tbe party ini question

bas to pay about $5,000 in additional income
tax. If, bowever, tbe father bad sold tbe
equipment to a local deaher, wbo in turn bad
sold it to tbe son, it would bave been treated
as an ordinary sale, and depreciation would
bave been admitted on the basis of the
amount paid for the equipment.
That is ahi I bave to say at the moment
witb regard to income tax.
Tbe Succession Duty Act is soon to be
revised. In my opinion it is too complicated
and too difficult to administer. I doubt
wbether many members of this chamber are
familiar with that statute. It provides an
exemption from succession duties on any
estate under the value of $50,000. In otber
words, no tax is levied if the net value of
an estate does flot exceed $50,000. On tbe
other band, if the net value of the estate
exceeds $50,000-wbetber it be just $51,000
or $52,000-the tax applies to the whole
amount; but no matter wbat tbe amount of
the duty is, the department ahways leaves
tbe estate at heast $50,000. I should hike to
see the act amended so that no tax would
be levied on tbe flrst $50,000 of an estate,
for most of the estate goes to widows and
cbihdren anyway. I feel that the flrst $50,000
should be absolutely tax free.
It must be remernbered that we are living
in a period of inflation, and the Canadian
dollar wihl not buy any more today than
wouhd 50 or 60 cents a few years ago. On
that account the exemption of $50,000 is not
large enough. In my opinion, it shouhd be
increased to $75,000, and I bope that wben
the ýGovernment studies the question it wilh
see fit to extend tbe exemption to tbis
arnount.
Honourable senators, I was appointed to
tbis chamber to represent tbe wheat growers
of the West, and I neyer feel that I have
made a proper or complete speech until I
bave said something about wheat.
Hou. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Last month tbe honourable gentleman frorn Peterborough West
(Hon. Mr. Duffus) gave tbe bouse a fine
address on Red Fife Wbeat. Since that time
I bave read bis speech witb great interest.
I bave ahso read a recent article in the magazine Lifetime Living whicb gives- a complete
story about wheat, and sorne of the remarks
I arn going to make now have been extracted
from that article. I arn not chaiming them
as my own.
Tbe story of wbeat is tbe story of civilization. One acre out of every seven of cultivated land on the earth is sown to wheat.
Wheat occupies more space on the eartb's
surface than do rice and corn, and there are
15,000 known strains or different kinds of

SENATE
wheat. Wheat is the most drought-resistant
cereal plant known to man. Incidentally,
that is my own assertion, for that has been
my experience through many years of farming
and growing wheat in Saskatchewan. Some
people have asked me, "Why don't you raise
cattle or grow oats and barley and go into
mixed farming?" and my reply has been that
if you cannot grow wheat you cannot grow
these other grains. Despite the fact that the
Palliser Triangle enjoys only about seven or
eight inches of rainfall in a summertime, we
farmers of that area are able to grow a
pretty good crop of wheat. I am not speaking
about fringe areas to the north or in Manitoba where barley, oats and other grains are
grown, or about places where there is a
greater rainfall. The farmers of the Palliser
Triangle would go into bankruptcy in a short
time if they went into mixed farming on a
big scale.
Wheat, which as I have said is the most
drought-resistant cereal plant that we know
of, ripens from the Poles to the Equator, from
sea level to even the 11,000-foot Himalayan
slopes. One or more varieties of wheat will
grow successfully in the hottest and coldest
of civilized countries and in some of the
driest.
A large quantity of wheat is grown in
Canada, and not a single moment passes but
wheat is being marketed or harvested in some
part of the world. For example, wheat is
grown in North Africa, Egypt, Turkey, the
Balkans, Belgium, India, and so on. Except
for France, which has been a wheat exporter
from time to time, most of these countries
do not grow more than enough wheat for
their own needs, and sometimes not enough;
and it is to such countries that exporting
countries like Canada, the United States,
Australia, and the Argentine look for markets
for their surplus wheat supplies.
I learned from the article in Lifetime Living
that bread as we know it was accidentally
discovered by a baker in Egypt some 5,000
years ago. Prior to that time the people
mixed flour with water or milk, and baked
something like pancakes. It was not known
that dough would rise, until one day this
baker happened to leave some moist dough
exposed to -some microscopic air-borne yeast.
When he returned he found that the dough
had started to rise, and when he took it out
of the oven he had, instead of one small
pancake, the equivalent of about half a
dozen loaves of bread. From then on the
people of the world baked bread as we know
it today.
Wheat created farms and cities.
We
always say out West that our farmers built
Winnipeg.

Hon. Mr. Howard: There is no doubt about
that.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: There would not have
been any Winnipeg had it not been for the
farmers and the wheat growers of the Prairie
Provinces. I am told that it takes eight
square miles of uncultivated land to support
one hunter, but the same eight square miles
of land, when ploughed and cultivated and
sown, are capable of supporting 6,000 people.
I hope that I am not boring my audience.
Hon. Senators: Go on.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I have some more information that might be of interest. It is
acknowledged that wheat is vital to the
economy of not only Western Canada but of
the whole nation. When we have a good
crop and are able to sell it the Western
farmers can buy machinery, clothing and the
other things they need to live, and thus the
whole country prospers. In the West farmers
could not get along without machinery, and
we could not have produced these great
crops of wheat if it had not been for the
invention of the McCormick reaper. Prior
to that time harvesting was done laboriously
by hand, either with the scythe or the sickle.
Sixty-four man hours used to be required to
harvest one acre, but the McCormick reaper
does the same amount of work in two and a
half hours.
When I was in Italy, a year and a half ago,
I found that farmers were using the old
method of harvesting, and that in a field of
about an acre there would be from ten to
twenty people at work. The women were
using a little sickle to cut the wheat, and
they were tying up the sheaves with stalks
of wheat. Between the cities of Rome and
Florence, all along the coastal plain, we saw
only one binder and one tractor.
I want to make some remarks now about
the different types of wheat, and the difficulties that had to be overcome by cerealists,
government officials and others. The first
enemy that wheat farmers had to contend
with was the Hessian fly. It was followed by
the sawfly, the cutworrn and the wireworm.
Drought and frost have always been destructive. Now we have rust to contend with. At
the turn of the century the Hessian fly destroyed practically all of the crops of the
United States year after year. A man by the
nane of Mark Carleton happened to notice
that certain Mennonite farmers had good
crops, so he went to see them, and found out
that they had got their wheat from Russia.
He went to Russia, brought back samples of
wheat from the Russian plains, and started
to distribute the samples to farmers throughout the United States, with the result that

FEBRUARY

crops were much better. Then he went to
Siberia, and brought back a hardy variety
of Durum wheat, which he distributed to
the farmers of North Dakota, and from that
grew up the macaroni industry in the United
States.
We have all heard about the important
work done by David Fife. The story I was
told was not exactly the same as that told
by the honourable senator from Peterborough
(Hon. Mr. Duffus). My version may be absolutely wrong, but I will relate it as I heard
it. I understood that Red Fife wheat had
its origin in this way: A Scotsman, standing
on the docks in Glasgow, watching a ship
unloading wheat from Poland, caught a hat
full of the wheat out of the spout, and sent
it to David Fife in Ontario. Perhaps from
now on the stories of the honourable senator
from Peterborough and mine will be the
same. David Fife, not knowing this was
winter wheat, sowed it in the spring, and all
died except one or two stalks. They were
saved and from them he developed this
great strain of wheat which became known
as Red Fife, which for many years was responsible for giving the farmers of Ontarioand also, in the early days, the farmers of
Western Canada-good crops of wheat. AIthough it was a good producer, it was a
late variety and therefore subject to frost.
William and Charles Saunders started to
work to find a type of wheat that would ripen
a week or so earlier. Through a letter received
from a missionary in India they learned of
a strain of wheat which grew and ripened
11,000 feet up on the Hirnalayan mountains.
Charles got samples of that grain, known as
Hard Red Calcutta, brought it to Canada and
started to experiment by breeding it with
Red Fife. He had a long, hard struggle, and
at one time, in 1903, he was down to one
stalk, which fortunately he was able to save.
From that stalk he developed the favourite
strain known as Marquis wheat, which ripened six days earlier than Red Fife, and was
also a heavy yielder. In spite of what my
friend from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)
or anybody else may say, the West really grew
up on Marquis wheat. I grew it myself for
twenty years, until the thirties, when rust
started to develop, and from that time we
grew a strain known as Thatcher wheat,
which was developed in North Dakota and
later brought to this country. Most of us
have been growing Thatcher wheat right up
to the present time. But during the last two
years a new form of rust, known as 15-B,
has attacked the wheat crops in Western
Canada. It blows in with a southeast wind
from the United States. The spores come
from the barberry bush. Last year the

16, 1955

southeast winds blew for three months almost
steadily, carried the spores into Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and Alberta, and practically
destroyed the whole of our crops. At any rate,
it was the poorest crop we have grown in the
last twenty years.
To go back a little, I find in the records this
statement, that a man by the name of
McMurachy, at McConnell, Manitoba, not
long ago went into a field of badly rusted
wheat and found one stem that was not
affected. He gave the straw to his daughter,
and she lost it somewhere in the field, but
after a search they found it. He then turned it
over to a cerealist, who crossed it with Exchange and Redman and produced what we
now know as Selkirk, which is almost, though
not entirely, a rust-resistant strain. I saw
some of it growing last summer, and although
it had some rust on the leaf it had none on the
stem. I am told by my honourable leader
that in Manitoba Selkirk produces as much as
thirty bushels to the acre. On the other hand,
Thatcher wheat which we are growing on
better land in Saskatchewan, produced only
about ten bushels to the acre, and that is feed
wheat.
My honourable leader also showed me a
letter from a friend who said he had 3,000
bushels of Selkirk wheat and could not sell it
in Manitoba, because the farmers there had
no money-which is perhaps a little hard to
understand. Of course he could not sell it
across the border in the United States, for
that would contravene the regulations of the
Wheat Board. I suggested that if the Manitoba grower put an advertisement in the
Rosetown Eagle he would have no trouble
selling his wheat up there.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: In spite of the income
tax?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I am not suggesting that
we have reached that stage yet, although
before I conclude my remarks my honourable friend will understand that we are
rapidly approaching it.
The farmers in the Prairie Provinces have
for the most part been prosperous up to the
present moment, because in the years 1950,
1951, 1952 and 1953, they had big crops, and
a surplus was built up. The quota system of
marketing came into effect, and no matter
how close a farmer lived to a town or an
elevator he had no advantage over the farmer
who lived ten or twenty miles away; each
farmer in those years was given a quota of
two, four or perhaps five bushels per acre.
In 1954 the total quota issued to the farmer
was seven bushels, which did not give him an
opportunity to market much wheat and forced
him to fall back on his reserves. However,

SENATE
lie had been able to market a considerable
quantity of 1953 wheat the previous year, and
this enabled him to borrow money at the
bank.
The 1954 crop was badly rusted, gave a
light yield and graded very low. The initial
payment on feed wheat is 80! cents per
bushel. With the four-bushel quota now in
effect, a farmer cannot obtain much money
by selling at 801 cents. For instance, if lie
has a 160-acre farm-and under the quota
system he must take into account his whole
cultivated acreage-he would be able to
market only 640 bushels, which would yield
him slightly over $500. Under those circumstances, the farmers in my part of the country
are something like the farmers referred to by
the honourable senator from Kennebec (Hon.
Mr. Vaillancourt)-their income is going down
and they are getting hard up. However, I
hope their income never falls to the low figure
my honourable friend mentioned.
That, briefly, honourable senators, is the
history of wheat growing which I wished to
bring to the attention of the house.
I should like to register an objection against
the practice of the Government, the newspapers, the grain companies and the wheat
pools of estimating the wheat crop yield about
the first of July each year. Last July, while
we were being flooded out by rain and the
southeast winds were blowing in the rust
spores, I for one was certain we would have
no crop at all. But just at that time out
came the monthly reports from the Government, the newspapers, the grain companies
and pools stating that Western Canada generally was going to have another 600 million
bushel crop. What happened? While prices
were prevented from sagging by reason of
the controls in force, the importing countries
quit buying wheat. They decided that if
Western Canada was to have another 600
million bushel crop, when there was still a
surplus from 1953, and even from 1952, they
would not buy at that time. They did not
buy, and the farmers have not sold much
wheat.
While in Winnipeg in September, I talked
with one of the big grain companies who
sends out such reports, and their first
question to me was, "What is your estimate
of the wheat crop?" I replied, "I would first
like to know what your estimate is". They
gave me their figure, which was below the
Government estimate by 100 million bushels
or so. I said "You are just 100 million
bushels too high", and they laughed at me.
They pointed out that they had reports from
their elevator agents all over the country.
Well, it was not very long until the company
came out with its final report, and their estimate then was considerably lower than mine.

I object to these reports being sent out too
early in the year before an accurate estimate
can be made. They only serve to harm the
whole grain trade seriously.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Would the honourable senator care to give an estimate now
for the coming year, on soil conditions?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I am not that good a
prognosticator.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: But you have had a
lot of experience.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I will say this, that we
have had plenty of moisture. Although we
have not had a heavy snowfall, all the low
spots in Western Canada are still full of water
from last year's rains, and we do not think
we will suffer from lack of moisture. If we
can combat the 15-B rust we might have
another good crop.
These crop reports, about which I have
been talking, frequently contain erroneous
information. We have been told that right
now there is a surplus of some hundreds of
millions of bushels of wheat which have not
been marketed. To a large extent that information is wrong. My understanding is
that there is practically no old wheat in the
province of Manitoba or in the eastern part
of Saskatchewan. While in the area from
which I come there is considerable, the quantity is nothing like what we are led to believe
it is. I noticed that the Winnipeg Free Press,
in its issue of January 31 last, admitted that
the grain on the farms had been overestimated by 611 million bushels.
Hon. Mr. Horner: You can double that
figure.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: As the honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) says,
that is just about half of the over-estimate.
My estimate is that there are not now any
more than 200 million bushels of wheat in
storage on the farms awaiting delivery to the
elevators.
I would call the attention of honourable
senators to an article in yesterday's Montreal
Gazette which gives quite a complete story
of the present wheat situation. According to
that dispatch, in the 1952-53 crop year Canada sold 392 million bushels of wheat; and
in 1953-54-that is, from August 1, 1953 to
July 31, 1954-she sold 288 million bushels,
a decrease of 100 million bushels. The article
goes on to say that there is some improvement in sight for this year, but the predicted
increase in world wheat exports of 5 per cent
over the previous year will not help Canada
very much, because ber exports would still
be not more than those of the previous year,
288 million bushels. To support this the

FEBRUARY 16, 1955
Gazette cited figures showing that from August 1 to December 31 last year Canada exported 117,200,000 bushels of wheat, or 4
million bushels less than the quantity sold
in the corresponding period in the previous
year, whereas during the same time the
United States had an increase in exports of
20 million bushels.
I am hoping that we will be able to sell
all of our surplus wheat at a fair price. Our
price is away below that in the United
States. On February 8, 1955, the price of
wheat at Portal, North Dakota, was $2.25!
per bushel; and just across the border at
North Portal, Saskatchewan, it was $1.23.
The price of $1.23 was for No. 1 wheat, and
represented the initial payment only. The
Wheat Board makes additional payments
from time to time which, after deductions
for transportation and other charges, may
net the farmer a selling price of $1.50 or
$1.60.
Hon. Mr. Horner: There is storage.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Storage has to be deducted before the final figure to the farmer
is arrived at.
We are sorry that apparently the British
market bas been lost-perhaps not entirely,

50437-13

but to some extent-and we hope that it
will be regained. We would press the Government to take all steps possible under the
circumstances to recover that market, because if there is no market for this wheat
the effect upon the economy of Canada will
be very depressing.
For the information of honourable senators, I would say that right now in addition
te wheat stored on the farm, totalling 200
million bushels, the country and terminal
elevators are full, and there is still more
stored in box cars and in the holds of ships
tied up on the Great Lakes until spring.
Honourable senators can see that we still
have a lot of wheat, possibly more than we
can sell, and I therefore press the Government to take whatever steps are possible,
not only to regain the wheat market with
Great Britain but to sell to Japan, the Orient and all other countries where it is possible to find a market for our wheat.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

was adjourned.

PETITIONS FOR PRIVATE
INQUIRY

BILLS

On presentation of petitions:
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, at this
time I should like to ask the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) whether
this is not the last day for the receiving by
the Senate of petitions for private bills.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I must admit that
during the comparatively short period I have
been a member of the Senate I have not
examined our Rules with respect to the time
limit for receiving petitions for private bills.
I have left this matter to others, and therefore I am not in a position to answer my
honourable friend's inquiry.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My information is that
today is the last day for the filing of petitions.
If that is so I want to be assured that no
further divorce petitions will be accepted.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am sure that the
Clerks at the Table are familiar with the
rules, and if this is the last day for filing they
would not be empowered to receive further
petitions after today without a direction from
this house.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is correct.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS

IN REPLY ADOPTED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's

Speech at the opening of the ses-

sion and the motion of Hon. Mrs. Hodges,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Tremblay, for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Charles B. Howard: Honourable senators, at the outset of my remarks may I be
permitted to join with those who have pre-

ceded me in congratulating the mover of
the Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne, the honourable senator from VicI wish to contoria (Hon. Mrs. Hodges).
gratulate not only the honourable lady
herself, but the Province of British Columbia
upon having sent such an illustrious personage to join the galaxy of representatives of
that province who were already in this house.
Hon. Sena±ors: Hear, hear.
(Translation):
Hon. Mr. Howard: I hold in high esteem
the senator from Lauzon (Hon. Mr. Tremblay), who seconded the reply to the speech
from the throne. When I was a youngster,
I had the good fortune of living with his
family at St. Malachie, where his father was
our manager and I know I met then one of
the worthiest French Canadian families that
I have ever known. I rejoiced when my
colleague was elected to represent the riding
of Dorchester in the House of Commons,
where I sat with him, and even more so when
be was appointed to the Senate. He started
at the bottom of the ladder and he has made
his own way to the position he occupies today.
I congratulate him upon his speech and upon
his success.
Hon. Senators:

Hear, Hear.

(Text):
Hon. Mr. Howard: I wish now to say a few
words, with which I am sure everyone in
this house will agree, by way of congratulating the Speakers of the Senate and House of
Commons upon the splendid reception held
in this building in honour of the Queen
Mother during ber visit last November. Never

FEBRUAfRY 17, 1955
ln my thirty years of parliamentary life have
I seen a ceremony better arranged and carried
out.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Howard: I should also like to
thank our good friend the honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald),
and also the Prime Minister, for having
named me as a delegate to the United Nations
during the past year. I am sure all members
of this house join me in the hope that in the
very near future the Western European Union
will become a fait accompli.
May I also say a word or two about the
Honourable Lester B. Pearson, the Secretary
of State for External Affairs? It is sometimes
not considered proper to praise people while
they are living, but after my experience with
Mr. Pearson at the United Nations last year
I want to say that we have in him a man
of whom all Canadians can rightly feel proud.
He knows nearly everybody connected with
the United Nations, comprising some sixty
member nations. He is a diplomat of rare
talents, and a gentleman in the true sense
of the word. In short, wherever he goes he
is an outstanding representative of Canada.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Honourable senators,
the Speech from the 'Throne this session contains something of interest to every single
Canadian citizen, in whatever stratum of life
he may be. However, I intend to confine my
remarks to three of the subjects dealt with in
the Speech.
The first of these is the United Nations,
concerning which the Speech says:
Our country continues to give full support to
the United Nations. The Canadian delegation took
an important part in the deliberations of the recent
meeting of the General Assembly in New York.
It 15 earnestly hoped that the adoption of the
resolution on disarmament
introduced in the
political committee by the Canadian delegation
may lead to agreement on an effective system of
international safeguards.

The second part of the Speech which I will
discuss reads as follows:
During the summer arrangements were completed
to permit the navigational facilities of the St.
Lawrence River to be enlarged and a hydroelectric project to be undertaken in the International Rapids section.

The third subject to which I will refer is
the National Housing Act, 1954. It is not
necessary for me to quote what the Speech
says on this.
Now, dealing with the United Nations, I
will begin by reading from the remarks made
50437-13U

at the opening of the General Assembly by
Canada's Secretary of State for External
Affairs:
This is the ninth year in which we have come
together from all corners of the world to discuss
and try to solve international problems in the hope
which Is not realized often enough that by doing
so we may ease international tensions and promote
human progress.
The United Nations like other human institutions
is developing its own traditions, its own techniques.
It has had Its successes and its failures. Perhaps
a disproportionate amount of attention has been
devoted to the latter, which are indeed not so
much the failure of the United Nations as an
institution as of the peoples and Governments
which make up its membership.

As honourable senators know, the 'United
Nations has been in existence for nine years.
When our good friend the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) was a delegate
to the General Assembly its meetings were,
held some miles out of the city of New York,
but during the last four years the meetings:
have taken place in the new building that
is the permanent home of the United Nations,
The site for the building was donated by
John D. Rockefeller, Jr. It was valued on
the assessment roll of the City of New York
at $6 million, though it was in probably one
of the worst sections of the city. At that time
it was occupied by a number of buildings,
and these were torn down. The land extends
from 48th Street to 42nd Street and from
First Avenue right to the East River; and to
avoid interruption of the view and traffic
congestion, the East Side Drive passes under
the buildings. Also, through traffic has been
taken off First Avenue: it goes underground
at Forty-first Street and emerges at Fortyninth Street. Consequently traffic in front of
the United Nations Buildings is mainly confined to United Nations business. The United
States Government considered that from a
world standpoint it was important that the
meetings of the United Nations should take
place in the United States-a view with
which I entirely 'agree-and therefore it
loaned to the United Nations $65 million for
the construction of the present buildings. As
some of you know, these premises consist of
the auditorium or assembly hall, the conference building, and the quarters for the
Secretariat. Some countries made donations
towards the construction of these buildings.
Canada provided, at a cost of $75,000, the
special nickel alloy entrance doors situate at
the north end of the building. So those who
go as visitors to United Nations headquarters
enter and leave by doors which our country
has donated. There are 3,000 people in the
employ of the Secretariat, which, as is generally known, is headed by the SecretaryGeneral, Dag Hammarskiold. At the present

SENATE
time the membership consists of sixty countries. Twenty-one others have applied for
admission. Because the members of the
Security Council other than Russia would
not consent to admission to the United Nations
of North Korea, Mongolia, and other Communist countries, Russia placed a veto on
the entry of Italy, Japan and some other
states. Therefore none of the twenty-one
countries has been admitted. It rests with
the Security Council to recommend for or
against the admission of any applicant nation,
and only in the Security Council may Russia
or any of the "Big Five" exercise the power
of veto. Otherwise the various issues are
settled on a straight majority vote basis.
This year when President Eisenhower proposed his disarmament and atomic energy
programs, a move was at once made to refer
the proposals to the Security Council; but
this move was blocked by a majority vote and
the proposals were dealt with on their merits
in the General Assembly. Had they gone to
the Security Council the power of veto would
have been applied.
As a member of the "Big Five", China has
a seat on the Security Council, but it so
happens that Formosa China holds the seat,
and Red China will not have anything to do
with the United Nations until Formosa China
is kicked out. It is a question whether Formosa China or Red China should occupy the
seat allotted to China. My personal view is
that both should be given seats. I certainly
would not kick out the Formosa Chinese, and
I would not block admittance of Red China.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I interrupt my
honourable friend to ask him whether the
term "Formosa Chinese" is now being used at
the United Nations to describe the Nationalist
Chinese?
Hon. Mr. Howard: That is right. I have
used the term "Formosa Chinese" to be sure
that we do not confuse Nationalist China with
Red China.
The Security Council consists of eleven
members, five of whom hold permanent seats.
These are the "Big Five"-the United States,
the United Kingdom, Russia, France, and
China. The remaining six member nations
are elected for two-year terms by the General
Assembly and are not eligible for immediate
re-election. Canada served two years on the
council but is not a member at present. Another Commonwealth country is serving on
the council now.
The Security Council meets whenever required to consider a threat of peace; for
example, its members have recently been
called together to discuss the Formosa and
Red China problem.

The Economic and Social Council of the
United Nations consists of sixteen members,
all of which are elected. Canada bas also
served a term on this council, but is not at
present a member. This council meets two
or three times a year.
The United Nations bas many specialized
agencies, the most important of which include the World Health Organization, the
International Labour Organization, and the
Food and Agriculture Organization. These
agencies operate independently in their own
fields but have working agreements with the
United Nations. Canada belongs to all of
them.
It might be said that there are five branches
to the United Nations: the Security Council,
the Economic and Social Council, the General
Assembly, the five Committees, and the
Secretariat.
Each nation is entitled to send five representatives and five alternates to each session
of the General Assembly, the purpose being
that every nation should be represented on
each of the five committees. I shall elaborate
on this later.
Canada's delegation to the Ninth Session of
the United Nations last year, was headed by
the Honourable Lester B. Pearson, as Chairman, and the Honourable Paul Martin, as
Vice-Chairman. An accomplished bilinguist,
Mr. Martin had a fine way of getting on with
some of the adversaries we ran across. Our
other delegates were D. M. Johnson, permanent Canadian representative to the United
Nations in New York; G. D. Weaver, Member
of Parliament for Churchill; Lucien Cardin,
Member of Parliament for Richelieu-Vercheres; Mrs. K. G. Montgomery, Edmonton;
Charles Stein, Q.C., Under-Secretary of State;
K. P. Kirkwood, then of the Department of
External Affairs and now Canada's Ambassador to Egypt; Stuart Hemsley, of the Department of External Affairs, and myself.
Earlier in this debate the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
suggested that Canada should be represented
at the United Nations meetings by members
of all Opposition parties as well as by members of the party in power. Last year, the
Government invited all parties to name parliamentary observers to be attached to the
Canadian delegation, and the following
attended as such: T. H. Ross, M.P., Andre
Gauthier, M.P., A. R. Lusby, M.P., J. L.
MacDougall, M.P., all of the Liberal party;
Roland Michener, M.P., of the Progressive
Conservative party; A. B. Patterson, M.P., of
the Social Credit party; and M. J. Coldwell,
M.P., and Clarence Gillis, M.P., of the C.C.F.
It is my opinion that the number of observers

FEBRUARY 17, 1955
should be increased to include five senators
and at least twenty members of the House
of Commons.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Howard: I would also suggest
that each year new observers be sent, so
that as many Members of Parliament as
possible will be able to see at first hand what
goes on at the United Nations. Sometimes
members of the Senate and of the House of
Commons find difficulty in handling certain
questions, even though we can all speak the
same language. We may differ in our way of
thinking, but when we are unable to agree
upon something we can at least agree to disagree. But the United Nations is made up of
sixty nations, whose representatives speak
a great variety of languages, and when you
walk into a lounge room and hear one group
talking French, another English, another
Chinese, another Spanish, and so on, you
begin to realize that it is very much more
difficult for them to arrive at a common
understanding of things than it is for us. In
the United Nations quite a conglomeration
of peoples have got together to try to do
business, and it takes plenty of time to iron
out the many difficulties, especially when
each committee strives for unanimity in its
reports, which must go to the General
Assembly for approval. In the General
Assembly any single person can disagree
with a committee report and, by a two-thirds
majority vote, the report can be thrown out.
Incidentally, this did not happen last year.
Honourable senators, I want to pay tribute
to our staff at the United Nations. I have
never met a brighter and better informed
group of young men than the Department of
External Affairs officials who make up that
staff. It was the practice for all members of
the Canadian party to meet each morning in
the common room at the Beekman Tower
Hotel, where a representative of each committee would give a report on what had
happened the preceding day. By this means
we were kept completely posted as to what
was going on in the various committees; and
whether you were an observer or a delegate
you had the right to express your opinions
and offer suggestions.
I want to, pay tribute also to the delegates
who went to the San Francisco conference
nearly ten years ago. At that time the
representatives of Canada-my friend the
honourable senator from Kootenay East
(Hon. Mr. King), who is sitting right in front
of me now; the Prime Minister, the Right
Honourable Louis S. St. Laurent, who was
then Minister of Justice; the Honourable
Lester B. Pearson, Mr. M. J. Coldwell, M.P.,

and the late Gordon Graydon, M.P.,--did a
splendid job in helping to create the United
Nations Organization.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Howard: I hold in my hand the
agenda of last year's General Assembly, containing sixty-seven items. The agenda allots
certain items to seven committees of the
Assembly: First Committee, Political; Second
Committee, Economic-on which I was chairman of the Canadian delegation; Third Committee, Social and Humanitarian; Fourth
Committee, Trusteeship and Non-self-governing Territories; Fifth Committee, Administration and Budget; Sixth Committee, Legal; and
a Special (ad hoc) Committee, which is
usually set up each year to share the political
work.
I have before me a list showing the assessments of member countries. The annual net
budget of the United Nations is about $40
million. Each country except the United
States is assessed in proportion to its national
income. The United States, however, which
might pay more than half the budget if
strictly assessed according to its national
income, is limited to 33à per cent of the
budget, because it was decided that no nation
should pay too large a share. In business,
that method is known as a "cut-off". Of
course, if more nations could be admitted to
the United Nations the cost of each country's
contribution would be reduced.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Who determined that cutoff, the United Nations or the United States?
I believe it was the United States which
decided that no country should contribute
beyond 33à per cent, was it not?
Hon. Mr. Howard: That is right. It was
thought at the time that if the United States
were allowed to contiibute its full proportion
of about fifty per cent of the total cost, it
would have too much to say in the affairs of
the United Nations, and for that reason the
cut-off of 33J per cent was stipulated.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Are not some of the countries in arrears?
Hon. Mr. Howard: None at the present time.
In 1955 Canada will be paying 3-63 per cent
of the United Nations' budget, or roughly
$1,400,000. The U.S.S.R. pays 15.08 per cent,
or more than four times as much as Canada.
The United Kingdom pays 8-85 per cent.
Thus, Russia pays almost twice as much
as the United Kingdom. It might be of
interest to honourable senators to know that
the Canadian payment averages just over
ten cents per year for each citizen. The percentages given do not include contributions

SENATE
nade through the United Nations to voluntary programs of relief and assistance to
under-developed countries, to which all the
countries pay as much or as little as they
wish. Canada has a very good record of
voluntary contributions. For example, so far
Canada has paid $74 million to the United
Nations Korean
Reconstruction
Agency,
approximately $3M million to the United
Nations Agency for Palestine Refugees,
nearly $9 million to the United Nations Children's Fund, and $3,400,000 to the United
Nations Technical Assistance Program for
Under-developed Countries. The Technical
Assistance Program was dealt with by the
honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McKeen) the other evening.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask the honourable
senator a question? Do the figures for Russia
include the Ukraine and all the Soviet
Socialist Republics?
Hon. Mr. Howard: The percentages do not
include the amounts of money contributed to
the various relief organizations. The money
which Canada has paid, in most cases, has
been used for the purchase of supplies in
Canada for shipment to other countries.
Honourable senators will be interested to
know why Canada stands so high in the
estimation of other nations. We are apt to
boast about our country-our people and our
natural resources, and all the good things we
possess. It is natural for the people of any
country so richly endowed to do so. However,
there is a very special reason for Canada's
position in world affairs today. Any country
dominated or controlled by another is likely to
be aroused to antagonism, even if the controlling country is doing its best to help. For
instance, Great Britain has done a wonderful
job in raising the standard of living of countries under her control, but a feeling of antagonism has sometimes been shown toward her.
Canada has never controlled any other country, and that fact has put us in a preferred
light in the eyes of the other Commonwealth
countries. The United States, on the other
hand, has incurred disfavour-but for only
one reason; that is, jealousy. Of the sixty
nations comprising the UN, let us not forget
that fifteen are "donor" nat.ons and forty-five
are "taker" nations. It is not surprising
therefore, that it is hard to get agreement among them all on some of the most
important questions at issue. There can be
no doubt that while the United States has
been very liberal, the under-developed countries are highly jealous of that country.
Let me relate an incident that illustrates
Canada's favoured position. When the question of disarmament arose at the United
Nations, Russia proposed that it be referred to

the Security Council, and that proposal was
voted down. Then the United States and the
other "donor" nations had a conference to
decide which country should sponsor an
acceptable resolution. The United States representative said that if he did so, some other
countries would not like it. The United Kingdom representative felt that he was in a
similar position. Finally, it was agreed that
if Canada was chosen as sponsor, the resolution would "go over." As a matter of fact,
it did "go over." Canada sponsored the resolution, and when the question was put to a
vote, Russia voted with us for the first time
in the nine years that the United Nations has
been in existence.
Turning briefly to the East Asian situation,
may I say to my honourable friend from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), that I disagree
entirely with the thoughts he expressed here
a few days ago. I concur in what was said
by the honourable member from St. John's
West (Hon. Mr. Pratt) and the honourable
member from St. John's (Hon. Mr. Baird).
Honourable senators, we must try to understand the thinking of the East Asian people.
They do not think as we do, and for that
reason we cannot deal with them on the
same basis as we can with, shall I say, the
Christian nations. But any country that has
the necessary money and power behind it
can deal with the East Asians, for they understand force and nothing else.
I think the whole world should congratulate the President of the United States, who
went before both houses of the Congress
and secured almost unanimous approval to
move the Seventh Fleet in between Formosa
and Red China in order to prevent either
side from starting to fight. That was one of
the most progressive steps towards peace in
our time.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Howard: With the force that is
now being displayed, I think we shall be
able through diplomatic channels to get an
agreement for peace.
To my way of thinking, there are three
main causes of war: narrow nationalism,
differences of religion, and differences of
language. Until my recent visit to the United
Nations I had not realized the far-reaching
effect of religious and language differences.
As honourable senators know. I come from
a section of Canada where the population is
for the most part made up of English Protestants and French Catholics. In that area
each group has every respect for the religion
of the other; and we understand each others'
language and get along very well together.
But the situation is entirely different when

FEBRUARY 17. 1955
we get into world affairs, involving saine 150
languages, perhaps twenty of which are
spoken at the United Nations, althaugh only
some five of them are translated.
The greatest preventives of war, in my
opinion, are the strength of the United
Nations, diplomacy, and the power we have
developed thraugh NATO countries, whîch I
might cali the "donor"' cauntries. I arn sure
that the hanourable senator froin Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) will agree that when he
holds trump cards in a bridge garne he can
play rnuch more comfartably than when he is
holding poor cards. In ather words, if you
have power bebind you, you can negotiate
with other countries more easily than if you
lack power.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I don't play bridge very
well even wben I hold good cards.
Hon. Mr. Howard: I shauld like ta mention
some of the problems which. I encouintered
while at the United Niations, and which will
no doubt be met with by future delegates. I
would mention first the Cyprus question. As
honourable senatars know, Great Britain was
the protector of the Suez Canal since its
construction nearly ninety years ago; she
,stood as a bulwark of strength and fair play,
and allowed free access ta the canal by ships
frorn every nation of the world. But she
was obliged ta withdraw frorn Egypt, and
ceased ta be a protectar of the Canal Zone.
With the change of events she found it necessary, in her awn interests and that of the
world generally, ta establish a base as close
ta the canal as passible so as ta meet possible
trouble in the future. Cansequently, Britain
toak control of Cyprus, an island with a
p)opulation of about 200,000 Moslems and
300,000 Greeks. The Greeks wanted ta have
the British witbdraw and the island turned
over ta thern. Naw, Cyprus, situated as it
is off the caast of Lebanon and Palestine, is
a long way from Greece and still fartber frorn
Great Britain, but is the closest point at
which Britain can locate a base ta pratect
the Suez Canal. I mention that ta illustrate
the type of seriaus prablem. that cornes befare
the United Nations for its decisian.
Another question which demanded aur
seriaus tbought was that of West New Guinea.
As honourable senators know, that country
has been a protectorate under Dutch contrai
for many years. It has been developed ta the
stage wbere its people naw have an impraved
standard of living, but it is not advancing
fast enougb ta suit them. and they wauld like
Australia
to get free of Dutch control.
objected to the proposai, because it would
like West New Guinea ta rernain with Dutch
Indanesia, and ta jaîn, shall I say, the
Indonesian group.

The committee of which I was a member
discussed at saine length the functions of
SUNFED-the Special United Nations Fund
for Economie Development of underdeveloped
countries. We ail know that when rnoney is
borrowed by an individual it sometimes becornes difficuit. for any number of reasons, for

when pressure is used ta force collection it

advanced money to a certain country, and
because of a decline in exports or a drap in
the price af the products of that country it
has been unable ta meet its interest payments.
Incidentally, a couple of cases of that type
are being consîdered at the present time. As
1 have said, any attempt ta force the collection of arrears soan creates hard feelings.
It was suggested by sorne of the forty-five
"taker" countries that inquiry should be made
ta find out whether the "'donor" countries
would be willing ta participate in interestfree loans ta "taker" countries which were
willing ta help themselves. 0f course many
difficulties can arise in such transactions.
For instance the barrowing cauntry might not
permit repayment ta the lending country at
the time agreed upon. It was argued, and
rightly so, that money used ta raise the
standard of living in under-developed cauntries would create a market for products of
Canada, the United States and other advanced
cauntries. That was a seriaus question which
involved the turne of the committee far six
weeks.
It should always be remernbered that despite the fact that the United States contributes
33à per cent of the United Nations budget,
she has no more ta say than a small country
such as Yernen. Incidentally, when I walked
inta the United Nations Assembly I noticed
on a desk a card bearing the naine "Yemen",
a country I had neyer heard of. I consulted
the rnap and learned that it is a small kingdam in Arabia, situated nat far froin the Red
Sea. Thaýt little country, as I say, has its
voice, just as have the bigger countries, in
the business of the United Nations. When the
General Assembly opens, each nation has a
right ta speak, and very often one has ta
listen for days ta representations made by
one country. Fartunately, any delegate has
only ta turn a switch at bis seat to get a
simultaneaus translation in his own language
of a speech being made in a foreign tangue.
I have perhaps tired honourable senatars
by my lengthy remarks about the affairs of
the United Nations, so I will turn ta my next
topic, the St. Lawrence Seaway develapment.
in speaking of that great developinent we
hear many people say that it shauld have

SENATE
been started years ago. No doubt that is
true, but let us face the isue. We have
2,200 miles of continuous waterway from the
Strait of Belle Isle to the head of the Great
Lakes, in the heart of Canada and the United
States, yet because of the lack of development
of a sixty-five mile section in the St. Lawrence
River it has not been possible to have through
shipping for deep-sea vessels. But in discussing the project today, we should remember
that every great work that has been achieved
in Canada-such as the construction of the
Canadian Pacific and the Canadian Northern
railways and the development of the Westhas been undertaken in a period of prosperity.
With the growth of the iron ore mining now
going on in Ungava and the kudos that Canada is getting from it, and with the construction of the St. Lawrence Waterway, I firmly
believe that we shall continue to enjoy the
prosperity that we have had during the past
ten years, and that for once-and perhaps
from now on-it will be prosperity that was
not created by a war. I therefore congratulate the Government on having undertaken
the great seaway project, and on being
successful in having the United States join
with us. An undertaking of such magnitude
at this time will greatly improve the employment situation in Canada.
Honourable senators, may I conclude with
a few words concerning the housing situation. Without being in any way boastful, I
may say that years ago I had the idea that
it would be a great thing for Canada if more
people owned their own homes. However, the
down payment was the big obstacle. At that
time a $5,000 house could not be built without an initial payment of at least $1,500 or
$2,000. I had the idea that if a prospective
home-builder was known to be reliable, a
down payment was not necessary. After all,
in the business of my honourable friend from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), and to some
extent in my business, the moral risk is an
element to be considered above any other.
I have made it a rule that if a man has been
employed for five years on the same job, and
is getting a certain salary, he must therefore be rated as steady and a good worker.
The houses that I built were financed by
money borrowed from a trust company at 7
per cent interest. Today, thirty years later,
we are almost at the same stage, except that
the Government is handling the situation.
Out of the fifty houses that I built, only two
were turned back, and in each case because
the breadwinner took sick and died and his
family were unable to continue the payments.
If I were again to undertake the building
of houses I would require-and I say this
by way of a suggestion to the Government

in connection with its housing developments
-a self-liquidating insurance policy covering
the balance of the payments. Then if a homeowner were to die at any time after moving
into his house and before he had fully paid
for it, the balance owing would be paid by
the insurance company. The amount of the
risk would decrease annually until the home
was paid for either by the home-owner, if
he lived, or, if he did not, by the insurance
company. Make no mistake, honourable
senators, the housing legislation brought in
by the present Government and administered
by the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, including the methods of financing,
constitutes some of the most beneficial legislation ever enacted. However, I was sorry
when I read in the press yesterday that the
interest rate on mortgage loans had been
lowered to only 51 per cent instead of to
5 per cent. Construction of homes creates
employment, and increases the number of
home-owners, and is thereby a deterrent to
communism. It would be difficult to overestimate the importance of all this to Canada
at the present time.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Would the honourable
senator be good enough to enlarge on the
statement he made regarding payments by
Russia to the United Nations' budget? He
stated that Russia paid four times as much
as Canada. I wonder if that is so in fact.
Can he give us the basis of assessment of the
various countries?
Hon. Mr. Howard: The contribution by a
country to the United Nations' budget is
based on its gross national income and total
population. For example, Canada's gross
national product last year amounted to $23
billion, and our contribution was based on
that income. I gave the house Canada's percentages, which in dollars and cents last
year amounted to $1,400,000, or an equivalent
of 10 cents per person per year.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Is it not a fact that Canada's contribution or assessment is the
largest per capita of any member of the
United Nations?
Hon. Mr. Howard: That may be true, because the basis of calculation is the total
population and national income. A country
with a high population and a low gross
national income naturally would pay less
per capita than is paid by Canada, which has
a high national income and a low population.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Will the honourable
senator permit a question? Am I right in
assuming that the percentage he has reported
for Russia this year is a considerable increase
over what it was four or five years ago.

FEBRUARY 17, 1955
My impression is that Russia's contribution
to the United Nations was very much below
what one might have expected in view of
ber population and wealth. When I was at
the United Nations in 1947-if I may enlarge
for a moment-Canada contributed something
like 3.4 per cent of the total budget, and today
it is 3.6 per cent. In addition we paid our
share for the special agencies and special
causes to which the honourable senator
referred. I think it is still true that Russia
is not paying a fair proportion of the United
Nations' budget in relation to ber total population and national wealth.
Hon. Mr. Howard: I have given the bouse
all the information that I possess on this
matter.

PETITIONS FOR PRIVATE BILLS
ANSWER TO INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
may I be permitted to revert to the question
which was raised by the honourable Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) with
respect to the last day for submission of
petitions for private bills? I have had an
opportunity of looking up the rules ;and I find
that Rule 110 provides that:
Petitions for private bills shall only be received
by the Senate if filed with the Clerk of the
Senate within the first six weeks of the session.
I have been in touch with the Clerk, and
he informs me that, as the Leader of the

Opposition suggested, this is the last day for
receiving these petitions.
Probably honourable senators will be interested in the latter part of the rule, which
states:
.no motion for the suspension of this standing
order shall be entertained unless a report has been
first made by the Committee on Standing Orders
recommending such suspension.

On the motion to adjourn:
Hon. John T. Haig: I would ask the indulgence of the house to make a statement: if

remarks made by the honourable senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) and the
honourable senator from Halifax-Dartmouth

Hon. Mr. Haig: All I ask the honourable
senator to do is to inform the appropriate
departmental officials that this question has
been raised and, on their authority, to assure
us that the figures he quoted are correct.

DIVORCE STATISTICS
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Divorce: Honourable
senators, I beg to present a number of petitions for divorce, and I will use the opportunity to give some figures which may perhaps
be of interest.
As honourable senators are aware, the time
for filing petitions expired on February 17.
The number actually filed up to that date was
472, considerably more than when I made my
previous report. Up to the present moment
we have heard and recommended 207 petitions; two have been rejected, five have been
withdrawn, four have been partially heard,
and 254 are now pending.
I may say that an additional 35 petitioners
have published notice of intention, but as no
petitions have yet been filed by them their
cases will not come before us at the present
session.
Hon. Mr. Vien: May I ask the honourable
gentleman if he has statistics with respect to
the number of divorce applications being
heard by the provincial courts?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not have such
statistics with me.

REPORTS OF COMMITTE

INTERNATIONAL TRADE
NOTICE OF MOTION
Hon. A. Neil McLean: Honourable senators,
with leave of the Senate I beg to move:
That the Standing Committee on Canadian Trade
Relations be empowered ta inquire into and report
on:
1. What, in their opinion might be the most
practical steps ta further implement article 2
of the North Atlantic Treaty whereby the signatories ta that document agreed that: "They will
seek ta eliminate conflict in their international
economic policies and will encourage economic
collaboration between any or all of them."
2. That notwithstanding the generality of the
foregoing,
the committee
be
instructed
and
empowered ta consider and report upon how, in
their opinion,
(a) any project for developing economic collaboration specifically between the countries which
are signatories of the North Atlantic Treaty, can be
co-ordinated with the trade policies of other
countries of the free world;
(b) any project for developing economic collaboration
between
the countries which are
signatories of the North Atlantic Treaty, might
have the same degree of permanence that is contemplated in the twenty year military obligation
under article 5 of the treaty whereby "the parties
agree that an armed attack against one or more
of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all".
3. That the committee be empowered ta extend
an invitation ta those wishing ta be heard, including representatives of agriculture, industry, labour,
trade, finance and consumers, ta present their
views, and that the committee also be empowered
ta hear representatives from business interests or
individuals from any of the NATO countries who
might wish ta be heard.
4. That the committee be empowered to send for
persans, papers and records, and ta secure such
services as may be necessary for the purpose of the
inquiry.

I may say honourable senators that this
is exactly the same motion I placed before
the house last year, and it was adopted
unanimously. That is the reason I am presenting it to the Senate tonight without
notice. If there is any objection I will be
very glad to have it considered as a notice of
motion.

LIBRARY OF PARLIAMENT BILL
SECOND READING

As I have said, that recommendation was
unanimously concurred in and adopted by
both houses.
The bill is composed of four clauses. Clause
1 provides for appointment of a Parliamentary
Librarian and an Associate Parliamentary
Librarian. I think I am right in saying that
provision for the use of official languages has
never been spelled out in any statute in exact
detail; and so the wording of the Joint Committee's recommendation was much more
specific than is the wording of this bill. But
the intention is, as I understand it, to follow
the conventions of Parliament under which
the equality of the two official languages is
recognized. Whenever the mother tongue of
the Librarian is English, that of the person
appointed to be Associate Librarian will be
French, and vice versa.
Honourable senators, the bill really makes
no other change in connection with the
operation of the Library, which is carried
on under rules and regulations agreed upon
jointly by the Speaker of the Senate and the
Speaker of the House of Commons, supported

Hon. Norman P. Lamberi moved the second and concurred in, wherever possible, by the

Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I am
sorry indeed that I was unable to attend the
meeting of the joint committee the other
day. I would like to ask the honourable

FEBRUARY 22. 1955
gentleman from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
a question regarding the library, and perhaps not directly related to the bill itself. My
question is this: At the meeting was any
information given as to when we might expect
the library to be finished? I ask that because
I am told that these Parliament Buildings
took three years to build, and it looks to me
as if the renovation of the library alone
will take three years.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: In reply to my honourable friend, I can only say that at the committee meeting last June, just before prorogation, this very question was brought up,
and owing to grave delays, which were increased by the unfortunate collapse of the
floor, it was estimated that it would be a year
and a half before the work could be completed
and the books transferred from the temporary quarters to the renovated library. At
a meeting of -the same joint committee last
week that question was brought up again,
and the best advice that could be given to the
committee was the same as that expressed last
June, namely, that completion would not be
possible for a year and a half.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, may
I ask if it would not be advisable to have
this bill referred to the Banking and Commerce Committee, so that certain persons
could be asked to come and give us the
information we require? I do not think we
should be tied down to a report of a committee which we only partly control. If anyone
were to ask me when the library would be
finished, I could not tell him, from what I
have heard tonight. If the proper persons
were called before our Banking and Commerce Committee they could answer the
question put by the honourable senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), and
inform the rest of us as well.
Hon. Mrs. Wilson: Honourable senators, I
attended the committee meeting last week,
and I regret to say that I was the only
senator present, although many other senators are members of the committee. I
understood from a report presented at the
meeting that the library would be ready in
January 1956; but of course, with the usual
delays, it might not be possible to move back
into the library before April of that year.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I should like to comment
on the request of the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig). This is a Government bill,
and if the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) wishes to grant the request
of my honourable friend and have this bill
referred to the Banking and Commerce Committee, or any other comnittee, I would be
agreeable; but personally I do not think it

should be necessary to do so, in view of the
information that was given and the full
opportunity that the members of this house
had to study the subject last June. The representation of the Senate on the joint committee
of both houses was then able to acquaint
itself intimately with what was going on.
To refer the bill to committee now would in
my opinion be just needless repetition, and
I think the Senate should confront itself with
things that are more necessary at this tme.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators, I
understood my honourable friend from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) to say that at
the meeting of the committee held last week
it was estimated that the library would not
be completed for still another year and a half.
I hope the committee will not keep on estimating the library will take a year and a
half to complete. I am reminded of the fellow
who was running along a road and at every
turn thought he was getting close to his
destination. But when he made the turn
he always found that he still had farther to
go than what he had first thought was the
total distance.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I suggest that the
question when the library will again be
occupied is quite out of order in connection
with this bill. If such information is sought,
the answer can definitely be obtained by having an inquiry placed on the Order Paper, for
I am quite sure that the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) would be
only too glad to get that information from
the Department of Public Works.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Honourable senators, I do
not intend to refer to the repairs to the library
or the report of last June. The bill makes
mention of the Speakers of the two houses,
but I understand that in recent years the
library was to a great extent under the jurisdiction of the House of Commons. I would
like to ask the honourable senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) under what department or minister the Library of Parliament operates at the present time.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Since I have had anything to do with the joint committee, as a
humble member of it, along with other members appointed from this house, the Speakers
of both houses have been joint chairmen, and
they have assumed the responsibility of preparing the agendas of all the meetings and of
having a complete hearing of the views on
any subject which came up for consideration
by the committee.
As far as ministerial responsibility Is concerned the Library of Parliament has always
been responsible, through this source, to the
office of the Prime Minister. There is no

SENATE
change in that status today. The minister Who
attended the last two meetings as a liaison
officer between the Library and the Prime
Minister's office has been the Honourable
J. W. Pickersgill, Minister of Citizenship and
Immigration, who is also directly responsible
for the National Library as well. In brief, my
answer to the honourable senator is that the
Prime Minister's office is responsible for the
affairs of the Library of Parliament, and that
the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration
is the liaison minister between the two.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I have
asked a question, but I have not yet spoken on
this subject. May I first say that I am surprised that the honourable senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) should object to
this bill being referred to a committee.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I merely said that it
was for the Leader of the Government to say
whether or not it should be referred.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My point is that any member of the bouse may ask that a bill be
referred to a committee. If the Leader of the
Government objects and the majority of the
bouse are behind him, that is the end of it;
but throughout my experience here, whenever an honourable member bas asked that a
bill be referred to committee, the Government have always agreed. And why should
they not agree in this case? They have
nothing to fear!
It is of some concern to our people to see
the functions of the library scattered around
in various buildings, and the library building
apparently now no nearer completion than it
was a year ago. For my part, I should like
to have the Librarian come and tell us why
it is necessary to have a Chief Librarian and
an Associate Librarian. I am sure he bas good
reasons for the proposals, but a committee
of this bouse should hear them.
I would certainly have objected to the joint
committee's report being passed by this bouse
last session if certain information had been
before us at that time. Since an explanation
was not given then I now ask the Government
to allow this bill to be referred to a committee. If they do not wish to accede to
that request, I cannot force them to do so.
I think that the Senate, of all bodies, should
examine this bill in every detail. We in this
bouse are not so busy that we cannot do it.
Indeed, the cry outside the chamber is that
we do not do enough, while in the chamber
it is that we have nothing to do. Yet,. when
I ask the sponsor of this bill to have it
referred to a committee, he replies that that
is unnecessary. I am not a member of the
Joint Committee on the Library, as is the
honourable senator from Ottawa, and I do
not have the detailed information which he

bas. With his extensive kndOßi€&ge and experience, he is undoubtedly better qualified
than I to judge as to the needs off the library.
However, in my humble opinion, the reconstruction work is taking a long time, and I
would like to ask what is happening in the
meantime. I happen to know that there is
quite a campaign on to have something done
with respect to the handling of newspapers
and periodicals which come to Parliament.
That matter bas come to my attention because
it affects me personally, and I have a right
to know of it.
I would remind honourable senators that it
is now only the middle of February and the
end of the session is some months off. Therefore, we have no need to hurry our consideration of any subject that cornes before us.
If, for instance, the honourable senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) wants to
obtain some information about the library, by
all means give him a chance to ask for it. If
there is a good reason for what is being proposed in this bill, let us hear that reason.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: May I ask the honourable senator who moved second reading of
the bill (Hon. Mr. Lambert) if the Parliamentary Librarian and the Associate Parliamentary Librarian are appointed by the Civil
Service Commission, as I presune the rest
of the staff are.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators, I
do not wish to evade the question that has
been asked, but I should like ta point out
that the appointment of personnel to the
library or any place else does net concern us in our consideration of this
bill. That is a responsibility of the executive branch of Parliament and of the Government. The bill provides a desirable and
advisable change in the set-up of the Library of Parliament, namely, that there be
one head instead of two. The Chief Librarian
will ordinarily be in charge, and the Associate
Librarian will act in his place when the Chief
Librarian is ill or absent for any other reason.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Honourable senators, there
are two classes of persons employed in the
Library of Parliament. The Librarians have
the status of deputy ministers, and as such are
appointed by order in council and do not
come under the Civil Service Act; all other
employees of the library function under the
Civil Service Commission.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Thank you. That is
what I wanted to know.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I am sorry I did not
fully answer the question asked by the honourable senator from Fredericton (Hon. Mrs.
Fergusson). I should like to say that the
library personnel is composed of thirty-five

FEBRUARY 22, 1955
temporary clerks appointed jointly by the
Speakers of the two houses and twenty-seven
permanent civil servants who come under the
Civil Service Act. That is, of a total staff of
sixty-two, twenty-seven come under the Civil
Service Commission, and the rest do not.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I did not understand the honourable senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) to say that
the bill could not be referred to a committee,
but rather that he saw no reason for doing so
since the purposes of the bill were set forth
clearly in the bill itself.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: And that the report of
the joint committee was adopted last session.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not see how the
question of when the library building will be
finished comes up for consideration under this
bill. Certainly the bill does not provide funds
for completion of the building, nor has it
anything to do with that. I quite agree with
the honourable senator from Ottawa, that the
bill,sets forth its purposes quite clearly and
it is not necessary to refer it to a committee.
I shall inquire from the Department of
Public Works when it is expected that the
library will be finished, and give this information to the house tomorrow.

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, the question is on the second reading
of Bill B, an Act to amend the Library of
Parliament Act. Is your pleasure to adopt
the motion?
Some Hon. Senators: Carried.
Hon. Mr. Haig: On division.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: On division.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time, on division.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
-senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would point out, honourable senators, that without the consent of the
house it cannot receive third reading tomorrow, and I refuse to give my consent.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Thursday.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
by Thursday I shall endeavour to have information from the Department of Public Works
as to the possible date of completion of the
library, and any other general information I
can get on the matter.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

May I point out that I do not know of any
reason for believing that Mr. Felix Desrochers

ago the other librarian, Mr. F. A. Hardy, was
very ill and it was expected that he would
be the librarian to retire first. So it is not
known which of the two will retire first.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Nor who will die first.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Nor who will die
first. That would be a compulsory retirement.
Then the report goes on to say:
Hardy's assistant, R. M. Hamilton, a veteran of
the library staff, would not move up, however,
because of the language division defined in the new
bill.

May I also say that the new bill does not

The report is completely unfounded, and has
nothing ta do with anything which was said
in aur debate last night. It is a diabolical
attempt ta misrepresent what was said here
last night. It is completely unfair ta my
hanaurable calleague, the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), because it implies
that he opposed the bill an the graund that
its pur-pase was ta catapuit ta the top position
in the Library a former private secretary of
the Prime Minister af thîs country. In past
years a repart of this kind wauld have been
sufficient basis, in the other hause, for the
writer ta be summoned ta the Bar af the
bouse and asked for an explanatian af the
matter. I personally repudiate the repart,
for which the British United Press is respansible, root and stem, and I would expeet my
hanourable leader who represents the governent in this bouse ta do the same, because,
as I have said, there is flot a word of truth
in it. Taday it will be broadcast from twentyseven private stations whose news service is
furnished by the British United Press. The
reporter of that press service was in the
gallery hast evening, recording aur proceedings. These objectionable statements have
already been made over the radia; they will
go also ta the newspapers which use the B.U.P.
service; and undoubtedly before this time

have had the daubtful pleasure af reading

of grain in the Prairie provinces, but there
is now a large movement of feed grain from
those three provinces to the rest of Canada.
The reduction in subsidies is based on new
freight rates to different parts of the country,
and the Maritime provinces will in future
receive the same assistance as in the past.
The assistance to the provinces of Quebec
and Ontario on feed grains will be reduced
by $1.50 per ton.
Until the Order in Council became
effective, British Columbia received higher
subsidies than eastern provinces did on the
transportation of feed grains from the Prairie
provinces, for the special purpose of developing her dairy farming, poultry production
and hog breeding operations. Under the new
arrangement, after the deduction of the
federal subsidy, the part of the freight rates
payable by the farmers of the Maritime provinces, Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia
will be the same, namely, $5.
The purpose of the original subsidies has
been achieved, namely, that of moving surplus grain from the Prairie provinces to
other parts of Canada. True, the reduction
in assistance seems to bear more heavily on
British Columbia, but, as I have said, that
province formerly received more generous
assistance, for the reason I have stated.
DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL
CAUSES BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. W. M. Aseltine moved the second
reading of Bill 0-6, an Act respecting
divorce and matrimonial causes.
He said: I crave the indulgence of honourable senators while I attempt to explain this
rather important bill. At the outset may I
say that I am not unaware of the fact that
in this chamber there are a number of
honourable senators who are absolutely
opposed to divorce in any form. I appreciate
their view, but I should like to point out that
this is not a bill having to do with the
institution of divorce. We have divorce in
this country, and have had for many years.
The bill now before us has to do with the
grounds which the courts of our country shall
consider to be grounds for the dissolution of
marriage. Therefore, during the debate I
should like honourable senators to keep in
mind that we are discussing whether the
grounds for divorce should be extended, and
not the principle of divorce.
This bill would be twofold in its effect.
As honourable senators know, in Canada we
really have no general law of divorce of our
own except that which we have adopted from
the English law. We have, however, passed

two or three statutes dealing with divorce,
which statutes I shal discuss later. If Parliament passes this bill it will constitute the
divorce law for the domin1on of Canada.
That would be one effect.
The second effect would be this: that in
addition to the present ground for divorce,
namely, adultery, there would be three other
grounds, which I shall discuss at greater
length later in my remarks.
I should perhaps give honourable senators
and the public at large some historical background of this subject. I would refer honourable senators to the explanatory notes opposite page one of the bill, most of which I
should like to incorporate in my speech, so
that members of the public who read the
report in Hansard will have these facts before
them. These explanatory notes are as follows:
The only courts in Canada to which the Act
applies are the courts which now have jurisdiction
to decree divorce.
A court in Prince Edward Island has had that
right since 1835 as the term "divorce" was then
understood.
A court in Nova Scotia has had that right since
1758.
A court in New Brunswick has had that right
since 1791.
No court has that right in Quebec.
A court in Ontario has had that right since
1930.
A court in Manitoba has had that right since
1870.
Courts in Saskatchewan and Alberta have had
that right since 1905. Before then the right was
inchoate in the N.W. Territories. Hence the right
of Saskatchewan and Alberta, although these provinces were only formed in 1905, is to the divorce
law of England as of 1870.
A court in British Columbia has had that right
since 1858.
No court has that right in Newfoundland.
Prince Edward Island now exercises its right
under its own act of 1835 by virtue of section 129,
B.N.A. Act.
Nova Scotia, under the same authority, now
exercises its right under its own act of 1866.
New Brunswick also operates under its own
preconfederation act of 1860.
Ontario operates under dominion act, chapter 85
of the Revised Statutes of 1952.
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta operate
under the terms of the respective acts of 1870
and 1905 which erected them into provinces. The
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council bas confirmed their right, which extends to the divorce
law of England as of 1870.

extends to that
as in force in

under a proclamation of Governor
in 1858, which, it has been held,
province the divorce law of England
1858.

I should like, honourable senators, to present some further historical background. It
will be remembered that prior to 1857, when
the English divorce law was passed, divorce
applications were made to the Ecclesiastical
Courts, which had sole control over such
matters, and granted divorce a mensa et

FEBRUARY 23, 1955
thoro-that is, from bed and board. A petitioner who was successful in obtaining a
judgment of this kind from the Ecclesiastical
Courts was then obliged to sue the adulterer
in court for damages; and if he succeeded in
securing a judgment for damages he made a
petition to the House of Lords for a decree.
That was the procedure prior to 1857.
However, the Matrimonial Causes Act,
which was passed in England in 1857, provided for only one ground of divorce, namely
adultery. Under that act a woman could not
secure a divorce from her husband unless
besides proving adultery she could also prove
cruelty on the part of her husband. It was
not until the present century that women
were placed on the same footing as men as
regards grounds for divorce.
That law of England remained in effect
until 1937, in spite of the fact that a Royal
Commission which was set up in 1908 to
Investigate the whole matter of divorce
recommended to the British Parliament in
1912 that in the future adultery should not
be the only ground, but that there should be
four additional grounds.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
senator how residents of Ontario secured
divorces before 1930?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: In 1930 Parliament conferred divorce jurisdiction upon the Supreme
Court of Ontario, and since then Ontario has
been carrying on under that act.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And before that, Ontario
residents came to Parliament to petition for
divorce.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes. Prior to 1930 all
divorces granted ta residents of Ontario were
parliamentary divorces.
The next step in Britain was the Matri-monial Causes Act of 1937, which was introduced by Colonel A. P. Herbert. Many
senators have no doubt read his book Holy
Deadlock, which illustrated better than any-thing else I ever heard of the farce that
persisted in Britain as regards grounds for
divorce prior to the passing of that act. It
was the public reception of this book which
encouraged him to introduce his bill in 1937.
I would like to read the preamble to that
bill:
Whereas it is expedient for the true support of
marriage, the protection of children, the removal
of hardship, the reduction of illicit unions and
unseemly litigation, the relief of conscience
amongst the clergy, and restoration of due respect
for the law, that the Acts relating to marriage and
divorce be amended: . . .

'The bill did not meet with any serious
opposition in either house of Parliament. It

was approved by members of the House of
Commons and of the House of Lords, including bishops, and by others.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Would the honourable
senator qualify the word "bishops"?
Hon.

Mr.

Roebuck:

Bishops

of

what

denominations?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I think they were
Anglican bishops. I will read later from a
statement made by the Lord Bishop of Birmingham to the House of Lords, to illustrate
what I have been trying to say.
I would like to point out to honourable
senators at this stage that the British North
America Act, section 91, gives the federal
Parliament full jurisdiction over marriage
and divorce. In 1925 Parliament passed an
act which gave the wife the same grounds
for divorce as the husband. In 1930 the
Divorce Jurisdiction Act was passed, and
under that act if a husband has deserted his
wife for two years or more and has acquired
domicile in another province she may sue
him for divorce, provided that immediately
prior to the desertion he was domiciled in
the province in which the proceedings are
commenced. Also in 1930 Parliament passed
the statute which gave Ontario the right to
set up its own divorce court.
As I said before, Canada has enacted very
little divorce legislation of its own. This Act
of 1925 and the Acts of 1930 are the only
ones which deal with divorce law at all in
this country.
Now I come to another historical fact. In
1938 the late Senator McMeans introduced
into this house a bill entitled the Divorce and
Matrimonial Causes Bill. If I remember correctly, I seconded the motion for second reading of the bill. I suggest that during the continuance of the present debate, honourable
senators should read the debate on that bill.
It will be found between pages 84 and 346
of the Senate Hansard of 1938. Other matters
also are dealt with between those pages, but
I am just indicating the opening and closing
pages of the debate.
That bill was introduced on March 8, 1938,
and the debate on the motion for second reading took place on March 15 and 16. Quite a
number of senators who are here with us
today participated in the debate. There was
the honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris), the honourable senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), the honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner), the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), the Right Honourable
Arthur Meighen, the late Senator McMeans
and many others.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: The late Senator Dandurand took part also.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: You are mentioning
some who are not still with us.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is so. I did not
intend to include any who are not with us
today.
On March 16, 1938, the bill was given
second reading in this chamber, by a vote of
forty to twenty-nine, and was then referred
to a special committee. I may say that if the
present bill should receive second reading
I shall propose that it be referred not to a
special committee, but to the Committee on
Banking and Commerce, by which matters
of law are usually dealt with.
The special committee reported the 1938
bill without amendment. There followed quite
a long debate, which resulted in the return
of the measure to the special committee for
further consideration. The committee proposed certain amendments, which were adopted by this chamber on May 11. Thereupon,
on the motion of the then junior senator
from Winnipeg who is now the Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), the bill was
considered in Committee of the Whole, on
May 12, and a number of amendments were
adopted. Third reading was given to the bill
on May 18, and it was sent to the House of
Commons late in June.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Was the bill then
passed by this house substantially the same
as that which the honourable senator is presenting today for second reading?
Hon. Mr. Aselfine: The bill now before the
chamber is an almost exact reproduction of
that which passed this chamber on May 18,
1938. A little later I will explain why so
long a period has elapsed between the two
measures.
I have already stated that the bill went
to the House of Commons. It did not obtain
second reading there, but was killed on June
14, just prior to prorogation. In my opinion
it did not receive adequate consideration at
that time.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Was there a division in
the House of Commons?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I understand that, following a very brief debate, the honourable
member for Fort William, Mr. Dan McIvor,
moved that the bill be not then read the
second time but be read the second time six
months later, and his motion was adopted.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Was there a division?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I do not remember, but
I think there was a division.

Hon. Mr. Euler: I am pretty sure that the
bill did not get much consideration, because
I was there and I do not remember it.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)
asked whether this bill is similar to the one
which was passed by this house in 1938. I
stated that it is in effect a reproduction of
that bill, and I said I would explain why
no attempt was made since then until the
present time to bring it again before this
house. It will be remembered that in 1939
we entered World War II, which lasted until
1945; that, following the close of hostilities,
a number of matters of great importance,
including reconstruction, needed attention. I
decided to delay action on this matter until
these other problems had been dealt with.
But I do not think it should be put off any
longer.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Copies of the bill were
distributed on Saturday last, and, I believe,
will be found by honourable members on
their desks.
First I would refer to section 3:
(1) This act shall apply to and in those provinces of Canada wherein there are now constituted and maintained courts of divorce and
matrimonial causes having jurisdiction to decree
dissolution of marriage, and to and in such provinces only.
(2) In each of such provinces this act shall apply
to and confer jurisdiction upon the court described
in subsection one of this section (subsequently
tn this Act termed "the court") and to and upon
that court only.

The application of this bill is restricted to

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not wish to

many points as possible as we proceed. I
am just asking for information. Will the
provisions of this bill, if enacted, not apply
to petitions for bills of divorce which are
presented to parliament?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I am advised by the Law
Clerk of the Senate that they would not.
These provisions will apply only to those
provinces which have courts within the meaning of the act, and Parliament is not a court
in that sense.

impossible to define cruelty in words that
might or might not fit every case. Will that
explanation do for the moment?
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: For the moment, yes.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I would refer honourable senators to section 5(1) which reads:

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Then do I understand
the honourable gentleman to say that if this
bill should become law an application to
Parliament for divorce could be granted only
if adultery were established?

That is a new feature, and I do not know
that it pertains anywhere in the world at the
present time, except in Great Britain. There
is, however, one exception. If the ground on
which the divorce is sought is adultery, the
petitioner would not have to wait for three
years following the celebration of the marriage.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Why was a threeyear period chosen rather than some other
number of years?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I do not know that.
The object was to prevent hasty marriages
which might result in hasty divorces, and
some period of time had to be fixed. Furthermore, I believe that was the number of years
stated in the British act and that we followed
suit in this country.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I suppose that is the
reason, that it is the period fixed in the
British act.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: There is no such provision
in effect in Ontario at the present time, is
there? A couple married in Ontario last year,
say, could apply for a divorce without waiting for the expiration of the three-year
period, could they not?

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I do not say that, for
Parliament has the power to grant a divorce
on any ground or on no ground at all.
Hon. Mr. King: And to receive divorce
petitions from any province?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: As a result of his
years of experience would the honourable
gentleman expect that, if this legislation is
enacted, petitions for divorce to Parliament
on the grounds set forth in the bill would
obtain approval of Parliament?
Hon. Mr. Aseline: Parliament has had the
right since 1867 to grant divorces on any
ground, but has never exercised that right.
I think, therefore, that there would be no
change whatsoever in that respect if this bill
became law.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question?
Hon. Mr. Aseline: Certainly.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: Section 2(b) reads:
"Cruelty" means legal cruelty as now interpreted
and construed by the High Court of England in
divorce and matrimonial causes.

Could the honourable senator give us a
definition of legal cruelty as it is defined in
the High Court of England?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I shall be coming to that.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: I thought that as my
honourable friend was dealing wi'th section 3
it would be an appropriate time to give the
house this definition.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I shall deal with it
when I come to it.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I may say that that
definition of cruelty was adopted in 1938,
after a long debate in this bouse, for it was

No petition for divorce shall be presented to or
entertained by the court until a period of three
years shall have elapsed since the date of the
marriage unless the court, upon application made
in accordance with rules of court, shal otherwise
allow.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Would this bill change
that situation?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It is a new departure.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It provides for a longer
period.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I understood my
honourable friend to say that if adultery
were set forth as a ground the three-year
period would not apply.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: Yes, that is right. I
would point out that section 5(6) provides:
This section shall not apply in the case of a
petition for divorce on the ground of adultery.

But it applies in every other case, and the
court would take every factor into consideration before it would make any order allowing
the petitioner to proceed with his case.

SENATE
Honourable senators, section 6 of the bill
is the important section, for it sets forth the
grounds upon which a petition for divorce
may be presented either by the husband or
the wife. The old ground of adultery is set
forth in subsection (1) (a). Subsection (1) (b)
provides a new ground, namely, where the
husband or the wife has deserted the petitioner without cause for a period of at least
three years immediately preceding presentation of the petition. Subsection (1) (c) provides another new ground, namely, that the
respondent, since the celebration of the marriage, has treated the petitioner with cruelty.
Finally, subsection (1) (d) provides a third
new ground, namely, that the petitioner's
spouse is incurably of unsound mind and
has been continuously under care and treatment for a period of at least five years
immediately preceding the presentation of
the petition.
In brief, if this bill is passed it will provide four grounds for divorce: first, adultery;
second, desertion for three years; third,
cruelty; and fourth, incurable unsoundness
of mind.

The honourable senator from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McKeen) has reminded me that
the bill provides for a ground which I did
not mention. That is a ground for a petition
by a wife only. It is to be found in section
6(2), which reads:
A petition for divorce may be presented by the
wife to, and it may be entertained by, the court,
on the ground that her husband has, since the
celebration of the marriage, been guilty of rape,
sodomy or bestiality.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Would the honourable senator mind referring me to the clause
in the bill which states, as I understood him
to say. that where adultery is the ground an
action may be commenced before a period of
three years has elapsed since the date of the
marriage?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is to be found on
page three of the bill, section 5(6).
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Certain provisions are
set out in section 8, which I do not intend to
read, giving the court power to dismiss a
petition where there is unreasonable delay
in proceeding with the petition, or cruelty
towards the other party of the marriage, or
where the petitioner also has committed
adultery, or where wilful neglect or misconduct has conduced to the adultery or
unsoundness of mind or desertion, as the case
may be, that is pleaded. Those are just safeguards which the court has discretion to
consider on the hearing of any case which
comes before it.

Hon. Mr. Burchill: I dislike to interrupt

senator may do so only with permission.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: If I have my honourable friend's permission, I would like to ask

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Can the honourable
senator tell me if the proceedîngs o! that
committee were printed?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I do not think they
were; in f act, I am sure they were not.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, the proceedings of the
committee were not printed.
Hon. Mrs. Wilson: May I ask the honourable senator if one of the bis introduced
did not specify habituai drunkenness as a
ground for action? I have a recollection that
it was included as a ground.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No, it was not included.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: It was considered,
though, was it not?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It was included in legislation of some other countries-Australia,
New Zealand and the United States-but
not in this bill. The present bill introduces
only three new grounds, and then it goes
on to deal with "presumption of death." Certain provinces have a law wîth respect to
the presumption of death, and others have
not. It was thought that the question of
presumption of death should be included in
this bill, so that if the bihl is passed t he one
law on this matter wili apply to, all provinces.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: Would the honourable
senator permit a repetition of my question?
What is the British definition of legal cruelty?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I cannot tell you.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: Well, it is very difficult
to judge thisHon. Mr. Aseliine: It is legal cruelty as
interpreted by the High Court o! Justice in
England. Ail kinds of cases involving cruelty
have been tried, and I would not attempt to,
define the term. If we had been able to do
so, it would have been defined in the bill.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: In the bill it is used in
a rather broad sense.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Does it mean that each
senator will have to define it for hiniself?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No; the courts will
have to define it
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I be permitted to ask
a question, following the question put by
the honourable senator from Victoria (Hon.
Mrs. Hodges)? If this bill were passed ini its
present form, would the courts of this country be in duty bound to f ollow the decisions
of Great Britain in regard to cruelty?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: As they exist at the
time this bill is passed, if it is passed.

Hon. Mr. Haig: It will become the 1aw
here then.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Yes, it will become the
law here then.
Han. Mr. Horner: The judge in each court
would do the interpreting?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: And the courts here
would be bound by that interpretation.
Han. Mr. Bouffard: On the basis of those
devisions as they exist today?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: As they exist today.
The bill also deals with judicial separation, avoidance and alîmony. Then there are
three sections under the heading of "General", the first of which sets out that clergymen shall not be compelled or bound to remarry persons where a former marriage has
been dissolved and one of the parties has a
former husband or wif e stili living. Section
16 deals with domicile when a husband
deserts his wife.
Honourable senators, as I said earlier, if
the bill is passed and becomes law we shal
have a divorce law of our own.
Unýless I arn compelled to do so, I shaîl not
go into the sections under the heading
"Avoidance". A debate on the question in
this house lasted for several hours, and as a
resuit these clauses were redrafted and
amended in their present form.
The objects of this bill are the same as
those of the English act. I submit to honourable senators that the bull if passed will
prevent hasty marriages, for under the proposed change in the law no divorce petition
from either spouse could be heard, unless
adultery is aileged, within three years after
the celebration of a marriage. As I have said,
this is a new departure which applies nowhere else in the world but in England.
The addition of tthree new grounds for
divorce would, I think, be of considerable
benefit to the poorer classes. Honourable senators who have served on the Divorce Committee of this house know that adultery is perhaps one of the weakest grounds for divorce,
beca-use not in one case out of fifty is there
actuall-y an eye-witness to the commission of
adultery.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is presumed.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: In a great many cases
brought before the Divorce Committee desertion is the true ground for the break-up of
the marriage; but since desertion is not a
ground for divorce the petitioner has in some
manner or other to, try to produce evidence
showing that adultery probably has been
committed. In my opinion, a large number of
cases in which. there has been a long separation, desertion could easily be proved and

SENATE
there would be no necessity for one party
to commit adultery or to bring false evidence
indicating that adultery has been committed.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I ask my honourable friend a question? What precisely does
he interpret to be the meaning of paragraph
(b) of section 6 (1), which uses these words
"has deserted the petitioner without cause"?
Surely there must be some cause for the
desertion, however ridiculous or trifling it
may seem. As that paragraph is at present
worded, it means nothing.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does it not mean without justification?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Or without cause on
the part of the petitioner?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: It may have that
meaning, but it does not say so.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: If for instance a woman
is deserted by her husband who takes up
with another woman, she may not be able
to prove adultery but she can prove desertion.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, but the husband
no doubt had a cause for deserting ber.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: Not necessarily.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: My honourable friend
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) is going
a little too far.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am quite serious. The
honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) is introducing a bill which must
mean something, and I am suggesting to him
that the paragraph I have mentioned, as
drafted, means nothing whatever.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: If that provision is not
satisfactory to the committee to which this
bill is referred, it can be amended. I am
unable at the moment to suggest what better
words could be used in a redrafting of it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think the honourable senator intends the words to mean that
desertion has taken place without cause on
the part of the petitioner.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: That is what I thought
they meant.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Do they not simply
mean desertion without justification?

matters incidental to marriage and divorce.
That is all I wish to say on that phase of
the subject at the moment.
I should like to read to honourable senators the words of the Lord Bishop of
Birmingham spoken in the House of Lords
on the second reading of the English bill,
in 1937. I may say that the bill was supported by clergymen, lords and commoners,
and received a large majority in both houses.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Would the honourable
gentleman please give the page from which
he proposes to read from the records of the
House of Lords?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I do not have before
me the official records of the House of Lords.
Instead, I shall read from a previous speech
I made in this house, as recorded in our
Hansard of 1938, at page 89, in which I
quoted the words of the Lord Bishop.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: For my own information, may I ask the honourable senator if
I correctly understood him to say that all
the bishops and all the clergymen voted for
the bill?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: No; I said the measure
was supported by clergymen, lords and
commoners.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: And I suppose it
was opposed by some of them too.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I do not intend to imply
that all the clergy had supported the bill,
but I say it was supported by a large
majority of the members of both houses.
On that occasion the Lord Bishop of
Birmingham said:
I intend to vote for the second reading of this
marriage bill. There is in my opinion nothing
in it which can encourage our people to regard
marriage lightly. It is, I am convinced, a careful
attempt to bring our marriage law into harmony
with opinions now held by an overwhelming
majority of enlightened Christian people in this
country. One of the great merits of the bill, as it
seems to me, is that it will Promote morality by
lessening the number of irregular unions among
working People.
I hope that it will lessen the
number of collusive divorces among our fellowcitizens of less narrow means. Some legislation as
to divorce is urgently needed at the present time,
for people generally-is it not so?-are made profoundly uneasy by present circumstances.
It
seems to me that the bill is carefutly balanced.
No practical alternative to it has been proposed.

been included in the law as a ground for

I want to give an example of what happens in this country right now. Let us take
the case of a soldier who married a girl in
England. The girl either refuses to come to
Canada with him or, if she comes to Canada
and does not like things here she returns to
England and refuses to live with lier husband
in Canada. That is desertion, no matter how
you look at it. In England, there is a law
whereby she can get a divorce from her
Canadian husband after three years of living
apart. She gets it on the grounds that the
husband has deserted her, but the poor
husband in Canada, notwithstanding that
divorce granted in England, is still tied to
his wife because her English divorce does
not release him.

moment I have three files, each about three
inches thick, containing letters received from
people all over Canada, and I should say that
99 per cent of them are in favour of what I
am trying to have enacted by this bill.
I said before that the only ground for
divorce in Canada at the present time is that
of adultery, but there is one exception to that.
In Nova Scotia cruelty is recognized as a
ground for divorce, but I do not know that
cruelty is defined in the Nova Scotia statute;
I think its interpretation is left to the court.
In the United States of America divorce is
granted on many grounds for divorce, including the ones mentioned in this bill.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Or on no grounds at all.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I took the trouble, for
the information of honourable senators, to
find out what the grounds for divorce are in
New Zealand. At present there are eleven
grounds for divorce in that country, as

What I am asking the Senate to do seems
to me not such a very serious matter after
all, when you consider the grounds that exist
for divorce in other countries. In the circumstances, the fact the bill proposes three
additional grounds should not disturb anybody at all. I think passage of the bill
would tend to make people in Canada much
happier and would not, as some would lead
us to believe, be a cause of breaking up of
homes. In my opinion, our divorce law is
antiquated.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: A man on the street

and that some revision is necessary.
I have received many letters. Honourable
senators will pardon me if I read one, a
very short one. Dated February 18, 1955,
and addressed to me at the Senate here, it
says:
My dear Senator:
May I wish you the best of luck in your efforts
to bring a sane divorce bill to the people of
Canada?
The writer has been waiting since 1929 for such
a measure in order to relieve himself of a domestic
tangle caused by War No. 1. So here's wishing you
God-speed and may the good Lord bless you in
your efforts.

Hon. Mr. Vien: May I be allowed another
question? Included among additional grounds
for divorce specified in section 6 is, that the
respondent "has since the celebration of the
marriage committed adultery". What if the
offence has been condoned and the couple
have resumed cohabitation?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Oh, well, that is part of
the law of divorce.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Not in the bill.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Everybody knows what
"condonation" means. It means forgiveness,
taking the party back, resuming cohabitation
as man and wife. All those acts would be
condonation.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: A provision as to condonation is in the bill.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Then that is all right.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Several organizations
for the reform of divorce law have been
formed in Canada. One, in the province of
British Columbia, has been in existence since
1942. It is called "The Divorce Reform
League of British Columbia", and its objects
are as follow:
1. The addition of the following grounds for
divorce:
(a) The desertion by a spouse of the petitioning
spouse without cause for a period of at least three
years immediately preceding the petition for

divorce.

(b) The treating with cruelty by a spouse of the
petitioning spouse.
(c) Incurable unsoundness of mind of a spouse
after continuous care and treatment for a period
of at least five years immediately preceding the
petition for divorce.

That is one of tbe chief reasons wby I am

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Wbicb provinces

1Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I cannot answer that
specifically. I know that a vote was called,
and I assume tbe vote was 5 to 1 in f avour
of this resolution. Representatives from nearly
every province were present.

Hon. Mr. Aselfine: Ob, no. The federal
Parliament bas full and total jurisdiction.
Honourable senators. to illustrate the trend
of tbinking amongst Canadian aduits I would
refer you to a report of a Gallup Poîl of
Canada on tbis subject. Sometimes Gallup
]Polîs give an accurate reflection and sometimes tbey do not, but frequently they are
almost right. Tbis report dlaims that 75 per
cent of Canadian aduits want the following
additional grounds for divorce: infidelity, desertion, insanity, physical cruelty, drunkenness, mental cruelty and inability to get
along. 0f course, the last three grounds are
not -mentioned in my bill at ali.

Honourable senators, I have talked longer
than I intended. I should like to close by
expressing the hope that this bill will be
considered very carefully by the Senate and
that it will be sent to a committee of this
house. We pride ourselves on being an independent body. We also pride ourselves on
our good sense, judgment, knowledge and
experience ln legisiation and other matters,
and I think this legisiation is a challenge
to the Senate to take some action. I hope
that we shaîl forget our politics and everytbing else and give this legislation the consideration it merits.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Mclniyre: Do not the provinces
have the right to pass.their own divorce laws?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No. The Parliament of
Canada has full and total jurisdiction in this
matter.
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: Except for Quebec and
Newfoundland, the provinces now have courts
within the meaning of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable gentleman from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) a question? He bas deait fully with
the various grounds for divorce under this
bill, but has said notbing with regard to
the section beaded "Presumption of Death".
At the present moment the Criminal Code
allows a person to remarry after his or her
spouse bas been absent for a period of seven
years.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The law does not allow
it; it is just that there can be no conviction
for bigamy.
Hon. Mr. ]Roebuck: It is the samne thing.
Hon. Mr. Farris: The second marriage is
flot validated.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is what I was
about to say. If a spouse bas been absent for
seven years without the otber spouse knowing where he or she is and witbout receiving
any communicationHon. Mr. Macdonald: I think there bas to
be a presumption of death.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Tbere is a presumption
of deatb. That is the basis of the provision,
aitbougb not so expressed. The absent party
is presumed dead and if the deserted person
marries seven years or more after tbe disappearance of bis or ber spouse there cannot
be a conviction for bigamy.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There is a clause in this
bill to whicb no reference bas been made.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes, I referred to it.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I did not hear any reference to it.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I said that one of the
objects of the bill was to unify the law in
all the provinces with respect to presumption
of death.
For instance, Alberta, British
Columbia and Saskatchewan have their own
acts, but they are ail different. The idea
is to make one law applicable to the whole
of Canada's marriage and divorce.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Do I understand that
if this bill becomes law and a presumedly
dead husband or wife appears à la Enoch
Arden, he or she is no longer married?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Certainly.

FEBRUARY 23, 1955
PRIVATE BILL
BONAVENTURE

AND GASPÉ TELEPHONE

COMPANY-SECOND READING
Hon. Paul H. Bouffard moved the second
reading of Bill P-6, an Act respecting The
Bonaventure and Gaspé Telephone Company
Limited.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
much more a matter of fact than the one we
have just heard about.
Hon. Mr. Horner: But not so interesting.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: On the other hand, it
will not take so long to explain.
This bill has to do with a telephone company which was incorporated in 1907, and
which does business in the counties of Gaspé
and Bonaventure in the province of Quebec
and in the counties of Restigouche and
Gloucester in the province of New Brunswick.
When the company was incorporated its
authorized capital stock was $100,000, and
provision was made whereby this could be
increased by an additional $150,000. Since
its incorporation the company has doubled
the number of its subscribers, but there has
been no increase in its authorized capital
stock. Needless to say, it is absolutely necessary for the company to increase its capital
stock now if it wishes to improve its facilities
and extend its services.
At the present time, the company has committed itself to an additional expense of
$800,000 over the period of the next four
years. One of the main purposes of the bill
is to ask Parliament for authority to increase
the authorized capital to $2 million, and to
divide this into shares of a par value of $25
each. The par value of the present shares is
$100, and the proposal is that existing shareholders will receive new shares in the proportion of four for one. The proposed changes
will make it easier for the company to finance
its operations and to get new capital.

The bill also provides the name of the
company in French as well as in English.
The reason for this is that the company does
business in both the provinces of New
Brunswick and Quebec.
A further effect of the bill is to change
the date of the annual meeting, which at
present is fixed for the first Thursday of
September in each year. The bill repeals
section 8 of the act of incorporation and
thereby makes the date of the annual meeting
conform with the company's fiscal year, which
ends on December 31.
The bill would also give effect to the company's desire that amalgamation and acquisition or sale of property may be carried out
with the consent of the majority of the shareholders, and under the supervision of the
Board of Transport Commissioners. Since
the present Act was passed, Parliament has
given the Board of Transport Commissioners
jurisdiction over telephone companies. The
bill provides that all matters pertaining to
this company shall come within the jurisdiction of the board.
Finally, the bill would give the company
the right to furnish radio and television services and other improved means of communication, in line with the right enjoyed
by other companies.
Honourable senators, I fail to see anything
in this bill that is outside of the powers of
any other telephone company, but if the bill
is accepted by this house and read a second
time, I will move that it be referred to the
Committee on Transport and Communications
for more detailed study.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
On motion of Hon. Mr. Bouffard, the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

LIBRARY OF PARLIAMENT
RECONSTRUCTION

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, on Tuesday evening last I undertook to
obtain information as to when the recon-

struction of the Parliamentary Library will
be completed. Upon inquiry I find it was
originally intended that the reconstruction
would be sufficiently near completion to allow
of the use of the library in the fall of 1955.
However, the condition of the structure, particularly the walls and the upper portion of
the building, and including the whole of the
roof, has necessitated a great deal more
rebuilding than was at first supposed to be
necessary. In

consequence it is now antici-

pated that the contractor will have completed

his work about a year from now, around the
month of April, 1956, and that by that time
the Librarian and his staff can

move from

their present quarters in the House of Commons reading room to the library proper. It
is estimated that to have all the books

replaced in the library, and the reorganization completed, will require another six
months. This additional time for the reorganization of the library, once the Librarians
and their staffs are installed there, is
accounted for by the fact that it was necessary to store many of the books elsewhere
than in this building.
ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators.
I beg to move that when this house rises
today it stand adjourned until Tuesday next

at eight o'clock in the evening.
The motion was agreed to.

Hon. A. Neil McLean moved:
That the Standing Committee on Canadian Trade
Relations be empowered to inquire into and report
on:
1. What, in their opinion might be the most
practical steps to further implement article 2
of the North Atlantic Treaty whereby the signatories to that document agreed that: "They will
seek to eliminate conflict in their international
economic policies and will encourage economic
collaboration between any or all of them."
2. That notwithstanding the generality of the
foregoing, the
committee
be
instructed
and
empowered to consider and report upon how, in
their opinion,
(a) any project for developing economic collaboration specifically between the countries which
are signatories of the North Atlantic Treaty can be
co-ordinated with the trade policies of other
countries of the free world;
(b) any project for developing economic collaboration
between
the countries
which are
signatories of the North Atlantic Treaty, might
have the same degree of permanence that is contemplated in the twenty year military obligation
under article 5 of the treaty whereby "the parties
agree that an armed attack against one or more
of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all."
3. That the committee be empowered to extend
an invitation to those wishing to be heard, includng representatives of agriculture, industry, labour,
trade, finance and consumers, to present their
views, and that the committee also be empowered
to hear representatives from business interests or
individuals from any of the NATO countries who
might wish to be heard.
4. That the committee be empowered to send for
persons, papers and records, and to secure such
services as may be necessary for the purpose of the
inquiry.

The motion was agreed to.
NARCOTIC DRUG TRAFFIC
SPECIAL COMMITTEE APPOINTED TO
CONDUCT INQUIRY

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved:
1. That a special committee of the Senate be
appointed to inquire into and report upon the
traffic in narcotic drugs in Canada and problems
related thereto.
2. That the said committee be composed of
the
Honourable Senators Baird, Burchill, Gershaw,
Grant, Hayden, Hawkins, Hodges, Horner, Hugessen,
Leger, McDonald, McIntyre, Quinn, Reid, Stambaugh, Turgeon, Vaillancourt, Veniot and Woodrow.
3. That the committee be empowered to send
for persons, papers and records.
4. That the committee be instructed to report to
the house from time to time its findings, together
with such recommendations as it may see fit
to
make.

He said:

Honourable

senators, for some

time there has been a growing awareness,

both among members of this house and the
public at large, of the need of an examination

of the law restricting the sale and the distri-

bution of drugs and narcotics. This need was
emphasized in the Senate last year during
the debate on Bill K-13, an Act to amend the
Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, and that

FEBRUARY 24, 1955
debate quite properly received wide publicity.
Early in the present session, when speaking
on the Address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne, I stated that I proposed to suggest to the Senate that a special committee
of this house should be set up to inquire
into this problem. Accordingly, I am now
moving the motion which is before us for
deliberation.
(Translation):
During the debate on the Address in reply
to the speech from the throne, the honourable
senator from Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) had a word of praise for me and I
wish to thank him sincerely for his kindness.
He stressed the evil effect of obscene literature on our youth. I am fully in accord with
him, but I do not think that the matter can
be discussed at the same time as the subject
of drugs which should be looked into by a
special committee. Hence, I have not included obscene literature in my motion which
deals solely with an inquiry into the narcotic
drug traffic.
(Text):
From certain reports which have appeared
from time to time in the press, the impression might be gained that the problem of the
sale and distribution of drugs and narcotics
is out of hand. In fact, this is far from the
case. In the year ending March 31, 1954 the
actual number of cases of arrest reported by
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police was only
12 more than in the year 1953. The figures
are: in 1953, 495 arrests, and in 1954, 507
arrests. In mentioning these figures, I would
remind honourable senators that the number
of arrests must be related to our total population of about 15 million people. Of course,
the figure for the current year is not yet
available, as our fiscal year ends on March
31, but I am reliably informed that there is
a reduction from last year's figure.
Before proceeding to discuss the problem
itself, I wish to remind honourable members
that in undertaking this work we should be
primarily concerned with devising ways and
means of controlling the actual traffic of drugs
and narcotics, as this is a federal responsibility. The treatment of drug addicts is a
matter which, of course, falls within the
ambit of provincial jurisdiction. Nevertheless, it may be, and we certainly hope, that
out of the findings of this committeE may
emerge not only recommendations to the
federal Government respecting control, but
also many helpful suggestions which the
provincial Governments might possibly find
of some assistance in facing the phases of the
drug problem falling within their jurisdiction.
I said earlier that last year the R.C.M.P.
had reported 507 arrests. The estimated num-

ber of persons in Canada addicted to the
use of narcotics is approximately 3,000; and
while the majority of them are located on
the West coast in and about the city of Vancouver, the problem is a very real one in the
large centres of Toronto, Montreal, Hamilton,
Windsor, Winnipeg, Edmonton and Calgary.
There is very little or no problem in the
Maritimes, and as we all know it is virtually
unknown in the rural areas.
Drug addicts may be broken down largely
into three classes. First, there is the addict
who suffers from a chronic medical disease
and requires the administration of drugs. A
man or woman in this class is not really an
addict in the ordinary sense of the word,
because the drugs are administered legally
and the dosage is supervised by medical
authorities. These people are not a problem
for enforcement authorities. The second
group comprises certain professional personnel who have ready access to narcotics and
find them helpful in facing their problems.
These are very few in number, and really
do not require anything more than a passing
mention. The third group, and the one which
causes the authorities in this country most
concern, comprises those who do not need
drugs for any medical condition. It is recognized, however, by social and medical
authorities that drug addicts are, for the
most part, mentally disturbed and emotionally insecure people. They are people who
have had such problems as broken homes,
or who face difficult personality factors, or
within whose experience a number of other
elements have contributed to making them
drug addicts.
It will be seen, therefore, that the solution
of the drug problem requires, in addition to
the criminal law enforcement feature, all
possible suitable measures for removing the
cause of the addiction and for effecting
treatment and rehabilitation. It is not enough
merely to imprison these people, if the causes
of the addiction have not been removed or
to some extent reduced, for they will become
addicts again almost immediately upon discharge from an institution.
A great many drug addicts are primarily
social and community problems. It must be
admitted, unfortunately, that many of them
have never been responsible and useful
members of the communities in which they
have lived. Because each one of them represents an individual problem, it is difficult to
outline a program for the treatment of
addicts generally. However, from time to
time a variety of proposais have been made
including the provision of free drugs in a
limited quantity for the addict. Some people
suggest that if this plan were adopted the
crime of robbery, which is so prevalent in

SENATE
certain parts of Canada, and which many
addicts commit in order to obtain money for
the purchase of drugs, would possibly be
donc away with or greatly lessened. However, I may say that the experience of this
country and others is that this plan has not
proved as successful as had been hoped. In
fact, it has often resulted in worse and more
problems than it was intended to reduce or
eliminate, and the authorities strongly
oppose it.
There is in this country a belief that the
man who traffics in drugs pursues a deliberate
policy of recruiting unaddicted persons, particularly those in the teen-age group, in order
to provide himself with a larger clientele.
However, the enforcement officers in our
country do not support that view, and I also
find that it is not generally supported by our
officials. I was interested to read an article
on this subject by R. E. Curran in the January
1955 number of the Canadian Bar Review,
beginning at the bottom of page 126 and continuing to page 127. The article reads:

pay my sincere respects te the honourable
senator from Victoria (Hon. Mrs. Hodges)

what effect their remarks had on other members of this house, but they made me realize
as I had never realized before the seriousness of this problem. If good comes out of

important things this committee could do is
to impress upon the world at large the serious effects which the indiscriminate sale of
certain drugs bas in general, not merely in
the city of Vancouver. Years ago, when l
was in New York, the drug trafic was rampant there, and today it is operating in all
the large cities. So I hope the committee
will do something to impress upon our own
nation and other countries the necessity for
proper control of manufacture and sale.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: May I briefly explain
to the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) why no representative of
Manitoba was nominated for the committee.
I had something to do with the selection. The
member for St. Boniface (Hon. Mr. Howden)
was not nominated because he is very busy
in the Divorce Committee; and he will be
even busier next session if the bill introduced
yesterday by the honourable senator from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) passes into
law. I understand that another Manitoba
senator, the senator from Provencher (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien), is occupied with duties which
prevent him from acting on this committee.
If at any time any honourable senator whn
is not on the committee desires to be appointed
to it, all he need do is to notify the honourable Government Leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) or myself, and it will not be long
before his name is added.
The Hon, the Speaker: Honourable senators.
it is moved in amendment by the Honourable
Senator Haig, seconded by the Honourable
Senator Macdonald, that the name of thHonourable Senator Howden be added to
the list of members of the special committee.
The amendment was agreed to.
The Hon. the Speaker: The question, honourable senators, is on the motion as amended:
1. That a special comrnmittee of the Senate be
appointed to inquire into and report upon the
traffic in narcotic drugs in Canada and problems
related thereto.
2. That the said committee be composed of the
Honourable Senators Baird, Burchill, Gershaw,
Grant, Hayden, Hawkins, Hodges, Horner, Howden,
Hugessen, Leger, McDonald, MeIntyre, Quinn, Reid,
Stambaugh, Turgeon, Vaillancourt, Veniot and
Woodrow.
3. That the committee be empowered to send
for persons, papers and records.
4. That the committee be instructed to report
to the house from tine to time its findings, together
with such recommendations as it may see fit to
make.

The motion, as amended, was agreed to.

PRIVATE BILL
LONDON AND PORT STANLEY RAILWAY
COMPANY-SECOND READING

Hon. William H. Taylor moved the second
reading of Bill Q-6, an Act respecting the
London and Port Stanley Railway Company
and the Corporation of the City of London.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
probably requires a brief explanation on
second reading, and I have been requested by
the Corporation of the City of London to
make this explanation to the Senate.
The London and Port Stanley Railway Company was incorporated in 1853, some fourteen
years before Confederation. By 1903 this
small railway of 24.5 miles ran from the
City of London, Ontario, through St. Thomas
to Port Stanley, a lakeport on the north
shore of Lake Erie. The sidings and terminals extended about forty-seven miles.
The financing of this line of railway was
guaranteed by a bond issue from the municipalities through which the railway passed,
but by 1903 the City of London had become
the holder of all the bonds issued for the
construction of the railway. The railway has
never been able to pay any bond interest or
any part of the principal, all of which is long
overdue.
In 1913 the City of London entered into an
agreement with the London and Port Stanley
Railway Company to take over the operation
of the railway for ninety-nine years from
January 1, 1914. The Statutes of Canada,
1914, Chapter 96, confirmed the lease and
authorized the city to carry on the railway
operation by electricity or steam, and either
by itself or by a statutory agent to be
known as the London Railway Commission.
Under the terms of the lease the cost of
electrification was to be a lien and charge
against the railway company. In 1954 the
city's investment by way of bonds, accrued
interest on bonds and for electrification was
in the neighbourhood of $7 million, which
is acknowledged to be greatly in excess of
the value of the railway. The city also by
this time had acquired over 95 per cent of
the outstanding shares of the company. The

FEBRUARY 24, 1955
city is the company's only creditor, and by
reason of the charge against the assets for
outstanding bonds and for electrification the
shares have no possible value.
In order to simplify the operation of the
railway and to enable the city to plan for
the future, an agreement was entered into
on January 10, 1955, between the railway
company and the city for the transfer of all
the company's assets to the city, in consideration of the city releasing the company
from its obligations to the city.
Honourable senators, the purpose of the
proposed legislation is to confirm this agreement and to make such other amendments in
the legislation as have become necessary because of the transfer of the assets of the
railway to the city as owner. I might review
the sections of the bill very briefiy.
Section 1 confirms the agreement. Section
2 is necessary because in the interests of
economy it may be decided to operate the
railway by diesel power instead of electricity
or steam, as provided in the earlier legislation.
Section 3 is necessary in order to correct
an omission in earlier legislation which failed
to provide as to qualifications or disqualifications of commissioners of the London Railway
Commission.
Section 4 is necessary to more clearly
define the powers of the London Railway
Commission. Section 5 is necessary because
the Railway Act, while providing for the sale
of the assets or undertakings of railway companies, does not contain legislation specifically
covering a railway owned by a municipal
corporation. If at a future time it appeared
desirable to lease or sell the railway operation,
section 5 would provide the machinery.
Section 6 of the bill provides for the
machinery to end the corporate existence of
the London and Port Stanley Railway Company. The company has no debts or liabilities
except to the City of London, and on parting
with its assets there is no need to continue
the existence of the company.
Honourable senators, I believe that is a
general explanation of the bill in principle.
If the bill is given second reading I will
move that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Transport and Communications, and I have an assurance that the
solicitor for the City of London is prepared to
appear before the committee to provide bonourable senators with any information they
wish.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Would the honourable
gentleman be good enough to inform us, in
respect to section 2 of the bill, whether the
60437-15J

railway is at present being operated by steam
and, if so, from whom it procures its coal?
I am wondering from what part of the country the coal is obtained.
Hon. Mr. Taylor: In 1913 the line was electrified. Prior to that time the railway had
an agreement with interests in Cleveland,
Ohio, to supply the coal by boat service
across Lake Erie. The railway was able
to obtain its coal from this source much more
conveniently and cheaply than from anywhere else. If the railway continues to operate, it is hoped that diesel power will be
used.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
On motion of Hon. Mr. Taylor the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications.
DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL
CAUSES BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Aseltine for the second reading of Bill 0-6,
an Act respecting divorce and matrimonial
causes.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
first, I wish to congratulate the honourable
senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
on bringing this bill before Parliament, and
also to commend him for his great contribution as Chairman of the Committee on
Divorce for so many years.
I am voting for the second reading of this
bill, because I believe the present practice
in regard to divorce is not the best that can
be devised. I have listened to the evidence
in about a thousand divorce cases, and I am
firmly convinced that some couples obtain
divorce in Canada who should not be
divorced, and that others who cannot obtain
divorce should, in the interests of all concerned, be able to do so.
In 1912, a royal commission which was
appointed in England for the purpose of
studying this whole problem, reported as
follows:
Divorce is not a disease, but a remedy for a
disease. Homes are not broken up by the courts
but by the causes referred to.

This indicates that homes are hopelessly
broken up before the parties ever come to
the divorce courts.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Gershaw: The report goes on
to say:
No law should be so harsh as to lead to its
common disregard. No law should be so lax as to
lessen the regard for the sanctity of marriage.

What is harsh about our present divorce
practice? Simply this, that no matter how
intolerable the marriage life of the spouses
may be, no matter how horrible the example
to the children in their tender years, no
matter how acute the suffering, there is no
release unless the crime of adultery, or the
crime of perjury, is resorted to. Honourable
senators, I suggest that adultery is a crime,
although not so recognized by the laws of
our country. It is so regarded by the law in
the province of New Brunswick. It is rather
shocking to see men and women stand in the
witness box and, under oath, without a blush
or without emotion volunteer the statement
that they had committed adultery. I feel
strongly that adultery should be a crime
according to our laws. It is, indeed, a moral
crime. If it were a crime by law, there
would be fewer co-respondents, and not so
many hotel-room cases brought before the
divorce committee.
We all sincerely regret the breaking up of
family life. The family, of course, is the
foundation of our society, and children are
our greatest national asset. We realize tUat
everything possible should bc done to prevent
a family from breaking up. Instruction should
bc given to young people about the sanctity
of marriage, and if friction occurs a proctor

or some wise counsellor should attempt to
bring the parties together. However, this
malady does exist in our midst, and we must
take a realistic view of the matter, because
it is right before us. I say that it is an
obligation on the part of this High Court of
Parliament to take whatever steps its members feel should be taken in the interests
of those involved in homes that are wrecked.
In undertaking that obligation, should not
the real reason for failure in a marriage be
considered and inquired into? Of course,
adultery is one disaster; but other disasters
also come to the home, and I think that they,
too, should receive careful consideration
throughout Canada.
It has been said, from time to time, that
divorce cases are hastily considered and
carelessly recommended by the Divorce Committee. That is not so. When a petitioner
comes before the committee, the committee
is careful to make sure, first, that the marriage occurred and that it was a legal marriage. Domicile is then determined, and that
is a very important factor. The committee
then makes sure that the offence alleged is
proven beyond doubt. More than one witness is required for proof. Every accused

person has the opportunity of clearing his
or her honour. Money is provided, if necessary, for a woman defendant who wishes to
come and plead her case. Notice of the time
and place of the hearing is issued, so that
all the parties will know about it. The chairman, or judge, makes sure that no collusion,
connivance or condonation exists. In cases
where it seems that unduly heavy expense
to the parties is involved, the usual parliamentary fee of $210 may be reduced to as
low as $75 or $50. It will be seen, therefore,
that every opportunity is given for a case
to be heard and to ensure that the real facts
of the case are brought out. A recommendation for divorce by one of our committees is
almost always unanimous.
Honourable senators, I have mentioned
those facts to indicate that if this bill is
passed-because I believe it will be passed
at some time-the same care as in the past
will be taken to provide justice in these
domestic tragedies. Lawyers who appear before the committee carry out their duties
very well, but no member of a committee
is influenced by the pleading of a lawyer,
because no pleading is permitted. Each member of the committee must make up his or
her own mind.
May I say here, honourable senators, that
no member who hears evidence in these
cases does so without having an urge to do
the very best possible for those involved in
a family break-up. There is something about
the atmosphere that impresses one and
creates a desire to do one's duty and help
the innocent in homes that are blighted.
Honourable senators, I think that some
urgent consideration should be given to those
unhappy cases for which at present there is
no relief, so that people will not find it
necessary either to pretend to commit
adultery or to actually commit adultery in
order to get a divorce.
Generally speaking, the bill before us
simply suggests three new grounds for
divorce. The first with which I will deal is
cruelty. Everyone knows that in some homes
in this country women are treated with great
cruelty and receive violent beatings from
time to time. This may come from hatred,
bad temper, cruel mentality, or from one or
more other causes. For that reason, I think
that the plea of cruelty should receive some
consideration. It may be difficult to give a
legal definition of cruelty, but I would say
that the ground should not be mental cruelty,
or incompatibility, nor should the offence be
flimsy or frivolous. Perhaps the ground of
cruelty should be constituted not by a single
offence, but rather by repeated acts of inhuman treatment whereby a woman lives in
constant danger of bodily injury or death.
Then, surely, some relief should be given.

I hope that in committee "cruelty" will contribute to the wellbeing of Canada and
be sufficiently well defined so that we shall the increase of human happiness.

PRIVATE BILL
VICTORIA INSURANCE COMPANY OF CANADASECOND READING

Hon. Salier A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill B-8, an Act to incorporate
Victoria Insurance Company of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
in the usual form for the incorporation of a
company, and is similar to many others that
have come before us. The purpose of the
company seeking incorporation in this instance is to conduct varlous types of insurance in this country, under the name of
Victoria Insurance Company of Canada.
The substantial shareholder of the company
would be the Insurance Company of Turin,
Italy. I am advised that the companies
associated with the parent operation in Italy
enjoy high standing in the fields of insurance
and finance in the northern part of that
country.
The bill, which is not unusual in any of its
aspects, provides for an authorized capitalization of $1 million-the amount usually asked
for in such instances-a subscribed capital
of $500,000, and a paid up capital of $360,000
before the company is permitted to carry on
certain named types of insurance business,
the principal ones being fire and casualty.
The bill also provides for substantial additions to capital in each year for a period of
five years; and further, that additional
amounts of capital must be subscribed before
the company may venture into those classes
of business set out in subsection 2 of section
7.
Honourable senators, I have dealt with the
more important aspects of the bill, and if
additional information is required it can be
secured when the bill is considered in committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

PRIVATE BILL
CALEDONIAN-CANADIAN INSURANCE
COMPANY-SECOND READING

Hon. Salier A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill C-8, an Act respecting
Caledonian-Canadian Insurance Company.
50437-16

1, 1955
He said: Honourable senators, this is
another bill by which certain persons are
seeking to be incorporated for the purpose
of carrying on the business of insurance in
Canada. I am sure the very sound of the
name of the proposed company will strike
a responsive and supporting chord in many
of the honourable senators present.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Don't make me blush!
Hon. Mr. Hayden: And may I for that
purpose emphasize the name by which the
company desires to be known in the conduct
of its business in Canada-Caledonian-Canadian Insurance Company.
The Caledonian Insurance Company of
Edinburgh is an old and very well-known
insurance company. It has been carrying
on business for, I think, 150 years, and for at
least seventy years in Canada. Up to the
present the business in Canada has been
carried on by what is known as CaledonianAmerican Insurance Company, with the management being provided by the Caledonian
Insurance Company of Edinburgh.
If this bill is approved by Parliament, a
separate Canadian company will be set up
under the name, Caledonian-Canadian Insurance Company, and that company will carry
on the classes of business in Canada prescribed by this bill; and in addition the bill
provides that it will take over the present
operations carried on by the CaledonianAmerican Insurance Company.
Honourable senators will note that the bill
contains the usual provision with respect
to capital: authorized capital, $1 million:
subscribed capital, $500,000; and, in this case,
paid-up capital of $400,000. In other aspects
this is the usual form of bill for purposes
of this kind. If the Senate sees fit to approve
the bill on second reading I will move that
it be referred to committee, where any questions in the minds of honourable senators
can be answered.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

PRIVATE BILL
ROYAL ARCHITECTURAL INSTITUTE OF
CANADA-SECOND READING

Hon. Salter A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill D-8, an Act to consolidate and
amend Acts relating to The Royal Architectural Institute of Canada.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Is that title approved?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes. If the honourable
senator wishes, we can have some discussion
on that point.

This bill is for the purpose of amending
and consolidating statutes which up to the
present time have governed the operations
of The Royal Architectural Institute of Canada. Before any question is raised about one
of the words in the title, may I say that the
Royal Architectural Institute of Canada was
originally incorporated by statute of the
Parliament of Canada in 1908. At that time it
was known as "The Architecutural Institute of Canada". There were subsequent
amending statutes, one passed in 1912, another in 1929. These facts, I think, establish
not only a precedent but a sort of hoary
antiquity for the title under which the institute operates, for it was in 1912, by virtue
of the amending statute, that the name was
changed to "The Royal Architectural Insti-

tute of Canada".

So the problem which may

be lying somewhere forward or back of the
minds of some honourable senators since their
promiscuous reading of the past week bas
not the foundation it might otherwise have.
The purpose of this bill is to amend and
also to consolidate the three statutes under
which this organization bas functioned. The
institute is a body superimposed so to speak
on the governing bodies of architects in the
various provinces of Canada. These organizations are provincially incorporated, and this
bill like the act under which the institute
operates, does not interfere with or intrude
in any way upon the powers of the provincial

organizations in relation to their governmental
functions or with the practice and the schooling related to the profession. In order to
qualify for membership in the Royal Institute an applicant must be a member of what
is called a component association. This component association is the provincial organization and the governing body within the province in its particular field.

Time teaches, and sometimes educates, and
as a result of this process the objects as
originally stated have been redrafted and
broadened to satisfy the concept of what
should be the Institute's function today. Also
it has been wisely decided to introduce more
flexibility into the methods whereby persons
can become members of the Royal Institute;
and instead of placing a fixed formula in the
statute, a more elastic formula, which may be
varied by regulation, is proposed.
The Institute is ambitious, as all organizations should be if they are to go along and
get anywhere. Years ago provision was made
to limit the funds which it could accumulate
and hold in expectation of the day when it
might erect a building proper and suitable

to bouse its activities. At that time the estimate of an adequate sum was $200,000. Now
its members feel-and I do not know any
group in a better position to know-that this
sum would not produce the kind of edifice
which would be worthy of their occupancy;
and it is proposed to vest the Institute with
authority to set aside and hold for building
purposes a larger amount, namely, $500,000.
Briefly, these are the purposes which it
is sought to accomplish, and the respects in
which earlier legislation is amended, by this
bill. Otherwise the purpose is to consolidate
existing legislation.
If the bill should receive second reading
I shall move to send it to committee.
Hon. Mr. Farris: In a general way, what
are the objects of the bill?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The objects, which are
set out very generally in the bill, are to promote a better relationship between not only
the component associations and other architectural groups with wbich an affiliation
exists-for instance, in other countries-but
also to endeavour by education and other
appropriate means to set higher standards for
the architectural profession and activities
ir: idental to it.

The bill was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
On motion of Hon. Mr. Hayden, the bill

was referred to the Standing Committee on
Miscellaneous Private Bills.
DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL
CAUSES BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Thursday, Feb-

ruary 24, the adjourned debate on the motion
of Hon. Mr. Aseltine for the second reading
of Bill 0-6, an Act respecting divorce and
matrimonial causes.
Hon. Nancy Hodges: Honourable senators,
I should like first to congratulate the sponsor
of this bill on his courage in bringing it in.
Apparently it requires courage, as I notice
that seventeen years have passed since a
similar bill was introduced. Also, may I
congratulate the honourable senator who
secorded the bill on his able presentation
of his views on the subject.
I want to make it quite clear at the beginning that I am supporting the principle of
this measure. It may be that some of us
will take exception to small details, but
these matters can be hammered out in the
committee to which, I am sure, the bill will
be referred.

MARCH 1, 1955
But let me make it equally clear, honourable senators, that my support of this bill
does not mean that I believe in divorce. I
do not believe in divorce. I am against it;
but one has to be practical and realistic. One
hears it frequently said that an ideal marriage
is made in heaven. But when one has
lived as long as I have, and has served on
our Divorce Committee, as I have, for even
a short time, one is forced to the conclusion
that a good many marriages are made far
from that place, in another place; and when
I say "in another place", honourable senators,
I do not mean the House of Commons.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: As I said before, one
has to be realistic. I agree with the honourable gentleman from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr.
Gershaw) that divorce is not the cause of
broken homes, for homes are broken long before the husband and wife get to the divorce
court. We all know-at least, anyone who
has served on the Senate Divorce Committee
knows-that under our present laws adultery
is the only recognized cause for divorce,
except in the province of Nova Scotia. At
this juncture I want to say that I am not
advocating easier divorce, by any means. I
think that broadening the grounds for divorce
would not mean easier divorce, for frankly
I do not think there is any easier way of
getting a divorce than under our present law,
which merely requires proof or so-called
proof of a single act of acultery.
I should like to say without any reflection
upon anybody connected with the Divorce
Committee or the work of tlie committee that
at times I have suspected there have been
stage settings of a certain kind to permit
divorce being achieved. As honourable senators know, adultery is one of those causes
concerning which one usually has to accept
circumstantial evidence, since it is very seldom that the parties are actually caught in
the act. In my estimation the divorce laws
of our country tend to be brought into disrepute by present practices which recognize
marital infidelity as the only ground for
obtaining divorce. To illustrate what I mean,
I would refer honourable senators to an
article appearing in the Montreal Gazette
of February 19 of this year. It is date-lined
Ottawa, Februry 18, and reads as follows:
Last Nov. 24 two Montreal private detectives
were sentenced to 15 months when convicted in
Ottawa for trying to set up a phony love nest
to gather evidence for a divorce case.
Maurice Pichette, 36, and Paul Santerre, 35, were
convicted of attempting to fabricate evidence and
of operating as private detectives In Ontario without a licence. They pleaded guilty to the latter
charge and were fined $200 apiece.
50437-16J

Apparently they were convicted on the
latter charge but not on the former. The
report goes on:
They were arrested after police alleged they
installed a 25-year-old Ottawa waitress in a hotel
room here and then tried to arrange a rendezvous
between her and a city man. The intended victim
became suspicious, however, and police kept the
rendezvous instead. The waitress was fined $50.
Passing sentence, Magistrate Glenn E. Strike said:
The waitress gave evidence that she was to go
into the hotel room, muss up the bed, open a
bottie of liquor and make the situation appear as
she said, "bad", before the private detectives
walked in. An innocent man caught in such a
trap might suffer greatly.

Honourable senators, that illustrates what
I mean when I say that our present system
of recognizing adultery as the only grounds
for divorce leads to easy divorce. I want to
make it quite clear that I am not condemning
all private detectives or all divorce cases
brought before the Divorce Committee. It
would be utterly absurd to do so, but this
practice of depending on marital infidelity
alone as a ground for divorce lends itself to
what I would call shady testimony.
As I said before, I am not advocating easier
divorce. But I am glad to see that the bill
introduced by the honourable senator from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) makes provision for divorce on the additional grounds
of cruelty, desertion and incurable insanity.
I am particularly pleased that the bill stipulates that no petition for divorce on any of
these grounds shall be entertained until a
period of three years shall have elapsed since
the date of the marriage. I am also glad to
note that where incurable insanity is alleged
as a ground, it will be necessary to prove that
the respondent has been under continuous
treatment for at least five years.
The reason why I am pleased that the bill
includes incurable insanity as a groundand this is particularly what I want to speak
about tonight-is that I know a number of
instances where incurable insanity has
created a great deal of hardship and suffering in homes. And when I say incurable
insanity I mean just that. The science and
study of mental illness have advanced to
such a point that there is very little likelihood of someone who is in fact sane being
called insane. That may have been a possibility a few years ago, but the possibility
has passed now, because most of our institutions-and I am speaking particularly of
those in British Columbia-have advanced
to such a scientific point that many people
who once might have been considered hopelessly insane are, after appropriate treatment,
cured and discharged.
I should like to read to honourable senators
a letter I received from a woman in Victoria.

SENATE
It was sent to me on December 16, 1953, the
date that I was appointed to the Senate
Divorce Committee. It reads:

the provisions in the bill was that the City
of London could operate the railway by
electricity, steam, oil or other fuel. In committee the observation was made that the
possible use of atomic energy had been overlooked. The amendment is suggested, therefore, for the purpose of allowing the use of
atomic energy, if it becomes necessary and
possible.

the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) for the courtesy which
he has shown to me in this matter. I thank
him. I had a chat with him last night in
which he told me that he was very anxious
to have the bill voted upon this afternoon,
and he asked me if I was ready to speak. I
said I would try. Owing to unfortunate
circumstances, honourable senators, I was
denied the time necessary to get ready to
present to you something worthy of you and,
if I may say so, worthy of myself. As some
of you know, I have been sick, very sick.
For months my coctor has been urging me
to keep away from this chamber. I said'.
"Doctor, do you want to kill me? It is not
the role of doctors to kill patients. Let me
go there. It is my home; I want to be with
my friends; I want to be happy." Here is
where I work; and I am not able to keep
away from work. I am always here at eight
o'clock in the morning; I leave at ten o'clock
at night; I am busy ýall day. But this has
nothing to do with the matter. The subject
before us is very important, and I would have
been only too pleased to gather my notes together and address you in a proper way. But
I cannot do it. I am told to rest myself: I
will rest myself.
The Hon. the Speaker: The question is on
the motion for the third reading of Bill B,

WINNIPEG AND ST. BONIFACE HARBOUR
COMMISSIONERS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Arthur L. Beaubien moved the second reading of Bill D, an Act to amend the
Winnipeg and St. Boniface Harbour Commissioners Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
very short bill. The Winnipeg and St. Boniface Harbour Commission was incorporated
by chapter 55 of the statutes of 1912, and
the act was amended in 1938. At the present
time the corporation consists of seven members: three appointed by the City of Winnipeg, two by the City of St. Boniface, one by
the municipality of East Kildonan and one
by the municipality of West Kildonan. These
commissioners serve without remuneration.
Under the existing provisions of the act
the quorum for the transaction of business
is six. The corporation has reported that
because the members have a variety of business interests it is frequently found impossible to arrange for attendance of the present

quorum. In the circumstances, the Corporation is desirous of having its act amended
to provide that the quorum shall be simply
a majority of the members. This would place
the corporation's attendance requirement on
the same basis as that of the other harbour
commissions.
The bill would amend the act in accordance with the request of the commissioners.
If the bill receives second reading and any
member of the house desires to have it referred to committee, I will move that this be
done.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I do
not rise to object to the bill, but I should
like to be clear as to whether the honourable
senator from Provencher (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) said the number of commissioners was
to be increased to seven, or that there are
seven commissioners now.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: There are seven now.
The bill simply provides that a majority of
the commissioners will constitute a quorum
at business meetings. As I said before, the
commissioners have various business interests
to attend to besides their work on the commission, and frequently it is impossible to
obtain the present quorum of members at
commission meetings. Therefore it is desired
to change the quorum, so that instead of a
fixed quorum of six, the majority in attendance at a meeting will constitute a quorum.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I wish to assure the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid) that no ships have been lost in
the harbour since it was opened many years
ago, and it is not expected that any will be
lost there within the next few years, so it
appears likely a quorum of four will be
able to carry on the business. If an inquiry
were made as to the volume of freight carried on the river, I think it would be found
that about one boat of lumber passes down
the river in a year, and the same boat returns
next year.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I understood the
honourable senator from Provencher (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) to say that a majority of the
commissioners attending a meeting will constitute a quorum. What will constitute a
quorum is not a majority of the commissioners attending a meeting, but rather a majority
of the commissioners, is it not?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: That is what I intended to convey to honourable senators, and
I thought I had done so.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I wanted to be sure
that I understood correctly.

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, March
1, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Aseltine for the second reading of
Bill 0-6, an Act respecting divorce and
matrimonial causes.
Hon. George H. Barbour: Honourable senators, the honourable senator from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine), the promoter of this
bill, has a long and honoured experience in
this chamber and in the Senate Divorce Committee. Also he has had in his own province
an extensive practice in divorce cases, and,
no doubt, has received many letters from
married people who are separated and are
looking for some source of relief. In his
kindness, and from his genuine interest in
people, he has sponsored the bill which is
now before us.

chamber in 1938, and although it was passed During that year the total value of the liquor

MARCH 3, 1955
sold in all the provinces combined was $143
million. I also have a record of the liquor
sales in New Brunswick for one year. In
that province, which has a population of
536,000, the sales by the Liquor Control Board
during the fiscal year ending March 31, 1954,
amounted to more than $17 million, and the
net profit was $6,464,150. It may be said
that tourists buy a lot of this liquor. On the
other hand, I think the record indicates that
when the drinking people of a province leave
it to visit another province or another country
they continue to buy liquor.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: May I ask the honourable gentleman if he wishes to imply that the
province of New Brunswick is worse than
any other province?
Hon. Mr. Barbour: No, I do not. New
Brunswick is the only province for which I
have a record for 1954. Others may be as
bad.
Honourable senators, this is a serious
matter, because it appears that the sale of
liquor is increasing from year to year.
There is another point that I wish to make.
The Criminal Code, while it is wide in its
scope, does not cover everything. For instance, a man who leaves his wife and gets
"married" again, can be charged with bigamy
and given a prison sentence. On the ýother
hand, a man who leaves his wife and goes to
live with another woman and raises a family,
cannot be punished by any law that I know of.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Apparently you want that
kind of thing to continue.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: No. On the contrary,
I would like the Criminal Code to be amended
so as to provide a penalty for that. If such
an amendment were brought in, I would
support it.
Honourable senators, I have been making
decisions-not very hefty ones, perhaps-for
more than 60 years. They have not all been
good decisions, neither have they all been
bad.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Better be careful!
Hon. Mr. Barbour: If my decision to oppose
this bill is as good as one I made 48 years ago,
I will be quite satisfied.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: Forty-eight years ago
I felt that I could pretty nearly make a living
for myself, and that it would be a poor
woman who would not help a little, so I
decided to get married, and my decision
proved to be all right. I see some honourable senators in this chamber who made a
similar decision several years before I did,

and by their appearance, and from what I
see of them, I believe that if the good Lord will
leave them here they will be carrying on for
another 50 or more years. But that is in the
hands of Providence.
Honourable senators, I think that the public is not so much interested in what we say
in this chamber as in what we do here. I
assume that we are here for a purpose. We
are our own masters.
In closing, I should like to quote some
words of Sir Winston Churchill, who the
other day, in looking forward in his own
lifetime to peace in the world, said we should
"never fiinch, never weary, never despair."
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. James P. McIntyre: Honourable senators, it was not my intention to say anything
today with respect to this bill. But, for
reasons beyond my control, I have to leave
Ottawa within about three-quarters of an
hour, and as I will not be here when the bill
is voted on I would like to make my position clear at this time.
I wish to congratulate my honourable friend
from Prince (Hon. Mr. Barbour). He spoke
about liquor, and although in his time he
has had a good deal to do with it, I can safely
say that he never drank a drop of liquor in
his life. He was, however, Chief Preventive
Officer for the Province of Prince Edward
Island for many years, and in that position
he did a splendid job.
On looking up the historical background
of this divorce bill, I found that it was
copied from a similar bill passed in 1937
by the British Parliament. If the British
people think such a measure is a good thing,
all well and good, but we are entitled to
have the kind of legislation that we think
best suits our people.
I listened with care to the speech made by
my honourable friend from Victoria (Hon.
Mrs. Hodges), and I was surprised to hear
her say that, although she was opposed to
divorce, she was supporting the bill. Well,
honourable senators, if I was opposed to
something, it would take a lot of persuasion
to make me vote in favour of a measure that
would extend it.
In my province we do not believe in divorce
at all, but, as in most other provinces, we
must deal with certain cases, and a divorce
court has been set up. Now, if Parliament
passed a bill such as this one, which would
broaden and extend the grounds for divorce,
it would, I believe, have the effect of doubling
and perhaps trebling the number of cases
brought before Parliament and the provincial courts.

SENATE
Canada has been getting along very well
under its present divorce law. As we all
know, the cases in eight provinces are dealt
with by provincial courts; and those from
the other two provinces, Quebec and Newfoundland, are heard by a committee of this
house and finally dealt with by Parliament.
I have every respect for the sponsor of
this bill, the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), who in 1938 supported a similar bill in this house. That bill
was passed here by a slim majority, just four
votes.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: The motion for second
reading carried by more than ten votes.
Hon. Mr. McIntyre: The records I looked
at in the Library of Parliament showed that
the bill was given third reading, on division,
by a vote of 33 to 29. And among those who
voted against it at that time were some six
or seven honourable senators who are still
in this house. After its passage here the bill
was sent to the House of Commons, where
Mr. Dan McIvor moved that it be given the
six months' hoist, and his motion carried by
a large majority.
I cannot forecast what may happen to the
present bill, but I think the vote in this
house will be close. As I have already stated,
I will not be present when a vote is taken;
and my chief purpose in speaking at this
time is to say that if I were here I would
vote against the bill. I might add that I tried
to get an honourable senator to pair with me,
but I was unsuccessful.
The honourable senator from Rosetown
bas every right to sponsor this bill, and if it
fails to pass this time, be will be entitled to
try again. I am reminded that the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
sponsored his bill with respect to margarine
three times, and each time it was defeated.
He was then able to place the subject-matter
before the Supreme Court, and there he won
out. Similarly, if this bill fails to pass at the
present session, my friend from Rosetown
may exercise his right to present it again.
Hon. John P. Howden: Honourable senators, I have made no preparations to speak
today, but there are a few observations I
wish to make to the house. First, speaking
as a medical doctor, I am in accord with the
principle of this bill-a view which would
be shared by almost every doctor who has
been faced with the misery and suffering of
mismated couples. However, there are in the
bill certain features that I cannot agree to.
There seems to be some confusion about the
rules as to the point at which we adopt the
principle of a bill, but I have been told-I

need not say by whom-that if the bill is
given the second reading we cannot change it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, no.

Hon. Mr. Howden: I am just repeating
what I have been told.
It is my view that epilepsy should not be
included in this bill as a ground for divorce,
because very many epileptics recover entirely, and it is not a permanent disease that
persists from day to day. A man may have
a seizure, be unconscious for perhaps fifteen
minutes or a half hour, regain his senses and
probably be all right for the next week, the
next month or even for six months. The
condition known as petit mal is a minor illness. For instance, while talking to a person
so affected, you may notice that his face suddenly becomes set, he twitches a little bit,
drops down, but gets up in a couple of
minutes and is quite all right again. That is
the extent of petit mal.
With respect to the inclusion of insanity
in this bill, I hold the same view as I do with
respect to epilepsy. There are many forms
of insanity that have latent periods of unknown length, extending for weeks and
months, when a person will be quite normal.
There is also the condition known as senile
dementia-a disease affecting people of my
age and older-which causes persons to lose
their mentality and become completely unintelligent. Now, to separate couples because
one of them suffers from senile dementia
would inflict unfair hardship, and this condition should not constitute a ground for
divorce. For example, my own mother-inlaw, one of the loveliest women in the world,
lost her mentality, and we had to restrain
ber. Finally, after the death of my wife, and
when I was a practising doctor, away from
home a good deal and with only a maid in
the house, it was necessary to commit ber
to an institution.
I have said what I had to say, honourable
senators, namely, that I am against the inclusion in this bill of any reference to insanity
and epilepsy.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, I had not intended to participate
in this debate at this time, but after listening
to the remarks of two of my colleagues from
Prince Edward Island, whose hospitality it
has been my good fortune to enjoy-even
to the extent of travelling over some of the
historic rum-running battlefields with which
the honourable senator from Prince (Hon.
Mr. Barbour) had to associate in his duties
as Preventive Officer-I am impelled to make
some reference to the subject now under
discussion.
I do not think the problem of divorce, as
it is reflected in this bill, has any relation

MARCH 3, 1955
to the marriage unions which took place fifty,
or even thirty or forty, years ago.
Most of us can look back quite a long time
and visualize the conditions that prevailed
in this country during the periods that my
friend (Hon. Mr. Barbour) referred to when
he spoke of those happy events. However,
since that time Canada has become a "great"
international power. We have been compelled
to take our place and our part responsibly
in two of probably the most serious wars
that have been waged in the history of the
world. In our contributions to those wars
we have had to face the social problems that
have followed in their wake-problems, by
the way, which have followed in the trail of
wars from the beginning of history.
My honourable friend from Prince (Hon.
Mr. Barbour) has referred to the abuse of
the liquor traffic as one of the reasons for
this state of affairs. That abuse, I am free
to say, is due as much as anything else to
the restrictions that were imposed during the
war periods and to the subsequent reaction
upon their removal after the wars had ended.
Accompanying that condition have come farreaching dislocations in the social and economic life of our country which have been
accountable, in my opinion, for a great deal
of the incompatibility and unhappiness of
ill-considered and ill-advised marriages. In
other words, and this is my point, so long as
society in this country or in any other
country finds it impossible to avoid active
participation in war in which the youth of
the country is sacrificed, there is bound to

be an aftermath of disrupted social conditions, with an accompanying trail of divorces.
To deny these young people the right of
having a second chance and of regaining the
freedom which they have dreamed about,
would, I think, be the very antithesis of our
profession in this country of decent government and decent living conditions.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I was a member of this
house in 1938 and in a very modest way took
part in the debate on the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Bill which was submitted by
the late Senator McMeans of Winnipeg, who
was Chairman of the Senate Divorce Committee for a good many years. The debate on
that bill was one of the best I have ever
heard in Parliament, and if any members
are interested in the subject at all I would
recommend that they read it most carefully.
It was approached with the greatest amount
of seriousness and public spirit and it
brought out the viewpoints of the ablest men
in Parliament, and I think the results which
followed in this chamber was a perfectly
well justified conclusion of that discussion.
While it did not reach its full fruition in the
other house at that time, I believe it was a
precursor of what may come in the near
future.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL
CAUSES BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, March
3, the adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Aseltine for the second reading of Bill
0-6, an Act respecting divorce and matrimonial causes.
Hon. George H. Ross: Honourable senators,
the object of the bill under consideration is
to widen the grounds for divorce in those
provinces only in which the courts already
have jurisdiction to grant divorce.
I propose to discuss briefly some problems
relating to divorce.
First: I should like to see an additional
section inserted in the bill before us to this
effect:
This bill shall not extend to or apply in any
province unless and until the province requests it,
whereupon the Governor General in Council would
pass an order in council making it applicable in
such province.

I believe my adopted province of Alberta
would welcome it. On the other hand I doubt
if my native province of Prince Edward
Island would like to see its judges given the
wider powers set forth in this bill; and there
may be other provinces opposed to it. For
these reasons I think the bill should be
amended.
Secondly: "Cruelty" means legal cruelty
as now interpreted and construed by the
High Court of England in divorce and matrimonial causes. For my part I should prefer to
see cruelty defined by statute. In the case of

Evans v. Evans, some one hundred and
fifty years or so ago, Lord Stowell said that
in order to constitute cruelty in a matrimonial cause, the acts complained of must

have caused "danger to life, limb or health,
bodily or mental, or a reasonable apprehension of it." I think that definition is satisfactory, but if it is not, a definition should be
inserted, so that it would not be necessary
to refer to the English cases.
Thirdly, should a spouse be permitted to
sue for divorce without leave? I do not think
so. An application to sue might be heard in
camera by a judge, a psychiatrist, a clergyman or some other competent person, or by

MARCH 8, 1955
one or more of them, with both the husband
and wife present, and a chief aim would be
an attempt to reconcile the married couple.
The trier would have before him the complete
family record, and his decision would be made
with family welfare in mind. If he gave
the applicant permission to sue, a judge or
a Senate committee could then hear the case
as at present. If dissolution of the marriage
were granted it would be for real reasons, not
for trumped-up ones. If a spouse had to
obtain leave to sue before commencing action
by filing a petition with the Senate or in
court I believe a great many cases would
never come to trial, but would be settled in
advance. If such a change were made, a
bringing of the parties together by the trier in
attempting to bring about a reconciliation
should not defeat an action on the ground
of condonation if it later appeared that the
parties could not "make a go of it".
Fourthly: under court rules in many provinces, and under existing Senate rules, the
co-respondent or person with whom the respondent or person with whom the respondent
is alleged to have committed adultery must
be named in the petition. This may be useful
where the petitioner is claiming damages from
the co-respondent. But as the petitioner does
not claim damages in any petition for divorce
brought before the Senate, the reason for
the rule does not exist in petitions for divorce
to Parliament. I think the rule should be
changed and the co-respondent should not
be named. I have seen different cases in
which the co-respondent was a married person. His or her spouse learned of the adultery through the public record naming the
co-respondent, and this resulted in another
action for divorce. This practice increases
divorce. We should do what we can to discourage divorce.
Furthermore, should the co-respondent be
named in the petition or should his or her
name be disclosed during the course of a
trial, whether before a committee of the
Senate or before a court? I think the hearing
should be adjourned, and the co-respondent
should be served with a copy of the petition
and given a chance to appear to defend his
or her character.
Fifthly: I would like to see divorce actions
transferred from Parliament to the courts.
I wonder if it would be satisfactory to do
this by making domicile in divorce Canadawide. At the present time it is provincewide. If we were to enact a statute making
it Canada-wide, persons domiciled in Quebec
or Newfoundland could sue for divorce in a
court in another province which grants
divorces.

In Canada, as in most civilized countries,
it is a prerequisite to the exercise of jurisdiction to grant a divorce that the parties be
domiciled in the country in which the court
sits. A divorce obtained in a country other
than the domicile of the husband, even though
the respondent has submitted to the jurisdiction of the court by appearing and contesting the action, has no validity in Canada.
(Le Messurier vs Le Messurier, 1895 A.C.
517.)
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I interrupt my honourable friend to ask a question?
Hon. Mr. Ross: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does my friend state that
a divorce secured in the United States, for
example, after the proper legal residence bas
been established, and the laws of that state
have been complied with, would not be recognized in Canada? I do not think that is so.
Hon. Mr. Ross: If the plaintiff, say the
husband, leaves Canada and establishes
domicile in some state in the United States,
he can sue for divorce in that state and, if
it is granted, it will be recognized in Canada.
But, unless he acquires a domicile before
suing, the divorce bas no validity in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is the point I had in
mind.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: It is all a question of
domicile.
Hon. Mr. Ross: As Canada was given by
the British North America Act exclusive
jurisdiction in marriage and divorce, excepting only the solemnization of marriage,
and as domicile is such an important factor
in the obtaining of divorce, lawyers throughout Canada were much surprised when the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
held, in the Cook case, 1926 A.C. 444, that
domicile in divorce is not Canada-wide, but
province-wide only. The law officers of the
Crown apparently considered domicile in
divorce to be Canada-wide too, as since Confederation all statutes granting divorce refer
to the parties as being domiciled not in a
province, but in Canada. The words used are,
"domiciled in Canada."
A province-wide domicile discriminates
against women. Let me illustrate: A married
couple domiciled in Newfoundland disagree.
The husband may abandon his wife, go to
Vancouver, and acquire a domicile in British
Columbia for the express purpose of obtaining
a divorce. On making his domicile in British
Columbia, he can sue for divorce there.
(Baker vs. Baker, 49 Man. 163). It is not
often that a husband will abandon his wife

SENATE
and go to another province for the express
purpose of obtaining a divorce. But it is a
common thing for a corporation to transfer
employees from one province to another
where a husband may acquire a domicile and
sue for a divorce.
A wife cannot do that. Although ber home,
in the Newfoundland case to which I have
referred, is still there, yet ber domicile is in
British Columbia, even if she has never been
outside of Newfoundland. If she wishes to
sue in the courts for divorce, she must
go to British Columbia with her witnesses
to bring her action or to defend any action
brought against ber for divorce. The only
apparent exception is under the Divorce
Jurisdiction Act 1930, which does not confer
a separate domicile on a deserted wife, but
only preserves any right of action which she
may have had in the province in which she
was deserted. As the courts of Newfoundland have no power to grant divorces, she
is without remedy in the courts there.
Hon. Mr. Howden: Have we not jurisdiction here to recommend divorce in such a
case?
Hon. Mr. Ross: Yes, of course.
Hon. Mr. Baird: In other words, the wife
does not have to go to Vancouver.
Hon. Mr. Ross: If she wants to get a
divorce in the courts she must go to Vancouver. Of course, she can come to Parliament if she prefers.
Hon. Mr. Fournier: Will the honourable gentleman permit me, with great respect, to put
a question to him? Would he give us a definition of "domicile"? As long as we have no
definite understanding of what domicile is,
we are really not in a position to talk
about it.
Hon. Mr. Ross: Domicile is the place where
the husband chooses to make his permanent
home without any intention of leaving it and
making his home elsewhere.
Hon. Mr. Fournier: I do not wish to provoke
a lengthy discussion on this point, but may I
be permitted to pose a further question?
Suppose a man whose wife and family live
in Newfoundland, and whose business is
located there, moves to Vancouver, does his
domicile change from Newfoundland to
Vancouver?
Hon. Mr. Ross: If he goes to Vancouver to
spend a year, or to visit for a reasonably short
time, his domicile will remain in Newfoundland, but if he intends to move to and live
permanently in Vancouver, that will become
his domicile.

Hon. Mr. Howden: If he goes to another
place for six months, his domicile changes.
Hon. Mr. Ross: There is no definite period
of time which affects domicile.
Hon. Mr. Fournier: A man may be in a
place for as long as ten years and never have
his domicile there, because he never had the
intention of staying there.
Hon. Mr. Howden: How are we to know
what is the intention of a person?
Hon. Mr. Fournier: That depends on the
circumstances.
Hon. Mr. Ross: I-t is not time, but intention,
that governs domicile.
We could carry out what was possibly the
intention of the Fathers of Confederation and
at the same time place women on an equal
footing with men in divorce by making
domicile Canada-wide. I realize that there
are objections to it which will be apparent to
all. For that reason I do not suggest that
Canada-wide domicile be incorporated in the
bill now before us. I have simply discussed
it as a means of transferring divorce actions
from Parliament to the courts which might
be resorted to should applications for divorce
continue to increase in the future as they
have in the past.
I hope the bill now before us will receive
second reading and be referred to a
committee.
Hon. Charles B. Howard: Honourable senators, before I discuss the subject-matter
under debate, may I be permitted to express,
on behalf I am sure of every honourable senator in the house, our heartiest congratulations to the honourable senator from Ponteix
(Hon. Mr. Marcotte) on having today reached
his eighty-second birthday.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Howard: My remarks with respect
to this bill, honourable senators, will be short.
In brief, the measure proposes to widen the
grounds for granting divorce. I have listened
to arguments from outstanding doctors and
lawyers, all of them members of this honourable house, and I have listened as well to a
discussion of the subject by politically minded
people. In spite of all I have heard in favour
of the bill, I would tend to take another view,
based on the respect that a man must have
for the marriage vows he takes when he
marries.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

MARCH 8, 1955
Hon. Mr. Howard: I am sure each one of us
remembers well the vow he took when he
got married. This is the language of the
vows:
. . . to have and to hold from this day forward,
for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in
sickness and in health . .. till death us do part . . .

Every honourable senator could undoubtedly cite extraordinary cases where a husband
whose wife has been bedridden for many
years bas taken care of her, even to dressing
and feeding her, through a long period. For
example, one of the leading members in the
other bouse has suffered such an experience,
and we all respect him for the way he bas
carried his burden.
Hon. Mr. Howden: May I ask the honourable senator a question? What are we, the
members of the Divorce Committee, to do in
cases where neither the husband nor the
wife desires to respect the vows you have
just referred to?
Hon. Mr. Howard: That is just too bad for
them. But let us not forget that usually
people do not enter into these vows lightly.
Hon. Mr. Howden: But what are we to do
with people who have changed their minds?
Hon. Mr. Howard: I should like to go one
step further, and refer honourable senators
to St. Matthew, chapter XIX, verse 6 and also
to St. Mark, chapter X, verses 6-9. May I make
particular reference to verse 9, which reads:
What therefore God hath
not man put asunder.

joined

together, let

Hon. Mr. Reid: Read what the Bible says
about adultery.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Honourable senators, I
am opposed not only to divorce on the grounds
proposed in this bill, which I intend to vote
against, but I am opposed to divorce on any
ground.
Some Hon. Sena±ors: Hear, hear.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, like the honourable gentleman who has
just taken his seat, I oppose the principle of
this bill. Consequently, I too feel I must
vote against it.
If the proposals of this legislation were
implemented by Parliament, the divorce law
of this country would be changed by adding
three, and possibly four, new grounds for the
severance of the marriage bond. For the
reasons which I propose to outline to you, I
think that such a change in our divorce law
would be a retrograde step.
I can agree with the honourable gentleman
from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) when
he says that homes are hopelessly broken long
before the consorts ever resort to the courts.

It is a condition which leads to divorce that
cries most loudly for a remedy in this country,
and we all agree to that. Some of these have
been pointed out by the honourable gentleman
from Prince (Hon. Mr. Barbour) and the
honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert), and by other honourable senators.
These conditions are a cancer in the body
social. But I think also that divorce begets
divorce, and that easier divorce begets more
divorce. I think divorce is not only a
symptom of a social problem; I think it can
also be considered the cause of a social
problem.
I will agree that there are grievous defects
in the existing law and practice with reference to divorce in this country, but I think the
remedy proposed should not activate another
disease. I say also at once that Canadians
generally want the lowest possible divorce
rate to prevail in this country.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Now it seems to me that
the Senate of Canada should exercise the
greatest of caution before it adopts the principle of this bill. In the first place, I doubt if
Parliament as a whole bas a mandate to
pass it.
In 1938 a bill in almost identical terms was
passed by this chamber but failed to get approval in the House of Commons. Since that
time four general elections have been held
in Canada and I think that no mandate for
this type of legislation was given the Government elected at any of those elections.
There have been times in the history
of the Senate when legislation from the
House of Commons has not commended itself
to a majority of this house. Examples are
available to show that despite that situation
the Senate bas passed such legislation in the
belief that a majority in the other place had
a mandate from the country to pass it. But
that is not the present situation. When this
second chamber initiates legislation I believe
we should be satisfied both that the legislation is for the betterment of the country as
a whole and that the legislation carries a
considerable measure of popular approval.
I think those two tests were met in the margarine legislation and in the new Income
Tax Act, to take but two recent examples.
But I say they are not met here.
Now, honourable senators, I do not propose to found my argument against this bill
upon any theological, doctrinal or dogmatic
premise. but I do say at once that as Canada's
Upper Chamber-a representative body and
a body of great responsibility-the Senate
cannot be unmindful of these factors. Church
and state have a mutual interest in matters

SENATE
of public policy affecting such fundamentals
as the family, marriage, divorce, education,
inheritance, crime and many other facets of
life in society. Even the ancient patriarchal
institutions of pre-Christian times-of the
Hebrews, of the Greeks, the Romans with
their idea of paterfamiliasand patria potestas,
and the Chinese too-testify to the fact that
both the civil side and the religious side of
life and society have a contribution to make
to social problems. This view has been reinforced by the Christian dispensation. No
responsible body of legislators can afford to
ignore it, and I think that the Senate of
Canada would not dream of ignoring it.
But before proceeding I would like to refer
to and re-echo the words expressed here
earlier in the session by the Leader of the
Opposition, (Hon. Mr. Haig), when he commended the members of our Standing
Committee on Divorce for the exceptionally
high quality and the judicial character of the
work they do. We all recognize that Parliament and the country are their debtors for
the high capacity they bring to their deliberations and for the manner in which they discharge their duties.
Hon. Sena±ors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: The periodie reports
that are made on the work of that committee
by the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) emphasize this,
and I for one do hope he continues to present
such facts to Parliament and to the country.
Hon. Senajors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Unfortunately the work
done by that committee has been subjected
to unwarranted criticism from poorly informed quarters. I do hope that we always
point out the importance and the value, particularly the judicial quality, of the work
they do.
This session the committee is going to have
to deal with some 475 cases; all of tLem
involve domestic unhappiness, many of them
involve tragedy. I know it is a very heavy
burden for the members of that committee
to sit as frequently and for as long hours as
they do.
Frankly, I must say that I regret the circumstances which require so many capable
members of this body to spend so much time
and energy on that work which is of a judicial
character. Members of the Senate are
primarily legislators and I think, with all
respect, I can say that if that time and that
energy could be devoted to the more constructive work that this body can and does
do, the country would be better for it.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Connolly: I would like to add
this too, that I know the honourable gentleman who sponsors this bill and those who
support it do so out of a deep conviction
that it will improve the lot of Canadians
generally. While I take the opposite position,
I do respect their point of view.
Now, it might be helpful if I stated a few
propositions which I consider to be. fundamental to the argument I would like to
make to this chamber. None of them are new.
The purpose of marriage is to beget and
educate children. By entering the married
state consorts assume a triple responsibility:
first, to each other; second, to their issue
actual or potential; and third, to society.
And I say further that this responsibility is
a personal responsibility and duty on the
part of each consort.
But in my view divorce reverses the purpose of marriage. I think it completes family
disorganization. I think it is the final demoralizer for the consorts and the children
in the home.
The family is the true unit of the larger
organization, which is society. And it is
natural for men and women to live in society.
Since divorce strikes at the family, the basic
unit of society, divorce is alien to the welfare of society as a whole, and so in my
view divorce offends against the natural law.
Apart altogether from the religious or the
quasi-religious aspects of the divorce problem, I believe there are rational grounds for
refusing this legislation, grounds which
touch democratie considerations, grounds
which touch sociological considerations and
grounds which touch philosophical considerations.
The honourable gentleman from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) and others who support
this measure have given some, and I know
they can give many other, instances of unhappiness, of tragedy and of human suffering
resulting from hopelessly broken homes. No
one with a heart in his body can fail to
sympathize with many of these cases. The
tragedy of broken homes touches many
people, and all of us know of pitiful cases.
But the general legislation passed by this
Parliament, we must always remember,
should not be framed for the relief of some
individuals or classes. The common good of
the country must be the governing factor.
Victim cases we shall always have-cases in
which otherwise sound general legislation
creates not only inequities but at the same
time unfairness. Anyone who bas dealt with
tax legislation knows how true this can be.
But in domestic cases they are more personal and more poignant.

MARCH 8, 1955
If legislative relief can be supplied without
doing general damage, such relief is good
legislation. The trial and error method is
always part of our democratic legislative
machinery. But we are not justified in providing relief for "victim cases", if the damage we do is inimical to the common welfare.
I would even say that many of the people
who would take advantage of these new
grounds for divorce are not people whom
those who support the bill would feel should
be helped:-I mean, those willing to shirk
marital responsibilities as readily as possible.
In our approach to this problem much can
be learned from the experience in other
countries. Since the beginning of the century
there has been an increased easing in the
divorce laws of many lands. This unfortunate
trend has been refiected in a mounting rate
of divorce, as the following figures will show.
I take them from Chambers' Encyclopedia,
vol. IV, page 565:
In the United Kingdom in 1912 the divorce
rate was *26 per cent of the marriages of
that year. In 1946 it had risen to 8 per cent.
In the United States it went from 9.4 per
cent in 1912 to 31 per cent in 1945.
In France the increase was from 4-6 per
cent in 1912 to 9.7 per cent in 1946.
In Denmark the rate was 3-5 per cent in
1912, and in 1946 18-6 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask: percentage of
what?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Of the number of marriages performed in the given years.
In Norway it was 6-9 per cent of the
marriages performed in that country in 1912,
and 15 -1 per cent of those performed in 1945.
In New Zealand it was 2-2 per cent in
1912, and 10.6 per cent in 1946.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Is not that per thousand?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: No, it is the percentage
of all marriages for the given year.
While I recognize that there are provisions
in this bill which restrict divorce more than
is the case in many jurisdictions in the United
States, it may be useful to look at the divorce
situation in that country. There the rate is
higher than in any country for which I have
been able to get figures.
Perhaps I might say something first about
the grounds available for divorce in the various jurisdictions of the United States. In 48
States and in the District of Columbia divorce
is granted upon proof of adultery-now the
principal ground for divorce in Canada. In
44 jurisdictions in the United States divorce
may be granted for cruelty; in 47 for desertion; in 43 for felony; and in 29 for nonsupport; and there are other grounds.

From the 1953 World Almanac I have
secured the following figures as to the United
States position:
Based on 1,000 population in 1890, the marriage rate was 9 and the divorce rate was -5.
In 1925 the marriage rate was 10 -3, and the
divorce rate was 1-5, or three times the rate
in 1890. By 1950 the marriage rate per 1,000
of population was 11 and the divorce rate
was 2.5, or five times the rate sixty years
earlier.
Rates, however, can be misleading. Let us
look at some figures.
In 1900 in the United States there were
709,000 marriages and 55,700 divorces; in 1925
there were 1,180,000 marriages and 175,000
divorces; in 1950 there were 1,667,000 marriages and 385,000 divorces. For the ten-year
period from 1942 to 1951, 4,219,000 divorces
were granted in the United States, an average
of 400,000 divorces each year.
From Whitaker's Almanac I learn that just
over 6,000 divorces were granted in the
United Kingdom in 1938. This was the period
when the divorce laws there were liberalized.
In 1951 over 28,000 divorces were granted,
and in 1953 the figure had risen to over 33,000.
In this same period the population of the
United Kingdom was 47ý million at its lowest
and 502 million at its height.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Did that increase of divorces
result from the extension of the grounds for
divorce?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: That, I think, is the
fair inference.
Now as to Canada. The Canada Year Book
for 1954 supplies reasonably accurate information about the position in this country. As
the honourable senator from Prince (Hon. Mr.
Barbour) has said, in 1900 there were eleven
divorces granted in Canada: in 1952 there
were 5,562. In the ten-year period from 1943
to 1952 over 57,000 divorces were granted
in Canada. In Ontario the total went from just
over 200 in 1930 to just over 2,200 in 1950.
In British Columbia the level of divorce was
222 in the year 1930. and 1.377 in 1950.
I apologize if I have wearied the house
with too many figures. I would not want to
draw any unwarranted conclusions from these
statistics. But the inference seems inescapable
that there is a definite causal relationship
between the numbers and rate of divorce in
a -country on the one hand and the liberality
of its divorce laws on the other. It is true
that the real causes of most divorces are
deeper than the divorce laws. It does appear
to be true, however, that the easier the access
to the divorce courts and the more numerous
the grounds for divorce, the greater are the

SENATE
numbers and rates of divorce. In our own
country the figures for Ontario and British
Columbia seem to bear this out.
What are the effects of a high rate of
divorce upon a country? We are concerned
at times with the increase in juvenile delinquency, with the lowering of moral standards,
with a demoralization in parts of our social
structure. Without resorting to statistics
again, it is fair to say that people concerned
with crime prevention-the sociologists and
the social workers-all condemn the increasing prevalence of divorce and they call it a
major contributing factor to many of these
undesirable social problems.
I wondered what the actual effect of
divorce would be upon children, particularly
in the United States, where there have been
some very extensive studies made, and I
found a report published by the Duke University Press, in Durham, North Carolina, in a
periodical called Law and Contemporary
Problems. The conclusions reached in that
study were that from 150,000 to 200,000 children are affected by divorce each year in
the United States. The peak year of divorce
following the war-probably 1945 or 1946its author claimed, would see as many as
300,000 children involved in divorce cases.
With regard to the total number of children
of divorced parents, the same writer gave
the figure of 1,433,000 for the year 1940. It
was admitted that this estimate probably
errs below rather than over the actual
number.
Several decades ago, when the divorce rate
in the United States was much lower than it
is in that country today, President Theodore
Roosevelt was .concerned with the problem
which is now engaging our attention, and he
said this:
Easy divorce is a bane to any nation. It is a
curse to society and a menace to home, an
incitement to married unhappiness, an evil thing
for men and a still more evil thing for women.

Admittedly we do not take our social
philosophy from the leaders of the Russian

state, but it may be of interest to record
what has happened in that country in relation
to divorce. Engels taught that the family was
based upon economics, upon private property.
The Communist Manifesto proclaimed, following Engels, that the family would disappear with capital. Even inheritance was
abolished.
The Matrimonial Codes of Russia in 1918
and 1927 both taught that all children
belonged to the state. This included women
between the ages of 17 and 32. Church marriages were invalidated and the rights of
husbands were abolished. Admittedly these
doctrines promoted great extremes of free

love and family destruction. Izvestia reported
some figures in 1935. In 1934 in Moscow it
was found that there were 57,000 births that
year to 154,000 abortions. In the villages the
figures were over 242,000 births and 324,000
abortions. It was also believed that in this
period there were some seven million homeless children in the streets of the cities and
towns, bent on thievery and crime of all
kinds.
Not on any moral grounds but because the
authorities recognized the danger to their
state, the Journal of the Commissariat of
Justice had to reverse the former proclamations on the family, and affirned the perpetuity of the marriage bond. I am informed that
in Russia today divorce is very difficult. That
is the other extreme.
Mr. Walter Lippmann, the eminent American
political scientist and philosopher, bas
recently published a book called The Public
Philosophy. It contains many wise and valuable statements upon government in general,

and I am sure that most honourable senators
would read the book with great pleasure and
satisfaction. Many of Lippmann's views bear
upon the argument I make here. He asks the
question: "Is there a public philosophy .

.

.a

body of positive principles and precepts which
a good citizen cannot deny or ignore?" Lippmann is convinced that there is; that it is
known as the natural law and that it is
the premise of the institutions of Western
society. He traces it from the ancient world
through the Romans to the Christians, and
he finds it to be the basis of British and
American constitutional order.
It is not a body of law which can be
enforced in our courts. It is a way of looking
at things. In the simple society of the 18th
century the natural law provided the principles upon which the free states were
founded. But in the 19th century the idea
was abandoned to the reactionaries. Now,
Lippmann says, this public philosophy unfortunately is gone. And he continues:
And all that the defenders of freedom have to
defend in common is a public neutrality and a
public agnosticism . . . Modern men have a low
capacity to believe in the invisible, the intangible,
the imponderable . . . To repair the capacity to
believe in the public philosophy it will be necessary
to demonstrate the practical relevance of the
public philosophy-much as the Roman lawyers
worked out the jus gentium-

-the

law of the nations-

and related it to the jus naturale

-the

natural law.

Lippmann admits that the public philosophy
cannot be popular. But its warrant is that
the results of rational and disciplined government will be good.

MARCH 8, 1955
This is the argument with which I would
associate myself in my approach to this bill.
The liberalization of divorce law offends
against the principles of the natural law because it attacks the natural basis of the social
structure-the family, the home.
In 1905 Mr. G. K. Chesterton, the eminent
English journalist, wrote these words:
The vice of the modern notion of mental progress
is that it is always something concerned with the
breaking of bonds, the effacing of boundaries, the
casting away of dogmas.

I think that is'another way of saying what
Lippmann concludes in his new book. For my
part, I do not become too disturbed to learn
that we in Canada are 500 years behind the
times. Five hundred years ago the men from
whom we inherit the institutions and traditions of our Western culture based it upon
an appreciation of the natural law. Wecannot have it both ways. We cannot ignore the
natural law, as we would by passing this
bill, and at the same time promote our western and democratic traditions.
I think that the Parliament of Canada,
and senators of Canada, can do better for the
social problems of their country than to open
escape hatches which will be used mainly to
free the irresponsible from their duties to
their spouse, to their children actual or potential, and, in a very special sense, to their
country. I think the higher purposes of the
cradle and the clan are more worthy of our
earnest attention.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Bouffard, the debate
was adjourned.
PRIVATE BILL
ST. MARY'S RIVER BRIDGE COMPANYSECOND READING

Hon. Thomas Farquhar moved the second
reading of bill N-8, an Act to incorporate St.
Mary's River Bridge Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to form a Company to build a
bridge over or a tunnel under the St. Mary's
River at Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. The Council of the City of Sault Ste. Marie has had
this question under active consideration for
some years and has now come to the conclusion that definite action should be taken
regarding it.
The two Sault's are often referred to as
the hub of the Great Lakes, and the location
supplies the only international border crossing between the Westerly end of Lake Superior and the Southerly end of Lake Huron,
some 700 miles, and gives connection with
great East-West and North-South arterial

highways of the United States. As it is becoming an increasingly important link with
the United States, the ever increasing need
of adequate facilities for crossing the river by
traffic of all kinds presents an urgent problem
for solution; and in keeping with many other
international boundary points a bridge seems
the best and most natural solution.
I am informed that in 1927 the number
of motor vehicles which crossed the river
by ferry at Sault Ste. Marie was 76,000; and
the number has increased, until in 1954 there
were approximately 290,000. In heavy periods
the traffic cannot be handled without considerable delays.
The present needs will grow very quickly
and the growth rate accelerate by reason of
many factors that are developing, including
the Mackinac Straits Bridge at present under
construction at the Straits of Mackinac, 60
miles south of Sault Ste. Marie, which will
connect Southern Michigan with the upper
peninsula of Michigan by the longest suspension span in the world. The four-lane
highway on the bridge will have an estimated capacity of 3,000 cars each way per
hour. Traffic experts estimate the bridge
will carry 1,927,000 cars in 1958, as compared to ferry crossing of 900,782 in 1953;
and that traffic will increase steadily year
by year by an additional 100,000 cars, trucks
and buses. The Sault has every reason to
expect to share to an appreciable degree in
this heavy increase of traffic. Preliminary
estimates by the same traffic experts with
reference to the proposed bridge at Sault
Ste. Marie has indicated traffic, and increasing traffic, at this point sufficient to interest
financial interests in the project.
We are informed that a four-lane highway
from Southern Michigan to Sault Ste. Marie
via the Mackinac Bridge is assured and will
tap important transcontinental roads in the
heavily populated States neighbouring on
Michigan. This is bound to result in ever
increasing traffic to the north, especially with
no delays in crossing the Straits of Mackinac.
The Government of Ontario has indicated
that the Trans-Canada highway around the
north shore of Lake Superior will be completed within the next five years. This will
give a tremendous impetus to tourist traffic
and will add substantially to the inflow at
this point of vehicles from the United States.
A bridge will give continuous, around-theclock, dependable service throughout the
year and will avoid any tie-ups in service
from ice conditions. The great increase of
heavy type transportation by truck is common knowledge and is becoming more and
more an economic factor of importance to
industry. A bridge accommodating such

transportation will add important advantages
to industry trading into the great markets of
the Middle West of the United States.
The area around Sault Ste. Marie is recognized as vital in international defence matters because of the importance of the Locks
located there; and important measures have
been taken, and installations effected, towards adequate protection. This involves
prompt movement of defence forces and
heavy equipment between the two countries.
A bridge would be of great advantage towards such defensive strength in that area.
Honourable senators, if the bill is given
the second reading tonight I will move that
it be referred to the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications for further
detailed study.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: May I ask the honourable senator how many more miles are required to complete that North Shore road?
Hon. Mr. Farquhar: I cannot give the exact
figures. I believe that up to the present time
they have built close to 100 miles north of
Sault Ste. Marie. The city council has the
assurance of the Ontario Government that
the road will be completed through to the
head of the lake within five years.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The bill as finally
passed by Parliament provided that it should
come into effect on a date to be fixed by
the Governor in Council. A proclamation
was issued fixing the lst day of April, 1955,
and it is deemed advisable that this commencement date be set forth in the statutes.

Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
I very much favour the proposal to set out
the effective date of commencement of the
new Code in the statutes rather than by order
in council. One reason for saying so is
that failure to issue an order in council in
similar circumstances once caused me some
trouble. A client who had a claim against
the old Grand Trunk Railway came to me on
the last day of the period within which he
had a right of action against the railway and
asked me to sue. I very hurriedly issued a
writ and prepared a statement of claim
against the Canadian National Railways, with
which the Grand Trunk Railway had then
been amalgamated by statute. However, I soon
learned that an order in council proclaiming
the statute had not been issued, and of course

HONOURABLE CAIRINE R. WILSON
TWENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY AS
MEMBER OF THE SENATE

A

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, it gave us great pleasure this afternoon
to attend at the House of Commons when a
bust was unveiled to the first lady commoner,
the late Miss Agnes Macphail. We in the
Senate are more fortunate: we still have
with us the first woman senator, the honourable lady from Rockcliffe (Hon. Mrs. Wilson).
Our honourable colleague recently completed
her twenty-fifth year of service to Canada as
a senator. This fact first came to my attention because of an interesting article which
appeared in the column "Ottawa Scene", a
weekly feature of the Toronto Globe and Mail,
in which reference was made to the five
Alberta women who in the 1920's started a
movement to have the word "persons", as
used in the British North America Act, interpreted to include women. I quote from the
article:
This group of five, to whom Canadian women
owe a larger debt than many today realize, were
Irene Parlby, one-time cabinet minister in the
Alberta Legislature, and sole survivor of the group;
Mrs. Nellie L. McClung, Judge Emily Murphy, Mrs.
Henrietta Muir Edwards, who as convener of laws
Council of Women became

the National
thoroughly versed in the legal position of women,
and Mrs. Louise McKinney, a national president
of the WCTU.
It

is

most

interesting

to

note

that

the

honourable senator from Rockcliffe was summoned to the Senate on the recommendation

of the Right Honourable William Lyon
Mackenzie King, then Prime Minister of
Canada, on St. Valentine's Day, 1930.
I am sure all honourable senators join with
me tonight in extending our best wishes to the
honourable lady senator on her twenty-fifth
anniversary as a member of this house. To
the dean of women senators we wish good
health and many more years in which to
participate in our deliberations and to serve
her country.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I too would like to say a few words on
this interesting subject. I join with the
Leader of the Government in the Senate (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) in extending congratulations
to the honourable senator from Rockcliffe
(Hon. Mrs. Wilson).
This afternoon we
heard some splendid speeches on the occasion
of the unveiling of a bust in memory of the
first woman member of the House of Commons, Miss Agnes Macphail, who passed
away not long ago. We are, however, fortunate, as the leader stated, in having an
opportunity to pay tribute to the first lady
senator while she is still with us.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: She owes her appointment to this house, as has been mentioned,
to those five women in Alberta who believed
that the word "persons" as used in the
British North America Act included women.
Their view, however, received no judicial
recognition in Canada. In fact, the Supreme
Court of Canada held that the word as used
in that act meant members of the male sex
only. Fortunately for our honourable women
senators there was at that time a right of
appeal, which we no longer have, from the
Supreme Court of Canada to the Privy
Council in England. The decision given by
the Privy Council, upholding the view of the
five Alberta women, has benefited this
chamber and Canada as a whole. Since that
time five women have been summoned to
this chamber, all of whonï have become very
valuable members of it. I wish heartily to
congratulate the honourable senator from
Rockcliffe not only on having been the first
woman to be summoned to this chamber,
but also on having attained her twenty-fifth
anniversary as a senator. We join in the hope,
as expressed by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, that she may be with
us for many years to come.
Hon. Cairine R. Wilson:
Honourable
senators, this is just a little bit overwhelming, but it is very delightful to have these
gracious tributes paid in my hearing.

SENATE
Having heard the words of commendation
and praise paid to the late Agnes MacPhail
this afternoon, I should like to say to my
colleagues in this chamber that I have always
been well received here. I did not feel that
the all-male Senate showed any sense of
resentment at my entrance here, although I
imagine that inwardly there might have been
a feeling that their sanctum was being
invaded. Miss Macphail once told me that
she would not like to see any other woman
go through what she had to go through when
she first came into the House of Commons.
I repeat, that from the outset I have been
treated in this house as one of the family,
and for that I am very grateful.
When I heard the honourable senator from
Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard) refer to the
82nd birthday of the honourable senator from
Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte), I was reminded
that he is my junior in the Senate. When
the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) and the Acting Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) said they
would like to have me here for a long time
yet, they were careful not to mention another
twenty-five years. It is nice to be received
so cordially, and I thank you all for your very
kind words.
I confess that this year I was rather pleased
that both my birthday and the anniversary
of my appointment to this chamber fell on
days when the Senate was adjourned for a
long week-end; however, they apparently did
not go entirely unnoticed.

Incidentally, I notice that the article to
which the honourable Leader referred states
that my youngest daughter was five years old
when I entered the Senate. Inadvertently, a
year was added to her age, but she may be
grateful for it when the time comes to claim
her pension. At any rate, I have not heard
any protests from her yet.
I would like to point out that the famous
five women from Alberta first took their case
to the Supreme Court of Alberta, which
decided against them. They appealed to the
Supreme Court of Canada, where the
decision went against them, with only Sir
Lyman Duff, later Chief Justice, dissenting. Then, with true feminine persistence,
they appealed to the Privy Council in London.
May I add that they did so with the full
support of the then Minister of Justice, the
late Right Honourable Ernest Lapointe, who
seemed to have a high regard for women's
capabilities, and to whom, I am sure, the
other women in this chamber are grateful.
Incidentally, I notice that the article draws
attention to the rather curious fact that the
late Right Honourable W. L. Mackenzie King,
having recommended one woman for appointment to the Senate, never recommended
another. I do not know if that was because
of any failing on my part, or whether, as he
said, it was his first and only experience of
proposing, and he did not wish to repeat it.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow
at 3 p.m.

DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL
CAUSES BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate: resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Aseltine for the second reading of Bill 0-6,
an Act respecting divorce and matrimonial
causes.
Hon. Paul H. Bouffard: Honourable senators, the bill which I propose to discuss at
this time is surely one of the most important
ever to be introduced in this chamber.
Highly divergent opinions have been expressed by those who have already dealt
with it. Beyond any question, those who have
discussed the matter have done so in perfect
good faith and with a view to serving the
interests of the Canadian nation. I would,
however, point out something which, to my
mind, is important. Nearly all those who
have spoken so far on broadening the
grounds for divorce have admitted that, in
principle, they are against divorce and that
they approve of it only in exceptional cases,
in order to avoid a greater evil.
I want to say, at the outset, that I do not
intend to consider this bill from the religious
point of view; on that score the opinion of
Catholics is well known. Freedom of creed
is a precious freedom for all of us. I respect
the opinion of others, as much as I insist that
mine shall also be respected. The social
standpoint is the only one which I shall
consider.
The general and unconditional broadening
of grounds for divorce is generally considered

as a great evil. That is why even those who
are most in favour of it accept it only with
the gravest reservations. They seek to relieve
the parties in what they call the extreme
cases, for whom the continuation of the
marital bond involves greater hardship than
divorce. It would appear therefore, and beyond doubt, that all of us recognize divorce as
a social evil, as a wound to be treated with
the greatest care, or as a remedy to be used
in very particular and exceptional cases only.
Let us not forget either that this plague
is not particular to Canada. Nearly all
countries in the world are afflicted with it;
and the experiment which it is proposed to
make in Canada is not the first one of its
kind. It has been tried in many countries,
under the leadership of legislators who were
as convinced as are some members of this
house that divorce should be approved in
order to avoid a greater evil and to untie a
bond which, in fact, no longer exists.
Unfortunately, however, the experience
which these various countries have had is not
encouraging. It should, on the contrary, convince us that if divorce has in fact settled
some especially unfortunate cases, it has given
rise to most serious abuses. By granting freedom in several cases these countries have
opened wide this wound which festers and
decays, to the point that many countries
have adopted the opposite stand and others
are seeking solutions which are difficult to
apply once bad habits have become too deeply
rooted.
Canada, far from making similar exper
ments, should rather, in my opinion, draw
from them the most serious lesson and put
them to account, not by broadening the
grounds for divorce, but by restricting them
more and more and by being more and more
exacting, even in the case of adultery, which
has so far been about the only accepted
ground for divorce throughout Canada.
The honourable senator from Victoria (Hon.
Mrs. Hodges) did not fail to deplore the admission of simulated adultery as evidence upon
which the judgments of our courts and of the
Senate are so often based. I entirely agree
with her. However, I fail to see how the
remedy for this already enlarged and festering wound can lie in broadening the grounds
for divorce.
A more painstaking inquiry, less trust in
these sham adulteries, closer questioning of
the parties requesting divorce and of the
co-respondents, would appear to me a better
way of correcting abuses than a broadening
of the grounds for divorce, which would have
no other effect than to increase the number
of cases based on such simulated evidence,
which is all too frequent at the present time.

MARCH 9, 1955
There are some who claim that the people
from Quebec and Newfoundland are not
interested in this question, since it does not
affect them. Let us not forget that all senators, whatever part of the country they may
belong to, are bound to examine all federal
legislation carefully and to consider the interests of each and every part of Canada when
a bill as important as this one is brought
before Parliament. It is the duty of every
member of the Senate to study the measure
in detail and to express an opinion on the
good or evil which it may bring to a certain
part of Canada, and it is the duty of every
senator who thinks that it will affect some
more or less extensive part of Canada to
express his opinion.
The bill before us is a social measure of
capital importance. Those of us who are
convinced that it endangers the very foundations of our Canadian society are bound
to oppose it even if the part of Canada in
which we live is not affected. We represent
here the whole of Canada, not only one
locality or one province.
But Quebec and Newfoundland are affected.
In so far as petitions from these two provinces are concerned, Parliament has up to this
time considered no other ground for divorce
than adultery; but I am firmly convinced that
if this bill were passed Parliament would,
less than a year later, be recommending and
granting divorce on the same grounds as
were then accepted in the rest of Canada.
I will attempt to prove later on that those
who imagine that this bill would not affect
Quebec or Newfoundland are mistaken. I
am afraid, and I think rightly so, that once
Parliament accepted this bill it would be
bound to extend the measure before long to
all parts of Canada. A striking example of
this was the bill which established divorce
courts in eight of the ten provinces of Canada.
It was not supposed to affect Quebec or
Newfoundland. However, in every session in
recent years a bill has been introduced in
the House of Commons for the sole purpose
of imposing divorce courts upon those two
provinces.
The bill defines the word "court" in section
2 (a), which refers to section 3. Section 3
states:
This act shall apply to and in those provinces
of Canada wherein there are now constituted and
maintained courts of divorce and matrimonial
causes having jurisdiction to decree dissolution of
marriage, and to and in such provinces only.

Such is the definition of the word "court".
The definition establishes the jurisdiction of
the courts in each province, and the act
would apply in all provinces where such
courts exist.
50437-17à

Are there in the province of Quebec courts
of matrimonial causes having jurisdiction to
dissolve a marriage? There is no doubt in
my mind that such courts exist in the province of Quebec. The Superior Court has that
general jurisdiction. Has this court jurisdiction to annul a marriage? Undoubtedly.
One bas only to review the provisions of the
Civil Code to find in what circumstances the
Superior Court in the province of Quebec
can declare a marriage null ab initio voidable
and that it should be dissolved.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I interrupt the
honourable senator? Can those whose marriage is declared null in such cases remarry?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Certainly. I am not
talking of separation from bed and board,
I am talking of a full dissolution of marriage,
and the Civil Code specifies several causes
for dissolution of marriage. I will cite a few
examples. Nullity can be decreed if natural
or accidental impotency existed when the
marriage took place. That is one cause.
Nullity can be decreed when the marriage
has been contracted by a minor without
having obtained the necessary consent. That
is another cause. Nullity can be decreed if
the marriage is between close relatives
whether in a direct or collateral line. That
is a third cause. Nullity can also be decreed
if there is a religious obstacle resulting from
relationship, whether natural or by affinity,
and affinity there means by marriage. That
is a fourth cause. I could cite some more.
Under the Civil Code there are cases where
the marriage is null ab initio and consequently
the marriage has never existed, and there
are others where the court can decree an
annulment. Such a case would be where the
marriage was contracted without the free
consent of husband and wife.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I do not like to interrupt,
but may I ask if the same provisions apply
in the other provinces? Can their courts
declare marriages null and void?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I am not sure.
Hon. Mr. Howard: I think so, yes.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It must be so. I do not
know exactly what legislation on marriage
there is in the other provinces, but the
federal Parliament having legislated on marriage, I am inclined to believe that the other
provinces must have courts which are able
to declare marriage either null or voidable.
A marriage can also be dissolved if it was.
contracted without the free consent of husband and wife. Any marriage which was not:
contracted publicly or before an authorized,
official may also be annulled. This enumeration leaves no doubt as to the existence in

SENATE
Quebec of courts with jurisdiction over
matrimonial causes, and, therefore, it is possible to question the exclusive application of
this measure to provinces other than Quebec
and Newfoundland. It would be very unfortunate to find that it applies to Queber and
Newfoundland, even if all the members of
this house do not think it should apply to
either of these provinces. I would suggest
that all provinces to which the act applies
should be named specifically, in order to
remove any ambiguity on the point.
Such are the serious reasons why the members of the Senate who come frorn Quebec and
Newfoundland should take an active interest
in this question and try to foresee the difficulties into which the bill would soon involve
the two provinces which are not supposed to
be affected by it.
As far as I am concerned, I am opposed to
divorce, both from the social standpoint and
as a means of correcting or relieving an error,
and I propose to vote against this bill. A
study of the experience of some of the countries we know best will easily show to what
extent it has been unfruitful, not to say
frightful. In France divorce was not recognized before the Revolution, but apparently
that did not prevent France from developing
into or from being at that time one of the
most important and powerful countries.
]ecause of her artistic and literary achieve-ments she was then the most admired country
in the world. The Revolution thought it
could rebuild France. I do not believe it was
a success. Of course, this was not entirely
due to the recognition of divorce. Divorce
was one of the novelties inaugurated by the
Revolution. Only a few years later France,
though still revolutionary, had to reconsider
its decision and prohibit divorce entirely.
The divorce law was first established in
France in 1792, that is to say three years

divorces than marriages. The act of 1884 and
the amendments enacted thereunder were
drawn up in very much the same terms as
those of the measure now before this house.
The terms of the French law were even
stricter than those of the proposed bill, in
that, in 1884, a woman could not marry
before the expiration of a certain interval.
The act provided for the care of the children
and attempted to control the financial position of husband and wife. The arguments
advanced in France in 1884 in favour of a
divorce law were exactly the same as those
put forward in the Senate at the present time.
The French law was designed to correct
certain pitiful situations, to settle certain
specific cases, to break bonds which the
abuses of one or the other of the parties had
already irrevocably broken. As a French

diately after the coming into effect of the

dropped in 1816, and for a period of almost
seventy years France refused to recognize
divorce on any ground. She has, unfortunately returned to her former legislation and
is now suffering, as are all other countries
going through the same experience, from the
disastrous results which divorce brings to any
country which opens its doors to it. Mr.
Mailhé-and I am talking about not a great
Catholic, but a man who did not practice
at that time-in reporting to both houses of
the French Parliament, could not refrain from
saying:

new law, in 1938, the cases totalled 7,500; and

the start of the revolution.

It

You cannot soon enough put a stop to the torrents
of immorality let loose by these disastrous laws.

In Paris, during the Revolution and for a
few years thereafter, there were more

writer so aptly put it:
In analysing the various arguments advanced,
one is brought to the conclusion that if the arguments of those who urged divorce had been true,
the problem would no longer exist.
But the
terrifying increase in divorces now endangers the
institution of marriage itself. Trumped-up charges
of desertion and cruelty are more often resorted to
than shan charges of adultery.

In France, divorce is a mere formality.
The court of the district of the Seine has
granted more than 270 divorces in a single
day. Such are the results of a law very
similar to the measure now before this house.

Hon. Mr. Aselline: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Exactly the same. There
is not in the French law a single ground
which does not appear in the bill before this
house. I admit that at the beginning, before
things went the same way as they have gone
in France, the law might be applied more
strictly here.

Now let us consider the situation in
England. Until 1937 there was an average
of 3,000 to 4,000 divorces per year. Imme-

in 1946 and 1947 they climbed to 50,000 a
year. A commission appointed a few years
ago recommended the enlargement of grounds
for divorce.
Its recommendation
was
approved by the British Parliament and bas
been in force for more than twenty years.
The number of divorce cases has increased
to such an extent that England has revived
its Royal Commission, under the chairmanship of a distinguished personage, Lord
Morton of Henryton, for the purpose of considering the effects of the law during the
last ten years and of trying to find some solution less disastrous than the present one.
Let us now glance at the United States.
The situation there is simply terrible. The

MARCH 9, 1955
grounds for divorce are just about the same
as those proposed in this bill.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: In practically every
state.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No, that is not correct.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I repeat that in practically every state the law is about the same
as that which we are asked to enact, except
that in some states there is the ground of
"mental cruelty", which is not a ground
included in this bill, although if the bill in
its present form is adopted it may well be
admitted by our courts.
These grounds-and I do not refer to the
laws of Nevada, which I am not considering
given rise to disastrous conditions.
-have
In one state, one in every three marriages
ends in divorce. A well-known American
who was both socially and financially prominent told me ten years ago that in the state
of New York conditions were most deplorable. He mentioned that, of twenty-two
graduates of a well-known and highly reputed
convent, at which his daughter had studied,
twenty had married within two years of
leaving the convent, and after three years
nineteen of them were divorced.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: May I ask the honourable senator whether in New York State the
sole ground for divorce is adultery?
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I am giving an example
of what may happen when divorce is restricted even to one ground. My informant
had no personal interest in telling me of this
experience. His daughter was living in New
York, and the family is one of the bestknown in the state. This happened ten years
ago. I cannot give a precise statement as to
the number of divorces in New York at the
present time, but I have information as to
what is happening nowadays in the United
States, and in a moment I shall give some
figures which relate to twenty of those states.
Hon. Mr. Wood: It does not necessarily
follow that all the divorces to which the
honourable senator has referred were granted
in New York State.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Perhaps not. In many
cases New York residents obtain divorces
elsewhere.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Some Canadians do, too.

Hon. Mr. Farris: In many cases Americans
go to Mexico. and obtain decrees of divorce
there.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: But in Canada, except
under very special conditions, we do not
recognize divorces obtained by our citizens
in the United States.
Hon. Mr. Farris: That does not deter them.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: No, but such cases are
not very numerous. What I am pointing out
is that any state of the United States recognizes a divorce which is granted in any other.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Since it is a fact that the
ground for divorce is the same in New York
State as in Canada, what conclusion does
my friend seek to draw from the fact that,
in the incident he mentions, nineteen marriages out of twenty resulted in divorce?
What does he expect to prove by these
figures?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I pointed out that this
New York gentleman was to a certain extent
interested in a situation which, to him, was
very deplorable, namely, that nineteen out
of twenty girls who were married after leaving the convent were divorced after three
years.
Hon. Mr. Euler: And the ground is the
same as is recognized in this country.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: That is so. But I do
not know whether all these decrees were
granted in the state of New York. It may very
well be that some of them were granted in
other states and not necessarily on the ground
of adultery. My honourable friend has only
to look at what is going on in Canada, where
adultery is the only ground for divorce. Just
look at the number of divorces which have
been granted in Ontario and British Columbia alone since the establishment of divorce
courts in those provinces-and they have
been granted on the ground of adultery only.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What does that prove?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: That those who want
to untie the bonds of matrimony will take
whatever means they can. I am not the only
one here who holds that view. When taking
part in this debate the honourable senator
from Victoria (Hon. Mrs. Hodges), in deploring the present situation, stated:
I should like to say without any reflection upon
anybody connected with the Divorce Committee
or the work of the committee that at times I
have suspected there have been stage settings of
a certain kind to permit divorce being achieved.

Hon. Mr. Bouffard: But with this differThe activities of the American divorce
ence, that most divorces obtained outside courts are about to "bury the family unit",
Canada by Canadians are not recognized in
Dean
this country, whereas in the United States a to use the words of John C. Fitzgerald,
divorce granted in one state is recognized in of the Law Faculty of Loyala University.
Since 1867 the American population has
another.

SENATE
increased fourfold, but the number of divorces has increased sixty times. In 1948 there
were in the United States more than 20
divorces for every 100 marriages. I do not
know where Mr. Fitzgerald found his statistics, but he states that from 80 to 90 per
cent of the divorces are prearranged by
mutual consent, and that 75 per cent of the
cases involve perjury.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is what we are trying to avoid by this bill.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: According to what has
happened in the United States, this proposed
legislation would not have that effect. Some
people might not perjure themselves in testifying on a charge of adultery, but they might
be less scrupulous about perjuring themselves
in testifying on a charge of cruelty or
desertion.
It takes an average of fifteen minutes to
obtain a divorce in the United States courts.
The experiment has proved an absolute calamity in that country. The number of divorce
cases rose from 2,950 in 1886 to 32,557 in
1921; and, in 1951, to 100,000 in only twenty
states.
I need not repeat the statistics quoted by
the honourable senator from Ottawa West
(Hon. Mr. Connolly) in regard to Canada.
What are we aiming at? Is not the record of
other countries sufficient to prevent Canada
from trying similar experiments? Adultery
will not be simulated any more; a less shameful ground will more often be simulated.
This is indicated by the fact that out of
100,000 divorces granted in twenty American
states, only 1,400 were granted on the ground
of adultery, but 56,000 were on the ground
of cruelty.
Ella Winter reports in Collier's magazine
another painful example, in the case of
Russia, where in the first days of the Soviet
Revolution a divorce could be obtained in
ten minutes, abortions were performed by
the thousands, sexual education was taught
all over the country, and the home was cast
aside and children were entrusted to the
state.
Today Russia bas abolished co-education;
girls' schools are teaching cooking, sewing
and embroidery; and it has become more
difficult to otbain a divorce in that country
than in many capitalistic countries. The
marriage ceremony has also become more
solemn. Family life is praised, encouraged
and even rewarded. Stability has become a
password-stability in marriage, in family
relations and in relations between the sexes.
To obtain a divorce in Russia it is necessary
to appear before two courts of justice and
to publish a notice in the newspapers, and the

cost of divorce is very high. I found this
information in the book Ella Winter published in 1945, entitled I saw the Russian
People.
It seems quite clear to me that it is neither
because of moral or religious principles that
Russia has changed its family code and its
divorce laws. Having seen how seriously
divorce endangers the security of the nation,
it has taken the means of checking it. It was
force of circumstances which compelled
Russia to return to the Christian notion of
marriage.
In this debate few honourable senators
have dealt with the welfare and education of
the children. I was impressed by the statistics which the honourable gentleman from
Ottawa West gave us last night on the
number of children whom divorce deprives,
to all intents and purposes, of any family life.
It is estimated that the total number who
have been so affected in the United States
is 4 million-a terrifying number. What will
it be in Canada? Human nature is the same
everywhere, and the results of divorce in
the countries we have reviewed will be repeated in Canada. In a few years we shall
have more than half a million children who,
from the practical, educational and family
points of view, will be abandoned or placed
in institutions which the state will have to
provide to look after them. Are we willing
to accept such consequences, merely to afford
a few unfortunate people a second chance in
life?
Unfortunately, if this bill is adopted it
will settle very few cases, but will rather
open the way to the same abuses and the
same sad results that have been experienced
in other countries.
Indissolubility surely causes some difficult
situations. There is no institution on earth
which is free from pain and suffering. These
are individual and accidental evils which
cannot be remedied by an act creating general
unrest and producing disastrous results of
the kind experienced in the countries I have
mentioned. Legislation is not meant to safeguard the happiness of the individual at the
expense of the common weal. That is the
principle which should underlie this proposed
legislation, just as it underlies, in fact, any
other legislation. Duties and taxes, expropriations and sanitary measures are striking
examples of this.
States more concerned with individual
happiness than with the common good, are
not in general successful. On the contrary,
their legislation bas, every time, loosed torrents of scandal, of discord and of injustice
and, if it has untied a few unhappy marriages,
it has also sown doubts among good ones and

MARCH
opened the way to the systematic destruction
of the family. Under such conditions people
turn away from marriage as a duty and look
upon it as a mere source of pleasure.
If the question is considered from the point
of view of the birth rate, it will be seen that
divorce gives rise to the gravest results. A
nation cannot afford to lose interest in its
birth rate, for it is too closely connected with
its security. The birth rate is in direct proportion to the stability of the home, just as
instability of the home inevitably causes a
fall in the birth rate. I need not go outside
of Canada to prove that. In the province of
Quebec, where the number of divorces is
among the lowest, the birth rate is 28 per
cent; in Ontario, in 1942, it was only 20-1
per cent, and in British Columbia, where the
proportion of divorces is the highest in Canada, it was 19-3 per cent. The story is the
same everywhere.
Most advanced sociologists have accepted
the following theory: where the number of
divorces is lowest, the gross birth rate is
highest.
The highest birth rate is not to be found in
the states where there are the most marriages,
but in those where there are the least
divorces. Such facts, it seems to me, should
make us pause. As far as I am concerned,
they place upon me a responsibility which,
from the strictly social and national point of
view, I cannot escape.
Moreover, where does the pressure come
from in Canada to have this bill passed? As
far as I know, not a single province has even
considered passing a resolution to that effect.
The only public body that I know of which
has taken a stand in this matter is the Canadian Bar Association. I recognize that its
opinion may be quite authoritative, but it is
far from representing a majority opinion of
lawyers in Canada. Neither is it specially
competent to express an opinion in the social
field. No one has quoted a single social body,
a single important political group, or a single
province which has expressed an opinion
either way. The Senate, which is par excellence an independent body should not be
swayed into passing legislation which has
produced such harmful results elsewhere,
just because a small minority of our lawyers
have seen fit to recommend such a measure.
Some senators, among them the honourable
senator from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross), have
suggested that this law should apply only in
those provinces that want it. I am entirely
opposed to delegating our authority to the
provinces. The Fathers of Confederation
entrusted us with a jurisdiction within which
we ourselves must exercise our authority. If
they had wished to grant this authority to

the provinces, they would not have failed
to do so. It is our responsibility, and Parliament must exercise this power.
It Is
Parliament which is entrusted with the
responsibility of defending the indissolubility
of marriage in the interest of the family and
of society.
How would the views of a province find
expression? It is readily realized that pressure groups may attempt to arouse public
opinion. Indeed, pressures become easier to
exert as the size of the unit wherein they are
exerted becomes smaller and less populated.
Personally, I would frown upon delegating
our powers to the provinces. We have been
given authority, and it behoves us to exercise
it. Divesting ourselves of some of our authority would surely not tend to diminish our
responsibility.
Honourable senators, it seems to me quite
obvious and beyond any doubt that this bill
would open the door very wide to abuses
which have really occurred in all the countries where a similar experiment has been
made. Human nature has been tried; it cannot stand such temptation. Because of a few
exceptional cases which might deserve consideration, there are created thousands of
unfortunate situations which from the social
point of view affect hundreds upon hundreds
of women, who are oftener the victims of
divorce than men, and thousands of children
whose home life is broken beyond remedy.
Auguste Comte very aptly said:
The

mere

notion

that

a

marriage may

be

dissolved is an incentive to divorce.

And Mr. Planiol added:
The matrimonial union will not attain its fundaand
mental end unless it is both exclusive
indissoluble.

Is not the experience of those countries
conclusive? It should give food for thought
to those who, in perfect good faith, want to
broaden the grounds for divorce in order that
some individual cases may be settled. Unfortunately, if this bill is adopted, it will
settle very few cases, but rather will result in
the worst abuses imaginable.
I will now consider the more important
details of the bill.
The grounds for divorce: Section 6 of the
bill mentions adultery as the first ground of
divorce. In this instance, the man and the
woman are placed on the same footing. Is it
necessary, from a strictly legal point of view,
to mention adultery as a ground for divorce?
Out of ten provinces, eight have already
recognized the right to obtain a divorce on
the ground of adultery, and this under old
English laws, which the sponsor of the bill
is very anxious not to tamper with. The
other two provinces have no divorce courts.

SENATE
In order to grant a divorce to a resident of
either of these provinces, it is necessary in
each case to pass a special act of Parliament.
Everybody recognizes that Parliament, having
supreme authority, has the power to pass any
special act which it deems desirable and to
grant a divorce on any ground whatever.
I wonder why this bill mentions adultery
as a ground for divorce, since it stipulates
clearly that it does not modify or amend
existing laws which provide for the granting
of divorce in British Columbia, Alberta,
Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island?
Does it not seem that this bill would be
interpreted as giving to certain courts of
Quebec and Newfoundland the right to grant
divorces on the ground of adultery? From a
legal standpoint I believe so and, accordingly,
I submit that the word "adultery" should be
entirely omitted from this bill, which as a
matter of fact could in this respect affect
only the provinces of Quebec and Newfoundland.
As far as this ground for divorce is concerned, does it not imply that only Quebec
and Newfoundland could benefit from this
bill, since the other provinces have no need
of it in order to consider adultery as a ground
for divorce? If this bill is adopted, I would
suggest that, from a strictly legal point of
view, in order to clear up any misunderstanding, adultery be deleted from the grounds
for divorce.
The second ground for divorce under the
bill is desertion. Desertion has no doubt painful consequences for the spouse who has been
deserted and for the children, if any. Desertion especially reveals the little consideration
the husband and wife have given to the most
important act of their lives.
Racial and religious differences, temperaments and customs, are the most frequent
causes of desertion, which is often the aftermath of marriages contracted after an orgy.
I do not feel that for such unimportant reasons we should apply so drastic and so
dangerous a remedy as the dissolution of
marriage. If we accept such a ground for
divorce, we immediately open the door to
hasty and ill-considered marriages, because
whenever one does not work out, desertion
can easily be involved to obtain a dissolution.
One is often inclined to look upon married
life as a temporary state that could be called
a matrimonial venture. But for more than
eighty years our laws have not allowed, and
our legislatures have refused to consider,
desertion as a cause for dissolving a marriage. Such a record impresses me. Our lawmakers did not want a breaking-up of
marriage through divorce based on desertion,

and I respectfully urge our present legislators to think seriously before introducing into
our statutes provisions that for more than
eighty years our predecessors have constantly rejected.
Is it not a fact that both world wars were
to blame for many cases of desertion which
aroused our sympathy but which remain
nevertheless exceptional cases? These are not
the only misfortunes that the wars have
brought to many families; indeed, desertion is
not as hard to bear as some other types of
misfortune that are the lot of many families
in Canada as a result of war.
In other countries where desertion has been
accepted as a ground for divorce, abuses
have proved to be numerous. Let us, therefore, think seriously before following the
modern trend, and let us reflect that by
approving desertion as a ground for divorce
we would be encouraging serious misbehaviour that would lead to a larger number of
cases of collusion than we have at present.
The third proposed ground is insanity.
Divorce is no longer a sanction in this case,
since neither party has failed in his obligations, but it is a remedy. If divorce is granted
for a cause that is totally beyond the control
of the party against whom it is decreed,
there is a breach of contract based only on the
risks covered by such a contract. The solemn
promise of mutual help in time of sickness is
put aside, and the contingencies related to
the frailty of life become involved. There is
no doubt about it, a sick spouse cannot fulfil
his or her obligations. But that is not the only
type of illness that married people risk. There
are many diseases which render them absolutely incapable of fulfilling the most important functions of family life. For instance,
many diseases are a constant danger to the
wife and children; many diseases compel
either the husband or the wife to leave the
home for ever, or permit them to come back
only at infrequent intervals. Often on account
of the illness of husband or wife the other
spouse is obliged to provide for the ordinary
financial and educational needs of the family,
without any assistance from his or her mate.
If marriages were to be dissolved on account
of those hazards of life, there would be no
end to it.
Insanity is a disease which at present is
treated more efficaciously than formerly. Many
patients considered as incurable are recovering gradually through operations and drugs
that produce cures where formerly they could
not have been expected.
But there are many other diseases quite as
specific and sad, and if we consider as a
ground for divorce any disease, however distressing it may be, we shall open the door

MARCH 9, 1955
very wide to the worst abuses and the worst
aûd most unforeseeable consequences. Besides,
insanity is a mental disease that assumes a
a great variety of forms which are extremely
difficult to recognize and define. Let us not be
the judges of those human misfortunes that
God inflicts upon only a few individuals, and
let us not break the most sacred contract to
alleviate accidental circumstances.
Moreover, if we examine the laws of each
country in the world, including those of each
province of Canada, we find that insanity or
any disease, even death, cannot annul a contract of a purely economic and financial
nature. Notwithstanding the hardship involved, economie and financial contracts
must be complied with by those who have
entered into them. There is all the more
reason for maintaining this position with
regard to a contract which is held to be the
most indissoluble and most sacred by al
countries in the world.
The fourth proposed ground is cruelty.
In France it is called abuse, mistreatment
or serious injury. Cruelty is accepted in
France, in England and in the United States
as a ground for divorce. However, it is recognized everywhere as the cause of the worst
abuses. If we already complain, and rightly
so, that collusion exists in the matter of
adultery, how much easier it will be to sham
cruelty, even physical cruelty? In certain
American states, I dare say in most of them,
quarrels that happen rather frequently,
rather bitter reproaches, moods that change
from day to day, an unpredictable disposition, too great an interest on the part of the
husband in his business, early retiring, early
rising, snoring, reading a newspaper at
breakfast, are all daily grounds accepted in
the courts as grounds for divorce. It is called
mental cruelty.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is not true of
England.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: England bas a tendency
to enlarge the ground of cruelty, and today
mental cruelty in certain forms is accepted
as a ground for divorce. True, in England
mental cruelty does not yet include such
things as snoring or reading the newspaper
at breakfast, but if that country continues
its present course it will soon come to that.
Hon. Mr. Farris: May I ask my honourable
friend what bas been the result of the inquiry made by the Lord Morton commission?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: That commission is
still sitting and bas not yet made a report.
Consideration is being given to what should
be done in England to prevent the abuses
committed since 1937.
Do we want to expose ourselves to this
sort of thing in Canada? Do we think that
50437-18

we are more immune to such abuses than
are the English, the Americans or the
French?
Hon. Mr. Farris: The Nova Scotians seem
to be immune to it.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I do not know how far
cruelty has been accepted by the courts of
Nova Scotia as a ground for divorce, but if
I accept the version given to me today, I take
off my hat to that province, for it is the only
place in Canada where no abuse has resulted
from a long-standing law allowing cruelty as
a ground for divorce.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: And cruelty is not
defined in their provincial act.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: One conclusion we
could come to is that Nova Scotia is the most
moral province in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Better than Quebec?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: In Quebec we do not
grant divorces on any ground.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: What!
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: In 1951 or 1952 Parliament granted only approximately 74 divorces
to every 10,000 marriages in Quebec, and in
Newfoundland the ratio was approximately
one divorce to every 400 marriages. But
Quebec and Newfoundland have no divorce
laws and no divorce courts. My honourable
friend knows very well what bas been the
result of the establishment of divorce courts
in Ontario and British Columbia-the number of divorces has increased tremendously.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: But British Columbia
has since 1858 had the right to grant divorce
on the grounds of adultery.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: But can it not grant
divorce on the ground of cruelty, under the
law of England as adopted in 1857?
Hon. Mr. Aseline: In British Columbia the
only ground for divorce is adultery.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: To what would my
honourable friend from Grandville (Hon. Mr.
Bouffard) ascribe the increase in the number
of divorce cases handled by Parliament?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It is less costly and
much simpler to sue for divorce in a court
than it is to petition Parliament. Does that
answer your question?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I do not think my
honourable friend grasps the point I am
trying to make. If Quebec and Newfoundland,
the two provinces from which Parliament
receives petitions for divorce, had courts
similar to those in British Columbia and
Ontario, obviously the number of petitions
to Parliament would not be so large.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I am not so sure of
that. I know that in every province in which
divorce courts have been established the
increase in divorces has been very great.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Maybe that is because the
causes are greater.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It is notable that
divorces began to increase immediately after
the courts were established. As I said, it is
much simpler and less costly to sue for
divorce before a court, and the case is concluded in less time than it takes to pass a
private bill through Parliament. The provinces of Quebec and Newfoundland do not want
courts which can grant divorce, even for
adultery, because they fear an increase in
the number of divorces would result. I do
not say that the people of the province of
Quebec are immune to the temptations that
would accompany the establishment of a
divorce court, but if we do not have divorce
courts we will not be tempted.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: To follow up that argument, I would like to ask the honourable
senator another question. How does he
account for the fact that in the last twenty
years the number of petitions to Parliament
from the province of Quebec has increased
tremendously?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I would say that the
increase in population has had something to
do with it. Also the large immigration into
Quebec of peoples from Eastern and Western
Europe has had something to do with the
increase. The people of Quebec are following
the modern trend, and although on religious
grounds Catholics are forbidden to seek a
divorce, nevertheless many of them do come
before the Senate Divorce Committee. I
repeat, we do not want to be led into temptation, for if we are we shall surely fall;
so it is best not to place temptation in our
way by making it possible to secure divorce
within the province. Our Lord exhorted us
to pray: "Lead us not into temptation". I
am not praising those provinces which have
no divorce courts or divorce law, nor am
I suggesting that they are better than other
provinces.
It seerns to me that we should profit by
the actual experience of others. Let us therefore not pass a law whereby we run the risk
of undermining the very basis of this fundamental institution of our society which is the
family.
Let us not fear that our society will be
weakened if we keep within the bounds of
reason. Are we not rather sorry for those
errors that have so strongly shaken and are
still shaking society in countries where
special laws were passed in order to give

relief to individual cases which have now
become so numerous that they are no longer
exceptions? I have enough faith in our legislators, in their experience and in the consideration which they have for the Canadian
family to know that they are not, without
long and serious thought, going to weaken
the basic law aimed at preserving our families
when, as a matter of fact, this law should
be strengthened.
If our aim is to reduce the number of
divorces in Canada, if we want to protect our
families, if we wish to prevent abuses and
collusion, then instead of broadening the
grounds for divorce, let us place obstacles in
its way. Let our inquiries into charges of
adultery be more thorough, let the married
parties and the co-respondents in every case
be examined, let us set a long period during
which both parties to a divorce would be
forbidden to remarry; let us look after the
children of divorced parents by providing
under the act for their education and care;
let us leave with parents the same obligations
that they assumed towards their children at
the time of their marriage; let us make provision with respect to the financial support
of each of the parties that are going to be
separated. In this way, and in this way alone,
we shall be able to control and perhaps
eventually to cure the plague of divorce
which is so deeply regretted in those countries
that have applied the policy proposed in this
bill.
The second part of the bill deals with presumption of death. It provides that a spouse
absent for seven years may be presumed
dead. This is no longer a question of divorce
or of desertion, it is a decision made by law,
and the bond is annulled. Therefore, this is
not a ground for divorce; it is rather an
acknowledgment that the marriage is dissolved. It is a presumption that after an
absence of seven years a person is dead. Just
as I am opposed to divorce for desertion,
I am opposed to divorce on the ground of
presumption of death after an absence of
seven years. This woud open a new door that
could easily lead to collusion. After all, marriage should be dissolved by nothing but
death. It is sometimes necessary to presume
death for purposes of administration of an
estate, but this should not be done in order
to dissolve a marriage.
In my humble opinion, this question does
not come within the jurisdiction of Parliament. The death of a person is a matter of
civil law and comes under the exclusive
jurisdiction of the provinces. Presumption of
death after an absence of seven years is provided for in each provincial law dealing with
the distribution of estates. Our legislatures

MARCH SI 1955
did flot see Eit to enact that from ail points
of view a person absent for seven years should
be presumed dead. The presumption was
provided for only in the very llmited field
where it is required for the administration
of an estate. It fails solely within the powers
of our provincial legisiatures to provide, if
they deem. it advisable, that the presumption
should apply to ail contracts.
Under the British North America Act our
federai Parliament has the right to legisiate
on marriage and divorce, but not on demise.
To legisiate that after an absence of seven
years a person may be presumed dead is flot
to legisiate on marriage or on divorce. The
ternis of this part of the bill before us are,
in my opinion, unconstitutional, and in legislating upon the results of a more or less
prolonged absence Parliament would be overstepping its constitutional. rights. It is quite
possible that the federal jurisdiction, having
the right to consider an absence of seven
years as a ground for annulîrnent of marriage,
might add a new ground for dissolution of
the conjugal bond. However, that is not what
the bill now before us provides. It establishes
a presumption of death, which is a purely
civil matter, the result of which is the dissolution of marriage.
The presumption
created by the bill before us affects not only
marriage but also the civil rights of husband
and wife and those of the children, and allows
for the opening of the estate. These are
matters over which the federal Parliament
has no jurisdiction. In other words, it is a
presumption which is used as evidence of a
civil fact, which is death. The sections of the
bill concerning separation from bed and
board are also matters which do flot constitutionally corne under federal jurisdiction.
Such Provisions are, in fact, to be found in
the legisiation of each and every one of the
Canadian provinces.
The right of the federal Parliament to
legisiate on marriage in no way involves the
right to legisiate on the rights of the spouses
during marriage, on the division of property
between them, and on the duties of husband
and wif e toward each other and toward
their -children. Parliament is no more entitled to legisiate on judicial separation than
on the duties of parents towards their children, on the property of husband and wife,
or the different agreements under which
they may choose to marry.
A later part of the bull relates to annulment
of marriage. It provides that in certain cases
the marriage may be considered as null ab
initio. Frankly, I admit that I see no great
difference between divorce and annulment
of marriage. Both have the same consequences. The federal Parliament undoubtedly
has the rlght to legislate on the capacity to
50437-18J

marry, as also on the cases wherein it may
be declared that the marriage is nuli ab initio
or that it could be annulled. I find, unfortunately, that the bull omnits to deal with the
main grounds for annulment so far recognized by provincial legisiation, such as the
age at which one may marry, the cases in
which an error or misrepresentation may be
such as to cause annulment-for instance, in
the case of physical impotence at the time of
marriage-or the degree of relationship between the parties. From that point of view,
there are certain shortcomings in this bill.
The bull provides four new grounds for
annulment.
First, non-consummnation of the marriage
owing to the wilful refusal of the respondent
to consumniate it. This may be a legitimate
ground. It is recognized by the Church to,
which I belong, when such refusai to consummate stems from serious reasons.
Second, that either party to the marriage
was at the time of marriage in a state of
mental unbalance or disease or subject to
recurrent fits of insanity or epilepsy. In my
opinion, mental disequilibrium or insanity
should not constitute a ground for annulment
unless the condition was such that the party
affected could flot give a valid consent. The
theory that marriage may be annulled by
reason of mental disability or fits of epilepsy
is inconceivable. The existence of a disease,
however serious, cannot be accepted as a
cause for annulling a marriage. The party
affected may not even be aware of its existence. Medical data on such diseases is too
vague for an accurate diagnosis of their
causes to be made at the time they can be
detected. Adoption of this proposed ground
would give rise to very great abuses.
The third new ground is that the
respondent was at the tume of marriage
suiffering from contagious venereal disease.
There are many causes of venereal disease.
Often such diseases are hereditary: they may
be the resuit of the misbehaviour of former
generations. Moreover, usually they can now
be cured; and however disgusting they may
appear to the other party, it seems to me
that they.do flot constitute sufficient grounds
for annulment.
The fourth new ground is that the wife
was at the time of the marriage pregnant
by a man other than her husband. This
ground is evidently based on the fact that
the husband must flot be compelled to support a child who is flot his own. If the child
is born more than 180 days after the marniage, he cannot disclaim it: there is then
a presumption de jure that the husband us
the child's -father. Therefore, in order that
this ground may be invoked, birth must have
occurred less than 180 days after celebration

SENATE
of the marriage. In these circumstances,
although I think that the husband could have
been aware of his wife's pregnancy at the
time of marriage, he may disclaim the child,
and is not compelled either to keep or to
support it. The real reason for seeking annulment might be that he does not wish to live
with a woman who deceived him before his
marriage. To grant annulment for this reason
would, it seems to me, broaden the grounds
for annulment to a greater degree than anybody would wish. If we were to annul all
marriages where the wife had had relations
before marriage with a man other than her
husband, the percentage of annulments
would be far too high.
These are the remarks I wished to make
about this bill. I believe they are important
and thought-provoking. I am sure that all
members of this house will give them serious
consideration before voting on the principle
of the bill, and I am confident that as a
result the majority will be convinced that,
far from improving the social conditions of
our population, it would weaken the morals
of our nation and have most disastrous
effects upon its development.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourable senators, in introducing the bill we are now
discussing, the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon Mr. Aseltine) has raised an issue
of far-reaching importance; and the bill, if
passed, will mark a change in our historic
attitude towards divorce.
This is an era of change. It is not surprising that new conditions and ways of
living in an age of apartment houses, with
both husband and wife as wage-earners, additional leisure, and above all, the social upheavals occasioned by two world wars, have
called for an overhauling of laws which were
designed for an entirely different society. I
can well understand that the long experience
of the honourable senator from Rosetown as
Chairman of the Divorce Committee has made
him aware many times, in many cases, that
the present legal machinery is inadequate, or
does not apply, or is made to apply by the
use of questionable practices; and evidently
he feels that the time is overdue for a more
realistic law.
My own, more limited, experience as a
member of the Divorce Committee has made
me realize also that in many cases the grounds
alleged in the complaint are not the real
reasons for which the divorce is sought, but
are used as the only means of escape.

Further, I was much impressed with the
views of the honourable senator from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) and the honourable senator from St. Boniface (Hon. Mr.
Howden), eminent members of the medical
profession whose lives have been devoted to
healing physical and mental distress, and
both of whom have testified that they favour
a change in the law of divorce. The honourable senator from Victoria (Hon. Mrs.
Hodges), in her able address, spoke not only
as a representative of ber section of the
country, but also, I think, as a woman urging
a broadening of the grounds for divorce,
which this bill seeks. I thought the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
also made a very valuable contribution to the
debate, as did others. At any rate they
impressed me, and made me feel that the
subject is a very important one and that the
situation they described warrants our most
sympathetic consideration.
I am trying to approach the subject with an
open mind. I am quite aware that the religious denomination to which I belong frowns
on divorce, but I want to convince myself of
the right course I think it is fair to say
that our national attitude-if I may use that
expression-towards divorce has been definitely negative, although over the past quarter
century there has been a change which we
must recognize. I recall that when I was a
young man a divorced person was not very
graciously received in society, while today
divorce is not only tolerated, but indeed in
many circles it is quite generally accepted.
In approaching the subject one bas to take
into consideration the view of those who are
altogether opposed to divorce on religious
grounds, and who look upon marriage as a
divine institution; the view of the sociologist
who looks at marriage as a social institution
with its influence on society generally; and
the view of the lawyer who feels that in
many cases the law is not applicable and who
is concerned with the economic and legal
aspects of the institution.
It is interesting to note here that in our
Western civilization divorce passed from the
hands of civil law at the time of the Roman
Empire to Canon law during the Middle Ages,
but that in England after the Reformation
divorce became a civil law responsibility and
there was only one ground for divorce. In
1912, after four years of study, a Royal Commission in England recommended that five
grounds be added, but the influence of the
Roman Catholic and Anglican churches prevented any change until 1937, when a bill
similar to the one we are discussing was
passed by the British Parliament.

MARCH 9, 1955
I am inclined to the view that if this bill
is passed, divorce in Canada will be increased,
notwithstanding the-view expressed by the
honourable senatôr from Victoria (Hon. Mrs.
I think statistics on this point
Hodges).
showing experience elsewhere cannot be
overlooked. I start with the year 1938, which
was the first year after the bill liberalizing
the grounds for divorce was passed in
England, and I want to compare the experience since then in Canada, the United
States and the United Kingdom.
In Canada in 1938 there was one divorce
in every 40 marriages. In 1952 there was
one divorce in every 22.8 marriages. In the
United States in 1938 there was one divorce
in every 5.4 marriages, while in 1952 there
was one divorce in every 4-6 marriages. In
England in 1938 there was one divorce in
every 59 marriages, while in 1952 there was
one divorce in every 11 marriages.
While making every allowance for other
factors which are reflected in these figures,
such as the legacies of war and changed
social conditions, I think the evidence is very
strong and hard to contradict that an increase
in the grounds for divorce brings an increase
in the number of divorces. In the state of
New York, for example, where there is only
one ground for divorce, namely, adultery, the
number of divorces granted is much smaller
than in states where other grounds are
recognized.
However, that is not the chief reason why
I think we should go slowly on this measure.
I have been unable to discover any substantial public demand for this legislation,
and in our system of democracy I think legislation of this kind especially should reflect
a demand on a part of the people. Personally,
I have never received any communication
from my constituency or province and I have
not noticed in the press or heard on the
radio any resolution or expression of opinion
from any group of any kind asking for legislation of this character-and goodness knows
there are people suggesting better ways of
doing almost everything. To my knowledge
the only professional group which has expressed an opinion and recommended legislation of this character is the Canadian Bar
Association. However, I take it that, from
the public viewpoint while many people feel
al is not well as things are at present, the
matter is not a pressing problem, and I
think that we are just a little ahead of public
opinion.
Honourable senators will have noted from
these remarks of mine that I have been

feeling my way along. My conclusion is this,
that I want some information on the subject
from people who know more about it than
I do. I wantto hear from judges of divorce
courts and from members of the legal profession. I want to hear from social service
workers and representatives of the medical
profession and all and sundry who can
contribute anything to this subject, which
is of such great importance to the future
generations of Canadians. We are building
in this new country the fabric of a Canadian
culture, and a few years is a short time in
the life of any nation.
My recommendation is to make haste
slowly. I would welcome the appointment
of a special committee, as soon as convenient
to make an exhaustive enquiry into the whole
subject, and, if they think it wise, to bring
in recommendations upon which legislation
can be based.
Divorce is an evidence of failure, always
to be deplored and avoided. If any means
of success can be achieved even over what
may appear to be insurmountable obstacles,
the welfare of children, of the family and
of society must never be ignored or minimized. To meet the situation here in Canada
in the Canadian way it seems to me is a
challenge to legislation, and the solution will
not be found without our practising those
virtues of tolerance and respect for the viewpoints of others. Tolerance and respect for
the opinions of others have been the basis
upon which has been built our Canadian
unity. Therefore, because I feel we need
more opportunity to study the question and
weigh public opinion, and because under the
rules I am forbidden to move an amendment
on second reading, I regret that I shall be
obliged to vote against the bill on the present
occasion.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Han. J. W. de B. Farris moved the second
reading of Bill F, an Act to implement the
Convention on damage caused by foreign
aircraft to third parties on the surface.
He said: Honourable senators, I think this
bill requires some explanation. Its purpose
is to ratify a convention agreed to at Rome,
by representatives of a number of nations,
for the purpose of making uniform as far
as possible the rules applying in the various
countries to compensation for personal injuries and property damage caused by
foreign aircraft flying over one of the countries. For instance, if a plane from the
United States were flying across Canadaassuming that the 'United States was a signatory of the convention-and an accident
caused the plane to faîl on this building and
kili a number of senators-which might cause
some satisfaction in some quartersHon. Mr. Macdonald: I don't know where!
Hon. Mr. Farris: -under the bill compensation would be payable to the persons injured and to the proper representatives of the
persons killed. The bill also provides for
compensation for damage to property.
This question was flrst dealt with in a
convention at Rome, in 1933, but nothing
came of it. After the war the need for an
international agreement on the subject became
obvious, and the convention which we are
now asked to approve was agreed to at Rome
in 1952.
The bill itself consists of only one page,
and 1 might read the substance of it. Section
2 gives the following definitions:
2. In this Act,
on
(a) -~Convention" means the convention
damage caused by foreign aircraft to, third parties
on the surface, set out in the schedule;
(b) --Contracting State" means any state that
has ratified or adhered to the Convention and
whose denunciation
thereof
has not become
effective; and

272

SENATE

(c) Other words and expressions have the same
meaning as in the convention.

Section 3 reads:
(1) The convention is hereby approved and
declared to have the force of law in Canada.
(2) This Act and the convention apply only in
respect of damage contemplated by article 1 of
the convention caused in the territory of Canada
bj an aircraft registered in the territory of a
contracting state other than Canada.

The increase in transportation and traffic by
air makes the necessity for this measure
obvious. The present bill provides for compensation without proof of negligence; it fixes
the proportion of liability of the offending
aircraft operator; and makes provision for
the collection
of damages under the
convention.
At the 1952 meeting in Rome thirty-two
countries were represented, fifteen of which
signed the convention at that time. Britain
and Australia signed it in 1953, and in 1954
the Honourable Mr. Chevrier signed on
behalf of Canada. However, the mere signing of the convention is not sufficient, for
two reasons. First, article 33 requires that
the convention be ratified by a nation before
it can be made effective therein. Secondly,
it does not have the force of law in this
country until it is ratified by Parliament.
Honourable senators are sufficiently familiar
with treaties under the British and Canadian
system of government to know that Canada,
for instance, can bind itself internationally
with another government by a treaty or a
convention. In the United States a treaty
does not become effective until it is ratified
by, I think, a two-thirds vote of the Senate
of that country, and once that is dono it
becomes law. That is not so in Canada.
Here, a treaty is made by the sovereign, and
a convention may be secured in a less formal
way; however, as I have said, it does not bind
the citizens of the country until it is ratified
by parliament and thereby becomes the law
of the land. Subsection 1 of section 3 reads:
The convention is hereby approved and declared
to have the force of law in Canada.

Now, while a large number of nations including Britain, Australia and Canada have
signed the convention, up to date only one
country, namely Egypt, has ratified it. It is
necessary for at least five countries to ratify
the convention before it becomes operative.
Then, of course, it will only be operative as
between those five countries, but thereafter,
as each country does ratify it, it will come
under the convention. I am told by Mr.
Matthews, the Chairman of the Air Transport
Board, that it is expected other countries will
follow our example, and that it will not be
long until a number of other countries, perhaps all the signatories, have ratified.

This convention has been recommended
unanimously by the Air Transport Board. It
has also been recommended as in the public
interest by Trans-Canada Air Lines and Canadian Pacific Air Lines, which are the only
Canadian international air transportation
companies affected by it.
I feel I should explain this bill in some
detail because of article 39 of the convention
which provides:
No reservations may be made to this convention.

So it is a case of take it or leave it. Ordinarily provisions such as there are in this
convention would be referred to a committee
and investigated, and probably some changes
would be made. If I were in charge of the
drafting of this convention I can see several
provisions that I would perhaps suggest
should be made a little plainer, but we cannot
do that. As I say, it is a case of take it or
leave it. So I feel I should explain here now
in a general way what these provisions are,
and it will be up to this house, without bothering with a committee, either to accept the
convention in whole or simply reject it.
A detailed examination involves certain
considerations. First, to whom is compensation payable? This is covered by article 1,
section 1. I will read that. The convention
itself is attached as a schedule to the bill.
Article 1.
1. Any person who suffers damage on the
surface shall, upon proof only that the damage was
caused by an aircraft in flight or by any person or
thing falling therefrom, be entitled to compensation
as provided by this convention.
Nevertheless
there shall be no right to compensation if the
damage is not a direct consequence of the incident
giving rise thereto . . .

Honourable senators will see from that
provision that all an injured person has to
prove is the damage and the fact that an aircraft was the cause. There does not have to
be any proof of negligence.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: May I ask the honourable senator whether this provision is not
contrary to the practice of the civil courts?
For instance, in an automobile accident the
burden of proof is upon the automobile
owner. Under this bill, unless I misunderstand
it, the burden of proof is transferred to the
private individual.
Hon. Mr. Farris: My honourable friend is
quite right. His statement applies also to the
common law. But this Convention was established, as my honourable friend will fully
appreciate because, for instance, if an accident happened in the night, an airplane
crashed, and damage were done, it might be
almost impossible to prove negligence; and
it would be equally difficult to recover damages afterwards. It is in the light of these two

MARCH 10, 1955
facts that the burden has been shifted. Contrary to existing law in the common law provinces and in the province of Quebec, all that
an injured party will have to do is to prove
the fact of damage and who caused it.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: Does the expression "on
the surface" cover the case of anyone who is
damaged in a house or other building?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Oh, yes; "surface" would
include even a basement. The term is a very
general one.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: The reference is not to
the "surface" of the person only?
Hon. Mr. Farris: It is the surface of the
earth.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Is the case covered of
a foreign aircraft which collides with another
aircraft in this country?
Hon. Mr. Farris: No: on that point there is
another provision, which I will read to my
honourable friend when I get to it: the one
I am discussing is not applicable to an accident of that kind. If two airplanes collide,
and both go down, and both are from a country signatory to the convention either of them
may be fully liable. It is not intended to deal
with collisions in the air so far as the damage
is done in the air; its application is to damage
done to persons on the surface of the earth.
There are three exceptions to liability.
First, under article 5, where the damage
arises out of armed conflict or civil disturbance.
As defined in Article 2, "operator" means
the person who actually operates the plane
or who has authorized and directed the
operation of the plane. A man who owns a
plane may employ somebody to operate it,
but nevertheless the operator is the owner.
The second exception, contained in article
6, is where the operator proves that the damage was due entirely to some improper act
or negligence of the person who claims compensation. At the moment I do not see clearly
how that situation could arise; but should
it arise, the operator would be excused.
Although article 6 places the burden on
the operator, if he can show that the person
injured was partly to blame, the doctrine of
divided responsibility, which exists in the
common law provinces and, I believe, is to
be found in the Quebec civil law, will apply.
For instance, under our contributory negligence statutes, damage would be apportioned
in relation to the degree of negligence of the
person who claims the contribution.
With regard to extent of liability, full
recovery may not be granted, but the provision is a fair one, for this reason: If

negligence is proved the claimant may get
100 per cent and collect his damages to thpt
extent, but where the law of negligence has
no application some limitation must in ail
fairness be placed on the quantun of recoverable damage. Honourable senators who are
familiar with admiralty law, of which I know
a little, will recall that in claims resultirg
from damage done by ships there is quiie
frequently a limitation on the total liability
of the defendant. I believe this holds good
in admiralty cases even where it is necessary
to prove negligence and negligence is established.
Under "extent of liability", article II deals
with currencies of foreign countries, which,
to be understood, must be translated into
our own currency. I shall therefore read
from a memorandum given me by Mr. Matthews and put it in the record, rather than
attempt to interpret the clauses of the article:
The limits of liability are such that full compensation will be paid except in very exceptional
circumstances. The maximum amount payable in
the case of a small aircraft weighing a thousand
kilograms-that is 2,200 pounds-would be approximately $37,000. The indemnity increases progressively with the weight of the aircraft, with no
fixed maximum.

As the next paragraph indicates, that statement is not quite correct.
In the case of an aircraft weighing fifty tons or
more, the limit is approximately $775,000-

It will be seen that the limitations I have
alluded to do not reduce the liability to any
trifling amount.
-increasing
by 100 gold francs (approximately
$7.37) for every additional kilogram.

I looked this up, and find that a kilogram
equals two and one-fifth pounds, or 1,000
grams.
In case of death or personal Injury the maximum
indemnity for each victim would be 500,000 gold
francs, or about $37,000. The carrier is entitled to
the protection of these limits of liability except
in the case of a deliberate act or omission done
with intent to cause damage in which case liability
is unlimited.

So much for liability. The next question
that comes up for consideration concerns the
forum or court and the rules of procedure
and limitation of actions, found in articles
19 and 20 of the convention. Article 19 reads
as follows:
If a claimant has not brought an action to
enforce his claim or if notification of such claim
tas not been given to the operator within a period
of six months from the date of the Incident
which gave rise to the damage, the claimant shall
only be entitled to compensation out of the
amount for which the operator remains liable after
all claims made within that period have been met
in full.

SENATE
That is a rather slight penalty to ensure
that claims will be promptly made.
Article 20 starts off as follows:
1. Actions under the provisions of this convention

may be brought only before the courts of the
Contracting State where the damage occurred . . .

So that if an aireraft from, say, Italy
crashed on the surface in Canada and damaged
property belonging to a Canadian, any resulting action would be brought in this country.
Article 20 also sets out provisions for
execution. They are rather detailed and I
do not propose to read them, but among
other things they provide that judgments
delivered in one contracting state can be
executed in another contracting state without
further litigation.
Article 21 provides that actions under the
convention shall be subject to a period of
limitation of two years from the date of the
incident which caused the damage.
The final provisions to which I wish to
refer are the important ones dealing with
insurance, and they commence at article 15
of the Convention. I admit they are rather
complicated, but it must be remembered that
they were drafted by representatives of some
thirty nations, so undoubtedly they are not
framed in the same way that perhaps a
Senate committee would frame them. However, I think all I need do is refer the house
to article 15 and point out that provision is
made therein whereby registered companies
may be required to take out insurance of
some kind. It may be with an insurance
company that would be satisfactory to the
member countries, or it may be a bank

2. (a) For the purposes of this convention the
term "operator" shall mean the person who was
making use of the aireraft at the time the damage
was caused, provided that if control of the navigation of the aircraft was retained by the person
from whom the right to make use of the aircraft
was derived, whether directly or indirectly, that
person shall be considered the operator.

There is one question I do not know the
answer to-whether that excludes the person
actually operating the aircraft or whether it
makes both persons liable. Off-hand, my
opinion would be that it means both.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: There is a provision in
provincial motor vehicles acts which makes
the owner of the vehicle liable if it is involved in an accident while being driven by
someone with the owner's consent. Is the
provision in this bill similar to that?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I take it that it is. The
language is not quite "consent". It says that
"operator" shall mean:
The person who was making use of the aircraft
at the time the damage was caused, provided that
if control of the navigation of the aircraft was
retained by the person from whom the right to
make use of the aireraft was derived, whether
directly or indirectly, that person shall be considered the operator.

I think that is more of a limitation than
you would have in the motor vehicles acts
provision. Under the convention a person
must retain control. That is to say, he can
order the other person where to go, but if
somebody took a plane for a joy ride merely
with consent of the owner of the aircraft
it might be doubtful whether the owner
would be brought in under the convention,
but the person operating the aircraft is liable
guarantee or a guarantee of the nation itself. anyway and if you get judgment against him,
I do not think it is necessary that I read these even if he is judgment proof, you still have

provided. The word "may" applies only in
the case of the nation which has it witbin
its own power to seek the protection. I think
that is ail rigbt.
Then subparagraph (a) of paragraph 2
says this:
The insurance shall be accepted as satisfactory If
It conforms to the provisions of this convention
and has been effected by an insurer authorized
to, effect such insurance under the laws of the
state where the aircraft is registered or of the
state where the insurer has bis residence or
principal place of business, and whose financial
responsibility bas been verifled by either of those
states.
Of course, that puts it in the power of the

other state, when these are joint contracting
parties-and one must assume good faîth on
the part of the other contracting states-to see
to it that any sanction given to the financial
reliability of the insurance company will be
reasonably satisfactory.

May I draw attention to subparagraph (b):
(b) If insurance bas been required by any state
under paragraph 1 of this article, and a final
Judgment in that state Is not satisfled by payment
la the currency of that state, any contracting state
may refuse to accept the insurer as financially
responsible until such payment, if demanded, has
been made.
That is a littie like locking the stable door
after the horse has fled. However, there is a
similar provision in some of our motor
vehicles acts: a driver of a motor vehicle is
neot required to take out insurance, in the
flrst instance, but if he bas an accident, and

is judgment proof, he is required, before
driving a car again, to take out insurance.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: One more point, while
we are on that subject. I understand that the
country from which the airpiane fies arranges for the insurance?
Hon. Mr. Farris: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Does that mean that a
country, say the United States, insures al
aircraft which leave the United States and
fiy over Canada against liability for damage,
whether tbey are private planes or corporation planes, or whoever owns tbem?
Hon. Mr. Farris: So far the United States
has not signed this convention. I tbink my
bonourable frîend and I misunderstood each
other. The state does not insure. in the first
instance; the state merely gives sanction to
the financial reliability of the company which
gives the insurance.
Allow me to read subparagrapb (a) to my
honourable friend again:
(a) The insurance shall be accepted as satisfactory if it conforms to the provisions of this
convention and has been effecteci by an insurer
authoriseci to effect such insurance under the laws
of the state where the aircraft Is registered or
of the state where the insurer has his residence..

So that ail the nation does is to put a
blessing on the company doing the insuring,
and for that you must accept the good faith
of any nation which is a party to this
convention.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Well, a private plane
flying over Canada might not be insured,
and if it crashed in this country we would
not have an opportunity to collect damages.
Hon. Mr. Farris: It is the duty of every
nation to see tbat ail planes going out of its
own country are insured. I do not know of
any other way it could be worked out. The
provision is not 100 per cent foolproof, but
it is about the best that can be made, and
is much better than no provision at ail.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It seems to me that our
chance of collecting damnages wouid depend
on what arrangements had been made when
tbe owner of the aircraft obtained bis licence
to fiy.
Hon. Mr. Farris: He must register in bis
own country, and I take it that every country
bound by this convention would see-at the
time of registration, as my friend says-that
one of the incidents of the registration was
the taking out of proper insurance.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I know that our requirements in Canada are very strict, because on
several occasions I have tried to obtain a
licence to fiy planes in Canada to spray crops
to destroy weeds, and on applying 1 have had
to go througb a lot of detail-answer a thousand questions, and give ail the security in
the world-before getting a licence at ail.
I assume similar regulations are in force in
ail countries.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Well, good faith of the
contracting nations is essential.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators, it
is not my intention to criticize this proposed
legisiation in any way. The honourabie senater from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris)
bas given us a very good general expianatien of the purpose of tbe bill. I wisb, however, to off er a criticism on another point.
Here, obviously, is a very important convention, to wbicb by this bill we are asked to
gîve ratification and adberence. We know
fromn article 39 that certain plenipotentiaries
from certain unnamed countries met in Rome
in tbe year 1952, and that as a result of their
deliberations this document comes forth. But
wby was some brief explanation not given
on tbe blank pages of the bill as to tbe history
of the convention? I feel that tbe namnes of
the countries wbich took part in tbe deliberatiens sbould bave been stated, as well as tbe
general purpose of the convention and what

SENATE
is proposed to be achieved by the various
articles set out in the convention which we
are asked to ratify-and which I think we
should ratify. My complaint is that there is
not a single word of explanation given, and
it would have been a simple matter to provide
it. An explanatory note of the purpose of a
bill, or of the amendments to an act, if
there are amendments, is of considerable
assistance to members of both houses in
studying proposed legislation and trying to
pass intelligent judgment on it. Most bills
are accompanied by an explanatory note.
When a matter of this kind comes before us
again for consideration, I hope an explanatory
note of the purposes of the bill will be
provided.
Hon. Mr. Farris: May I point out to my
honourable friend that the signatures attached
originally to the convention in 1952 are
listed at the back of the convention, and I
have added to those which do not appear
there, Great Britain, Australia and Canada.
Those three countries signed the convention
subsequently. The United States has not yet
signed. My honourable friend will find the
list of signatures on pages 18 and 19, at the
very back of the schedule.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Well, there must be something lacking in my copy. Page 16 is the
last page I have.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Perhaps I have been
especially fortified in that respect. The signatures on behalf of the various countries
appear at the end of my copy of the schedule.
If honourable senators wish me to read into
the record that additional information, I
shall be glad to do so.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There is no objection
to your reading it.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I think it would be of
assistance to us.

honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) was speaking, it occurred to me
that the sponsor of the bill might agree to
having it referred to a committee, not for
the purpose of attempting to change the
convention, which of course cannot be done,
but to give additional information which
honourable senators might require. I offer
that purely as a suggestion.
I would be interested to know, as perhaps
other members of the chamber would, in what
court a claim under this bill could be made.
Would it be one of our provincial courts
or, because of the intervention of the Dominion of Canada, would it be the Exchequer
Court of Canada? Neither the convention nor
the bill appear to indicate in which court
claims could be heard.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I shall be glad to answer
that question to the best of my knowledge.
My opinion is that claims could be heard in
the regular courts which try cases between
individuals in respect of injuries or damages,
namely, the provincial courts. The Exchequer
Court, I may say, is usually reserved for the
hearing of issues having to do with the affairs
of the Crown. If a person were injured by
a foreign aircraft, on the surface in, say,
British Columbia, his claim would be heard
in the Superior Court of that province. One
could not expect the convention to set out
for twenty or thirty countries the respective
courts in each country having jurisdiction in
the matter; that must be left to be determined
by the countries themselves.
My opinion, therefore, for what it is worth,
is that the provincial courts could hear such
claims.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Thank you very much.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: I too would like to
thank the honourable senator from Vancouver South for the excellent interpretation
he has given of this bill and of the convention which we are asked to ratify. May I ask
one question of him?
Article 30 on page 14 says in part:

Hon. Mr. Farris: The bill is no respecter
of persons by reason of their nationality. I
would assume, therefore, that any person,
whether from Canada or any other country,
who was injured on the surface by a foreign
plane in Brazil would have the same rights
as a citizen of that country, regardless of
nationality. The article says:

various parties represented at the convention,
and I presume that our Department of Transport, or our Department of External Affairs,
was a party to that approval.

For the purposes of this convention:-"Person"
means any natural or legal person including a
state.

Hon. Mr. Lamberi: But my point is that
is a prerogative of the Crown, and the
matter of ratification by Parliament is really
only a custom?

That is all it says. Now if, for instance, a
Canadian were riding in a motor car in
Brazil, and a foreign plane flying overhead
dropped a golf bag on his automobile and
smashed it, my opinion is that he would
have the same rights as any citizen of Brazil,
which is a contracting country.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Could he sue in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Farris: No; he would have to
sue in Brazil.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Would a person of a
country or a state which was not a signatory
of the convention have the right to make a
claim in circumstances such as those mentioned by the honourable senator from
Fredericton (Hon. Mrs. Fergusson)?
Hon. Mr. Farrîis: I would think so. My
understanding is that it would apply to all
persons in the signatory country, with the
possible exception of persons who had
entered the country illegally and were there
in violation of its immigration laws. In other
words, for the time being the Canadian would
be a person of Brazil.

Hon. Mr. Farris: The Honourable Mr.
Chevrier signed the convention while he was
a member of the Government.

Hon. Mr. Farris: I would not agree with
my friend in that respect, for two reasons.
First, the convention itself requires not only
the signature of a country, but ratification
by it; and secondly, the Government of
Canada cannot by order in council make the
citizens of this country subject to any law
in a convention or treaty-only Parliament
can do that.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: We have had before us
other conventions for ratification, such as
one concerning the immunity of diplomatic
representatives, and a more recent one concerning trade with Japan. In those cases the
Crown was quite in order in binding the
countries according to the international agreement, and ratification by Parliament afterwards was just a custom.

Hon. Mr. Farris: My friend is wrong there.
As I said earlier, in the United States after
ratification by the Senate a convention becomes part of the law of that country, but
in Canada no solemn treaty is binding on our

now how the honourable senator from Grandville reached the high position at the Quebec
Bar which he occupies today. He demonstrated clearly yesterday that he possesses
three of the qualities s0 necessary to success
at the Bar: a well-stored mind, a tremendous
capacity for hard work, and a very forceful
delivery. I confess that as I listened to hlm
I feit once or twice just a littie like King
Agrippa of old.
As I said, it is something of a task to
follow the two senators who spoke yesterday, especially when convinced, as I am, that
the bill is a good one-with one or two reservations which I shall deai with later-and
that it is long overdue. My views will, I fear,
not; please some senators, but ail I ask is
faith in rny sincerity.
The reason I arn supporting the bill is that
I believe we shouhd try to bring as much
happiness as we can into the hives of the
Canadian people. I arn one of the fortunate
ones who have had a very happy married life.
For that reason I want other people also to
have a happy home and f amily life.
Thomas Jefferson in his original draft of
the Declaration of Independence, said that
"ail men are created equal, and independent",
and "1among their inahienable rights are the
preservation of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness".
I arn not one who believes that misery and
suffering are good for us. Nor do I believe
that by enduring misery and suffering in this
if e we are preparing ourselves for a happier
time in the life to come-whatever and
wherever that may be. I believe that we
should do everything we can to make people
happy here on this earth. I hate misery!
I like to see people smile and haugh and enjoy
if e.
I believe that if this bill passes through
Parhiament it wiil make for happiness and
better citizenship to as great a degree as, if
not a greater degree than, it can possibly
make for misery, and suffering, and immorality-to which some reference has been
made.
Perhaps I shouhd apologize to the honourable senator from Grandville (Hon. Mr.
Bouffard), and also to the honourable senator
from Ottawa West (Hon. Mr. Connolly), for
not being convinced by them. The senator
frorn Ottawa West made an excellent speech
on Tuesday night. It was welh prepared and
full of statistics. I should have lîked to
agree with him if I couhd, for our friendship
goes back some fifteen years, but some of the
figures ie quoted, instead of depressing me,
made me feel good. I arn afraid hie did not
intend thern to.

You see, honourabie senators, I arn one of
many Canadians who feel that divorce can do
good, as it might possibly do harm.
Prior to 1930 1 wrote many articles in my
newspaper urging proper divorce courts for
Ontario. I felt that there was a demand for
divorce courts, and I was glad when they
were instituted. The resuits, in my opinion,
have been good.
Let us look this question fairly and squarely
in the face. A couple get married. They are
young; perhaps money is scarce; they may
flot have very strong characters. Bickering
starts. Bickering becomes quarrelling. Quarrels lead to blows; love flies out the window,
and we have a broken home. Under our
present laws, in order to get a fresh start in
pursuit of a useful and happy life, which
Thomas Jefferson f elt was the inalienable right
of individuals, one or the other of these two
young people has got to commit adultery.
That, unfortunately, is the law.
I am flot a lawyer. I spent thirty years of
my life as the active editor of a daily newspaper published in a small Ontario provincial
city. In that capacity I was pretty close to
the people. I took an active part in community life; I saw ail sides of it. I read many
newspapers every day: it was part of my job.
As a result of that reading, and the reading
of the daily press today, and as a resuit of that
close contact with the people, I cannot agree
with the senator from Ottawa West that there
is no demand for more liberal divorce laws
in this country. 1 arn convinced there is. I
am borne out in my contention by the Gallup
Poli referred to, by the honourable senator
from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) in his
speech in introducing the bill. He toid us
that the poli reported that seventy-five per
cent of the Canadian aduits interviewed
wanted infidelity, desertion, insanity, physical
cruelty, drunkenness, mental cruelty, and
incompatibility added to the causes for which
a divorce can be granted. The honourable
senator from Rosetown aiso toid us he had in
his office a file of letters three inches thick,
every one of them asking for the changes
proposed in this bill.
I know ail about the marriage vows. I
have repeated them after a clergyman on two
occasions. But surely we are not sincere if
we base our objection to this bill on the verse
from the Gospel of St. Mark, chapter X,
verse 9, quoted Tuesday night:
What therefore God hath joined together. let
not man put asunder.
Are we not putting asunder every week
of every session of Parliament men and
women whom God hath joined together? Did

SENATE
we not put asunder legally in this chamber
yésterday afternoon about twenty-five couples,
in about three minutes?
What we are saying to the people of Canada
today is that we will not legally put them
asunder unless one or the other of them goes
out and breaks the Seventh Commandment.
That, to me, is the rotten part of divorce
today. I, personally, know of couples who
could not get along after trying hard, and
one or the other of whom has hired some
woman to go through the phony bedroom
scene so common in so many divorces, in
order that they could make a fresh start.
Also, I know many couples who have made
a fresh start after a while, have raised nice
families, and have lived happy and useful
lives.
In my own life I am very thankful that I
have never had to question the verse quoted
Tuesday night. But being a Presbyterian, I
know something of the Bible, and I confess
freely that my favourite verse is that one
from the seventh chapter of Matthew, "Judge
not, that ye be not judged."
I am very fond, too, of the lines from
Joaquin Miller's poem on Lord Byron, the
great English poet:
In men whom men condem as ill,
I find so much of goodness still;
In men whom men pronounce divine,
I find so much of sin and blot,
I do not dare to draw a line
Between the two, where
God has not.

I am glad that this bill has been introduced.
I hope it is given second reading, and is sent
to committee, where we can discuss it and
perhaps amend it. If it does go to committee, I hope that an extension of the time
for desertion will be considered; and I would
like to see the time stipulated in subsection
1(d) of section 6 increased from five years
to ten years. The honourable senator from
Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw), who has
had experience with mental diseases, recommends an amendment. I agree. I feel ten
years is short enough time to wait for a loved
one to recover. I would also like to see the
word "cruelty" in subsection 1 (c) of section
6 clearly defined. I am not in favour of using
"mentai cruelty" as a cause for divorce in
Canada. I think, as the honourable senator
for Grandville said yesterday, it is too liable
to misuse.
I do not want to see in Canada what I call
"licensed loose-living", which is what I am
afraid some courts in another country are
condoning. However, I have faith that if we
pass a good bill such things could not happen
in Canada, because of the high quality of our
judges and of the members of the Senate
Divorce Committee.

I would like to see this bill pass second
reading. If it does it will enable us to treat
all Canadians more fairly. Today we say to
one group: "Go out and commit adultery and
we will give you a divorce." To another we
say: "No matter if your husband has turned
out to be a drunken beast; no matter if he
beats you, half starves you, refuses to provide
you with enough food and decent clothes
to wear; no matter if he has taken the dignity
out of your life and made your life miserable,
you must just put up with it. We will do
nothing for you." To still another group,
said to number 20,000, we say: "If your
spouse has deserted you and left you to shift
for yourself, we can do nothing for you. You
must make the best of it." That, honourable
senators, does not strike me as the proper
Christian attitude. I feel it is the very
antithesis of Christianity.
It is true, where divorce laws have been
widened divorces have increased. It happened in England; it happened in Ontario.
That to me was a natural process. Many who
were probably living in misery, and perhaps
sin, were able to legalize their positions.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Davies: But the British people
are a fine people. I visit them every summer.
I meet them in all walks of life-decent,
law-abiding, God-fearing people. The increase
in divorce has most certainly not made them
into criminals, nor has it, in my opinion,
lowered their standards of morality at all.
About Ontario I shall not comment. I live in
this grand old province, and divorces or no
divorces, there are no finer-living people
anywhere.

In conclusion I have only this to say, honourable senators. I am going to support this
bill because I sincerely believe it is a step
in the right direction. Divorce is here. We
cannot push it away from us by refusing to
recognize it. It is here to stay. Then let us
make a start on liberalizing our divorce laws
to some extent, and make life brighter and
happier for the large numbers who today
are caught between the upper millstone of an
unhappy home and the nether millstone of
forced adultery.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. B. Baird: Honourable senators, I
have listened with interest, and, I must
confess, with more or less amazement to
the progress of the discussion of this bill.
Comment has, it must be admitted, wandered pretty far afield-indeed all the way
from opposition to the bill for fear of disrupting the honoured institution of marriage, to

MARCH 10, 1955
quibbles about some of the proposed additional grounds for divorce, and even to a
long discussion of the evils of liquor, and
so on.

The question as I see it is simply this:
shall we permit a lessening of the hardships
now unfortunately imposed upon couples who
have found they have made a mistake, a big
mistake, which has already marred their
lives and which if not rectified will continue
so to do?

Now, make no mistake. I do honour the
institution of marriage, but I can see no sane,
unbigoted reason for our insistence that legitimate grounds for divorce shall be so limited
as to encourage illegal methods of obtaining
"divorce evidence". Even now this is causing
great damage to our people, in that a growing disrespect for all law results from any
evasion of the strict letter of the law. I
believe this body should implement the
proposals in the proposed legislation before
us. I believe the people of Canada do not
require the strict divorce regulations that
we now have, and that for the small percentage of our people who have made a mistake in
their marriage we can do a really good
service by providing a reasonable easing of
the restrictions and making the grounds for
divorce more in keeping with the day and age
in which we live, and more in line with the
conditions and problems of modern life.
Years ago, general conditions were such
that life was more leisurely and people were

not always in a hurry. Marriage was entered into only after careful consideration by
both parties. When it did not work out too
well both parties had to make the best of
it; and they tried and tried, for divorce was
hard to get. So, regardless of the hardships
of the small percentage of our people who
even considered or needed divorce, we had a
very small divorce rate in Canada. I find
that, in fact, before 1900 only 20 divorces
were granted a year; in 1913, there were 60;
in 1918, 114, and in 1926, 608. But times have
been changing. Life has speeded up, and
with it marriage has not had the careful consideration it had in years past, so that the
divorce rate is much larger and growing year
after year. There is a demand from the
public for "easier divorce", a demand that
must be met. I for one believe that it should
be met and that the proposal before us should
be enacted.
I believe that a man or woman who makes
an honest mistake is entitled to a second
chance and should not be forever penalized.
So honourable senators, as an act of human
kindness, I plan to vote for this bill, and I
trust that it will pass.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

CANADIAN CURLING CHAMPIONSHIP
TRIBUTES

TO COMPETING

TEAMS

On the orders of the day:
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are proceeded
with I wish, first, to apologize for being
absent at the last four sittings of the house;
and secondly to call attention of the house
to what I think was an important event.
It was my privilege to attend and help to
direct the Canadian Curling Championship
playoffs held last week in the city of Regina.
There were eleven rinks entered in the
competition. All ten provinces of Canada
were represented by one rink each, plus an
additional rink from Ontario, because in line
with a custom that bas existed for a good
many years there was a rink representing
Northern Ontario as distinct from the rest
of that province.
I am sure that if every senator in this house
had been at Regina with me they would have

MARCH 15, 1955
formed the same opinion I did: what a great
country Canada is and what fine young men
we have in this country!
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I can pay that tribute to
every province in Canada, without any exception at al. Al the players were gentlemen
from start to finish, on the ice and off the ice.
There was no over indulgence in liquor, no
abusive language. All in al it was a very
great pleasure to me, as one who has been
with the organization since the first national
curling championship games, in 1927-I am
,the last member of the original organizationit was a great pleasure to see those fine young
men step on the ice on Monday afternoon to
begin the great fight for the title of champion
rink of Canada.
I want to emphasize this: I never saw a
better outfit in al the twenty-six years that
we have had the competition than I did on
this occasion-never. This time a Saskatchewan team won the championship of Canada,
and I want to congratulate them.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There are more curlers in
Saskatchewan than in any other provincemore men, more women, more boys and girls
are curling there than in any other part of
Canada. It is especially pleasing that after
twenty-seven years of competition, that province should come through and win the
championship in its jubilee year.
There were some astonishing features. Last
year Alberta could not be beaten, but this
year it was pretty close to the bottom. Two
or three years ago New Brunswick was one
of the great provinces of this dominion as
far as curling is concerned, but this year it
was pretty well down.
It was interesting to note that when the
Quebec team used the French language to
the rocks they got the same result as the
fellows who used the English language to
them. The rocks did not change their course
a bit. If a fellow had the broom and the
right weight he got the shot, but otherwise
he missed, no matter what he may have said
to the rock in the meantime.
Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Haig: As a Manitoban I offer to
Saskatchewan my most heartfelt congratulations. As I said before, it is a great curling
province. A few years ago it won the junior
championship and now, in its jubilee year.
it has won the senior curling championship
of the world.
Just let me try to describe for you the last
end between Saskatchewan and Manitoba.
They are coming home seven to six in favour
of Saskatchewan. They have the last rock.

It comes to the Saskatchewan rink to play.
The Manitoba rink are laying two rocks
inside the white centre. The Saskatchewan
skip has only three inches to use, and he
cannot hit them, because the lay prevents
that. He drew cold to an inch from where
he ought to be. I never saw a more thrilling
finish in my life, and I have been following
curling for more than fifty-seven years. The
winning team comes from Avonlea, a little
town of 350 people. It was said that they
were not al at the game-but 400 people
from the town were present, and I do not
know where the other fifty came from. We
had an attendance of 51,275 people at those
four days of curling. That is another record.
It made me feel very proud that I should
live to see in our country such a great game.
It used to be said that curling was an old
man's game, but that is not so today. The
skip of the Saskatchewan rink is twentyeight years old. The third man on the
Manitoba rink is twenty-three years old.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: He should have been
skiing.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not think there is a
player on any of the rinks, outside of the
skips, over forty.
In conclusion, I just want to make an
aside, which is not for the press. In Regina,
where the people did not know me, except
that I happened to be addressed as "Senator",
I found out that they think quite a lot of
the senators of this country. I had a very fine
reception, not because I was Jack Haig, but
because I was Senator Haig. I felt very
happy indeed that these prairie people, of
the stock of our pioneers, so clearly recognize that the Senate is a significant part of
Canada, and I made up my mind that when I
returned east I would tell my fellow senators what great people we have on the
plains, as well as al over this country. I
believe that the forty-four young men who
represented Canada in these games cannot be
excelled anywhere in the world. They are a
great credit to ail our provinces.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I should like to join the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) in
congratulating the Saskatchewan rink on its
outstanding victory. We are al indebted to
him for his vivid description of the last end.
As it was impossible for al of us to be there,
we are glad that he has told us of that great
play. His description was so vivid that, in
spite of the red carpet under our feet, we
could almost imagine ourselves on the ice.
In complimenting the Saskatchewan team I
think I should also congratulate the Leader

SENATE
of the Opposition on the interest he has
taken over the years in this sport.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: When the Macdonald
Brier trophy was first presented for competition there were appointed a number of trustees, of whom the only survivor is our dearly
beloved Senator Haig. The trophy is entirely
safe in his hands. I am sure that all of us
will join in extending to him our thanks for
what he has told us this evening, and in
hoping that for many years to come he will
remain the trustee of the trophy and a representative of the Senate at these great
matches.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Honourable senators,
the enthusiasm shown by my honourable
leader over the years in the curling championship matches which he has attended, I found
rather amusing, for to me it is no matter of
astonishment that we men of Saskatchewan
are champions. In my younger days, in my
field of sports, I was taking on all comers
from every quarter; and I was, and still am,
undefeated amateur billiards champion of
Canada.

DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL
CAUSES BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, March
10, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Aseltine for the second reading of
Bill 0-6, an Act respecting divorce and matrimonial causes.
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable senators, in rising to take part in this debate may
I first join with the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) in congratulating
the Saskatchewan rink which recently won
the Canadian Curling Championship at
Regina. As one who represents a province
which recently distinguished itself in another
form of ice sport, I feel that we champions
can join together.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Farris: Honourable senators, I
approach with considerable diffidence a discussion of this very serious and important
question, for I have been somewhat conscious
of my deficiencies, if not senility, after having
read some comments from other places, including the newspapers about old and incompetent senators.
Some years ago at a cocktail party, where
sometimes persons speak rather freely, I was
discussing with two recently-graduated college men the question of public affairs. They
laid it down to me that as the old men had
made such a mess of the world they, the
young men, were going to see that things
were changed. I said to them, "You boys
must feel very discouraged." They looked at
me in wonderment and asked me what I
meant. I replied, "Well, you must be discouraged when you realize you can never be
any wiser than you are now."
Honourable senators, there is another reason why I have some regrets about this discussion at this time. I refer to the fact that
there are twenty-one vacant seats in the
Senate which, according to our constitution,
should be filled. I exceedingly regret that
the obligation imposed upon the Government
of this country under our constitution has not
been fulfilled.
Honourable senators, before proceeding
further I should like to extend, as many
others

have

done,

congratulations

to

the

honourable gentleman from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine), who introduced the bill now
before the house. It was a timely introduction, and the discussion that has taken place
and will take place amply justifies the introduction of this measure, whether or not it
carries.
I come now to the issue of this debate. The
first thing that we should direct our minds to
is the principle embodied in this bill, for I
am afraid there have been many wanderings
afar from that principle. The principle of
this legislation is not concerned with the issue
for or against divorce. The law of divorce is
the law of Canada, established in every part
of this country, and I want to take a few minutes to call attention to that fact.
The law in Nova Scotia is that a person
may secure a divorce on the grounds of
adultery or cruelty, and this has been the
law of that ancient province since 1761. I
shall have more to say about that later on.
Incidentally, a well-educated reporter asked
me today, "How is it you have provincial
divorce laws when divorce is within the
jurisdiction of the dominion?" I explained
to him that while the divorce law has been
conferred on the dominion since confederation, the provinces brought their existing
divorce laws with them when they entered

MARCH 15. 1955
confederation and these laws were to continue in effect until changed by the dominion
Parliament.
The divorce law in the province of New
Brunswick has existed since 1791, and the
grounds for divorce or annulment are frigidity, impotence, adultery, or prohibited
consanguinity.
The divorce law in Prince Edward Island,
which is the same as that in New Brunswick,
has existed since 1835. In Prince Edward
Island the court originally was the Governor
in Council. I have been reading the leading
text-book in Canada on divorce laws, and
the learned author writes that the law in
Prince Edward Island was a dead letter from
the time of confederation until 1949, when
the procedure was amended and a new act
was introduced making special provision for
a new kind of court to deal with divorce on
the grounds I have mentioned. It may be
interesting to honourable senators to know
that the honourable senator from Prince
(Hon. Mr. Barbour), who made such an
appealing and effective argument against this
bill, was a member of the Cabinet in Prince
Edward Island which introduced those new
provisions for divorce. I looked up that
information in the Parliamentary Guide. I
do not think he bas explained his reasons
for his change of heart.
Then we come to deal with British Columbia and the three Prairie provinces, where
divorce laws have existed since Confederation. Prior to the passing of a federal act,
in 1927, the grounds for divorce in British
Columbia and the three Prairie provinces
were as follows. A husband could secure
divorce by proving adultery on the part
of his wife. But a wife in order to secure
a divorce had to prove not only adultery on
the part of her husband, but in addition,
incest, rape, sodomy, or adultery and cruelty
or desertion for two years. In 1927 the
Parliament of Canada passed legislation providing that in any province in which there
was a divorce court the wife could secure
a divorce on the same grounds as the husband,
namely, for adultery.
I come now to the next province. Ontario
had no divorce courts, and a person domiciled
in that province could not obtain a divorce
except by coming to Parliament, until 1930,
when Parliament passed legislation conferring jurisdiction in divorce on Ontario for
the same grounds that applied, as I have
already stated, to British Columbia and the
prairie provinces, and Prince Edward Island.
Turning to the provinces of Quebec and
Newfoundland: Newfoundland entered into
Confederation recently, so I will confine my
remarks chiefiy to Quebec. It is the practice to
secure decrees of divorce in both these provinces by act of Parliament. I understand that

approximately 500 divorce petitions from
Quebec will be dealt with by Parliament this
session.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Not quite so many.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I said "approximately."
It is somewhere between 400 and 500.
I am indebted to the honourable member
from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard) for his
contribution to this debate. He is not here
tonight, but I intend to quote from what he
said. I shall have quite a lot to say about
his speech. But I would not like honourable
senators to think that I was discussing his
speech with a sense of security arising out of
the fact that he bas gone over to the Old
Country.
Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Farris: As a matter of fact, I
think my criticism of his speech will be a
tribute to the strength and force of what he
said. His speech invites reply from anybody
who disagrees with him, not because of its
weakness, but because of its strength. I say
that also of the speech by my honourable
friend from Ottawa West (Hon. Mr. Connolly).
However, I think I shall pick on the absentee
senator a little more than on my friend from
Ottawa West.
Honourable senators, at this stage I am
indebted to my honourable friend from Grandville for what he said about the jurisdiction
of the courts in the province of Quebec-more
in regard to nullity than divorce. It will be
recalled that be was discussing the wording of
our act referring to the conferring of jurisdiction on the courts of the province of Quebec
in regard to divorce, because of their existing
jurisdiction. I quote from the report of his
speech in the Senate Hansard, at page 259:
I am not talking of separation from bed and
board, I am talking of a full dissolution of
marriage, and the Civil Code specifies several
causes for dissolution of marriage. I will cite a
few examples. Nullity can be decreed if natural
or accidential impotency existed when the marriage
took place.

Now, that would be declaring the marriage
void ab initio.
May I point out to honourable senators
who are not lawyers that there are two kinds
of nullity. There are cases in which the
marriage is just void. There are other cases
in which the marriage is voidable. That
means that the marriage is good if it is left
alone, but the parties may make an application in court and have the marriage declared
void ab initio. It is voidable but not void
until so declared. That is a very important
distinction when we are considering this
question of the jurisdiction of the courts in
Quebec in comparison with the jurisdiction
of the courts in the other provinces. As I
understand it, a voidable marriage might be

SENATE
so declared void after there were children.
I do not know what the law is in the province
of Quebec, but a voidable marriage so
declared-that is, void if in any of our other
provinces-would bastardize the children.
The honourable senator from Grandville
continued:
Nullity can be decreed when the marriage has
been contracted by a minor without having obtained
the necessary consent.

That is, without the necessary consent of the
minor's parents.
Nullity can be decreed if the marriage is between
close relatives whether in a direct or collateral
line. That is a third cause. Nullity can also be
decreed if there is a religious obstacle resulting
from relationship, whether natural or by affinity,
and affinity there means by marriage. That is a
fourth cause. I could cite some more.

I now refer to my friend's remarks on
page 267:
Frankly, I admit that I sec no great difference
between divorce and annulment of marriage.

You see, honourable senators, I am supporting my proposition that in principle
divorce is the law of Canada, practically
without any exception, and while in the
province of Quebec divorces as such are
obtained in large numbers only in Parliament, there is, as my honourable friend from
Grandville pointed out, a process by which
you can take a marriage which is good until
it is interfered with, and cause it to be
rendered void. To repeat what my friend
from Grandville said:
Frankly, I admit that I see no great difference
between divorce and annulment of marriage. Both
have the same consequences.

As far as I can understand the situation,
I quite agree with my friend. I think he is
right in that connection, particularly as to
marriages which are only voidable.
I think, honourable senators, that by these
references I have established the proposition
that divorce law is the law of Canada, that
it is the recognized law of Canada, and has
been during our Confederation. I say that
nothing in this bill challenges that principle.
My reason for emphasizing this is that I
think that too many of the speeches already
made have not been shooting at the right
target, but that they have been shooting at
the target of the principle of divorce that
has already been established, which is not
the issue. We are not now debating the issue
of divorce, but recognizing divorce as an
acknowledged principle of law in Canada.
The issue is: is there something the Senate
of Canada can do in the public interest to
improve the conditions under which divorce
may be granted?
Honourable senators, I have written down
what I conceive to be the issue, and the only
issue, in this debate, and I will now read it:
The issue involved on the second reading of this
bill is neither to approve or challenge the principle
of the divorce for cause.

That, I say, has been established.
But, recognizing the established law, the only
principle involved is to determine if it is in the
public interest to modify and extend the grounds
of divorce in order
(1) to better serve modern social conditions,
(2) to correct existing abuses, and
(3) to treat with mercy, toleration and justice
the innocent victims of broken homes and those
suffering from the intolerable conduct of unfaithful
or depraved husbands, or wives.

Now, honourable senators, may I repeat
myself. I strongly urge the bouse to confine
this discussion to the specific issue involved,
namely, the matters contained in the bill
now before us. Those honourable senators
who are opposed to divorce in any form, and
who are opposed to the law as it now stands,
should have the courage of their convictions
and say what they believe. They should
introduce in this bouse a bill abolishing
divorce on any ground and on that question
their speeches directed to that issue would
be in order.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I take it my honourable friend would not want to leave the
matter with the provinces.
Hon. Mr. Farris: No; I do not think we
want too conglomerate a divorce law, such
as that of many states in the United States.
I say again, if any honourable senator thinks
divorce as a principle is wrong not only for
Quebec, but for all of Canada, his proper
procedure is to introduce a bill abolishing
divorce altogether. Some of the speeches
made on the bill now before us have served
to becloud the issue in this case. Those
speeches should have been made on a measure
to abolish divorce generally, and not on a
measure to improve the acknowledged, existing and continuing divorce law in Canada.

Now, honourable senators, I have had some
experience in public life in Canada which
makes me disposed to emphasize the need for
improvement of our divorce law. In this connection may I turn to another subject-matter,
that of liquor, to illustrate my point? During
the First World War I was Attorney General
for the province of British Columbia. The
Government of which I was a member had
a referendum on the question of prohibition,
and later introduced a prohibition law into
that province. It appeared that almost everybody was in favour of prohibition as a war
measure, as long as it did not apply to himself. I speak with some feeling on this matter
because as a young and inexperienced man
on the liquor question, except to take a drink
now and again, it was my duty to try to
enforce this law. I suffered considerable
criticism at that time which does not attach
to me today, because in later years experience
has proven the impossibility of running
against the current of public sentiment. The
Government held another referendum, in
which it asked the people, "Are you in favour

MARCH 15, 1955

of the sale of liquor by the Government?"
The vote was in favour of the referendum
by a large majority. It then became my duty,
with the assistance of Mr. Pineo, the legislative counsel, a very able man who came
frorn Eastern Canada, to draft the law which
was to follow the referendum.
While prohibition had been defeated, there
were still many active prohibitionists in the
legislature and particularly in our Government caucus. The result was that many of
those men approached the drafting of that
law in this frame of mind: we are prohibitionists; we are against the sale of liquor;
we will make the act as unworkable as possible. Well, honourable senators, with all
deference to my efforts and achievements, I
think we succeeded in drafting such a law.
It prohibited drinking in a public place or
in a hotel; it provided for the establishment
of beer parlours, in which you could only
swill beer; you could not buy a sandwich or
get a glass of ginger ale.
I am glad to say, honourable senators, that
in later years that law was very much improved. However, it must be said that the
law we enacted had the effect of creating
habits of bedroom drinking. Mr. Pineo
remarked to me, "My instructions are not to
prohibit drinking, but to make sure it is done
in secret." To indicate my attitude in the
matter, I merely say that within a year I
resigned from the Government.
Honourable senators, that is ancient history,
but the principle involved there with respect
to liquor can be related to the principle of
divorce today. Let us not make the mistakes
that those well-intentioned prohibitionists
made some thirty or forty years ago. Let us
not approach the discussion of an improved
law with the attitude, "I am against divorce
on any grounds." I appeal to honourable
senators not to discuss this bill by challenging divorce on any ground. If they will
recognize the existence and continuance of
divorce in Canada, then let us join together
and see if we cannot improve the existing
law by some amendments which would be
regarded by even those prejudiced against
divorce as being reasonable and sensible.
I should now like to take up some of the
arguments which have been made against
this bill. The honourable senator from Prince
(Hon. Mr. Barbour) made some emphatic
statements about the evils of liquor as contributing to conditions which bring about
divorces. As long as my friend stayed with
that argument I agreed with him and thought
he was on sound ground. He went on to
say that because of these conditions there is
divorce, and he gave liquor as the cause.
I must disagree with him when he confuses
cause and effect.
I turn next to the argument put forward
by my honourable friend from Grandville

(Hon. Mr. Bouffard), who pointed out that
in his opinion there were bad conditions
arising out of the present divorce law which
was confined to the one ground of adultery.
No man can deny that there are abuses: in
some cases there is perjury; in some cases
there is connivance; in other cases I have
no doubt adultery has been deliberately committed as the only ground on which a divorce
could be secured, when the relationship of
husband and wife has become absolutely
hopeless. I agree with my honourable friend's
proposition up to that point. But what is
his cure? He advocated stricter enforcement
of the law. Well, I think if my honourable
friend has any ideas as to how we can better
enforce the law he should become a member
of the Senate Divorce Committee and assist
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
I would point out that in all nine provinces
in which there are divorce courts they are
presided over by judges of the Superior
Courts, men appointed by the Government of
this country and of whom we are proud. I
challenge my honourable friend from Grandville, or any other senator, to prove by any
evidence that these judges do not perform
their duties just as sincerely and efficiently
as do the members of our Divorce Committee.
I say to my honourable friend from Grandville that as a practising lawyer of wide
experience he should be more realistic and
understand that the necessity for the present
measure arises from one cause, namely, the
absence of grounds other than adultery for
people bound to have divorce at any cost.
That is the explanation. You can no more
dam the tide than you can improve the
present situation without extending the
grounds.
I say, honourable senators, that these conditions so far as they exist under the present
law are a demonstration of a pent-up resistance against limitations that can only be
cured by a sensible widening of the grounds
to meet present-day realities.
Now, let us turn to the grounds in the
divorce bill itself. The first is desertion.
As lawyers we have an expression in our
pleadings that you must condescend to particulars. Outside of the honourable member
from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard), I have
not heard a single senator speaking against
this bill who has "condescended to particulars." But my honourable friend from
Grandville did. The first new ground proposed in the bill is desertion, designated in
the bill as second, and here is what my honourable friend from Grandville said, as
reported at page 264 of the Senate Debates:
The second ground for divorce under the bill is
desertion. Desertion bas no doubt painful consequences for the spouse who bas been deserted
and for the children, if any.

SENATE
I would agree with that very strongly,
honourable senators. He continues:
Desertion especially reveals the little consideratin the husband and wife have given to the most
important act of their lives.

If I may use a slang expression: So what?
Divorce has not been the cause of that condition. It is only an attempt as a last resort to
give relief from a situation which has become
intolerable and impossible.
Racial and religious differences, temperaments
and customs are the most frequent causes of
desertion, which is often the aftermath of marriages
contracted after an orgy.

Now, just think of that, honourable senators, as an argument against divorce. These
people, young and irresponsible, indulge in
an orgy-I suppose that means they become
more or less "tight"-and get married and
find themselves in an impossible condition.
The argument is that there should be no
relief for them, and that the possibility of
getting a divorce would explain the cause
of the orgy. With all deference to my honourable friend from Grandville it does not in
my reasoning make sense.
He went on to say:
I do not feel that for such unimportant reasons
we should apply so drastic and so dangerous a
remedy as the dissolution of marriage. If we
accept such a ground for divorce. we immediately
open the door to hasty and ill-considered
marriages . . .

There you see his point, that the divorce is
the cause of the hasty and ill-considered mar-

riage. Now we men and women of the
world-a great many of us professional-have
had a good deal to do with the problems of
people who get into these predicaments. I
have been practising law for over fifty years,
and although I do not specialize in the law
of divorce I have had a good many people in
such cases come to me for assistance. I have
never had in my practice, and I cannot believe
that any member of the Senate who is a
lawyer has ever had a suggestion that the
possibility of a future divorce was in the
least degree a factor in causing those people
to get married in an irresponsible way.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. Farris: My honourable friend
from Grandville continues:
Is it not a fact that both world wars were to
blame for many cases of desertion which aroused
our sympathy but which remain nevertheless
exceptional cases?
Well, in considering the descriptions that
were given, particularly by my honourable
friend from Ottawa West (Hon. Mr. Connolly),
of conditions in England, I do not think they
are exceptional cases. It is a little hard
for those of us who were not in England
during the war years to get a full picture
of the conditions there. They were very
different from conditions in this country. Over

on that little island were a lot of mighty
attractive girls, and the fine young men in
military training appealed to the imagination
of every girl who saw them in uniform. There
were men in thousands and tens of thousands
from Canada, from Australia and from the
United States of America, and those girlswe might as well look at things as they
are-appealed to the normal instincts that
existed under those conditions. Beyond that
was the fact that a great many soldiers felt
they probably would be killed in action, and
they might as well have a little pleasant
association before they left England. That
was not the exceptional case; that was the
more or less general situation, which has led
to thousands of divorces since the war. Many
have resulted from the lowering of moral
standards at that time and ill-considered
war-time marriages.

What in the world did the possibility of
divorce have to do with those conditions?
Not a single thing. I venture to say that
you could not find one single case in a
thousand in which there would be any
evidence to support the proposition that illconsidered promiscuous relationships before

marriage or hasty war marriages were
influenced or contributed to by the possibility
of divorce afterwards. I appeal to the practical common sense of every person here in
submitting that that is right.
The next objection put forward is that
there might be collusion. Now, honourable
senators, we are discussing desertion, we are
"condescending to particulars"; we are mak-

ing not a general statement about the sanctity
of the home life, but a cold-blooded analysis
of a desertion where there is no home life.

It is gone. This desertion is for three years
or more without cause. Where does the home
life come in? Where does the sanctity come
in? It has gone.
Now the suggestion is that this ground of
desertion would lead to collusion. When a
man can get a divorce now by spending one
night with a woman, is he going to abandon
that simple process to fabricate desertion and
wait for three years or more just for collusion's sake.

Hon. Mr.
have to.

Golding: He certainly

doesn't

Hon. Mr. Farris: Honourable senators, make
no mistake. There must have been an unhappy relationship of a most serious nature
between husband and wife if they collude at
desertion for three years. I do not think there
is any ghost of a chance that there will be
fraudulent divorces on the ground of deser-

tion such as there now are for adultery.

MARCH
Both my honourable friends from Grandville and Ottawa West discussed the question
of children said we must protect our children
from divorce.
They told us of the tragedy of the thousands
and thousands of children in the United States
and in Great Britain, of broken homes where
-the children of divorced parents are not looked
after. I would refer honourable senators to
what my honourable friend from Ottawa
West said about this at pages 250 and 253.
For the time being we are considering
divorce from the standpoint of desertion. For
example: a husband, to whom his wife bas
borne two children, leaves her. He does not
give her a cent; probably she does not know
where he is, his absence extends over two
years or more; the chances, nine out of ten,
are that he bas a mistress, although his wife
cannot prove it. What harm, in those circumstances, will a divorce do to the children?
This is one of the issues we have to face.
Take the case which was mentioned by the
honourable senator from Victoria (Hon. Mrs.
Hodges). Here are a man and a woman,
honourable people, who want to be married.
The woman has children, and the man would
provide for them. Her husband bas deserted
ber and been confined to a mental hospital
for years. The law denies ber remarriage,
on the principle of the sanctity of the home
-in this case a home which bas no sanctity
about it. It refuses her a divorce on the
ground of a supposed unity of two persons
who for years have had no unity, nor ever
will have on God's earth.
Or consider the experience of the Senate
Divorce Committee. I had the privilege a
couple of years ago of attending a good number of hearings-I have since been occupied
elsewhere-and in almost every instance the
question was asked, "Is there any chance of
normal home life being restored? That is
something with which every member of the
committee was gravely concerned-can the
marriage be restored?-and I venture to say
that in not one case of the five hundred or so
which constitute a year's work bas the committee decided, "We will not recommend a
divorce because we believe the parties can
be brought together again."
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In not a single case.
Hon. Mr. Farris: What is the use of talking
about the sanctity of a home that has no
sanctity, or stressing marital obligations
which have been torn to shreds, or suggesting as a consideration the welfare of children
whose mother bas been left without a dollar
by her husband? What is the sense of talking
about the benefit to the children of preserving a marriage of this kind? The only
earthly prospect of happiness they can have
50437-19

Is that their mother may be able to marry
some decent man who will be glad to provide a home for herself and ber children,
and perhaps raise other children who would
be brought up respectably. Make no mistake
about it; each one of us knows from his own
experience that such things happen. I could
naine a great many cases in which, divorces
having taken place, remarriages have followed and very happy homes have been
established. But in all my experience as a
lawyer and as a member of the Divorce Committee I do not know of one solitary case
wherein the happiness of a broken home
could be restored through denying to the
parties concerned the right-in my opinion,
legitimate and just-to a separation through
divorce.
My honourable friend the senator from
Ottawa West (Hon. Mr. Connolly) asserts
that divorce is a cancer in our social system.
He is right about the cancer, but wrong
about the cause to which he attributes it.
The cancer is that condition which disrupts
and destroys our family life. Al that a
divorce does is to attempt to cure that cancer. In my respectful submission, the honourable senator's argument directly confuses
cause and effect. He told us that divorce
begets divorce, that it will increase the number of divorces. Well, it is a catchy phrase,
but I do not find anything in the speeches
of either my honourable friend from Ottawa
West or the honourable senator from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard) in proof of the
soundness of this statement. Divorce does not
beget divorce; it is the consequence of some
conditions of which I will treat more fully
in a few minutes. The honourable senator
who cited the English statistics in this connection did not disclose how many divorces
were the result of desertion, which is the
subject I am now discussing. The important
point is to find out what were the causes of
these desertions, and whether a pent-up condition resulting from the denial of relief has
any chance in the world of improving the
social conditions or the morals of the people
or lessening the prospects of further divorces.
My desk-mate, the honourable senator
from Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard) quoted
the Gospel of St. Mark, chapter 10, verse 9:
What therefore God
not man put asunder.

hath joined together, let

I understand, honourable senators, that many
different kinds of people can quote scripture.
I suggest to my honourable friend from Wellington that the tenth chapter of St. Mark
should not be interpreted too literally, for
in another place in that same chapterHon. Mr. Howard: Then do not quote that
too literally!
Hon. Mr. Farris: Oh, yes, I am going to
read it. I understand that my honourable

SENATE

friend is not without worldly possessions;
and the twenty-fifth verse of that same
chapter reads:
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye
of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into
the kingdom of God.

I understand, of course, that there are interpretations of that verse which may reassure
my honourable friend. And I would respectfully suggest that a proper understanding of
the verse he has quoted, in its statement "Let
not man put asunder", is that it is primarily
directed to the husband himself.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why, of course.
Hon. Mr. Farris: When, for instance, there
is desertion, it is he who puts the marriage
asunder. Does the judge who grants the
divorce put the marriage asunder? Not be,
honourable senators, but the man who has
left his wife and children in destitution; who,
for two years or more, has caused his family
nothing but suffering and sorrow, and has
denied his wife the opportunity of improving
her condition. So I repeat that a mere
declaration by a judge that the marriage is
dissolved, when in essence it is already
destroyed, is not a violation of the Gospel
injunction. I trust that this, which seems to
me the evident meaning of the verse he has
quoted, will change my honourable friend's
views in this connection.
Both the honourable senator from Grandville and the honourable senator from Ottawa
West laid stress upon the contractual obligation involved. Under the common law in our
English-speaking provinces I know that no
matter how formal a contract may be-it may
bear a seal and the names of witnesses and
so on-if one party breaks the essentials of
the contract the other party is relieved in law
from any obligation. There is no question
about that. Why should that principle not
apply so far as the contractual obligation of
marriage is concerned? Where is the mutual
obligation if a man deserts his wife for two
years, perhaps leaving ber helpless with
children; or commits adultery with a mistress;
or continually commits acts of cruelty upon
his wife, making a hell out of the home?
I am sure that every lawyer in this chamber
who comes from a province which follows the
common law will agree with me that under
similar conditions any other kind of contract
would be as dead as Julius Caesar.
Honourable senators, I strongly urge that
we give this bill second reading and send it
to committee where we may consider ways
and means to improve it. Leaving aside for
the moment all other grounds but desertion,
is there not reason to show that we could improve our existing law by including desertion
as a ground for divorce, trusting our courts
not to stultify any new law in respect to

desertion but to give to it the same honest
interpretation and administration as they do
all other law in Canada? If honourable senators agree with me that there ought to be
some provision in our divorce law for desertion, that alone justifies sending the bill to
committee even though we may throw out all
its other proposals. Would fewer divorces
lead to fewer desertions? I would challenge an
affirmative answer to that question, and I
have not heard a worthwhile argument to
support it.
Let us come next to the question of cruelty,
which in my humble opinion requires more
consideration than that of desertion, where I
think the argument is all one way. The honourable senator from Grandville quoted statistics from the United States showing that
out of 100,000 divorces granted in twenty
states only 1,400 were on the ground of adultery, while 56,000 were on the ground of
cruelty. He went on to give illustrations, and
I believe he said that in some states a wife
could even get a divorce on the ground of
cruelty because ber husband ate his breakfast with a newspaper stuck up in front of
him. What does that prove? In my judgment
it proves nothing. That sort of thing does
not reflect on divorce laws but rather on the
social and moral conditions of the people,
and on the judges who interpret the law in
such a way. If there have been such cases as
have been given in illustration, they reflect
a wrong attitude of the courts. I say that
with all deference.
In his address the honourable gentleman
from Grandville told us about twenty-two
graduates of a well-known and highly reputed
convent. I presume the young ladies were
beautiful and virtuous. He went on to say
that within two years of leaving the convent
twenty had married, and after three years
nineteen of them were divorced. What does
that prove? It might be a very persuasive
argument to sweep a jury off its feet, but
let us stop and analyse the story. What do
we know about those divorce cases? We do
not know the background or history of
those girls. We do not know whether they
got the divorces or whether their husbands
got them; we do not know on what grounds
the divorces were granted, and we do not
know in what jurisdiction they were granted,
whether in New York or some other state.
I suspect those girls were so strictly brought
up in the convent that every man looked good
to them when they got out. There is a basic
explanation of these hasty, ill-considered
marriages. The mere unexplained statement
of fact that has been given to us proves
absolutely nothing in relation to what we
are now discussing.
It is admitted, and we know it is true,
that there are serious abuses in the United

MARCH 15, 1955
States in the matter of granting divorces on
the ground of cruelty, but can we not safeguard ourselves against this mockery and at
the sarne time provide reasonable grounds for
divorce where the home is destroyed by
cruelty? In my respectful submission the
answer is yes. We have already had experience in this in Canada. Cruelty has been a
ground for divorce in that good old province down by the Atlantic, Nova Scotia, since
1761. Has this law been abused in Nova
Scotia? When this point was put to my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Bouffard), he said:
"I take off my hat to Nova Scotia. It must
have higher morals than the rest of Canada".
Well, I went to college in Nova Scotia, and I
doubt very much whether the people there
were any better than my people over in New
Brunswick or the people in British Columbia,
where my new home is. But they are good
people and there has not been any pitiable
exhibition of mockery of that law by the
citizens and judges of Nova Scotia. We can
feel assured that our courts will never
interpret any reasonable law in regard to
cruelty so as to make a mockery of the law,
as has been done in some of the alleged
interpretations in the United States. Each
one of us has enough confidence and faith
in our judges to be satisfied with that fact.
But I am not entirely satisfied with the
definition of cruelty as contained in this
bill. We do not have to accept it; we can
change it. I would suggest, first of all, that
the word "repeated" be incorporated in our
definition of cruelty. If a man comes home
drunk some night and beats his wife up it
should not constitute cruelty within the meaning of the act. But if the beatings were continued there would come a time when they
would be considered habitual, and at that
time I think the wife should be entitled to
sue the husband for divorce on the ground of
cruelty-at the stage where the home no
longer exists, and where the sanctity of the
home, which my honourable friend from
Charlottetown (Hon. Mr. Barbour) so touchingly referred to, is undermined. I cannot
see for one minute how one can talk about
the sanctity of the home if there are real
grounds of cruelty or of desertion.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: I wonder how many
nights the wife could stand a beating?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Well, I wonder, too, but
according to my honourable friend she has
to stand it for the rest of ber life.
My honourable friend from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) has indicated that we
should accept the definitions of cruelty as
given by the High Court of England. I have
not had time to read them, and I do not
know whether we should tie ourselves to
them, or whether we should make our own
50437-19J

definition right now, with the benefit of the
English definitions before us. But I would
say first that the acts of cruelty must be
repeated acts which include not only acts or
conduct endangering life, limb or health, but
also any course of conduct so intolerable that
the petitioner could not be reasonably
expected willingly to live with the offending
spouse. This definition may not be drastic
enough, but it is my suggestion for consideration in committee only. Honourable senators,
conditions of cruelty can exist that make the
home not a sanctified place but a hell on
earth. And what good is it going to do to
the moral conditions of this country to fasten
on a man or woman a law which drives them
out to seek what pleasures they may obtain
out of life in other pastures? I cannot see
any.
I come now to the question of insanity. if
has been suggested that this ground would
lead to collusion, deception and fraud. I
submit that that is just out of the question,,
for we have competent courts and doctors
with speciaized knowledge to deal with such
cases. May I point out that the bill before
us specifies that insanity must be of at least
five years' duration, and also must be incurable-not by old standards, but by modern
standards of medicine. Now, if it is proven
that insanity has existed for at least five years
and is incurable according to modern science,
how can there be any possibility of fraud,
deception or collusion?
Some of my friends of the medical profession have mentioned curable insanity. That,
of course, does not enter into our consideration, for cases that are curable according to
medical science, as of to date, would not be
within the jurisdiction of the courts under this
bill. Others have said that, after all, insanity
1s comparable to other diseases. I dispute
that assertion. I can understand and admire
the husband or wife who has to bear with
a spouse who is incurably ill but who nevertheless has a mind; but when the mind is
gone, I submit there is really no difference
between that kind of insanity, if it is incurable, and death. How can one conceive of
any factor of union in a relationship which
we all regard with such high reverence, if a
man or woman is permanently insane and
has no mind, and is not conscious of what is
going on within the bounds of that relationship? But one honourable senator said, "Oh,
but this relationship is to be 'in sickness and
in health.'"
With regard to the obligation to support, in
practically all the provinces the obligation to
support an insane person rests primarily on
the state, if such person is not able to provide
support by his or her own means. In the
province of British Columbia, at least, if an

THE ESTIMATES
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE ON FINANCE

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved:
That the Standing Committee on Finance be
authorized to examine the expenditures proposed
by the estinates laid before Parliament for the
fiscal year ending March 31, 1956, in advance of
the bills based on the said estimates reaching
the Senate; that the said committee be empowered
to send for records of revenues from taxation
collected by the federal, provincial and municipal
governments in Canada and the incidence of this
taxation in its effect upon different income groups,
and records of expenditures by such governments,
showing sources of income and expenditures of
same under appropriate headings, together with
estimates of gross national production, net national
income and movement of the cost-of-living Index,
and their relation to such total expenditures, for
the year 1939 and for the latest year for which
the information is available and such other matters
as may be pertinent to the examination of the
estimates, and to report upon the same.
That the said committee be empowered to send
for persons, papers and records.

He said: Honourable senators, this motion
1s in form the same as one moved in 1951

when the estimates for that year were referred to the Standing Committee on Finance.
Honourable senators will recall the splendid
work done by that committee under the very
able chairmanship of the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). I have read
the committee's report, and I feel that the
committee that session rendered very valuable service to Parliament and to Canada.
In 1950 the estimates were referred to a
number of committees. For instance, certain
estimates were referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications. I
presume they were the estimates of the
Department of Transport. The Standing Committee on Public Health and Welfare also
was authorized to examine certain estimates,
and the votes are mentioned. Presumably they
were the estimates of the Department of
National Health and Welfare. Similarly, our
Standing Committee on External Relations
was authorized to examine the estimates of
the Department of External Affairs; and our
Committee on Canadian Trade Relations to
examine the estimates of the Department of
Trade and Commerce.
However, it was found difficult to obtain
quorums at these different committees when
they were sitting at the same time, and it
was necessary to have them sitting at the
same time in order to get through with the
examination of the estimates. The difficulty
arose of course because quite a number of
senators were members of more than one of
the committees that were sitting simultaneously. In 1951 the difficulty was overcome by
referring all the estimates to the Standing
Committee on Finance.
It has been suggested outside this chamber
that it is not necessary for our Finance Committee or any other Senate committee to
examine the estimates because a new procedure has been adopted in the House of
Commons.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It has not been tried out yet.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My honourable friend
from New Westminster says that the new
system has not been tried out yet. It is being
tried out at the present time. Probably I
could just explain briefly what the new
arrangement is. Previously in the House of
Commons all the estimates were referred to
the Committee of Supply and considered in
the chamber. However, at the current session certain estimates, though not all of them,
have been referred to a committee on estimates which meets quite frequently, and sits,
not in the Commons chamber, but as an
ordinary committee, usually at times when
the house is not in session. At present that

that have been made to myseif and to the
work of the Finance Committee in previous
years. However, as honourable senators are
well aware, I am certainly not; that kind of
a fiower. Nevertheless I have appreciated
-what both the honourable Leader o! the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) have said.
I arn quite unchanged in the view I have
.always had that if an inquiry o! titis kind
is to achieve any good purpose it must be
wholly non-partisan in character and objective in its approach. That was the basis upon
which the previous inquiries were carried
-out by the committee, and I arn bound to
say that that was largely responsible for
any success attending the committee's efforts.
I do not think there is anything more
important in the conduct o! public business
'than the amount of money that governiments
'take out of the taxpayers' pockets and what
Zovernments do wîth this money; and titis
-touches directly upon these Government estimates. It wouid be very inadvisable for this
.committee to single out certain departmnents
.and dig into their spending activities. The
.committee trîed to do this the first year it
lnquired into the estimates and it did not
work out too well.
I arn sure honourable members are
lfamillar with the sheet that appears in the
'back of the Blue Book ýcontaining the estimates for the fiscal year. There is a wealth
-of information i this sheet for any member
of Parliament who wishes to in!orm. himself
intelllgently about Government spending. It
gives a broad classification by classes o!
expenditure which are grouped into what
are called "Standard objects of expenditure
and special categories". There are twenty-two standard objects and twelve special
categories, and the expenditures of each
department of Government are given in
-these various groups. The net total estimated
expenditures o! each department are also
given.
When our committee meets for the first
time I shail suggest that we deal with some
particular object o! expenditure that has
,grown, and try to find out the reasons for
this growth. I shaîl suggest that we examine
-it in 'a critical fashion so as to ascertain
whether the growth has been fully justified.
I mention titis because it is a matter of
,serious concern that over one-third of the
net national income is being taken by way
of taxes at ail leveis o! Government. We
liave been able to carry these heavy taxes
because of the immense amount of new
wealth we have been turning up, particuiarly since the end of the war. However, if
-we become committed to a certain process

of expenditure, our gross national income
and the very structure upon which our tax
system. is founded will be affected, should
living conditions become a littie more difficuit: shouid crops become poor or should we
be unable to get adequate prices for our
newsprint, base metais or lumber. Therefore,
I seriousiy think it is of some value and
importance to try to carry out a critical,
unbiased and fair examination of these
expenditures and possibilities.
1 am sure that the committee members
will co-operate, as they have done in the
past, to effectiveiy study these matters.
Incidentally, I think altogether too much
credit has been given to me in the past as
chairman of this committee. The credit should
go to the committee members. I have had a
great deai of experience in commitee work
and 1 must say that I have neyer seen any
committee members work more unselfishly
and whole-heartedly to get the f acts and reach
the conclusions resting upon those facts. The
work of the committee will be demanding,
but that is the kind of work we are here to
do. I arn certainiy iooking forward with
considerable interest to the hearings of the
committee this session.
Hon Sonators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourabie senators, I shouid like to add a few words by
way of background in connection with the
reference of the estimates to the Finance
Committee. In past years, and especially
during the war, there was a good deal of
criticismn of the practice of submitting the
Supply Bill for approval of the Senate in the
final days of the session. Strong protests
were made that the members of this house
had had no opportunity whatsoever to
examine the details of the vast expenditures
that they were being asked almost overnight
to approve-amounts which certainly in the
history o! this country have not been equalled
at any time. On the motion o! my honourable
friend from Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King),
who was the Leader of the Government in
the Senate at that time, the estimates for
one of the war years were referred to the
Finance Committee for study, so that senators
might be able to acquaint themselves with
the character of the proposed expenditures
before the Supply Bull was presented in this
house, and that was done each session for
some years thereafter. In 1950 the estimates
were referred to various committees as
mentioned by the Leader o! the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald), but in 1951 the
practice o! referring them to the Finance
Committee was resumned.
I submit that the study of the estirnates
by tis committee in past years has been

SENATE

of great value, perhaps chiefly in that it has
enabled the members of the Senate to have
a more intelligent appreciation of the expenditures provided for in the Supply Bill
than they otherwise would have.

gra.ce this chamber with his presence, to
delight us with his eloquence and to guide
us by his wisdom.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: At the outset of my
discussion of the bill, may I declare in no
uncertain terns that I am in favour of
marriage. I should like to see all the young
people of marriageable age married and
living happy lives. And, like the senator
from Victoria (Hon. Mrs. Hodges), I am
opposed to divorce, because if our young
married couples were living comfortable,
proper, decent and happy lives there would
be no need for divorce.
When I say that I am in favour of marriage, I mean that I am in favour of all
those things involved in that splendid institution; first of all, that natural attraction
between the sexes, which is just as beautiful
and purposeful as the petals on the rose,
and which serves the same purpose. One
can scarcely express one's impressions on
this subject, around which the sweetest and
noblest of all sentiments cluster, without
referring to what the poets have written
about it. Honourable senators will pardon
me if I quote briefly:
I have travelled much this weary mortal round,
And sage experience bids me this declare:
If Heaven one draught of heavenly pleasure spare,
One cordial in this melancholy vale,
It is when a youthful, modest, loving pair
In each other's arms breathe out the tender tale...

Obviously, honourable senators, the poet
reserved for his rhapsody a youthful pair.
I always rejoice and am happy when young
people join their lives in the holy bonds
of matrimony, for this is the natural order.
In youth emotional impulses are strongest,
and the physical side of sex, the power to
reproduce, is at its highest level. I have
many times advised young people to marry,
and to do so early, for when people are
young the reorientation that is necessary in
order to pass from single to double blessedness is most easily accomplished.
You will also note that the poet reserves
for his enthusiasm a loving pair. To my mind,
marriage without love is a stark and ugly
mask of the beautiful thing called marriage.
Let me discuss marriage from a practical
point of view. It is much more than a contract; it cannot be called a contract altogether
in law or in fact. In his speech last evening
the member from Vancouver South quoted
a senator who spoke earlier in this debate as
saying that marriage was a contract and
therefore it should be carried out with the
sanctity of a contract. The honourable senator
from Vancouver South aptly replied, that if it
was a contract and subject to contract law,
violation of the essential principles by one
50437-20j

party would release the other from his or ber
obligation. Although perhaps contract is involved in a marriage, I say it is not a
contract.
Marriage is a condition, entered into by
agreement, usually publicly announced, and
almost always impressively solemnized. Marriage bas two phases which are important in
our consideration of this bill. First, the confirmation of the spiritual and physical union,
with its mutual love and helpfulness, the
procreation of children and the maintenance
of the family. That I would designate as true
marriage. The second phase involves the
legal consequences of entering into that condition, personal and property rights affecting
the parties both within and without the contract, and public recognition. When our young
people say, as they often do, that their marriage was contracted in heaven, I have no
doubt they have in mind the first phase,
namely the love, helpfulness, procreation of
children, maintenance of the family and so
forth, more than the mere legal relationship.
The great founder of Christianity is
reported to have declared:
What therefore God hath joined together, let no
man put asunder.
I believe when He made that statement He
had in mind the first phase that I have
described, that of mutual co-operation and
the procreation of children, rather than the
second phase, based on the dusty law books
or the cold formalities of the law. Further,
I think He had in mind the spiritual and
human things, the rights of the parties one
to the other, and their effect upon the community as such. His whole life indicates to
me the truth of that interpretation. Consider
this:
The Sabbath was made for man, not man for
the Sabbath.
Man was not created for the purpose of
serving laws but laws were created for the
purpose of serving man. Or again, let us
recall that great saying:
Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's,
and to God the things that are God's.

There we have the clear separation between
the things that are spiritual and human as
opposed to the things that are merely legal.
Now, when I say that I am for marriage I
do not mean only those things legal which
we deal with sometimes here in this part of
Parliament. I refer as well to the things that
are human and spiritual. A union that is
only legal should hardly be designated with
the nane of marriage, and when the things
that are human have gone, as they so frequently have in our experience, then in my
judgment the dead husk of the law can usually go along with it.

SENATE
We have not in this country entirely forgotten that the injunction, "let not man put
asunder", refers to the union of hearts, the
joinder of bodies, the bonds of family as well
as that of law, for witness the stern disapproval with which we regard the interloper
between man and wife who disrupts and
breaks a family. I want to join with my
honourable friend from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) in his statement last night
that that command applies not only to those
outside the family, not only to those in authority, to the law givers, but it applies also to
those within the family, to husbands and
wives themselves. But unfortunately at the
present time those who disregard that injunction within the family have grown greatly in
number and I am afraid a good many are
guilty of breaching that injunction.
Now, if the question before us this afternoon was the total indissolubility of the marriage bond I might have a little more trouble
in coming to an opinion as to what we should
do. But that is not what is before us. Legal
divorce has been in existence from the
earliest times.
St. Matthew, chapter 19,
verse 9, in reporting the words of the founder
of Christianity with regard to the matter of
marriage and divorce, makes the special saving clause:
. . . except it be for fornication . . .

That is to say, even in those times-and
now I quote the highest authority we have
in Christian countries-in the words of the
founder of Christianity Himself there was
approval, at least toleration, of the principle
of divorce.
The principle of divorce has been the law
in every civilized country for at least a good
many years and is now the law of all civilized countries of the Western world, at least
in what we like to call the free world,
including the dominion of Canada, and, as
my honourable friend from Vancouver-South
(Hon. Mr. Farris), said last night, including
the province of Quebec.
Over the spiritual human ties that I have
been endeavouring to indicate, the law
giver, the law administrator, has very little
power. We have some power, there is no
question about that. We could do much, it
seems to me, to make marriage easier, and
successful marriage more likely. I mention
for instance the lack of proper housing
accommodation. I mention the very low
wages that are paid under certain circumstances. I mention the slums of our great
cities; yes, and the slums of the rural districts besides. There are many things that
we could do to make marriages-at all events
young marriages-more possible to those who
engage in them and more likely to succeed.

In the Divorce Committee just the other day
we passed a case in which the husband told
of the alienation of his wife's affections being
due to the miserable salary that he was making. While I could not approve of the wife's
attitude in the matter, I could nevertheless
understand to some extent how it came about.
Men are not machines, they are human and
spiritual, and unfortunately the legal bonds
which we do control are of very little avail
indeed when the human and spiritual bonds
have gone. And so the question is, not
whether we shall have divorce in this country
-we have it and shall continue to have itbut only when and under what circumstances
we shall grant divorce to those who apply
for it.
Up to the present time we have recognized
adultery as the only ground for the dissolution of marriage, with such exceptions as
have been mentioned earlier, particularly in
the province of Nova Scotia. But in the main,
and certainly in my province of Ontario, we
have in the past recognized only adultery as
a ground for dissolution of marriage, not as
a punishment for the adulterer but as indicating to us a matrimonial condition that is
intolerable to the innocent party. In our
Divorce Committee and in our courts all over
this country we consider the facts of the marital relations as well as the legal bonds, and
regularly we ask about the other ties as
well as the legal ties. We want to know
whether the real marriage is still in existence
before we will even consider dissolution of
the legal marriage. We ask the parties whether
they have continued sexual relation after the

in explanation-and we will no longer entertain the application for divorce. We ask if
there has been forgiveness, and we ask also
if there is any chance of re-establishing the
real marriage, that is by having the parties
forgive one another, forget the past and live
happily in the future.
Unfortunately, by the time these cases come
to us the real marriage is a thing of the past.
It has gone. I have not yet found a single
case where we could defer action in the hope
of re-establishing the truc marriage. But it is
only in cases where the marriage, in any
proper sense, is no longer in existence that
we will grant a divorce by cutting the legal
bonds. We do so because in this country we
regard adultery as a serious marital offence;
because, honourable senators, it is a breach
of the marriage vows, a breach of the undertaking-the very basis on which modern
marriage rests-to remain faithful to the
other party alone.

MARCH 18, 1955
Now, neither L. nature nor in law can
I find, in the ceremony itself or anything
outside of it, any distinction between these
various pledges which the parties make each
to the other and to the public. All are
stated together, and with equal emphasis,
and all are to continue, as expressed, while
both shall live and "till death us do part".
Neither in Holy Writ, so far as I have been
able to find out, nor in the law except as
we are responsible for it, is there any distinction between any of these pledges. I
find no reason whatsoever, in the words of
the ceremony itself or otherwise, why the
breach of one only of these pledges should
be a sufficient ground for dissolution of the
marriage, and that all others may be violated
and breached with impunity, without the
possibility of interference by the authorities
of the state. I repeat that neither in the
ceremony itself, in the law, nor in common
sense can I find any justification for singling
out one element and utterly disregarding the
others.

a seventh pledge-to cherish.

But what I want to call attention to this
afternoon is that the pledge to keep to ber or
to him alone is not by any means the only
marriage vow. What are the pledges to which
the parties commit themselves? Thus far, in
this debate, very little reference has been
made to the vows which people make when
they enter into the bonds of a legal or real
marriage. May I refer to the Book of Common
Prayer of the Church of England in Canada,
and turn to the section on Solemnization of
Matrimony? I select this book because I was
brought up in the English Church and was
married according to its ceremonies. But, more
important than that, as I understand the
matter, all marriage ceremonies are in essence
the same. There are changes of wording, but
not many: all the forms follow pretty much
the same lines; and as, of course, I cannot
read them all I take one which I believe to
be typical of the rest. What is this pledge,
made by a husband to a wife and a wife to
a husband, which is important to us in considering the matter of divorce? This is what
is said by the officiating clergyman:

SENATE
her. If there could be a more pronounced and
absolute violation of the marriage pledge, I
would like to know what it is. It is certainly as clear, distinct and definite a breach
of, shall I say, the agreement as is an act
of adultery. Desertion implies intended
desertion, mens rea, and certainly the man
who wilfully deserts his wife for three years
can hardly be said to cherish or to love her.
The next subclause in the section specifies
cruelty. I have read enough cases to know
what legal cruelty means in law. The man
who treats his wife with cruelty as defined
in the cases can hardly be credited with
keeping his pledge to comfort her. The same
is true of the wife if she treats ber husband
in the same way.
Section 6 (2) of the bill would enable a
wife to petition for divorce on the ground
that since the marriage her husband has
been guilty of the revolting crime of rape,
sodomy, or bestiality. Putting it mildly, if a
husband is found guilty of any of these
crimes lie has surely breached the vow to
honour his wife. Even if that is not the
cogent pledge which he has broken, lie certainly has not been living with his wife
according to God's holy ordinances. As I
have said, these words in the marriage contract mean something.
I submit that the provisions with regard
to insanity are in a somewhat different
classification. A person who becomes incurably insane has certainly suffered a terrible
misfortune, for which lie himself is not
deliberately responsible. It might be said
that in these circumstances the vow to love,
comfort, honour and keep "in sickness and
in health" is still binding. On the other hand
-and the case was put most forcibly last
night-what advantage is there to either the
husband or the wife to be kept tied together
by legal bonds when all other bonds under
the marriage vows are no longer possible of
fulfilment? What can society at large gain
by imposing cruelty of this kind upon one
or other of the married partners?
I do not mind confessing that I would be
more comfortable in this debate if we had
before us some general resolution rather
than a specifically detailed bill. It is true that
British precedent usually furnishes a good
guide , for Parliament when debating new
legislation in Canada. It has served as a
guide so often and so successfully that I do
not need to argue the point. British legislation has been adopted all over the world;
even its exact phraseology has been used in
other countries. For example, the Bills of
Exchange Act is law in practically every
civilized country outside the Iron Curtain.
But conditions in Great Britain, particularly
in social matters like divorce, may differ

from conditions in Canada, and it would be
unwise to adopt British legislation holusbolus. I submit, therefore, that most serious
consideration should be given to each of the
active clauses in this bill as well as to the
general principle of the bill. As honourable
senators know, it is the principle of the bill
to which I am addressing myself. I do not
propose to discuss the bill in detail.
The honourable senator from Grandville
(Hon. Mr. Bouffard) raised the question of
the constitutionality of the second half of
the bill, that is to say, the granting of divorce
in the event of seven years absence of a
husband or wife. According to the law of
Canada as it is today, if one of the partners
to a marriage has been absent for at least
seven years, and the other has not heard
from or of him or ber, the deserted spouse
may remarry and cannot be charged with
bigamy. The fact that the remarried person
cannot be charged with bigamy is a permission by statute law to the deserted person
to marry again. That is a very important
statute.
Hon. Mr. Davies: In order to remarry, must
the deserted spouse obtain, a divorce?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, it is not necessary to
obtain a divorce first. Although it is not so
stated in the act, we have always assumed
that a person absent for seven years is presumed to be dead.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Is it necessary for a
court to state that the absent person is dead?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, it is not. I think
there has been some tightening up in the
province of Ontario in the issuing of licences
for remarriage in such cases, but the departmental officials will grant a licence to be
remarried without a court passing on it, and
the individual-let us say the wife, for simplicity's sake-enters into the marriage upon
her own responsibility, ready, however, to
defend herself, on the grounds stated in the
Code, should a charge of bigamy be laid
against lier. But the difficulty is that if the
deserting spouse returns, no matter how long
lie has been away-whether seven or 27 years,
the law is that the woman and ber second
husband are then married so to speak, out
of wedlock.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does that mean that the
children are regarded as illegitimate?
Hon. Mr. Hoebuck: That is my understanding. I hate to admit it; the very thought of
it is repugnant to my mind, but I think that
is the law.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think that is a perfectly
contemptible position for us to take in society

SENATE
Each one of us will have to answer that
question for himself, but for my part the
answer is no.

The real question before us this afternoon
is: Will the widening of the terms of divorce,
as proposed by this bill, increase or decrease
the percentage of happy, normal, healthy
homes? Let me put it this way: Would there
be more happy homes if we said to the man
that he must keep his wife no matter how
badly she treats him? Should we say to him,
in effect: You were tied to this woman immediately the marriage noose was placed
about your neck and irrespective of how
grossly she neglects her wifely duties or how
she abuses her marital associations, you cannot escape? Would that lead to better and
happier homes? And should we tell the woman
that for ber there is no escape, regardless of
whether her husband beats, abuses or deserts
her? Or would it be more likely to lead to
happiness if we told ber that ber husband
could keep ber only as long as he treated
her decently, in accordance with the marriage
vow and the law of the land, but should
he violate them seriously by deserting or
abusing her or being cruel to her, as defined
by the law, she can escape from his unrighteous clutches? I rather think that freedom of that kind would tend more to happier
homes than the policy of endeavouring to
handcuff the parties one to the other.
It is admitted by my friends who oppose
the bill that there are hard, sad and pitiable
cases. One cannot sit as a member of the
Divorce Committee without knowing the truth
of that statement. But by what method are
we to increase the number of happy families?
Is it by maintaining the legal bond, irrespective of the suffering inflicted on the innocent
party; or, when gross marital guilt is proved,
by giving freedom to the innocent party and
allowing that unholy state of slavery, called
matrimony, to be dissolved?
My honourable friend from Ottawa West is
very much concerned about the vast army
of children of divorced people, and so am I.
But, does it help the children if we force the
continuance of unhappy homes? I think not.
Rather, would it not be of greater help to the
children to allow the parents to form more
suitable family arrangements? There are, I
know, cases where a mother and child might
both be greatly benefited by allowing the
mother to exchange a bad mate for a good
one. Can there be any complaint about that?
Extra-marital relations are not to be encouraged, but when parents do determine to make
new arrangements, as unfortunately they frequently do, and when they enter into these
extra-marital relations and form what they
call common law marriages in a new home, is

it of benefit to the children to refuse those
people the regularity of law and society of
the country in which they live? I do not
think so. Indeed, I can fancy the child from
an irregular home meeting difficulties from his
companions at school; yes, difficulties which
a little more humanity on our part might
very easily ameliorate, if not altogether
remove.
These are the problems, honourable senators, which we must discuss in the course of
this debate, and they cannot be resolved by a
puritanical approach; rather, our approach
must be made with kindness, understanding
and perhaps a little bit of courage. I willingly
concede that all who take part in the debate
and all who vote on the bill, whether they
are in favour of the bill or opposed to it, are
to the best of their judgment seeking the welfare of their fellow citizens. I mean that.
And I appeal to you all to let this bill go to
committee, where a thorough examination
may be made of all its provisions, where
evidence may be taken, where public opinion
may be tested. I appeal particularly to the
senators from the province of Quebec. The
sponsor of this bill has most carefully provided that it shall not apply in that province,
and if the provisions to that effect are not
sufficiently strong now they can be strengthened in committee.
Now, the honourable senator from Grandville says that we are representatives of all
Canada, and I agree with him in that. None
of us represents any one part of Canada alone.
But, regardless of what the law may be with
regard to the matter, the fact remains that I
am a representative of Ontario in this house.
I think the honourable senator from Rosetown was right in excluding Quebec and
Newfoundland from the provisions of this
bill.
I hope that I will never be guilty of trying
to impose my opinions and prejudices upon
the people of a province not my own. I also
hope that in discussing and voting on the
bill the senators from Quebec will express
the same sentiments toward the rest of
Canada as I am expressing with regard to
Quebec. I would not like to see this bill
applied to the people of Quebec if they did
not wish it. If they want to keep what I
think is an antiquated law on divorce, I am
all for letting them have it; but on the other
hand I do hope that they will not impose
their views, and their ideals with regard to
religion and divorce, upon the people of the
province from which I come. It works both
ways. If Ontario wants to liberalize its
divorce laws, surely my friends from Quebec
should allow them so to do; and they can do
so without any strain whatever, so far as
representing all Canada is concerned.

MARCH 16. 1955
in a general way, I favour this bill for

my province of Ontario, and for all the other
provinces to which it will apply if it is carried
out in the spirit in which it has been drawn.
I would like to see it given second reading
and sent to committee, where its every provision may be studied with great care, then
referred to this house and considered again,
if we see fit, in Committee of the Whole, and
not read the third time until we have a complete and thorough grasp of all its actual
provisions and their effects upon the community.
I will vote for the second reading of the
bill.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, it
was my intention simply to move the adjournment of the debate today, but if it is agreeable to the house I would just as soon make
the few remarks that I have to make on the
bill at the present time. I say this because
we are due to meet in committee in a few
minutes; but if I have the consent of the
house I will proceed now.
Hon. Senators: Go on.
Hon. Mr. Horner: First of all, honourable
senators, I want to say that I am in favour
of this measure for broadening the grounds
for divorce. I supported a similar bill just
seventeen years ago, and during the intervening years I have gathered considerable
experience, particularly while serving on the
Divorce Committee.
I often thought that it would be a very
good thing if a number of senators from
Quebec were to sit in on the Divorce Committee, even if they do not wish to take part.
They could gain more experience from
ittending its sessions than anyone can gain
?rom reading the printed evidence. There
they could see the agony on the faces of those
people who appear before the committee
praying for a divorce. All honourable senators who have served on the committee soon
realize that by the time the parties reach that
stage there is no question of breaking up their
homes. The homes, as has been remarked,
have already been broken up.
It is rather difficult for me to rise today
after listening to two magnificent speeches
by men of great ability, men trained in the
law. I consider that a number of the other
speeches made on this measure were also of
a very high order. I admired the remark of
the honourable senator from Kingston (Hon.
Mr. Davies) that he liked to see people
happy. As I listened to the quotations from
Scripture, I could not help but feel that the
Bible contains many important lessons for
us today. The parable of the Good Samaritan
is perhaps meant to depict our passage

through life. A certain man on the road from
Jerusalem to Jericho was pounced on by
thieves and left on the roadside. The priest
and the Levite passed by on the other side
of the road, but the good Samaritan stopped
and assisted the injured man. To me, that
is a grand illustration of how men and women
who tread this life sometimes have their
worries and troubles relieved. I would like
to be worthy of being considered a good
Samaritan.
For 47 years I have lived in a community
where the Doukhobors settled many years
ago. At that time they were given the privilege of solemnizing their own marriages in
their own way. They have churches, but
marriage ceremony generally takes place
in the home. At any time within a year of
the marriage it can be dissolved. You may
call it a trial marriage if you will. That is
a privilege which was extended to them
when they immigrated here, and their
form of marriage is legal in Canada.
Now, the important point I want to make
is, that after living amongst those people
for 47 years I am convinced that their marriages and family life are just as good as
those of any other people in Canada. I say
that without reservation. I firmly believe
that they are just as moral as any of us
are, that their church teaches as high a
course of conduct as does the church that
I attend, including opposition to divorce.
They are taught to consider the step seriously
before taking a life partner. I am certain
that such ideals are as thoroughly drilled
into them as they were into me.
I was rather amused at the remarks of
the honourable senator from Prince (Hon. Mr.
Barbour). Of course, he comes from that
little island garden down in the gulf where,
I understand, anyone not born on the island
is considered a foreigner. He states that the
evils of over indulgence in liquor contribute
to conditions which bring about divorces.
Well, honourable senators, I agree with the
honourable member from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) that prohibition drove liquor
drinking into the homes.
I firmly believe that it is the duty of the
churches to preach against divorce and the
improper use of liquor. I am reminded of
a story about the late Calvin Coolidge. One
morning, after he had been to church, somebody asked him what the minister preached
about. Mr. Coolidge replied, "Sin. He said
he was against it". We, too, and the churches
should be against sin. Figures have been
quoted of the number of divorces granted
in 1900. Recalling those times, I thought
of some of the changes which have taken

SENATE

place. For instance, the honourable senator who quoted scripture reminded me of
two of the commandments:
Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work.

Yet recently, in a supposedly God-fearing
country, a national hockey championship
match was played on Sunday with players
from a godless state in which religion is
declared to be the opiate of the people. No voice
was raised in Canada to protest against that
game having been played on the sabbath.
Had such a thing happened in 1900, there
would have been in this country something
like a revolution. But in 1955 not a minister
commented on the fact: all the radios were
going, and everyone, instead of going to
church, was listening to reports of the hockey
game.
When my good-looking colleague from
Prince was a boy, no doubt he did what he
was told. When he grew up he came to the
Senate and still, in my opinion, does exactly
as he is told. Perhaps, away back in 1900,
his parents had something to do with his
courtship; probably he was told how the
match should be conducted, when he was to
go out walking-for in those days there were
no cars-and I am sure he was a very good
fellow and always kept his place according to
the standards of the time. But today we are
facing changed conditions in a different world.
A divorce bill much like the present one was
introduced here seventeen years ago, and in
this respect, in spite of world changes, we
have not advanced at all. I would like honourable senators to reflect that we, men and
women of mature years, are here for a purpose. All of us know how much sufferingmuch of it needless-is going on in human
society. If two animals were tied together
and likely to fight and injure each other, we
would interfere. Why should we be less concerned about human beings? Every day one
reads in the papers of murders and suicides
resulting from men and women being tied
together in marriage until conditions have
become intolerable.
With the permission of honourable senators,
I shall briefly continue my remarks tomorrow.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Horner, the debate
was adjourned.

GRAIN SHIPMENTS AND FREIGHT RATES
INQUIRY AND ANSWER
Hon. Mr. Isnor inquired of the Government,
pursuant to notice of February 15:
1. What is the average cost per bushel of shipping
(b) head of Great
grain from (a) Winnipeg;

SENATE
2. What amount of grain was shipped in the

current year of 1954 through each of the routes
(a),

(b),

(c)

and (d)?

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The answer to the
honourable gentleman's inquiry is as follows:
1. This question cannot be answered for
the following reasons:
(a) Grain moving for export via Vancouver
or Churchlil is not grain that is routed
through either Winnipeg or the Lakehead.
(b) Grain for movement ex Eastern ports
is bought and sold based on a Lakehead price.

The local freight rate tram Winnipeg to the
Lakehead is not an element of cost.
(c) A bushel of wheat is 60 lbs. A bushel of
oats is 34 lbs. There is, therefore, obviously
no means of calculating an average cost of
moving a bushel of "grain". Each grain is
different.
2. The following table indicates overseas
exports of Canadian grain by ports of loading
in the current crop year up to February 23,
1955:

ST. PATRICK'S DAY
TRIBUTES TO IRELAND'S PATRON SAINT
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Felix P. Quinn: Honourable senators,
I need not remind you what day this is. It
is the day on which Irish men and Irish
people generally throughout the whole world
do honour to their glorious and illustrious
apostle and patron, Saint Patrick. The Irish
people have a special love and reverence for
their patron saint. Their devotion to him is
different from that of people of other countries to their respective patron saints, because
-for instance-while St. George, England's
patron saint, never saw England, and St.
Andrew never trod the soil of Scotland, St.
Patrick spent the greater part of his adult
life in Ireland, performed there his wonderful
missionary work, and died there and was
buried in its sacred soil. We honour his
memory on the 17th of March. But I have
learned that shortly after his death certain

elements contended that he died on the 8th,
others that his death occurred on the 9th.
The parties could not agree, so, in the latter
part of the fifth century, they called in an
Irish priest named Mulcahy, who was noted
for his wit as well as his wisdom, and asked
him to settle the argument. He listened to the
statements of the respective parties, and
finally said, "You are both right-those who
say the 8th, those who say the 9th; we will
add the figures together and make it 17." So
the date was established as the 17th of March,
and it has so remained from the fifth century
to the present time.
There is also considerable doubt as to the
date of his birth, and while everyone does
not agree as to the place, most writers believe
it was in Dumbarton, Scotland.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I thought Scotland had
something to do with it.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: That is how Scotland
derived much of its virtue.

MARCH 17, 1955
His father, whose name was Calphurnius,
was a middle-class land owner and a minor
Roman official. As honourable senators know,
in those days Britain was under the rule of
the Roman Government. Patrick was raised
as a Christian, and at the age of sixteen he
was seized by a band of Irish raiders and
carried in captivity across the channel to
Ireland, where he was sold as a slave to a
Druid chieftain in the northern part of the
country. There he spent six unhappy years
engaged in the menial occupation of tending
sheep. He prayed continually that he might
be delivered from his captivity so that he
might spend his life doing something more
useful. Finally, he escaped and made his way
to Wicklow, in southern Ireland, where a
ship was being loaded with wolf hounds.
Patrick was able to gain employment as the
caretaker of the hounds and in this way he
secured his passage to France. There he
placed himself under the protection of St.
Martin of Tours, who is said to be Patrick's
uncle. St. Martin sent Patrick to the monastery at Lerins where he was educated and
ordained to the priesthood. He later returned
to Britain, where his thoughts often turned
towards Ireland, and from time to time he
was favoured with visions of unborn children
from Focluth, by the Western sea, who cried
out to him: "O holy youth, come back to
Erin, and walk once more amongst us".
Patrick prepared for his journey, gathering
together a small band of missionaries to
accompany him to Ireland.
The story is told that St. Patrick reached
Ireland on the eve of the annual festival of
the Druids. In those days the people of Ireland were all pagan and in the spring of each
year they held a celebration. The kings and
chieftains and Druid priests were gathered
together on the hills of Tara to venerate their
heathen gods, and it is said that Patrick
arrived on the opposite hill with his little
band of missionaries where, tired from their
journey, they fell asleep. When Patrick
awakened in the cold of next morning he
lighted a fire. This was against the edict of
the arch-Druid, who had ordered that no
fire was to be lit on that day until he himself
had set the torch to one. Patrick knew
nothing of this, of course.
Patrick's fire was beheld with consternation, and the alarm was made. The chieftains
were notified and they sent out a detachment,
and Patrick was summoned before the court
and asked to explain why he dared break the
law. He told them that he was ignorant of
any laws which compelled him to pay tribute
to any gods-that he knew only one God,
the Creator and Sovereign Lord of heaven
and earth, the God who reigned in the

heavens. He told them that his God consisted of a Trinity-Father, Son and Holy
Spirit. His accusers were amazed, and
Patrick could not make them understand.
They asked him to explain how it was possible that there could be three in one. Gazing
down at his feet, Patrick beheld a little
shamrock, stooped to pick it up, and, holding
it up for them to see, he said: "Oh, nature
can explain what I have failed to make clear.
There, you see how simple it is to have three
in one-all on the same stalk". Patrick must
have been given his freedom, because he was
granted permission to speak-and we know
with what wonderful success. Within a short
period of time he converted the whole nation
to Christianity, built churches, erected schools
and monasteries, and raised the standard of
learning. He was so successful, that he was
able to send his followers and missionaries
throughout the whole of the then known
world, and Ireland became known as the land
of saints and scholars.
That is the story oft told about Saint
Patrick. Is it any wonder that the Irish
people revere and respect his memory and
honour his name on Saint Patrick's Day? Is
it any wonder that we sing his praises?
All praise to Saint Patrick
Who brought to our mountains
The gif t of God's faith.

Or is it any wonder that we sing of the
dear little shamrock:
There's a dear littIe plant
That grows in our Isle,
'Twas Saint Patrick himself sure that set it;
And the sun on his labour
With pleasure did smile
And the dew from his eye often wet it.
This dear little plant
Still grows in our Isle,
Fresh and fair as the daughters of Erin;
Whose smiles can bewitch
And whose eyes can command
In each climate they ever appear in.
For they shine through the bog
Thro' the brake and the mireland,
Just like their own littie shamrock of Ireland:
The dear little shamrock,
The sweet little shamrock,
The dear little, sweet little shamrock of Ireland.

That beautiful poem is set to music, and I
wish I could sing it for you, honourable senators. If I may be favoured with your indulgence I will sing a few bars from a song
which will be quite familiar to you, for it has
become a modern song now. It is entitled
"Galway Bay":
If you ever go across the sea to Ireland,
Then maybe at the closing of your day
You will sit and watch the moon rise over
Claddagh,
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay.
Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream,
The women in the meadows making hay,
And to sit beside a turf fire In the cabin,
And watch the barefoot gossoons at their play.

CAUSES

MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Aseltine for the second reading of Bill 0-6,
an Act respecting divorce and matrimonial
causes.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, it
is very kind of the house to allow me today
to complete the remarks I started yesterday.
I believe I had reached the point where I had
demonstrated beyond any doubt that vast
changes have taken place in the world from
the turn of the century to the present time.
I would mention some further instances of
change. Back in the year 1900 scarcely any
married women worked outside the home;
there was not a motor car on the road; the
man who had a horse and buggy was indeed
fortunate. Today we ride either in a motor
car or an airplane, and vast numbers of
married women work outside the home.
These changes are bound to affect our way of
life and, as was very ably pointed by the
honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris), are quite likely to bring
about more divorces. For instance, in the
year 1900 only one divorce was granted in
Nova Scotia, although cruelty, as well as
adultery, was a ground for divorce in that
province. The increase that bas taken place
in the number of divorces is due to the vastly
changed living conditions.
As has been pointed out, the question in
this debate is not whether we shall have
divorce in Canada. Divorce already exists

in Canada. The purpose of this bill is to
widen the grounds for divorce. It might
possibly be argued that if the bill were passed
there would not be any more divorces, but
that there would be a great reduction in the
number granted on the ground of adultery.
I plead with honourable senators, to give
this measure second reading, at least, and
allow it to go to committee. I am sure that
step would not in any way commit anyone to
support the bill on third reading. Some
senators have expressed the wish that it go
to committee in order to clarify a number of
points, such as whether cruelty can be more
clearly defined. Suppose we were not able
to agree on a satisfactory definition of cruelty
this session, that might be put aside; and if
we could widen the grounds for divorce to
include desertion, that would be a progressive step.
While reading a certain pamphlet I ran
across a passage that I thought was very
applicable to the matter we are discussing.
I will read a brief extract:

Lord gave us the one great general principle,
"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's,
and unto God the things that are God's." We are
to so fit ourselves that in each generation we may
be able to deal rightly with the changing circumstances of each age.

I thought those words were very appropriate to our discussion.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: May I ask what publication the honourable senator is quoting
from?
Hon. Mr. Horner: It is from a pamphlet
called The Bulletin, a church publication.
The article I quoted from was written by
Rev. T. F. Summerhayes, on "Capital Punishment for Murder". The extract I read expresses my own view better than I can express
it myself.
There is another matter that I think we as
elder statesmen, if you will, ought to give
some serious consideration to. An act extending the grounds for divorce was passed
by the British Parliament in 1937; and in
1938 a bill similar to the one before us was
passed by the Senate, with a fair majority,
but defeated in the other house. In the intervening seventeen years the world has continued to change. Now, I say this with all due
respect, that there is a great deal of talk in
the country about this chamber being very
one-sided at the present time. Since 1938 it

SENATE
has become increasingly one-sided, and it is
now composed almost entirely of members of
one party. I would also point out that the
same party has a huge majority in the House
of Commons.
The honourable senator from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) says he has received
enough letters favouring additional divorce
grounds to make a complete book. The people
are looking to this house for leadership in this
matter. I am somewhat concerned about this
and I think every honourable senator should
be. It seems to me that every opponent of
the bill should give some thought to that
phase of the question before voting against the
bill and thus preventing it from going to
committee for further study.
A resolution favouring the widening of the
grounds of divorce was passed by the Canadian Bar Association at its convention last
summer, but honourable senators who are
members of the legal profession very modestly say that it was not the business of the
Canadian Bar Association to pass such a
resolution. Yet who else in this country is
better qualified to express themselves on a
matter of this nature?
The honourable senator from Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchill), in a very fine speech
on this bill, wanted to know who if anybody
had asked for a widening of the grounds of
divorce. He wanted to know if any churches
or other organizations had asked for such a
measure. Well, honourable senators, I would
like to say to him that he would never ask
such a question if he belonged to any lodge,
Kiwanis Club or Rotary Club or association of
that nature. It is practically impossible to
have a question like that discussed by the
membership of any such body, because discussion of anything offensive to any one of
the members is never permited. And surely
he would not expect any church to advocate
widening the grounds of divorce, because, as
I said yesterday, it is the duty of the churches
to preach against such things as divorce and
excessive liquor consumption-or, if you want
to put it the other way, to preach in favour
of total abstinence.
I therefore submit, honourable senators,
that the Canadian Bar Association is the only
group that could be expected to take a stand
on this question. Lawyers in their everyday
work come to grips with family difficulties in
the initial stages, being consulted by quarrelling couples about property matters and things
like that. Often after consultation with
lawyers, couples make up and go home, and
sometimes they are not charged any fee for
the good advice they got. That is why I submit that the Bar Association is the proper

body to deal with the matter and to recommend it for consideration in this chamber.
Honourable senators, I must not delay the
bouse. I think you all understand how keenly
I feel about this matter. As a matter of fact,
I am sure many of us feel the same way. I
know of several cases in my own experience
where couples have been separated on account
of insanity, and there is absolutely no hope
of these people ever coming together again.
The honourable senator from Victoria (Hon.
Mrs. Hodges) mentioned a case where a
woman's husband was afflicted with insanity
and the doctors held out no possibility of
recovery. Our present divorce law cannot give
the woman any relief in these circumstances.
Many a person finding himself or herself
in a similar situation goes to live with another
mate. I submit, honourable senators, that that
is a greater indignity and a greater moral
blemish on the community than a legal
divorce would be.
I would like now to take the opportunity
of repeating some words uttered by Lord
Birkenhead, which are to be found in the
Senate Debates of 1938, page 104. They were
quoted in a speech delivered by the late
Senator E. S. Little of London, Ontario, speaking on the motion for second reading of the
Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Bill of that
year. Senator Little said:
Only on Sunday last I read In Winston Churchill's
"Great Contemporaries" a quotation trom a speech
made by Lord Birkenhead on the Matrimonial
Causes Bill in 1920-which, by the way, is considered to be the finest speech of his life. May I
read an extract trom that speech, which I quote
from the Life of Frederick Edwin, Earl of Birkenhead, by his son, pages 131 and 132:
"I, my Lords, can only express my amazement
that men of saintly lives, men of affairs, men
whose opinions and experience we respect, should
have concentrated upon adultery as the one circurnstance which ought to afford relief from the
marriage tie. Adultery is a breach of the carnal
obligations of marriage. Insistence upon the duties
of continence and chastity is important; it is vital
to society. But I have always taken the view
that that aspect of marriage was exaggerated and
somewhat crudely exaggerated in the marriage
service. I am concerned today to make this point
by which I will stand or fall, that the moral and
spiritual sides of marriage are incomparably more
important than the physical side . . . If you think
of all that marriage means to most of us-the
memories of the world's adventure faced together
in youth so heedlessly and yet so confidently,
the tender comradeship, the sweet association of
parenthood, how much more these count than that
bond which nature In its ingenious telepathy has
contrived to secure and render agreeable the
perpetuation of the species."
And further, on page 134:
"Those who have spoken In opposition to the
present proposaI say with the best motives but
with malignant results: 'We deny you any hope
in this worid. Though an honest man loves you,
sin shall be the price of your union, and bastardy
shall be the fate of your children'. I cannot and

MARCH 17, 1955
do not believe that society, as it Is at present
constituted, will for long acquiesce in a conclusion
so merciless."

I believe those statements to be true of
conditions today; and I plead with honourable senators to allow this bill to go at least
to committee, where amendments to it may
be made.
Hon. Mr. Grant: Honourable senators. I
would like to ask the honourable senator from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) a question. He
quoted the words: "Render unto Caesar the
things that are Caesar's, and unto God the
things that are God's". This answer was
given by Our Saviour to some people who
asked him whether it was lawful to give
tribute to Caesar. Is it the opinion of the
honourable senator that the sacram.ent ýof
marriage belongs to God or to Caesar?
Hon. Mr. Horner: I may not be able to give
the honourable senator a satisfactory explanation, but certain marriages of the gun-shot
variety, in my opinion, may be said to be
rendered unto Caesar.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. W. D. Euler: After the very notable, comprehensive and-to me-convincing
speeches which have been made in favour
of the bill, I rather hesitate to prolong the
debate. If, in view of what has been said,
I should be somewhat repetitious, I crave in
advance the indulgence of the house. But my
interest in this question of the amendment
of the divorce law is so great, and is of such
long standing, that I should like to make a
few, brief observations, and stress some ot
the important matters which have been stated
in connection with the bill.
To me there is only one real and very
simple issue: shall I, as a member of the
only body in Canada that has the power to
do it, perform my part in bringing relief to
thousands of my fellow Canadians who are
living in misery, under conditions of cruelty
and suffering for which they are not responsible? Can I, in conformity with justice,
compel them to continue to be bound in a
marriage which is no longer a marriage?
Something has been said about mandates.
I am not particularly concerned about that.
The only mandate I have in this matter is
to try to rectify a glaring injustice. I have
been in Parliament some thirty-five years.
For a long period I served in the House of
Commons, and for fifteen years, ever since
I was called to the Senate, I have been a
member of the Divorce Committee. Long ago
I came to the conclusion that our divorce
laws are antiquated and unworthy of an
enlightened people.

Some speakers in the debate have declared
themselves against divorce. I am not against
divorce; I favour it if it is granted under the
proper conditions.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Under those circumstances
it could be a great boon to many innocent
and worthy people.
The senator from Grandville (Hon. Mr.
Bouffard) termed divorce a great evil; the
senator from Ottawa West (Hon. Mr. Connolly) called it a cancer. As the senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) said the
other day, they are confusing cause and
effect. The phrase is a good one; I had
intended to use it myself. In my opinion
divorce is neither a cancer nor an evil, it
is a corrective. The evil consists in those
immoral actions which make divorce justifiable.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is the answer.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The remedy is not to
abolish or restrict divorce; the remedy is
to use the influence of the church, school and
press to bring about a restoration of oldfashioned standards of morality. But that
is a pretty difficult job in this day and age.
At least two of the opponents of this measure
in the Senate have with prodigious energy
and research produced statistics galore to
prove that divorces are increasing. I am not
questioning that fact, but as far as I am
concerned the statistics were quite unconvincing and the research done was in the
nature of love's labour lost. There is no
doubt that divorces are increasing, and if
this bill passes they will increase still further. That is one intention of the bill.
The thing which concerns me is not that
there may be more divorces, but that divorces
shall be given for proper reasons and that
innocent people shall have justice done. It
has been said that divorce begets divorce,
but I have never been able to believe that.
If we want some proof to the contrary we
need only turn to Nova Scotia, where divorces
have been obtainable on the ground of cruelty.
Despite this fact the divorce rate in that
province has not increased in any greater
degree than it has elsewhere in Canada.
Yesterday afternoon a senator told me that
he was opposed to this bill, saying that divorce
begets divorce. I asked him why, and he
replied, "I have two nieces who married, and
when one of them got a divorce the other
one got one too." I then said to him, "Well,
they couldn't get divorces unless there was
proper justification, which in our country
means adultery on the part of their husbands".
To this he replied, "But the divorces were
granted in the United States."

SENATE
There are three chief reasons why there
bas been an increase in divorce. The first
is the common disregard for law and morals
and general proprieties, and I think this has
come about pretty largely as a resuit of the
two world wars. The present disregard now
for law and order did not exist before those
wars. The second reason, which is not so
strong, is that people are now "divorce conscious". Knowing that divorce can be obtained for the one reason, they come to the
courts or to Parliament for relief. The third
reason, which is based upon the first, is an
increase in infidelity and a disregard for
the marriage vows.
I may make one or two philosophical
remarks, and while they may not bear directly
on this question I shall not be too long.
Marriages are not made complete merely by
the physical or sexual adjustment of the
partners. It takes a great deal more to complete a marriage. There must be genuine
affection, consideration, compromise, kindness,
good temper and an honest effort by both
partners to make the marriage a success.
My friend from "the little island," as it
has been called, (Hon. Mr. Barbour), made
a very fine speech, and I was glad to learn
that he bas had an exceptionally happy marriage. I congratulate him on that, for I
think he is more fortunate than some men.
But the point is that this bill does not strike
at the happy marriages. It is just the contrary. It strikes at the shackles that unite
in the bonds of misery, cruelty, or desertion,
men and women who, under our present law,
with their marriage wrecked and hopeless,
have no prospect of relief except in death; no
opportunity of again having a mate and a
family, which is the natural state of all men
and women. That is my reason for supporting
this bill. The senator from Kingston (Hon. Mr.
Davies) told us the other day that he likes
to see people happy. I think it is our duty
to do all we can to promote the happiness of
people who are not responsible for the state
into which they have had to descend in
unhappy marriage as a result of cruelty,
desertion or something of that kind. Does
any intelligent person believe that any man
permanently separated from his wife would
not seek to satisfy his most urgent instinct,
that which is given to him for the perpetuation of the race? And would it not be better
to give that man the legal freedom which
would enable him to form a happy union?
I was just a bit surprised at the remarks
of my friend from Sherbrooke (Hon. Mr.
Howard), whom I have known for a great

many years. I believe he quoted practically
the whole of the marriage service, concluding
with the admonition:
What therefore God hath joined together. let
not man put asunder.

The senators from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris) and Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck), indicated that these words mean
a marriage should not be put asunder by the
action of the parties thereto. I shall content
myself merely to say that I would hesitate
to hold an "omniscient Almighty" responsible
for some of the marriages we see in the
Senate Committee on Divorce. I say with
all reverence that they are no compliment
to Him.
Civil marriage, which I believe is not at
all religious in its nature, is now permitted
in Ontario. Shall we say then that such a
marriage comes within the scope of this
admonition?
I have no real hope of influencing those
who, on religious grounds, believe they have
a mandate to oppose divorce on any grounds
whatsoever. I have no quarrel with them,
but what I do not understand is why, in
the case of others, where a great injustice
is being done to innocent people which only
Parliament can rectify, we should deny them
another chance to build a new and happy
married life when their present marriage is
wrecked beyond repair.
I congratulate the senator from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) upon introducing this
bill. To my mind he is endeavouring to right
a great wrong; and whether or not the bill
carries on second reading, he has done a
service to his country.
I have thought I could not quite agree with
one section of the bill which I believe provides that if cruelty, desertion, and incurable
insanity become grounds for divorce in
Canada, they shall not apply to divorce
petitions to Parliament from people of Newfoundland and Quebec. I am not sure, but
I think the senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) made some reference to
that.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: He suggested an
amendment to that effect.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Well, if such an amendment were proposed, I would have to oppose
it, for this reason: Today the people of
Quebec can obtain a divorce only by travelling, in some cases a considerable distance,
to Ottawa, and petitioning Parliament to pass
an act, on the grounds of adultery only. If
the grounds of desertion, cruelty and insanity
were added, the people of Ontario, for instance, could secure divorces through their

MARCH 17, 1955
provincial courts on these additional grounds,
but the people of Quebec would be denied
the right even to petition Parliament on the
wider grounds. That would be an additional
discrimination against Quebec, and one to
which I would object.
Honourable senators, I wish to advance a
submission, with some hesitation, in connection with what I have just said, and I
hope my friends from Quebec will understand
that I do so in good faith. I have never been
able to understand why there should not be
in that province courts to deal with applications for divorce. I have no quarrel with the
people of Quebec, whether they are Roman
Catholics or members of any other sectfor I think some other sects also are opposed
to divorce-but I cannot see why other people
in that province who may have just ground
for divorce under the law of Canada should
not be permitted to obtain a divorce as freely
as people in other provinces can.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Do you want a
definite answer now?
Hon. Mr. Euler: I prefer to continue.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: We in the province
of Quebec do not want to break up the family
and the hearth and the home.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I have heard that explanation before; in fact, I heard it the other
day.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: Well, that is the
answer.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Your answer will appear
in Hansard, and perhaps someone else's reply
to it. My point is this: people who are
opposed to divorce on religious grounds would
not use the courts; but why should other
people in Quebec be denied a privilege possessed by their fellow Canadians in eight
provinces?
I have nothing more to say, except to sum
up my reason for supporting the bill. If
courts and conscientious judges can prove
that a marriage has resulted in misery, cruelty
or desertion, then it is the duty of Parliament
to give relief and to provide the parties with
a lawful opportunity to find a new partner,
to remarry and live decently, respectably
and happily. That is denied to them under
our present law.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Cairine R. Wilson: Honourable senators, it is very difficult for me to follow
in debate so many distinguished lawyers
and others who have had long experience as
members of the Senate Divorce Committee,
but I feel that I would be lacking in duty

if I did not voice some support for a
bill of which I thoroughly approve. May I
say that I took part in the debate in this
chamber on the Divorce and Matrimonial
Causes Bill of 1938.
In opening the present debate the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) mentioned that desertion had been a
ground for divorce in Scotland for more than
300 years, but that there had been no greater
number of divorces in Scotland, on that
account, than in any other part of the
United Kingdom. As a Scotswoman-or at
least a descendant of Scots-I should like to
believe there were fewer.
Honourable senators, I think it is unfortunate that this bill has had to wait 17 years
for its reintroduction here. We owe a debt
to the honourable senator from Rosetown for
his courage in sponsoring it. The honourable
senator from Ottawa West (Hon. Mr. Connolly), paid tribute to the hard work and
self-sacrifice of the members of the divorce
committee. But if he felt that their opinions
were of value, I think perhaps he should
have shown some respect for this measure,
which was introduced first by the late Senator
McMeans, of Winnipeg, and lately by the
honourable senator from Rosetown, ably supported by the honourable senator from
Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw). The honourable senator from Ottawa West referred
to certain ancient institutions-to "other
times, other manners". While he was doing
so, I could not help thinking of an article
that I had read many years ago on the status
of women, and from which I would like to
quote briefly:
Woman today demands a goodness of her own
making, based upon a new set of values, for she
realizes that since the early days of patriarchal
society, morality laws have been framed for her
subjection.
Among the Jews woman was placed In the same
category with a man's ox, ass, and other property,
and later with the Christian ecclesiastics she
became a temptress and a curse.
King Ethelred's conception of woman Is a good
index to the English attitude towards the feminine
sex. To him she was a piece of property, to be
bought or sold at the caprice of the owner.
If a man seduced the wife of another, Ethelred
required that the guilty one pay the husband a
fine and provide him with another wife. The exact
wording of the law is interesting and curious:
"If a freeman have been familiar with a freeman's wife, let him pay for it with his wergild
and provide another wife with his own money and
bring her home to the other."

Like the honourable senators from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies), Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck), and Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler),
I want to see people happy. One of my
earliest recollections

SECOND READING

Hon. Gray Turgeon moved the second reading of Bill 4, an Act to regulate the exportation of power and fluids and the importation
of gas.
He said: Honourable senators, as I was
advised this item would not be proceeded with
until next week, I am in the position of
attempting to make an explanation of the
provisions of the bill without the benefit of
notes, which I left in my office when I came

MARCH 17, 1955
down to the chamber this afternoon. However, after listening to the glorification of St.
Patrick by our honourable friend from Bedford-Halifax (Hon. Mr. Quinn), honourable
senators may find it in their hearts to overlook any mistakes that I may make. In any
event, my lack of notes will serve to shorten
my remarks. Incidentally, it occurs to me
that if anyone ever presented a bill to provide for the divorcing of a member from the
Senate, the most appropriate ground would
be cruelty by means of the imposition of long
speeches.
Hon. Senators: Oh, oh!
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Honourable senators,
although the explanatory notes in the bill are
quite lucid, I should like to make a few
general observations.
The bill is designed to revise and consolidate the Electricity and Fluid Exportation
Act. I may say that the regulation of the
exportation of power and fiuids and the
importation of gas is in no way concerned
with the waters flowing down a river, and
therefore this bill is not related to the subject
matter of Bill No. 3, which is the subject of
some dispute in the House of Commons. The
interpretation section of the bill defines
"export" as meaning:
(i) with reference to power, to send from Canada by a line of wire or other conductor, and
(ii) with reference to fluids, to send from Canada through pipe Unes or other like contrivances;

Among other important changes that will
come about if this bill becomes law, is one
requiring a licence for the importation of
natural and similar gases which, up to the
present moment, has been unnecessary.
Another change which the bill would bring
about is the removal of the authority, now
held by the Canadian Government, to impose
export duties with respect to exports of gas,
oil and other fluids. When this bill becomes
law export duties could be imposed only
upon electric power.
During the debate on this bill in the House
of Commons, the Right Honourable the Minister of Trade and Commerce pointed out that,
in the discussions before the Federal Power
Commission at Washington having to do with
the proposed importation of gas and oil into
the United States, the point has been raised
that Canada could impede such exports by
the imposition of export duties. Well, honourable senators, this bill if it becomes law will
take away that authority from the Government of Canada and it will no longer have
power to impose an export duty on oil
-or gas leaving Canada. I sincerely hope that
this point will be brought to the attention of
,our good friends at Washington, through their
foreign office and their office dealing with

trade and commerce, and particularly to the
attention of those responsible for implementation of the provisions of article II of the
North Atlantic Treaty. It is of extreme importance that the impediments suggested and
actually proposed against importation of oil
and gas and other fluids into the United States
from Canada should not be put into effect.
I think, as was pointed out by the Right
Honourable the Minister of Trade and Commerce in the other house, that the elimination
of this authority to impose certain export
duties will have some material effect upon
Washington.
In dealing with this bill the Minister of
Trade and Commerce made several potent
references. He pointed out that because of the
great improvement in the transmission of
electric power at higher voltages, potential
power formerly inaccessible in far-away areas,
such as the Yukon Territory, could soon
become accessible. As a matter of fact I take
a great deal of pride, as do other senators
from British Columbia, in the recent statement made by the Minister that there is now
under construction in British Columbia a
line that will soon be transmitting at nearly
350,000 volts. He stated that this will be the
highest transmission voltage on the North
American continent.
There are two matters I would like to bring
to the attention of the house in connection
with proposed exportation of our natural gas
into the United States that could be brought
about by action of the Federal Power Commission at Washington. The first is, that there
is now under immediate consideration at
Washington the importation of gas from Western Canada through Winnipeg, by the Northern Natural Gas Company, to supply certain
parts of the United States, decision on which
matter is being delayed because of a doubt in
the minds of the members of the Federal
Power Commission as to the certainty of having that gas ready for export through Winnipeg. Secondly, there is the question of the
export of natural gas from the Peace River
District of both British Columbia and Alberta
into the United States. I sincerely hope that
when this question comes up again the passing of this legislation taking away from the
Government the ability to impede export of
gas from Canada through the imposition of
an export duty will have an effect, and make
it more certain that the Westcoast Transmission Company will secure the right to have
its product sold to American companies and
sent across the boundary.
Honourable senators, there is nothing further that I need say, except that if this bill
is given second reading I will move that it
be referred to a committee.

SENATE

Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If the bill is to be referred
to committee, I have nothing to say on it at
this time. I want it to go to committee, because I would like to hear the experts give
their ideas about it and explain its details.
As I understand it, the bill received practically unanimous consent in the other place,
and my advice from friends there is that it
is entirely satisfactory. However, I still would
like to have the experts come and tell us
exactly what it does, because these are very
touchy questions just at the present time.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Turgeon moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Honourable senators,
could this bill not be referred to the Committee on Transport and Communications?
Some honourable senators seem to think that
the Senate has only one committee, Banking
and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: It might be referred to
the Natural Resources Committee.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: There is no transport
problem involved in this bill-it deals with
the right to export.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: It deals with the
right to transport gas and fluid.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: No, it deals with permission to export.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: May I ask the Leader
of the Government if he has any suggestion
on the matter?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Far be it from me to
amend the motion of the honourable senator
who explained the bill (Hon. Mr. Turgeon).
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
PRIVATE BILLS
WESTSPUR PIPE LINE COMPANYSECOND READING

Hon. James A. MacKinnon moved the
second reading of Bill N-9, an Act to incorporate Westspur Pipe Line Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the development of oil production in the four Western
provinces has resulted in the discovery of
oil fields which straddle provincial boundaries. In addition, production of oil bas been
and will be obtained from two or more fields
on both sides of and in close proximity
to provincial boundaries, and their location

will require the construction of pipe line
gathering systems crossing provincial boundaries. Furthermore, branch lines leading
from the pipe line gathering systems in the
fields may cross provincial boundaries en
route to main trunk pipe lines, such as Interprovincial Pipe Line and Trans Mountain Oil
Pipe Line. The main trunk pipe line companies operating in Canada presently do
not and perhaps would not find it desirable
in the future to construct and operate such
pipe line gathering systems and branch lines.
Their construction and operation is usually
carried out by smaller companies formed by
the producing interests in the oil fields
served thereby.
It is anticipated that a number of such
pipe line gathering systems or branch lines
crossing provincial boundaries in the four
Western provinces will be required in the
near future. One immediate possibility is the
construction of a pipe line from Alida, Saskatchewan, to the Interprovincial Pipe Line
system at Cromer, Manitoba. A secondary
possibility in the future is the construction
of a pipe line across the British ColumbiaAlberta provincial boundary to accommodate
deliveries from the Peace River area.
Section 10A of the Pipe Lines Act, which
was enacted by Parliament on December 16,
1953, prohibits any person, other than a person having authority under a special act,
from constructing or operating an extraprovincial pipe line, which is defined in
section 2, subsection (cc), as meaning a pipe
line for the transportation of oil or gas connecting a province with any other or others
of the provinces or extending beyond the
limits of a province. By reason of the above
section the proposed special act company is
therefore required for the purpose of constructing and operating small pipe line
gathering systems or branch lines which
cross provincial boundaries.
The draft bill substantially follows the
pattern of the act incorporating Interprovincial Pipe Line Company, 13 George VI, chapter 34, which received royal assent on
April 30, 1949, and all other subsequent acts
incorporating pipe line companies.
If this bill should have second reading,
I shall propose that it be referred to the
Committee on Transport and Communications.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: Well, actually most
of the Northwest Territorjes and the Yukon
are available under certain conditions for
mining or otherwise. At the present time
the main reason why there are so many applications to purchase land is that people are
searching for oul.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Does the sale of lands

Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: It may, and the
Governor in Council may set the amount of
royalties that will be charged.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Is it the intention of the
honourable senator to move that this bill
be sent to committee?
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Not unless some
honourable senator thinks that is necessary.
It seems to me that it is quite easy to understand the purpose of this bill: it is simply
to speed up the sale of lands. The bull
would make no change in the regulations
governing the sale of lands, except to provide that sales can be made prior to surveys
of the lands. But stakes would have to be
driven in and lines drawn, so as to have
the lands chearly defined. In most cases
the price is set at sa much per acre. Under
certain conditions the price charged for some
lands couhd be so much per square foot, or
on a frontage basis; but generally speaking,
the price is set at so much per acre.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Perhaps some explanation
zould be made in committee of why it should
take two or three years to survey a piece of
land.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: I think I can explain
that. The way it was explained to me is
that there is a shortage of surveyors and
it 15 not customary to send a surveyor to
survey just one piece of land. The surveyor generally waits until he has several
pieces of land to survey in a certain district.
As f ar as the government is concerned, the
purchaser must pay for the survey, and honourable senators will realize that to send a
surveyor to survey land in this territory is
quite an expensive proposition.

MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Thursday, March
17, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Aseltine for the second reading of
Bill 0-6, an Act respecting divorce and matrimonial causes.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, it
is with great hesitation that I rise ta speak
on this bih. I had not intended ta speak when
I heard the explanations made by the honourable senator from, Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) on the motion for second reading, but
after listening ta the speeches that have been
made, and after hearing some innuendoes
going around the corridors that those of us
who are against the bll are against it because
of some command from. somewbere or perhaps
because of favouring some church, I decided
to came boldly before the Senate tonight and
give my own views. I am bowing to no one
wben I say rigbt now that I intend ta vote
against the bill.
I have beard charges of inconsistency. Wel
perhaps I arn one of the old fashioned kind,
as I arn trying ta be consistent. Wben the
Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Bihl came
before the House of Commons in 1938 I was
one of the sixteen who are now in this cham.ber wbo voted against the bill in that bouse.
I was rather surprised that in ahi the
speeches that have been made on the bihl
before us no mention whatsoever bas been
made of a bul introduced by the honourable
senator from Vancouver-South (Han. Mr.
Farris) in 1943. Also I was not a litthe surprised wben the bonourable senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), in speaking on
the bill now under consideratian, said he

SENATE
was going to vote for it, since the Senate
Debates of 1943-44 show that on April 13,
1943, he voted against that bill introduced by
the honourable senator from VancouverSouth, by which it was proposed or intended
to open the grounds for divorce a little bit.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Would my honourable
friend state the title of the bill that the honourable senator from Vancouver-South introduced in 1943? It had no relation whatever
to what is being considered now.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It was a bill to widen the
grounds for divorce.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: No, it was a different
bill altogether.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It was a bill to widen the
grounds of divorce a little bit, and the record
shows that you voted against that bill.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: It is not fair at all to
make a comparison between the two bills.
Hon. Mr. Reid: You may say it is not fair,
but I am drawing the comparison and I am
entitled to my opinion.
Hon. Mr. Lambert:
such a comparison.

There is no basis for

Hon. Mr. Reid: I have read the record. So
far as I am concerned I am being consistent,
because in 1938 I voted against the Divorce
and Matrimonial Causes Bill in the House
of Commons, and I intend to vote against it
here when it comes to a vote.
May I say, honourable senators, that I do
not stand on the same platform as those connected with the Roman Catholic Church,
because I am in favour of divorce for the one
act laid down in Holy Writ: that is, for adultery. I realize that there are clerics and
others who may take the opposite view from
mine, but since the days of my youth I have
read carefully the words of Christ.
Divorce is not a new matter. If you look
up Deuteronomy and read the laws laid down
by Moses concerning adultery and man's
attitude toward wornan, shall I say, you will
find that the problem then was just the same
as it is today. As a matter of fact, I am one
of those who hold strongly to the belief that
although we have airplanes, television and all
sorts of wonderful things in the world today,
man and mankind are just the same as in
the days of Moses-exactly the same, with all
the loves, all the hates, the good points and
the bad points. Generally speaking, people
have not changed one iota.
And that is where I think many of the
speeches have gone wrong. Some splendid

speeches have been made here, but I was a
little surprised by the position of the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck). I really thought he was going to
vote against the bill, because he had such a
nice story to tell about love and the homethe home being the foundation of the country
-yet when he came to the end of his speech
he said he was going to vote for the bill.
I have been looking up Hansard and burning the midnight oil, and I find it was nothing
unusual for senators in 1938 and 1943 to get
up and talk about holy matrimony and the
home being the foundation of the country,
and yet vote contrary to what they had said.
One very nice speech, which was made on
March 15, 1938, is worth repeating here. I
wonder if you can guess who made these
remarks:
The home is the whole basis of civilization.
without it we cannot survive. One country has
made a trial-

That was Russia.
-and
has been compelled to retrace its steps.
Therefore ail who feel that they are at a very
sacred point when dealing with legislation which
invades the home are going to be very careful
of the exact steps they take.
In a word, you
cannot get a law which is fair to the individual
and is not going to result in the disintegration of
the home. If we make our laws broad enough to
cover al cases-to provide fair and just treatment
for the poor woman who is deserted, for the
poor woman whose husband is a drunkard, for the
poor man whose wife has run away, for the poor
man whose wife has become insane-we get to a
point where the fortifications of the home are
gone.

I agree. But who, do you think, made
that speech? No less a person than the Right
Honourable Arthur Meighen. The strange
thing about it was that when the bill came
to a vote, he voted for it. That is something
difficult to understand.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable
senator a question? I understood him to say
that bills to amend the divorce law were
before the Senate in 1938 and in 1943.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Was the bill of 1943 concerned with divorce, or merely a change of
domicile?
Hon. Mr. Reid: So far as my reading of it
goes, it was a divorce bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think not. According to
my remembrance, it dealt with change of
domicile.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Just a matter of procedure.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The bill was called the
"Presumption of Death and Dissolution of
Marriage Bill".

MARCH 22. 1955
Han. Mr. Lambert: It did flot seek to
broaden the grounds for divorce.
Han. Mr. Reid: I differ from the honourable
senator. I think it did. If marriage may be
dîssolved because of the disappearance of one
of the spouses, and that is flot a divorce proceeding, I would like to know what it is. To
contend it is flot is just quibbling. Speaking
also as a layman. I assert that to permit dissolution of marriage on this ground is to
widen the scope of this country's divorce laws.
I have flot had trne to read the entire report
of the debate li 1943, but I notice that the
bill was presented by the honourable senator
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris).
A good many Bible quotations were presented in 1938. The honourable senator from
Vancouver South presented a number of
others in his speech of 1943, and we have
heard one or two more in the course of the
present debate. I took it upon myself to
interrupt the honourable senator from Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard) when he quoted
the passage:
What therefore God bath jolned together, let flot
man put asunder.
I asked on that occasion, and I ask again,
why he did flot quote fromn the Gospel of
St. Matthew, chapter 5, verse 32. Christ said:
But I say unto you, That whosoever shail put
away bis wife, saving for the cause of fornication.
causeth ber to commit adultery.
]Joes that strengthen the case for what we
are asked to do under this bill? From the
days of my youth that passage has been
interpreted as supporting the haw as it stands
in Canada and the Presbyterian Church has
stood firm on that ground and the maintenance of one of the laws of Moses. In the
days of the Mosaic haw, and ail through subsequent ages, people have realized that man
is pohygamous by nature. Perhaps some honourable senators will flot admit that, but it
is a fact, and because our ancestors recognized it they provided safeguards for the
home. In the days of ancient Israel rapists
were not taken to court, they were stoned to
death: there was quick action in those days.
Separations of various kinds were ahlowed,
but the outstanding separation was a bull of
divorcement for adultery.
Hon. Mr. Harner: When a woman was taken
in adultery, she escaped because Our Lord
said "He that is without sin among you, let
him first cast a stone at her."
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is another incident,
which has no bearîng on the point. The
evidence on that occasion was different from
the proceedings nowadays, because there the
woman was caught ini the act. In those days
they were up to date,--very much so. They

knew better how to handie erring members
of the human race than we do. I was rather
astonished at some of the remarks of the
honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner), because they contrasted with
the excellence of his closing remarks about
conditions of life today and evidences of
decay in the home.
Hon. Mr. Harner: I merehy mentioned that,
as the Bible was quoted to the effect that
man should not put asunder whom God
had joined together, it shouhd be remembered
that we are also enjoined to keep the Sabbath
day hohy.

Hon. Mr. Reid: I thank you, Mr. Speaker,
although I do not mind interruptions. However, the Senate's ruhes must be maintained.
The honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) made reference to
the fact that cruelty is a ground for divorce
in the province of Nova Scotia. Two other
honourable senators referred to Scotland. I
think they overlooked the relevant facts in
this connection from both Nova Scotia and
Scotland. There are in Scotland moral laws
which, though not; on the statute books, are
f ar stronger than axiy written law. At one
tîme, if a maxi ixitended to marry, ahi he had
to do was to say, before two witnesses, to
the woman of his choice, "Wiil you take me
for your lawful husband?" and if she said
"Yes" they were married. Somebody may
ask,' could they get divorced with equal
.ase? They certainhy could not, because the
uxiwritten moral haws of my native land
would not allow it. I do not know as much
about Nova Scotia as do the honourable
senators from that province, but I would
hazard a guess that there are unwritten moral
haws there which are as effective in preventing peophe from doixig certain things as are
the unwritten laws of Scotland. It is the
effectiveness of these rules of conduct, not;
embodied in any statute, governing marriage
and the relations of men and women, which
should be seriouslY taken into consideration
when the broadening of divorce jurisdiction
is recommended. I recail a time, in the days
of my youth, when if a Scotswoman entered
a public house she would almost have to leave
the city because her reputation was destroyed;
she was looked upon more or hess as a harlot.
Another rule in effect when I was youxig
was that if, when a man was courting a girl,

SENATE
it was found that tuberculosis existed in the

no one, in my young days, would have dared
to parade the streets, as some street-walkers
we know of are doing in this country.
I join with those who have pointed out
there are many things done nowadays that
were not done years ago. However, some
people call this a new age, an advanced age,
and are inclined to say that people like myself are old-fashioned. Nevertheless, I abide
by my early faith, realizing that the human
race is just the same as it always has
been and that men and women still have
the same basic weaknesses. They say we
are living in a new age. Well, I would not
be at all surprised to hear of even more
alarming developments in our divorce laws,
for I have just been reading that women
are now claiming a certain right. I was rather
surprised to read that women have given
birth to test-tube babies.
An Hon. Senator: To what?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Test-tube babies. In other
words, it has been reported that women
have given birth by means of artificial insemination, and married women giving birth to
these babies claim they are not committing
adultery. That is just an illustration of what
a fast age we are living in. The latest statistics show that Canadian citizens spent
some $870 million on alcoholic beverages
last year yet in face of this sort of thing
we are being asked to widen the grounds
for divorce and, in effect, make it easier
to untie the bonds of matrimony.
Honourable senators, I do not feel I can go
that far. Is the law the only place where we
should look for guidance or help? I am not
ashamed to say that I intend to continue taking my guidance from the Good Book. I think
people of this generation would be better off
and would have happier homes if they were
to pay more attention to the Good Book and
spend much less time indulging in the merry
life that some of them are leading. Some
honourable senators have said it is the duty
of the Church and our educational systems
to foster happy homes, but parents are leaving too much to these institutions and are
not doing enough themselves to control their
children. There is a definite lack of discipline in the modern home, and the members
of the Joint Committee on Capital and Corporal Punishment and Lotteries have been
told that many parents no longer believe in
giving youngsters the strap. Nevertheless, I
think the old adage, "Spare the rod and spoil
the child" applies equally to the children of
today.

Honourable senators, the people of Canada
should give serious thought to where they
are going, especially when they spend what

distress.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: What has that got to
do with this bill?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am glad my honourable
friend has asked that question. He has served
on the Senate Divorce Committee for a long
time and I should like to ask him if it is
not true that quite a proportion of those who
come before the Senate Divorce Committee
are alcoholics?
Hon Mr. Haig: No.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am glad to hear they are
not. If they are not helping to consume some
of that $870 million worth of liquor, who is?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Where does it come
from?
Hon. Mr. Reid: The $870 million?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: No, the Scotch.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I have
little further to say, but if a vote takes place
on the second reading of this bill it is going
to be interesting to see how certain honourable senators vote. I refer to those who, as
members of the other house, voted as I did
on the divorce measure sent by the Senate
to the House of Commons in 1938. Were they
right in 1938 when they helped to throw that
bill out, or will they be right if they vote in
favour of the present bill? On that occasion
I took a certain stand and when I went back
to my constituency for re-election I had no
trouble; the proposed changes in the divorce
law could not have been an urgent demand in
my constituency, and I do not think they were
anywhere throughout the length and breadth
of the country. I doubt if there is any great
agitation for the present bill. There is no
doubt that all kinds of pitiful cases can be
cited. We all know of them, and some of the
most pitiful cases I know of involve approximately 1,000 soldiers who brought back wives
from Korea and the Orient. There is little
doubt that many of those marriages will have
to be dealt with in days to come. These soldiers and their wives may be in love to begin
with, but when the children born from these
mixed marriages are growing up and find
themselves isolated, perhaps the husbands
will not feel so keen on living with their
Korean or Japanese wives as they did when
they were in Korea or Japan.

It must be remembered that he was speaking some years after the Matrimonial Causes
Bill of 1937 had been in effect.
He went on to say:
Today, the country as a whole Is shocked at the
very large number of divorces, and the large
number of broken homes. Not even the most
pessimistic opponent of the Herbert Act would
have ventured to suggest that there might be
something like 50,000 divorces in a year.
The
anxiety in the country today is not how to increase
the grounds for divorce, but how to decrease
divorce.
We have been told again and again
lately that a large number of our social problems
today arise from the broken homes: report after
report on delinquency goes back to the broken
home. I agree with much that the noble Lord
said. I agree that divorces are not in themselves
the cause of the broken home, but that the
divorce is the result of the broken home. But
when there are easy facilities for divorce, then
the whole idea of marriage becomes weakened
and undermined, and marriage is no longer
regarded as a sacrament, as a lifelong union, but
as a contract which may more or less be easily
broken. When once we have that atmosphere in
the country, then divorces are bound to increaseand that is what is happening at the present time.

I agree with the distinguished senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) that we
are not discussing whether or not we should
have divorce in Canada, because divorce on
the ground of adultery is now the law of
Canada. However, with the beliefs and the
convictions that I have on this matter, I hesitate to support a bill to enlarge the grounds
beyond those in effect unless I am convinced
that such a bill would improve the present
unsatisfactory situation in Canada regarding
divorce, and I am still not convinced, despite
the very persuasive arguments by the proponents of the bill.
The honourable senator from Vancouver
South said, as reported at page 288 of Hansard:
I have never had in my practice, and I cannot
ielieve that any member of the Senate who is a
awyer has ever had a suggestion that the possinility of a future divorce was in the least degree
a factor in causing those people to get married
.n an irresponsible way.

A little farther on he said:
It is a little hard for those of us who were not
in England during the war years to get a full
picture of the conditions there.

His reason for saying that was that there
had been so many divorces in England, and
apparently it had been suggested that easy
divorce was responsible for the growing number of divorces. The honourable senator
continued:
They were very different from conditions in this
country. Over on that little island were a lot of
mighty attractive girls, . . .

He goes on to give a very pretty picture,
although he had first said that it was a little

hard for us to imagine what was happening
over there. Finally, the honourable senator
asked:
What in the world did the possibility of divorce
have to do with those conditions?

Well, although the honourable senator from
Vancouver South is very persuasive, I feel
that a statement by Lord Iddesleigh, who was
in England at that time, is better evidence.
I should like to read from a speech be made
in the same debate in which the Archbishop
of York spoke.
Lord Iddesleigh said:
I believe that the existence of cheap and easy
divorce has done a great deal te undermine the
foundations of marriage in this country. During
the war my Staff duties compelled me to see a
certain amount of the correspondence which was
sent to the War Office in substantiation of divorce
procedure under the services scheme. Much of that
correspondence-which fortunately I did not have
to deal with, but merely to forward-made one
deeply pitiful.
Also, I formed the impression,
from reading a number of letters, that a substantial number of our fellow countrymen were
contracting marriage with no intention of its being
permanent.

I am sure they would not have been able
to enter into a marriage contract without any
intention of its being permanent, had the laws
of England not permitted divorce for desertion and on other grounds which the bill
now before us sets out.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Why not?
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Well, if that had not
been the law, they would not have had easy
divorce.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That is hardly what
you said.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: I am sorry, but that
is what I intended to say. May I make it
clear? Lord Iddesleigh said that after reading
many letters he formed the impression that
a substantial number of his countrymen were
contracting marriages with no intention of
their being permanent. I say they could not
have done so had there not been provision
for easy divorce.
Hon. Mr. Farris: What would those persons
have done?
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Probably they would
not have married at all.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask a question
of the honourable senator?
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Let her make ber speech.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Am I permitted to
speak?
The Hon. the Speaker: With permission of
the honourable senator who has the floor.

MARCH 22, 1955
Hon. Mr. Lamxbert: With the honourable
senator's permission, I should like to ask
this question. If I understood correctly, the
quotation from Lord Iddlesleigli's speech, it
was to the effect that certain marriages were
undertaken witliout an intention of their
lasting. I would ask the lionourable senator
if she is satisfied that Lord Iddesleigh was
justified in saying what lie did.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: I amn a little confused
by the question.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: If I may say so, I think
the staternent made by Lord Iddesleigh at that
time was entirely uni ustified and carnies no
conviction whatever.
Hon. Mns. Fergusson: My lionourable friend
may be quite riglit, but to rny mind the
staternent by Lord Iddesleigh, wlio was in
England at the time and who dealt witli these
cases as part of lis work, carnies more weight
than does the statement by the lionourable
senator from Vancouver South who only
imagined what conditions were like over
there.
Honourable senators, my short experience
on the Divorce Committee of the Senate lias
been a very illuminating one. It lias made me
aware of many sad cases which have corne
here for consideration. I would be less than
human, and certainly undeserving of the
name woman, if I were not touclied by the
pity and pathos of many of these cases. I
know there must be an equally large proportion of sad cases corning before the provincial divorce courts.
However, I do not believe that without
what I would consider adequate study we
should, in an effort to alleviate individual
cases of hardship, enact laws that may create
worse conditions than those they were designed to improve. Anyone wlio lias administered or enforced public laws-and I have
done both-cannot lielp but realize that with
even the best laws and the most careful and
f air administration possible there are always
sorne cases of liardship resulting from themn.
Even under the excellent administration of
the Old Age Security Act, many cases of
hardship may be found. As was s0 often said
in the debates in England that it was regarded
as a cliché, "Hard cases make bad law". Honourable senators, although my pity is aroused
by many cases we hear, I cannot be se blind
as net to realize that there are always two
sides to a case, and that in alî probability the
so-called innocent party should bear sorne,
and at times a very large, share of the blarne
for the break-up of the marriage. I recently
read a most interesting essay under the title
"The Myth of the Innocent Spouse".

Honourable senators, there are two outstanding reasons why I cannot support this
bill at the present trne. First, at page 214 of
Flansard the honourable senator frorn Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) is reported as stating that after the English bill was passed ini
1937 the Law Clerk of the Senate was
instructed to draw a bill for Canada and to
make the grounds the same as those inx England. I would ask the honourable senator if
I arn correct in that summary of lus statement.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The bill was to be
similar to the one passed inx England, but I
would not say exactly the same.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: I understood you to
say the Canadian bill was to be the same as
the English bill, and in my study of them they
appear to be the same.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: They are practically the
same.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: The English bill,
known as the Herbert Bill, which became the
Matrimonial Causes Act, 1937, implemented
recommendations made by a royal commission
that took evidence from 1908 to 1912. Its
report was made in 1912, some forty-three
years ago. The bill was not passed until
1937, or twenty-five years later. True, this
matter was debated in the House of Commons
between 1912 and 1937, but so far as I could
learn-and I have done considerable researchi
on it-no evidence was taken between 1912
and 1937.
In 1950, after the English act liad been in
force for thirteen or fourteen years, Lord
Mancroft moved in the House of Lords for
a commission to inquire into the confused
state of the law regarding marriage, separatien and divorce. Other dernands liad been
made in the House of Commons for changes
in the law, and in July, 1951, as the honourable senator from Grandville (Hon. Mr.
Bouffard) told us, a royal commission, whose
chairman is Lord Morton of Henryton, was
appointed to inquire into the matter. That
commission lias not yet made its report.
Great social and economical changes have
taken place in Great Britain since the Royal
Commission of 1908-1912 made its report in
1912, and great changes have taken place
over there even since 1937, particularly since
the war. I think it is quite understandable
that the recommendations made at that tirne
may not be suitable for the 1950's, and it is
quite reasonable that before the Britishi
Parliament decides upon any changes in the
divorce law an investigation should be made
in the light of present conditions.

SENATE
But, honourable senators, have not similar
social and economie changes taken place in
Canada since 1912 and since 1937? And
should we not take such changes into consideration before we alter our laws regarding
such basic and important matters as marriage
and divorce? I do not believe that we should
adopt without a very thorough investigation a
bill which is actually based on recommendations considered by a Royal Commission as
suitable for Britain 43 years ago. Particularly
I feel we should pause before doing so in
view of the fact that after the act had been
in effect in that country for thirteen years
the Government, on considerable pressure
from members of both houses who complained that the law was confused, has
appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into
it. Honourable senators, do you not think
it is a step in the dark for us to accept as
suitable for Canada an act the suitability of
which for England is now under investigation.
I would like to point out to honourable
senators that before any change was considered in the law of Canada relating to
capital punishment, corporal punishment and
lotteries a joint committee of the Senate and
the House of Commons was set up to study
these matters and to hear evidence. This committee sat for one sessIon and is sitting now
for its second session. I hope it will be the
last one, because I am on it. As I say, the
committee is hearing evidence now for the
second session, in spite of the fact that there
were available recommendations of a British
Royal Commission on capital punishment
which presented its report to the Government
as late as September 1953. There was also a
British Royal Commission on corporal punishment that made recommendations in 1938.
Also, a British Royal Commission on betting,
lotteries and gaming made recommendations
to the Government in March 1951. These
recommendations, which are certainly reasonably up to date, have taken into consideration
social and economic changes over the past
forty years. Yet their conclusions and recommendations were not considered acceptable
for adoption by Canada without further
investigation. Now I admit that the matter
of changes in our laws regarding capital
punishment, corporal punishment and lotteries
are very important, but I do not think they
are nearly so basic as changes in the laws
regarding marriage and divorce.
The honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) stated that we
often adopt English laws. He mentioned, as
reported on page 302 of Hansard, that we
adopted the English Bills of Exchange Act.
I looked up the speeches made when that bill
was before our Parliament, and I would like

to read to honourable senators from the Commons Hansard of January 28, 1890, when Sir
John Thompson moved the second reading
of Bill No. 6 relating to bills of exchange,
cheques and promissory notes. He said:
The House will remember that this bill was
introduced early last session, and that considerable progress was made with it.
Before its
introduction, even then, it had been fully distributed throughout the country, among institutions
immediately connected with commerce; not only
to the banks, but to chambers of commerce and
boards of trade, and to any person who manifested
interest in the subject. That distribution resulted
in a number of suggestions, more or less valuable,
emanating from banking institutions and persons
connected
with trade and
commerce.
Those
amendments
and
suggestions were
eventually
incorporated in the bill brought before the House...

I do not think I need to read all the
particulars. The statement goes on to say
that after these suggestions had been incorporated the bill was again circulated to a
large number of people and when no further
suggestions were made it was decided to
adopt that bill.
Well I submit, honourable senators, that
we have done nothing similar to that in
relation to the divorce bill we are now considering. We have not asked any organizations, welfare groups, or any people who
deal with divorce cases what they think of
our bill, so I submit that the analogy is
not very good. I thought the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity was going to
correct me?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, you are entirely
correct. But may I ask a question? Would
it not be a good idea to let this bill go to
committee, where we could make whatever
inquiry we wished?
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: That is not my idea,
and I think if the honourable senator will
let me continue he will see what I have in
mind as an alternative.
I cannot agree with the honourable senator
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris),
when he says, as reported on page 293 of
Hansard, that we have had ample time to
study this matter because a similar bill was
passed by this house in 1938 and has been a
live topic ever since. Many of us who sit
here today did not know until the present
bill was introduced that such a bill had
been passed in the Senate eighteen years ago.
From the records it would appear, if I did
not make a mistake in counting, that only
sixteen of the present members were members of the Senate at that time. The honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler),
who was a member of the House of Commons
in 1938, is reported on page 213 of Hansard
as stating that he did not remember it coming
before that house.

MARCH 22, 1955
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: There was only one
speech made on that bill in the House of
Commons, and it lasted about ten minutes.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: I do not doubt that
is true, but he did not remember it. It
would scarcely be expected that senators
who had not been members of either house
would recall the matter. Certainly I for one
had not been studying the problem before
this bill was introduced, and I am sure
others are in the same position.
It would seem to be logical that before we
decide on changes in the law of divorce we
should either have a committee or commission take evidence and investigate the
undoubted inadequacy and possible improvement of our divorce laws. If we do not wish
to do this it would seem at least reasonable
that we should take no action until we have
studied the recommendations of the Royal
Commission appointed in England in 1951.
Honourable senators, I would like to make
some reference to what is being done in the
United States.
In 1944 a national conference on family
life was set up. In 1947 it had a noteworthy
meeting at the White House, in which 135
organizations, representing some 40 million
people, participated. They came from every
field of social work,-education, religion,
medicine and psychiatry, child care, labour
organizations, law and legal aid. The American Bar Association accepted responsibility
for the legal section of this meeting, and a
report, known as the Smith Report, was prepared by the Bar Association's committee,
headed by Reginald H. Smith of Boston.
The book from which I am reading is called
Children of Divorce by J. Louise Despert; the
page is 224. It states:
The Smith Report minced no words in characterizing the present state of the divorce laws:
"(1) That our present divorce laws are producing
widespread evils and (2) that our laws in the field
of domestic relations, instead of constituting a
bulwark, are themselves a continuing threat ta the
stability of marriage in contemporary America."
The primary change recommended by the Smith
Report is in the approach to divorce: The premise
should be not punishment but prevention.
To this end the report takes a leaf from the
juvenile courts, which first recognized that with
child offenders against the law punishment presents more problems than it solves. The juvenile
courts function on the principles of prevention and
therapy, and use the resources of the social and
psychiatric sciences ta deal with the conditions
which contribute ta delinquent behaviour. Says
the committee:
"We suggest handling our unhappy and delinquent
spouses much as we handle our delinquent children.
Often their behaviour is not unlike that of a
delinquent child, and for much the same reasons.
We would take them out of the quasi-criminal
divorce court and deal with them and their problems
in a socialized court . . . Instead of determining
whether a spouse has misbehaved and then
50437-22

'punishing' hlm by rewarding the aggrieved spouse
with a divorce decree we would follow the general
pattern of the. juvenile court and endeavor to
diagnose and treat, ta discover the fundamental
cause, then bring ta bear all available resources
ta remove or rectify it."

And at page 227:
In the Smith Report the American Bar Association spoke out for the first time as a body on
the problem of divorce in our courts. Its recommendations were both sound enough and conservative enough ta win public support. A vast mass of
publicity in the press of the nation greeted the
report-all of it favourable, according ta Chairnan
Smith.

One of the committee's recommendations
was that the President appoint a commission.
However, President Truman declined to do so.
Then the American Bar Association Special
Committee, with the co-operation of a group
of national welfare organizations, organized
the Interprofessional Commission on Marriage and Divorce Laws, of which Judge
Alexander is chairman.
Judge Alexander wrote:
The research upon which it is expected ta base a
model act is going forward under the guidance of
Dr. John S. Bradway, of the Law Faculty of Duke
University, which has been made research headquarters for the entire project . . . The various
phases of the research have been or are being
farmed out ta law schools throughout the country.

I like that approach to the problem of our
divorce laws and the present unsatisfactory
situation. Either, I think we should have a
commission or a committee, or await the
report of the English Commission. If a
commission or a committee should be
appointed to investigate the matter at the
present time, it might well take into consideration, among other things, the newer
concept, that divorce be made a matter
of conciliation. This idea, it will be
found, runs through a great many of the
books and essays dealing with this subject.
No doubt such a commission for the investigation of the matter would take into consideration the idea that divorce be made a
conciliation matter, and that the first hearings,
in any case of marital troubles, should involve
consultations between social workers, psychiatrists, lawyers and other professional workers
who would form a tribunal to attempt to rehabilitate the family. Only after adequate time
and adequate efforts had been made, and
failed, would a petition for divorce be permitted.
It seems to me that the procedure might
follow somewhat that which is provided for
under other statutes. One which comes to
my mind is the Farmers Creditors' Arrangement Act, under which the Official Receiver
was only an arbitrator between the parties,
having no power to enforce rulings, but the
parties had to make an attempt at agreement

SENATE
before him prior to having recourse to a court.
Some of my friends who are much better
versed in the law than I am may claim that
this is merely a matter of procedure, but I
submit that it is the sort of procedure which
should be included in any law relating to
conciliation procedure in divorce which we
are asked to pass. I would infinitely prefer
to see Canada strike out on a new method
of approach to this problem, which we all
recognize is a serious one, than follow recommendations made for another country about
forty years ago, and implemented about
eighteen years ago; the more so as they have
not worked out too satisfactorily in the country which adopted them.
The suggestion I have made of a tribunal
is not the only one which could be considered.
Many other ideas might be brought forward
if there were some body to whom they could
be presented. I believe, honourable senators,
that if we have patience and give the matter
sufficient study we can find a better and more
modern way to treat the divorce problem than
through the bill now before us.
I was rather intrigued by a simile used by
the honourable senator from Ottawa West
(Hon. Mr. Connolly). He said that the
conditions which lead to divorce are a cancer
on the body social. I was also interested to
hear the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) say that he considered the simile a very good one. He added,
however, that in certain circumstances he
would welcome the surgeon's knife. Presumably, as this was the simile which had been
presented, he had in mind a case of cancer.
In the case of cancer I too would welcome
the surgeon's knife if I thought that were
the only possible treatment, but if I thought
my cancer would be cured by radium treatment or some other newly-developed treatment I would choose to avoid the surgeon's
knife. Perhaps the cancer on the body social
can be cured by less drastic measures than
the surgeon's knife of divorce.
I do not entirely agree with those who
state that none of the marriages which come
before the Senate committee could have been
salvaged. By the time they reach us it is
true that they seem hopeless, but most people
on seeing their marriage deteriorating would
gladly seek help if it were available. If conciliation were required before a petition could
be presented, I venture to suggest that many
cases would never reach the committee or
the provincial courts. I feel that we need
much more investigation and that we should
find out what is being done in other countries
before we decide to change our divorce laws
in Canada.

My second reason is based on the fact that
for years I have spoken at women's meetings
urging them to take a greater interest in
government at local, provincial and municipal levels. I have pointed out that the governments require such interest so that they
can determine what laws the people want.
I have said that in a democratic country governments try to implement the wishes
expressed by the people. I have quoted
again and again Burke's maxim-"To follow,
not to force, the public inclination is the true
end of legislature"-pointing out that unless
they show their inclination toward any legislation they cannot expect action by government.
Like the honourable senator from Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchill) I have had
no requests from the people of New Brunswick nor from the people of any of the
Atlantic provinces to support this bill, but
I can tell you that I do get many letters
asking me to support or oppose current
legislation. I have seen only one editorial in
our New Brunswick papers on this matter.
It referred to the fact that this bill was
before the Senate, but I could not determine
whether the editorial supported or opposed
the measure. It appeared to be on the fence.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I shall read some for
my honourable friend tomorrow.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: That is fine. I would
be very glad to hear them. Even if the
honourable gentleman from Rosetown has
editorials from New Brunswick, I cannot
see that there has been any great demand
by the people of Canada for this legislation.
The honourable gentleman may have many
letters; I do not doubt it. But I read in the
Debates of the British House of Commons
that when it was proposed to change the
divorce laws there, between the time when
a bill was introduced and came up for
second reading a petition was produced signed
by 100,000 people. I do not know of any
petitions that have been received here, and
if there are any I would be glad to know
about them. So far as I know there has
been no demand in Canada like the demand
for similar legislation in England, such as was
mentioned in the excerpt I read from the
speech of the Lord Archbishop of York, in
which he said the Government could not
refuse to pass the legislation because in a
democratic country the Government had to
do what the people wanted, even though it
might be what he considered un-Christian.
Honourable senators, a Gallup Poll was
taken in January, 1955, on the question: if
only one law could be passed in the coming
session what should that law be? I found

MARCH 22, 1955
from the replies that only one per cent of the
public voted that the law considered should
concern divorce, and one per cent was divided
between those who wanted a change-that is,
between those who wanted the law tightened
and those who wanted it relaxed.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: Was that Gallup Poll
conducted in Canada?
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Yes. It was carried in
the Montreal Star under date of January 5,
1955.
Honourable senators, how could I justify
myself to the women's groups to which I have
spoken if, upon becoming a legislator I supported-and without any indication of interest
or approval from my constituents-a biH that
makes such a drastic change in one of the
laws which many people in this country consider is basic to our society?
There are a number of points I would be
glad to argue. I do not believe divorce is good
for the children of our country. I have been
very much interested in welfare of children
for many years, and I think I have the right
to express an opinion. If it were not so late
I would be glad to argue that I do not think
the marriage contract can be compared to a
business contract. One reason is that in most
business contracts there is a clause whereby
the contract can be terminated on agreement
between the parties upon the giving of a
certain notice. There is nothing to that
effect in the marriage contract.
Honourable senators, I do not intend to
elaborate on other points, but I think you will
realize from the two points I have covered
that my convictions are that we should not
pass this bill at this time. Therefore I am
not going to vote for the bill on second
reading.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Has the honourable senator received many letters asking her to
oppose this bill?
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: I have not received
any letters at all.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Question.
Some Hon. Senaors: Question.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, the debate
was adjourned.
NATIONAL HARBOURS BOARD BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor moved the second
reading of Bill 181, an Act to amend the
National Harbours Board Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the main
purpose of this bill is to change the personnel
50437-22J

of the Board, increasing its membership from
three to four. The other amendments to the
bill are consequential upon the first. The
present subsection dealing with the membership of the Board reads as follows:
There shall be, under the direction of the minister, a board to be known as the "National Harbours

Board" consisting of three members, namely, a
Chairman, a Vice-Chairman and a third member,

who shall be appointed by the Governor in Council
to hold office during good behaviour for ten years.
The general wording of the subsection remains the same, except to provide that the
board shall consist of

".

. . four members,

namely, a Chairman, a Vice-Chairman and
two other members".
The Bill would further amend the act by
providing that three members, instead of two,
shal form a quorum. Subsections (8), (9) and
(10) of section 3 of the present act read as
follows:
(8) In all proceedings of the board the votes
of the majority of the members shan govern.
(9) In any meetings of the board, where only
two of the members are present, all questions upon
which an agreement cannot be reached shall be
referred for decision to a full meeting of the
board.
(10) In case of a vacancy on the board, the
presiding member may, notwithstanding the provision of subsection (9), cast an additional vote.

The proposed
follows:

new subsections

read as

(8) In all proceedings of the board the decision
of a majority of the members present is the
decision of the board, and in the event of a tie
the presiding member bas a casting vote.
(9) A vacancy on the board does not impair
the right of the remaining members to act.

I do not think I need to say anything further about the bill. I would, however, remind
honourable senators that the National Harbours Board Act became effective in 1936,
and that seven of our harbours are under its
administration. I think all honourable senators are familiar with the seven harbours.
May I say, with all due deference to the
honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid), that these harbours go al
the way from Halifax to Vancouver and
include those two very important ports.
The first board was headed by the present
Minister of National Defence, the Honourable
Ralph Campney, who in turn was followed by
Mr. R. K. Smith, and later by the present
Chairman, Mr. B. J. Roberts. The board has
done exceptionally good work-and I say
this notwithstanding that I took an altogether
different view in 1935, when I felt that the
board was not really energetic and did not
add to the economy of Halifax. However, I
have to recognize its excellent work, and
because of the large increase in the administrative duties I think these two minor amendments to the act are necessary.

SENATE

iIon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask one question?
Has experience not proved that ten years is
a long time for members of the board to hold
office?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I would answer my honcurable friend by saying that ten years in the
life of administrators on so important a body
:as the National Harbours Board is a desirable
term, and not too long. Continuity of administration results from long association. We have
found that ten years in office pass very
quickly.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: That is the same term
that the members of the Board of Transport
Commissioners serve, is it not?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Yes.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this
bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Next sitting.
CANADA-IRELAND INCOME
AGREEMENT BILL

TAX

SECOND READING

Hon. Saller A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill 124, an Act to implement an
agreement between Canada and Ireland for
the avoidance of double taxation with respect
to income tax.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to approve an agreement made
between the Government of Canada and the
Government of Ireland, dealing with the
subject-matter of income tax. The object of
the agreement is to avoid the incidence of
double taxation resulting from income tax
provisions in both countries in relation to
business and professional operations by residents of one country in the other country.
Bills of similar character have been considered by this house in the past. At the
present time we have tax conventions resulting from the ratification by Parliament of
similar agreements made with the United
States, United Kingdom and France.
Generally, the principle of the bill, as
contained in the agreement which the bill
proposes to approve, is to tax in each country
only the industrial or commercial profits of
an enterprise of the other country being
carried on in the first mentioned country
through a permanent establishment. It is
not necessary to deal with the provisions of
the bill, but I will explain some of the
articles of the agreement.
Article II defines the various terms which
occur therein, the most important being
"permanent establishment." That term, when
used in relation to a trade or business in the

nature of a commercial or industrial enterprise of one of the countries, means a fixed
branch or place of business in the other country. The incidence of taxation, in connection
with the carrying on of such an enterprise,
would apply to a permanent establishment.
The definition and the various exceptions
are set out in article II.
Article III deals with the incidence of tax
liability of an Irish enterprise or of a Canadian enterprise, when business is being so
carried on in the territory of the other country. Generally, the incidence of tax is exactly in line with the principle of this agreement.
Article IV provides methods for correcting
the possible understatement of profits in one
territory or the other as the result of the
operations of associated or inter-related companies in the two jurisdictions, whereby by
virtue of the control of the companies
in both territories it is possible to shift the
profits by the prices that are charged.
Article V provides that profits from the
operation of ships and aircraft are to be taxed
only in the country of residence.
Under article VI provision is made that the
withholding tax on dividends earned in
Canada by an Irish resident shall not exceed
15 per cent; and, if the company earning
those dividends in Canada is what may
properly be described as a subsidiary of a
corporation in Ireland the return shall be not
more than 5 per cent. In return for that consideration Ireland gives up any right to collect taxes in respect of dividends in the
reverse situation, where the operations are
carried on in Ireland by a resident of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It would seem as
though the good rule does not apply both
ways. Why is that so?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, it does work both
ways. Of course, which side will get the
greater benefit depends on where the balance of payments occur. For instance, if
a resident of Ireland earns dividends in
Canada, we collect a withholding tax of
15 per cent; but if, in the situation, a
subsidiary company operating in Canada pays
dividends to its Irish parent company, the
provision is for a 5 per cent tax. Ireland, on
the other hand, exempts from surtax income
arising in Ireland and payable to a Canadian
resident, other than income of the nature
which arises out of industrial or commercial
profits.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Are there many parent
companies in Ireland operating subsidiaries
in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Frankly, I cannot say.
However, I can say that on the general state

MARCH 22, 1955
of business operations as between Canada
and Ireland, the balance would be in favour
of Canada.
Article VII exempts from taxation,
Copyright royalties and other like payments
made in respect of the production or reproduction
of any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic
work . . .

If these are the property of a resident of
Canada and are being used in Ireland, and
royalties are accruing there, Ireland exempts
such royalties from taxation; in return
Canada makes payments for royalties exempt
from tax in the reverse situation. The only
exception to the exemption in either country,
in circumstances covered by the agreement,
is with respect to motion picture film.
Article VIII has to do with an individual
who renders services. For instance, a resident
of Canada who is in Ireland for the purpose
of discharging temporary duties for the
Canadian Government, pays no tax to Ireland
on his remuneration from the Canadian
Goverment, although he receives it in
Ireland. In the reverse situation, income
received in Canada by a resident of Ireland
representing the Irish Government would not
be subject to Canadian income tax. There
is an exception, as you will see, where the
relationship is that of a business representative working for a Crown company. For
instance, if the relationship were that of a
Crown company carrying on trade or business
for the Government, for a profit, the exemptions allowed in either country would not
apply.
Article X provides for the exemption from
Canadian tax of any pension or annuity
derived from sources in Canada by an
individual who is a resident of Ireland. If a
person who is a resident of Ireland for tax
purposes is in receipt of a pension or annuity
from a source in Canada, that income is
exempt from Canadian tax; in return, where
the reverse situation prevails, a resident of
Canada is exempted from income tax in
Ireland.
Articles XI and XII deal with promotion

receives from his home country for the purpose of maintaining himself are not subject
to income tax in that other country.
Article XIII provides for reciprocity in
tax credits for taxes paid in the other country
on income earned therein. For instance, if
you are a Canadian citizen who earns income
in Ireland, or if, in the reverse, you are a
resident of Ireland who earns income in
Canada, there is a reciprocity with respect
to tax credits. In other words, if you have
income from the other country which is
regarded as part of your income for taxation
purposes, you may offset your taxation in
the country of residence by that part which
you have paid in the foreign jurisdiction.
Article XIV is the type of provision one
inevitably finds these days, particularly in
tax legislation, which covers the exchange
of information between the contracting countries in relation to the subject matter of the
agreement.
Article XV provides for the time and the
manner in which the statute shall come into
force; and article XVI provides for its termination. The agreement shall continue indefinitely unless one party or the other before
June 30 in any year, indicates its wish to
terminate it. In that event a certain formula
is laid down in article XVI, setting out the
basis for and the time at which termination
will be regarded as having become effective.
Honourable senators, those are in outline
the provisions of the agreement. It contains
no provisions which could be described as
unusual, having regard to the tax conventions
which we have made with the countries already mentioned, namely, the United States>
the United Kingdom and France.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Honourable senators, I
should like to ask one question. In the case
of a ship, is the place of residence that of the
port of registry or the head office of the
company?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The agreement provides
only that ships and aircraft are exempt froni

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Davies: In those circumstances I
am hopeful the bill will be referred to conmittee for discussion there, because obviously
it omits to mention many things.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Davies: For instance, many
Americans have summer homes in Canada,
and spend perhaps two, three or four months
in this country, and we never bother them.
Fortunately, or unfortunately, I am one who
bas a small place in the Old Country. There
they interpret our Income Tax Act to suit
themselves, and I am without recourse. I
have discussed this matter with one Deputy
Minister of Finance and officials of the Department of National Revenue. I have also
tried to get some information from the High
Commissioner's office here, without success.
Honourable senators, this agreement contains nothing that in any way helps a man
who might be classed as an ordinary resident in Ireland. In the United Kingdom there
are two classes-resident and ordinary resident. If you maintain a small place in
England, be it only a hovel, and you visit
there regularly, you then become an ordinary resident and liable to pay income
tax. They require you to submit your income
tax papers from Canada and they go into
them in detail. Using your income in Canada
in the previous year as a basis, they translate
that amount into sterling at the British rate
of exchange, and assume that to be your
income. If you have not paid as much in
Canada as you would have paid under the
British rate, then you must pay the difference
to them. It is a very complicated question.
They say to you that you can bring in free
all the money you like so long as it is capital,
but if you bring in any income we must tax
you on it. When I asked them "What is
capital?" they replied that capital is inherited
money. I pointed out that capital is money
which over the years one has saved, after
taxation, and invested, and that it includes
capital gain. They claim that because twentyfive or thirty years ago it was income, therefore it is still income.
I do not know whether this agreement with
Ireland will affect many people, but I feel
that in this bill we should try to protect
Canadians as much as we can and not fail
them as we did in the United Kingdom
agreement. I would like to see this bill go
to committee and be discussed at length there.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If this bill is given
second reading I shall move that it be
referred to a committee. I should point out
that the agreement has been negotiated with
the Governments of Ireland and of Canada,
and Parliament is now asked to give approval.
If there is no approval of the agreement then

of course it is an ineffective document. In
approaching the question of approval or no
approval I suppose one should decide whether
it is better to refuse to approve at this time,
in the hope that we may make a better agreement, or to accept the agreement as it is
with its hardships, difficulties and iniquities.
So far as the United Kingdom agreement is
concerned, with all the problems that have
risen there, the convention has passed into
law and the only way we can deal with it
now, as I see it, is by agitation along the lines
suggested by the honourable senator.
Hon. Mr. Davies: But we cannot amend
this agreement in committee.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Why does the Government submit to Parliament agreements that
have already been entered into? It seems to
me ridiculous.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: The Government bas
negotiated and signed this agreement. If
Parliament approves of it and ratifications are
exchanged, the agreement will become effective; otherwise there is no agreement. But
as I see the function of the Senate in this
matter, and also the function of the House
of Commons, we either accept the agreement
or we do not.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Then Parliament bas
nothing to do with making agreements with
another country.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Except to disapprove or
approve them.
Hon. Mr. Davies: To ratify an agreement
with another Government without discussing
it?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: We can turn it ýdown.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: As I understand the
situation, when agreements are made between
a foreign country and Canada, they are
signed by the officials of both countries and
are then brought before the House of Conmons and the Senate only for the purpose of
being approved or disapproved?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Well, that is a strange
situation. Why do we have a democratic
Parliament if arrangements can be made with
other countries without the approval of
Parliament? We cannot even amend this
agreement?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I am not saying that
no amendment can be made by either country. What I am saying is that Parliament,
in considering this bill and the agreement
attached to it, either passes the bill or does
not pass the bill. We cannot by ourselves
amend the agreement attached to the bill.

MARCH
Hon. Mr. Pratt: May I ask the honourable
senator if this bill and agreement follow a
pattern which has been adopted? We had
agreements with Sweden and Denmark a
couple of years ago. Are this agreement and
bill along the same lines?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Prait: And these agreements are
negotiated between Canada and various
countries on an approved pattern of agreement between our country and another?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: They are individually
negotiated. Canada has agreements with the
United States, the United Kingdom, France
and the Scandinavian countries, in which
there may be some differences in terms and
language owing to various methods of taxation in the different countries, but the basic
pattern on the essential matters is the same.
For instance, in regard to a "permanent establishment" the basis of taxation of a Canadian
operation in another country runs through
all the bills.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Honourable senators, if
in this basic pattern there have developed
things that we have found are wrong, should
we continue to use this basic pattern? If
Parliament turned down the agreement,
would it not be the function of the Government officials to negotiate another agreement
along the lines that Parliament would suggest
or approve?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I would expect so, if
both sides were ready to make such an
agreement.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Mr. Hayden the bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
CANADA-IRELAND SUCCESSION DUTY
AGREEMENT BILL
SECOND READING

previous one, provides only for approval of
the agreement which is attached as a schedule.
Article III, which is an important article
in the agreement, determines the agreed situs
of all kinds of property. Paragraphs (a) to
(o) of article III, set out a series of rules for
an agreed situs for all kinds of property as
between the Government of Ireland and the
Government of Canada, and the agreed situs
would be the rule governing the application
of succession duty taxation in both countries.
Article IV provides that any deductions or
credits that up to the present moment have
been allowed by either country in relation
to the other are continued, notwithstanding
whatever additional taxation may be provided for by this agreement.
Article V provides for credits by the country of domicile in respect of duty paid te the
other country on the same assets. The purpose, of course, is to eliminate the exact imposition of a double succession duty.
Article VI provides for the period within
which a credit or refund may be claimed by
a person in one of these countries, as against
the other country, by virtue of the provisions
of this agreement; and there is a time limit
within which, in the circumstances, such
claim for credit may be made.
In article VII we find the inevitable provision for exchange of information between the
two countries.
Article VIII provides for the method of
ratification of this agreement after the parliaments of this country and of Ireland have
approved it, by the exchange of the signed
documents; also, for the date on which the
act shall come into force, and for the estates
to which the agreement shall apply. Generally speaking, it applies to any estates which
fall in on or after the date on which the
ratifications have been exchanged and the
agreement has the force of law.
The duration of the agreement is for three
years; and there is provision for its termination.
In broad outline that is the scope of the
agreement. The really important article is
number III.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

He said: Honourable senators, this is a
very simple bill. It seeks to avoid the confusion which exists at the present time because
there are two electoral districts in Canada
having the name of Northumberland; one
being in Ontario, and one in New Brunswick.
By this bill it is sought to distinguish the
constituency in New Brunswick by adding
the name "Miramichi". This is the name of
the river which flows through that constituency, and is the background of the economic
life of the whole district, and honourable
senators will quickly recognize that "Miramichi" is one of the earliest of Canada's
historic names.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I could say more on this
subject, honourable senators, but because of
the lateness of the hour I shall not detain
you. I only want to add that the river today
is as noble and grand as it ever was. By many
who know it, it is termed "The Rhine of
America". To my mind it is very fitting that
our constituency in New Brunswick should
bear the name of that great and historic
waterway.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

PRIVATE BILL
ST.

MARY'S

RIVER

BRIDGE

COMPANY-

COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the amendments made by the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications to
Bill N-8, an Act to incorporate St. Mary's
River Bridge Company.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved that the
amendments be concurred in.
He said: This bill, honourable senators will
recall, provides for the building of a tunnel
or a bridge across the rapids at Sault St.
Marie. Two interests, other than those which
were supporting the bill, appeared before the

committee. One was the Canadian Pacific
Railway Company, which has a railway bridge
across the rapids at that point; and the other
was the existing ferry company, which operates a ferry where the bridge or tunnel, it is
expected, will be built. At their suggestion,
and without opposition from the promoters of
the bill, we inserted an amendment to provide
that there should be no expropriation of the
lands and properties of either of these parties,
that is the Canadian Pacific Railway and its
bridge, or the ferry company, without the
approval of the Board of Transport Commissioners.

The second amendment we made to the
bill had relation to the time for payment-off
of the bonds or denbentures which are to be
issued to pay for the project. The bill
provides, in substance, that the work is to
be financed by the issue of bonds or debentures, which are to be paid off in a certain
period, and that at the end of that period
the bridge shall be owned, half by the
Dominion of Canada, on the Canadian side,
and half by the State of Michigan, on the
American side. Similar legislation passed
by the State of Michigan provides for a
period of forty years within which the bonds
are to be paid off, and also that the toll shal
be sufficient to allow of the payment of the
debentures or bonds within that period. So
we have inserted a similar clause in this bill.
The third amendment is not of very great
importance. In the bill as submitted to us

it was provided that the maximum rate ot
interest on the bonds or debentures should be
7 per cent. That, the committee thought,
was rather too much, and it has been reduced
from 7 to 6 per cent.
The motion was agreed to.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this report be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: With leave of the Senate,
I move that the amendments be concurred
in now.
Honourable senators, may I give an
explanation? The amendments have to do
with the cash penalty. The language of the
bill as drawn forced the conclusion that the
amount of the cash penalty was the minimum,
whereas it was intended to be the maximum,
that is, that the penalty should not exceed
the amount stated. We changed the language,
therefore, with the approval of the department concerned, so as to make it coincide
with the intention.
The motion was agreed to.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: With leave of the Senate,

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why now? Is there any
hurry to read this bill the third time? I think
it is far better to observe the usual rule
which requires a day's notice of a motion

second, with the result that I have the whole
world te roam around in; but this afternoon

I am very limited, because se many able

manners te do se, but I think probably I
can bring te the members of this house a

glimpse of the problem as seen by me, a
lawyer who has practised for many years in
one of our large cities.
First of all, however, I want te congratulate the honourable senator from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine). I did net know that he

could draw such a good bill, or that he could
make such a fine presentation.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You know, when you are
leader you always have te remember that
there are other fellows coming up. The old
policy used te be that when a fellow
threatened te come up you cut off his head,
and then you had a clear road until somebody
else came bobbing along. Now, I am getting
te the stage where I am inclined te clip off
somebody's head, but I may not have te do it.
I want also te congratulate the honourable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris).
If there is one member of the
Senate-I am glad te say it in his presenceif there is one member of the Senate who is
a great credit te this chamber, it is the honourable member frorn Vancouver South. He
is known from one end of Canada te the
other, especially by the legal profession, as
one of the outstanding legal lights in our
country. However, he must be approaching
the stage in life when retirement will be
required of him by the law of nature, for
although I have been practising law for fifty
years I have heard of him as far back as I
can remember. I consider it a great privilege
te be even associated with him in this chamber. I feel that I acquire some lustre just
through being one of his fellow-members
here.

MARCH 23, 1955
Hon. Mr. Burchill: We produced him in
New Brunswick.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: He was improved in
British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I also regard very highly
the fine speech made by the honourable senator from Toronto Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
I do not always agree with the honourable
gentleman, but I admire very much his speech
on this bill. Honourable senators, I have
been a member of the Senate for twenty
years, which is quite a while, but I have never
heard in any other debate three such outstanding speeches. In a single debate I have
heard two that could be compared to them,
but never three. I say that with no intention
of flattering the honourable gentlemen. Canada requires such men in her public life.
As the honourable senator for Vancouver
South has reminded us, there are twenty-one
vacancies in this chamber. I hope that they
will soon be filled, and with men of the
calibre of the three honourable senators I
have named, because such men bring to this
house the experience, the knowledge and the
brains we require in the complicated times
through which we are passing.
The other day I heard someone say that
Canada now occupies one of the most important places on the stage of world affairs. Our
country is not as great as the United States
or the United Kingdom, nor as important as
Russia or China. But we stand, as it were,
between two nations, the United Kingdom
and the United States. We are, in my judgment the only people whom both sides trust,
and they trust us to the limit. We must never
forget the obligations which go with our
standing and our reputation.
What is the issue in this debate? I would
point out that it is not concerned with divorce
in the abstract: nothing is involved in the bill
except the granting to women of a measure of
freedom equal to that enjoyed by men. The
greatest asset with which it deals is women;
next in order of importance are the children;
then, the men. I say that deliberately.
Let me refer to some personal experiences.
A lawyer in practice in a city, be it great or
small, gets to be known for what he is. For
a time he may fool some of his clients, but
sooner or later they get the measure of him;
they know that he stands for certain principles, and by the time he has reached forty
years of age his standing is pretty well fixed.
I am not among the foremost ten lawyers of
my city, and I think I can say that neither am
I among the ten least; I am one of the runof-the-mine variety-somewhere in the middle. Having been continuously involved in

politics for forty-seven years, and repeatedly
elected to public office by the people among
whom I live. I have come to be known as a
fellow who can be consulted: people say "Go
to Jack Haig, he will tell you what he thinks;
he will give you his straightforward opinion
on what he understands to be the law." I
have had as much to do with divorce proceedings as any man in Winnipeg, and in the
whole fifty years of my practice I have been
interviewed on these matters time out of number by women, and, be it noted, only by
women.
What is the usual story? In essence it is
very simple. For instance, here is a specifie
case. A woman came in and asked me, "Are
you Mr. Haig?" "Yes." "Are you one of the
members for Winnipeg?" "Yes." "Then you
are the man I want to talk to." "What do
you want to talk about?" "About divorce
from my husband, who has run away and
left me." "How many years ago?" "Three
years ago. I have not heard from him since.
My brothers and sisters have been helping
my children and myself, but I am getting
near the end of the road. The youngsters
require more clothes. Things are not too good
in the city. There is unemployment. People
who used to give me some money cannot
now afford to do so." After this, I told her
that the thing to do was to locate the man
and bring him to justice. I inquired where
he was. The woman did not know; he might
have gone to Montreal, or Toronto, or Calgary, or Edmonton. Finally, with tears in
her eyes, she asked, "Mr. Haig, can't you
help me?"
Well, I have children of my own; in those
days I had a wife of my own; and I felt it
was my duty to try to solve the woman's
problem. After careful inquiries from this
and that source I found that the husband
was living in Montreal. I asked, "Can you
raise any money?" She replied, "I could get
$25.00, but that is all. Would that be of any
use?" I told her that, though the amount
was very small, I would send it to a legal
friend in Montreal, give him all the particulars I could, and ask him to try to find
the husband. In three or four weeks my
agent replied to this effect: "I got your letter
and the $25. I have spent it, and maybe a
little more, but as you told me your client
has no more money, and I shall not expect
any further payment. The man she seeks is
doing so-and-so, and is living with a woman."
Now, what was I to do? The woman could
not go to Montreal and hire a detective to
get information. Nor could she petition the
Senate for divorce, because it would cost
her from twelve to fifteen hundred dollars,
and she did not know there was that much
money in the world. What did she do? She

SENATE
broke down, and cried. It was very hard for
me to avoid doing the same. The only advice
I could give her was to try to keep track of
her husband's whereabouts, carry on as best
she could, and maybe in a few years she
would hear something about him, and pass
on the information to someone in Montreal
to keep on the lookout for him.
Not infrequently an absent husband may
be seen by someone from Winnipeg who is
visiting in the East. In that event, back like
lightning comes the information, but it is of
no value for the purpose of taking divorce
proceedings in Manitoba. In such a case I
may write to the man and urge him to act
like a decent fellow. If he is a traveller, it
may be within his power to make Winnipeg
his headquarters and give his wife the
chance to get a divorce locally. In even the
worst of men one finds traces of better
feelings.
In the case I have in mind, after two or
three months, the husband telephoned me to
tell me that he was in town, staying at such
an hotel, travelling for a company, and
having his headquarters at Winnipeg. I
thanked him, called my detectives, passed
on the information to them, and bade them
keep their eyes open. Two or three weeks
later they furnished the information the
woman needed, with a bill for $50 expenses
incurred in keeping track of the man over
several days and nights. Of course the wife
was unable to pay this account; the $25 she
had already raised was the limit of her
resources. I shall not mention what happened, but the detectives were paid, the case
went to court, and the woman gained her
freedom. Three years later she married
another man.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: What was the evidence
upon which the divorce was granted?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Evidence of adultery, which
consisted merely of this: when the detectives
called at the hotel room they found a woman
in bed after the respondent had answered
the door dressed only in pyjamas. It was
held that this evidence was sufficient to prove
adultery. It was a case of fabricating evidence
of adultery in order to obtain a divorce when
the real ground was desertion.
As I have said, the divorcee remarried
three years later. Two years after that I had
occasion to travel to the Pacific coast with
a curling party. Our train made a brief stop
at a small village in British Columbia where
this woman lived, and evidently she had read
in the local newspaper that I was a member
of the party. She came down to the train
and said, "I want to shake hands with you,
Senator Haig". I was surprised and asked
her why, and she reminded me of her case

and said that she was enjoying the happiest
days of her life. She said that her new husband was manager of a local chain store, and
that ber son of nineteen had just graduated
from the University of British Columbia. She
also told me that her husband's daughter
from his first marriage-he had been a
widower when he remarried-was now happily married. That is a practical life story.
Honourable senators, let me relate an experience I had in the last year I served on
the Senate Divorce Committee. Our committee was hearing a particular case where both
parties were Roman Catholics, and the husband was suing the wife. In defending the
action the wife admitted in the witness box
that on one occasion she had been morally
wrong. She insisted that it had happened
only once. The couple had two children, five
and seven years of age, and reminding the
parents of their responsibility towards their
children I said to the husband: "You are a
successful businessman. Won't you take your
wife back so that you can keep your family
together?" He refused, so I then said: "You
and your wife belong to the Roman Catholic
Church. This is the middle of March and the
Senate is going to adjourn for Easter next
month. I want you to come back to this committee on a certain date in May, and in the
meantime I want you both to visit your parish
priest." Having a great respect for parish
priests of the Roman Catholic Church I said
to the husband, "I am sure your priest will
do his very best to get you two people together again." I told them, of course, that the
other two members on the committee could
overrule me; but they did not do so, and the
necessary arrangements were made. When the
couple reported back to the committee in
May the woman said she had gone to see her
parish priest on the appointed day, but that
her husband had failed to show up on that
day and on subsequent occasions. The husband verified this, saying that he had never
gone near the priest. He said that he did not
have to, and that he wanted to get a divorce.
"Well," I said, "not from this committee"
and the case was subsequently dismissed.
That is the sort of thing we are confronted with. I maintain that 75 per cent
of divorce petitions are filed on behalf of
women, and that this percentage would be
increased if more women could financially
afford to sue for divorce. Many women must
suffer because they cannot afford to pay for
a divorce. Woe betide a nation whi-ch lets
its women suffer and live in misery just
because those responsible are too pigheaded-and I use the word advisedly-to
bring the laws of the country up to date.

MARCH 23i 1955
The honourable senator frorn Fredericton
(Hon. Mrs. Fergusson), who is a member of
the Senate Divorce Committee, claims that
we should have strong evidence of public
opinion before we attempt to change such
basic laws. Well, many practising Canadian
lawyers are behind this legislation. In fact,
the great majority of Canadian Bar Association members are behind it. They believe
in it because they have seen what I have
seen. They have had the experience of
impoverished women coming to them to get
a divorce, and if they have refused to help
them these women have had to remain married and live in misery. Honourable senators
who are not lawyers and who have enjoyed
a happily married life cannot fully appreciate
the plight of such women.
I warned the bouse that I might make
personal references in my remarks today, and
I must tell you what a delight it is for me
to visit my three daughters who are happily
married and have children. Sometimes I
have thought what an awful thing it would
be if my daughters were poor and were in
the position of some of these women I have
been talking about.
I remember some women of 55 or 60 applying to Parliament for a divorce after they
had been separated from their husbands for
as long as 25 or 30 years. When asked why
they had waited so long before applying for
a divorce their first reason was that they
had never had enough money. Usually their
second reason was that their children had
now grown up and wanted nothing whatsoever to do with their father. I always did
my best to give such women a divorce.
Honourable senators, I will now deal with
the various grounds for divorce. In Canada
at the present time the only way that a
woman who has been deserted by ber busband can obtain a divorce is by proving that
be bas committed adultery. In 1943 the
honourable gentleman from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) introduced a bill in the
Senate dealing with presumption of death
and dissolution of marriage. The bill applied
to either sex, and provided that if a man,
say, had been absent for seven years and
his wife had known nothing of him during
that time, the court could, if satisfied, make
a decree of presumption of death, and subsequently a decree of dissolution of the
marriage. A continuous absence of seven
years has legal effect in civil law, and in
criminal law in the case of bigamy, but
it has no legal effect in divorce matters.
Next I wish to deal with the ground of
cruelty. During this debate the honourable
senator from Victoria (Hon. Mrs. Hodges),

asked for a legal -definition of cruelty. Well,
this matter can be left to the courts. I admit
that our judges are only human, but we
lawyers who practise before the courts,
although we are on the side of our clients,
have every confidence in our judges. We may
feel that Mr. Justice X has not got as much
ability as we would like him to have, but
we do appreciate that he administers the
law as he understands it. The question of
what constitutes cruelty can be safely submitted to the courts for interpretation.
I am not too clear about the question of
insanity. If this bill is given second reading
and is referred to committee and somebody
moves that insanity be struck out as a
ground for divorce, I would have great difficulty in voting against the motion. I feel
that insanity is really an illness.
I know the majority will be against me,
but I just cannot bring myself to vote for
that ground. Probably I should do so, but
I am not quite as clear as I ought to be about
it. However, I am positively clear about the
first two grounds. I would rather have desertion or cruelty as grounds for divorce, than
adultery, because we all know, without talking about it, that adultery is frequently used
as a vehicle to prove some other offence not
disclosed to the court.
I want to say a word or two about my
honourable friend from Fredericton (Hon.
Mrs. Fergusson). I think this is only the
second session that she has served on the
divorce committee. May I ask if she bas
ever had occasion to try to reunite a husband
and wife who have separated, and to get
them to live together afterwards?
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: No, I cannot say that
I have.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, I thought not. I tried
it once, and got a slap in the face for my
labours. You can't get any place with such
people-it is absolutely impossible. The welfare organizations are able to supply money
to the family, and they try to get them back
on their feet, but they cannot give money to
a woman to apply for a divorce. And in the
United States they have a welfare problem in
each of their 48 states.
With regard to the rights of a woman in
divorce, I would point out that in Great
Britain eight years ago an amendment to the
divorce laws enabled a woman to sue ber
husband in that country even if he lived in
Canada or elsewhere abroad. Great Britain
granted domicile to the wife, because it was
found that many women married to soldiers,
for instance, were unable to sue their busbands, for they had left the country and often
could not be found. So it was provided that

SENATE
the domicile of the wife should govern in
respect of an application for divorce.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: After three years'
desertion.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, after three years'
desertion, of course.
Honourable senators, I have been surprised
at the stand that certain members of this
house have taken towards this bill. I had
hoped-although I must candidly admit that
I have now lost hope-that the bill would go
to committee, so that each one of us would
have an opportunity to express his or her
ideas, and then that the committee could
report to the house and we would have had
a bill to satisfy the majority of members.
Whether the house passed the bill or not
after the report of the committee, is not so
important, but it is important that the opinions
of the majority of members be known. I
think the proposed legislation should be
allowed to go to committee.
I want to say something about the bill
which was introduced in 1938. My honourable friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
was present when the bill was debated, as
were the honourable senators from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine), Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner) and Bedford-Halifax (Hon. Mr.
Quinn). Not many of us are left.
Hon. Mr. Marcote: I was there.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, my friend from Ponteix
also was present. The bill of 1938, introduced
by the late Senator MeMeans from Winnipeg,
included two sections which did not appear
in the English Act. The Right Honourable
Arthur Meighen, the Leader of the Opposition
at that time, objected to the two sections,
as also did the honourable senator from
Ottawa. Mr. Meighen said he would not vote
for the bill if those sections remained in, and
the honourable member from Ottawa took
much the same stand. Two or three of us
suggested that the bill be allowed to go to
committee, where the offending sections could
be struck out. That was done, and carried.
Unfortunately, the late Senator McMeans was
pretty angry because we took out the two
sections, and he kept the bill standing for
weeks on end without moving the third reading. We could not move it, because he was
in the house at the time, but on the first
occasion that he was absent I moved it, and
the bill went to the House of Commons. However, it was too late. If I remember correctly,
it was June before the bill was brought up in
that house; and it could not possibly be passed
there when the session was so far advanced.
Honourable senators, I have given the history of that bill to show the delay that took

place. In the case of the bill before us now,
however, it is not a case of delay. I hope the
women of Canada, when they look at their
newspapers tomorrow, will have their eyes
open to see how the women members of this
house voted on this bill, that is, whether they
voted for the women or for the men. I am
more anxious about the vote of the women
than the vote of the men. I want the women
of this country to realize what a wife has to
put up with when she seeks a divorce and has
to apply for it in the jurisdiction where her
husband happens to be domiciled. I hope the
women in my city will be able to judge the
attitude of their representatives in Parliament
on divorce. We cannot hide behind some
religious denomination and say, "The church
does not allow it." That is no excuse for a
senator to offer at all. We are here as representatives of the people of Canada, whether
they are members of the Roman Catholic,
Anglican, United Church, Presbyterian, Baptist, Lutheran, or of any other denomination.
That is not the guiding consideration when
members of this house are chosen. The Government of the day summons men and women
to the Senate because it believes they are
representatives of the people of Canada.
Whenever the vote on this bill is taken, there
will be a chance to judge.
My honourable friend from Fredericton
(Hon. Mrs. Fergusson) is a young woman, and
I venture to predict that she will live to see
the day when her vote will be reversed and
the bill will be passed. She will have to
reverse her vote, because otherwise the
women of her part of the country will ask,
"Why didn't you vote to give women the same
right as men on the question of divorce?"
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Will the honourable gentleman permit a question? I am not a member
of the legal profession, and know very little
about the Criminal Code. My honourable
friend gave as an illustration the case of a
man from Winnipeg who deserted his wife in
Montreal. Is there not some provision in the
Criminal Code for prosecuting a man for
desertion?
Hon. Mr. Haig: He can be sued for nonsupport, but his wife has to go to Montreal
to sue him, and when she gets there she might
find that he has skipped to New Brunswick,
and that from there he bas gone to Nova
Scotia or somewhere else.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: May I ask a question?
Would that wife not be able to get an order
under the Deserted Wives and Children's
Maintenance Act?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Even if she did, how could
it be enforced?

MARCK 23. 1955

Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask a question?
Hon. Mr. Haig: My point is that Herbert's
book was the real force behind the passage
of that bill. He represented one of the universities in the House of Commons and with
his masterly grasp of the subject he carried
the bill through the bouse. Certainly there
was no large body of public opinion about it.

of his wife's admitted misconduct. The

SENATE
husband, but he insisted on getting a divorce;
and his application was refused. Have I
summarized it fairly?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: My question is: Do I
understand that where a husband has the
proper proof of the accepted ground for
divorce under the present law he is not
given the same right as is given to a wife in
similar circumstances?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Let me explain further.
While I was an active member of the committee I always felt-and I do not think I
was an exception in this respect-that we
should be most cautious in divorcing couples
with children. In the particular case to which
my friend refers, the woman admitted she
was guilty of adultery on one occasion only.
I am reminded that the Archbishop of
Canterbury suggested in a recent speech that
one isolated instance might be overlooked.
Hon. Mr. Euler: How many times does she
have to commit adultery before her husband
has a right to a divorce?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Let me finish stating the
facts of the case. I suggested that there was
a possibility of a reconciliation, and I thought
it should be tried. I inquired as to their
church and some other personal information,
and suggested that as they were members of
the same church they should return to their
parish and see if they could not settle their
differences.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But they did not agree.

Some Hon. Senators: Question, question.
Hon. W. M. AselIine: Honourable senators,The Hon. the Speaker: I would call the
attention of honourable senators to the fact
that the honourable senator from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) sponsored the bill, and
that when he speaks he will close the debate.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I did not intend to
make the closing speech in this debate this
afternoon, and I am not fully prepared. I
had intended to ask that the debate be
adjourned until tomorrow afternoon, but
upon learning at noon today that quite a
number of senators who are here today
could not attend tomorrow, I decided to
proceed this afternoon. And as a matter of
fact, I want to retain what little popularity
I have left with the members of this chamber.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: You have lots left.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I trust honourable senators will make allowances if my remarks are
not up to the demands of the occasion.
At the outset I want to say that I certainly appreciate the fact that so many
honourable members have delivered excellent
speeches on this subject-particularly those
favouring my bill, of course.
Generally speaking, I think the subject is
one of the most important that has been
brought up in this chamber for many a yearat any rate this year-and it has created great
interest throughout the country.
I want to refer briefly to the speech made

Now, I do wish to say something about the

gusson). I gathered from her remarks that

MARCH 23. 1955
she was basing her objection principally on
religious grounds. She said that she objected
to the bill because of, among other things,
the teachings of the Church of England, to
which she belongs. I do not think that that
is a very good reason at al. She also stated
that she had enjoyed a happy married life,
as her parents had. Well, as some other
people are so unfortunate as to have a very
unhappy married life, I do not know why
she should not be willing to vote for such
legislation as would help them to rehabilitate
themselves and live happily afterwards.
The honourable senator said that a Royal
Commission is at present inquiring into this
very matter in England, and therefore she
did not think we should pass this bill
until that Royal Commission had made its
report. But from what she said I doubt very
much that any recommendation by the Royal
Commission in England would have any bearing at all on whether she voted for this measure or not. Even if this bill went to some
committee of the Senate, I do not think its
findings would have any bearing on her
decision. Or if, as I have advocated time and
time again, a Royal Commission were
appointed in Canada to discuss and consider
this whole matter, I doubt very much from
what she said that she would vote for this
measure even if such a Royal Commission
brought in a report favouring the widening
of grounds for divorce.
I do think, though, that she made a good
suggestion when she said it would be a fine
thing if we had family relations courts in
operation. I would agree that such courts
might have a tendency to bring people together before the home was absolutely broken
up and all chances of reconciliation were
gone. But what would happen to all these
cases where the homes have been irrevocably
broken up, where there is no possibility of
any reconciliation, where the husband and
wife hate each other, yet are tied to each
other for life, with no law to help them correct their position by getting a divorce so
that they may start over again and bring up
their children properly. I submit that even
if domestic relations courts were in existence
all over Canada legislation would still be
required to take care of those cases which
such courts cannot do anything with.
I noted that the honourable senator from
Fredericton was somewhat critical of the
qualifications of the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) to question what effect easy divorce had had on
hasty marriages in England. The alternative
to that question would seem to be this:
What would have happened if those marriages

had not taken place Perhaps the honourable
senator could answer that question.
I next come to the speech of the honourable senator from Northumberland (Hon.
Mr. Burchill). I have not very much to say
about his speech, but he challenged me to
prove that there was a mandate from the
people for this kind of legislation. In other
words, he wanted to know if the people of
Canada desired to have this legislation passed.
He said that he had no knowledge of a
demand for anything of this kind. Well, I
want to say to him that I have had plenty of
evidence of such a demand over the years. I
hold up some files for all senators to see. They
contain letters that have been gathered since
1949 only. In one file are the letters which
have come in just recently from al over
Canada, and not one of them is opposed to
this measure. Even people living in the province of Quebec who belong to the church of
my honourable friends from Ottawa West
(Hon. Mr. Connolly) and Grandville (Hon.
Mr. Bouffard) want this legislation passed
and applied to the whole of Canada, including Quebec. I have letters written to me to
that effect, in French, and translated by the
official translator of the Senate. More of that
later on.
In my first speech on this bill I referred to
the fact that I had received many such letters
during the last ten years. I also mentioned
the Gallup poll, which reports that 75 per cent
of the people interviewed were in favour of
this legislation. I referred further to the resolution passed on this subject by the Canadiari
Bar Association. I also referred to the resolution passed by the Divorce Reform League
of Vancouver, British Columbia. I also referred to the resolution passed by the Canadian
Legion on this same subject. All are asking
for this legislation.
But at the time I made that speech I did
not have the resolution addressed to Parliament by the Canadian Legion at their convention held in Toronto August 1 to 6, 1954. I
propose to read it so that it will be on the
record:
Whereas the divorce laws in Canada are obsolete,
and Canada remains the only progressive country
in the world where adultery is the sole ground
for divorce:
And whereas, due to British legislation. many
veterans are affected by this situation in that their
war brides can return to England and become
divorced, while in Canada the veteran concerned
is still legally a married man:
Therefore be it resolved that Dominion Command of the Canadian Legion malce representations
to Parliament with a view to modernizing our outmoded divorce laws.

In the March issue of Liberty, at page 58,
I find a report, which I consider of great
importance, of this magazine's national sur-

vey on the question before us.

tive, a nation-wide poll conducted for Liberty by

Elliott-Haynes Survey Organization disclosed.
Forty-seven per cent of the 2,500 interviewed in
43 cities claim the laws are too restrictive; 23-7
per cent think they're about right, 11-6 per cent
believe they're too lax; 17-7 per cent expressed
no opinion.
Among male voters, 47-9 per cent feel the laws
are too restrictive; 24-7 per cent say they're just
right; 7-9 per cent claim they're too lax; 19-5 per
cent gave no opinion. Women think they're too
restrictive-46-1 per cent compared with 22-7 per
cent who think they're all right; 15-2 per cent
who say they're not; and 16 per cent who withheld
an opinion.
Asked whether insanity, desertion, incompatibility or cruelty should be grounds for divorce
(instead of present-day adultery), Canadians said:
Insanity-Yes, 53-4 per cent; no, 25-7 per cent;
don't know, 20-9 per cent.

In the last category of uncertainty, my
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Haig) is
included.
Desertion-Yes, 60-8 per cent; no, 21-6 per cent;
don't know, 17.6 per cent.
Incompatibility-Yes, 29-1 per cent; no, 43-3 per
cent; don't know 27-6 per cent.
Cruelty-Yes, 56-9 per cent; no, 22-6 per cent;
don't know, 20 .5 per cent.

That confirms pretty well the results of

the Gallup survey.
I now turn to the issue of Saturday Night of
March 12, 1955, and refer to page 3 where
there is a very fine editorial on this subject.
The magazine is well known, and circulates
to the extent of about 70,000 copies all over
Canada. I will read the editorial:

DIVORCE BILL
With the introduction of a bill by Senator Walter
Aseltine, the effort to put some sense into Canada's
divorce laws has been renewed. It is doubtful if
it wili be any more successful than previous
attempts but at least it serves to remind the Iegislators that they are doing nothing to cure a festering condition.
There cannot be a single member of either the
Senate or the Commons who is so removed from
reality that he does not understand how justice is
being mocked and morality preverted by the
present Procedure governing dissolution of marriages.
Newspapers in
the large cities carry daily
iists of people who have obtained decrees of
divorcement, and reading these lists, an outsider
would be justified in concluding that adultery
was one of Canada's most popular indoor sports,
since this is the only legail reason for ending a
marriage in seven of the ten provinces-crueIty
is an added cause in Nova Scotia, while Quebec
and Newfoundiand dump the whole sorry mess
in the lap of Parliament. Actually, of course, there
is at least as much perjury as adultery; husband
and wife agree that their union must end and one
or the other fakes the necessary "evidence". It
is a dirty, cynical business from start to finish,
but at present it cannot be avoided.
Senator AseItine would enlarge the grounds for
divorce to include cruelty, insanity and desertion;
no petition for divorce could be made until three

years after marriage, except in extreme cases or
for adultery; a wife could obtain a decree if her
husband had been found guilty of rape, sodomy
or bestiality.
It is a good bill, even though it
makes no provision for ending the absurd procedure
whereby Parliament turns itself into a divorce mill
for the benefit of mis-mated coutples living in
Newfoundland and Quebec. But there are too many
parliamentarians terrified of embroiling themselves
or their parties in a bitter, inter-provincial controversy to give such a bill as this a good chance
of survival.
Reform of the divorce laws would probably be
achieved more quickly if the provinces undertook
the job themselves.

As advocated by the honourable senator
from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross).
It would be a piecemeal method and would
undoubtedly iead to legaI complications, but at
least it would mean that a start had been made
on cleaning up a disgraceful situation.

To my mind that is a very strong editorial
indeed, and proves that popular opinion,
at any rate in the city of Toronto, is behind
this bill.
My next quotation is from an editorial in
the Brantford Expositor, published in the
home town of the honourable Leader of the
Government in this house (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald).
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It is a good paper.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The article is entitled:
UNDESERVED

HARDSHIP

Commenting on the move in the Senate to widen
the grounds for divorce in Canada, the Toronto
Star, which is almost as conservative in this matter
as it is Liberal in politics, concedes that when the
matter of liberalizing the divorce law comes up
there is much to be said on both sides. "The
present law", it agrees, "certainly creates much
undeserved hardship. Take the case of Canadian
soldiers who married overseas but whose wives
won't come to Canada, or have returned permanently te the Old Country. These men are tied to
wives an ocean away from them, apparently for
the rest of their lives. If divorce could be secured
for desertion, the husbands could get their freedom and the right to marry again."
This is one special category due for consideration.
There are many others. We agree with our Toronto
contemporary when it says that nobody wants
divorce laws as lax as they are in some states.
(In one of them, the other day, a man trumped
his wife's ace during a bridge game; the wife
thereupon hit him on the head with a handy
vase of flowers; whereupon the injured husband
sued for and obtained a divorce.)
But, as the
Star points out, "a growing body of public
opinion . . .

That is what I have been trying to show, that
there is public opinion behind this measure.
. . . inclines to the view that the matter should
receive thorough study . . ."
The matter has already had thorough study in
England, where sensible and just modifications have
been made, largely, be it noted, on the persuasion
of high church and legal and sociological authorities.
Canada iags unreasonabiy and inexcusably
behind in this connection.

MARCH 23, 1955
Is it any wonder that I lntroduced this bill?
I bave another editorial I should like to read.
Tbis one is from the Peterborough Examiner.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Honourable senators, I rise
to a point of order. I think the honourable
gentleman froin Rosetowin bas contravened
the rules of the Senate by reading editorials.
I would suggest that he should not persist in
doing so.
Hon. Mr. Assumie: I have been chailenged
to prove that public opinion is behind tbis
measure.
Hon. Mr. Vien: My point of order is to the
effect that it is not in accordance with tbe
rules of the Senate to read editonials during
the course of a debate.
Hon. Mr. Assumie: I do not know of any
rule against it, and I should like to have
permission of honourable senators to read titis
article.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I did not; want to interrupt
my honourable friend, but if he persists in
reading editorials I shail have to insist that
my point of order be dealt witb.
Hon. Mr. Asellin.: Wel, I bave only two or
three more to read.
Some Hon. Senalors: Proceed.
Hon. Mr. Vien: The honourable senator can
summanize or give the gist of editorials, but
be cannot read thema and bave them placed
on Hansard in that way.
The Hon. the Speaker: I would suggest that
the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hlon.
Mr. Aseltine) sumamarize rather tban read
the editorials.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Had I known that objection would be taken to this lime of procedure
I would bave summarized the editorials
beforeband.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Is tbe editorial whicb tbe
bonourable gentleman proposes to read in
favour of or opposed to divorce? I think it
would suffice if we bad that information.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: It is not a question of
wbetber the editorial is for or against divorce.
Tbat is not the issue in tbis debate at ail.
Tbe honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) eloquently and thorougbly
pointed out that the principle involved in this
bill is not whetber we sbould have divorce
but wbether we sbould widen the grounds
for granting divorce. That is what we are
debating now. I would point out that a considerable amount of latitude was given to
speakers who bave opposed this bill.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Tbey were given every
opportunity to get tbeir points across.

Hon. Mr. Lambert: I think the honourable
gentleman from Rosetown would cover bis
point effectively if he were to inform the
bouse of the names of publications that have
also expressed the same point of view as
those which he bas already put on record.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: The editorials I have
flot read are stronger still.
Hon. Mr. Vien: If the bonourable gentleman assures me tbat be is almost tbrough I
shall not insist, but if he persists ini reading
tbe editorials in detail I shah bhave to press
my point of order.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Go ahead.
Some Hon. Senators: Carry on.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I arn advised by tbe Clerk of the Senate
tbat tbe authorities bold the view it is flot
good parliamentary practice to refer in detail
to editorial opinions on a matter that is
immediately before the house.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I bow to the rullng of
His Honour the Speaker. I shail just say that
ini the issue of Marcb 2, 1955, of the Peterborough Examiner there is an editorial on
tbis very interesting subject, wbich in effect
approves 100 per cent of the measure I have
introduced. It goes on to say that if a measure like this is passed it will do away with
a great deal of the perjury, connivance, collusion and ail that kind of tbing that goes on in
our courts at present. I shall not read the
editorial.
Tbere is another editorial to tbe same effect
in tbe Kingston Whig Standard. There are
two more sucb articles in tbe Vancouver Sun,
one entitled "Erase the Moral Blot"l and the
otber "Divorce Sanity Sought"'.
At tbe present time a debate on this same
subject is taking place in tbe Legisiature of
Manitoba. Tbe provincial member for Winnipeg Centre introduced a resolution in tbat
bouse calling on tbe federal Government to
amend Canada's divorce laws to allow any
province to widen its divorce grounds. An
article entitled "Divorces do not Break Marniages,"1 wbîcb appeared in a recent edition of
tbe Winnipeg Tribune, deals with the debate
now taking place on a resolution in the
Manitoba Legislature.
I bave anotber long editorial from the
Globe and Mail, to the same effect. It also
deals witb the possible marriage of Princess
Margaret, and says that a certain Englisb
bisbop stated that if sbe wanted to marry
and no one else would perform. the marriage
ceremony, he would do so.
Honourable senators, I am not going to read
all the letters tbat I bave here, but I want

SENATE
to point out that every one of them is in
favour of this measure, and not one is against
it. Most of the letters-this bears out what
my honourable friend from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. Haig) said-are from women who are
down and out and whose husbands have left
them; and in some cases the women have
even been driven from home. One poor
woman wrote to me as follows:
If this divorce bill of yours does not pass, I
am going to live with another man, and I am
going to keep my daughter with me. and if my
husband ever shows up and makes any attempt
to get that daughter away from me I am going
to commit manslaughter, even if I have to go to
jail for the rest of my life.
Honourable

senators,

this

is

a

serious

matter; it is terrible. These poor women are
certainly in a difficult position-in a much
more difficult position than an injured husband, as was explained by my honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Haig). These letters go
on to say, in substance, that this is a great
chance for the Senate to justify its existence,
which it hasn't done up to the present time.
I do not agree with the latter part of that
statement, but I do agree with the former
part: I think it is a great opportunity for
the Senate of Canada to show that it is
alive and up and doing, and that it knows
what the people of this country want.
Honourable senators, in future when I get
letters of this kind I will answer them, and
tell every mother and son and daughter I
hear from to write to their senator and member of Parliament, and to the Prime Minister,
demanding that something be done. I would
like the newspaper reporters to take notice
of that and publish it so that this matter
will be brought to the attention of the people
who pass the laws of this country.
The first objection advanced against this
bill was that public opinion is not behind
this measure. I think I have shown conclusively that quite a lot of public opinion is
behind it.
The second objection was that the measure
would be detrimental to the children involved.
Perhaps honourable senators do not know
that more than 50 per cent of the people who
apply to Parliament for divorce have no
children at all. In looking through the
petitions listed in the Divorce Committee's
Orders of the Day for last Friday I noticed
that 12 cases were set down to be heard,
and seven of the petitioners had no children.
I have often wondered if childless marriages
were responsible for so many divorces. Of the
remaining five petitioners on Friday, four
had one child each, and only one had two
children.
I have here some statistics with respect
to England, in Appendix "B" to Memorandum

from the Divorce Law Reform Union for the
considerationof the Royal Commission. That
is the Royal Commission which is sitting in
England at the present time. From this
document I have taken the f ollowing information: The divorce registry in London, for
1949, shows that out of 14,847 couples whose
marriages were dissolved or annulled 6,052
were childless, and 2,516 had only one child.
Out of 30,870 such couples in 1950 in the
whole country, including Wales, 11,555 were
childless, and 10,464 had only one child.
In Australia, in the year 1948, 38.9 per
cent of the people who obtained divorces had
no children, and 30-2 per cent had only one
child.
The figures I have given show that the
problem of whether or not the children suffer
as the result of divorce is not so great as
many people seem to think. In cases that
I have dealt with in the Senate Divorce
Committee in the last 21 years, I have always
made it a point to find out before the case
is disposed of if there are children; if so,
how many, and who is looking after them;
whether the husband is liable for their
support, and if he is not, whether the wife,
if she gets a divorce, will be able to take
care of them, bring them up properly and
educate them. In no case have I been worried
at all about the fate of the children.

The

father must take care of his children, whether
his

him

or not, if

the law

declares that he must do so. If the husband
divorces his wife he is usually able to take
care of the children himself, because he
is the breadwinner, and he can get married
again, or have the children placed somewhere
to be properly brought up.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is it not so that such
children are already fatherless, their father
having abandoned the family?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Not in so far as the
law is concerned. If the father abandons
them he is still liable for their support.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But if the father has
abandoned the children, that means he is
living separately and is not taking care of
them, anyway.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: If the father disappears
altogether, they are fatherless, of course.
A few moments ago I gave some figures
from Australia. When I opened the debate
on this bill I told honourable senators what
the grounds for divorce were in New Zealand,
but at that time I did not know what the
grounds were in the Commonwealth of
Australia. I have since learned that the
grounds for divorce in that country are as
follows: Adultery, bigamy, cruelty, cruelty
and desertion, drunkenness, desertion and

What is our experience in the Senate
Divorce Committee? When I first came here,
in 1933-34, there were not more than fortyfive or fifty divorces each session. Now, still
with only one ground, we have more than
four hundred, or an increase of some 800
per cent. It is obvious that this is a worldwide condition, which does not arise just
because the United States happens to have
more grounds and more divorces than we
have. We are not in favour of the practices
of the "bed-hoppers" of Hollywood, many of
whom divorce and marry again and again
just for publicity purposes. What we are asking for is a sane reasonable law-not that of
Nevada or Hollywood and such places. It is
my submission that the facts do not support
the argument that additional grounds cause
increased divorces in other countries.
I am not one of those who do not believe
in divorce. Much as I dislike it, I believe it
is the only cure for this disease-this cancer
that the honourable senator from Ottawa
West (Hon. Mr. Connolly) spoke of-and if
we do not find a cure for it, the disease will
persist and the people will have no relief
from it.
I agree with the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) that if
the bill passes we shall have more divorces.
While that is certainly true, we shall not
have as many based on the ground of
adultery. More than half of the cases being
heard here for adultery could be tried on
the ground of desertion. When the great
backlog of perhaps two or three thousand
desertion cases have been cleared away and
the parties have received their rights and
have remarried, the divorce rate will level
off. But that can never happen until we
dispose of the backlog of desertion cases.
I think that people who oppose this bill
overlook the fact that we have had two
great wars in the world since 1914, and that
they have upset the whole world and in the
circumstances it is only natural that people
have become separated and alienated. There
has been a natural increase in the number
of divorces, no matter what the grounds are.
In Canada, we have only one ground, yet
over the years our divorces have gone up by
leaps and bounds, on account of the two great
wars and the generally upset condition of
the world.
Honourable senators will be glad to know
that I am getting along with my remarks.
I want to say something now about the bill
itself.
I do not pretend that this bill is perfect
at all. We did the best we could with it.

In 1938 it was amended in committee, and
further amended in committee of the whole
house. If I recall rightly, I think that I
brought in the amendment. The late Senator
Murdock was in the chair at the time. The
amendments were drafted by our Parliamentary Counsel, Mr. O'Connor, at the suggestion of the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) and the
Right Honourable Senator Meighen.
I might say, honourable senators, that there
is a wonderful debate reported on this subject in the Hansard of 1938. The bill was
spoken to by Senator Sir Allen Aylesworth.
I believe Senator Lynch-Staunton also spoke.
There were several speeches by Right Honourable Arthur Meighen, and an outstanding one
by the honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris). The outcome
was that certain sections of the bill were
redrafted, and they appear in the present
bill in substantially the same form as they
were when the 1938 bill passed the Senate.
As I said before, honourable senators, the
present bill is very simple. It provides only
three new grounds, plus the ground of presumption of death if one of the spouses has
been absent for seven years without trace.
Some objection was taken to the ground of
desertion. This could be pleaded only if
the petitioner had been deserted without
cause for a period of at least three years. It
is a matter that can be talked over and dealt
with in committee. Some people might believe
that a three-year period was not long enough,
that four years would be more proper. The
honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) asked me the other day how
many years' desertion were required in Scotland. At that time I told him that I did not
know, but in the meantime I have found out
that the period is four years.
The next ground is cruelty: In 1938 the
same question which was raised by the
honourable senator from Victoria (Hon. Mrs.
Hodges) came up, and we ended up by not
formulating any definition of cruelty. At that
time we studied the case of Russell versus
Russell and all the other cases, and whether
we were right or wrong the conclusion was
reached that it would be better to leave the
determination of cruelty to the courts. I
might say that I have no objection whatever
to a definition of cruelty such as the one
given to us the other day by the honourable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris).

was drafted in its present form so that it
should in no way affect provincial practice
and procedure. It will be noted that as the
section says that "in addition to any other
grounds on which, in the province and in
the court to which the petition has been
presented, a marriage is by law void or voidable", the specified grounds shall apply. As
far as the inclusion of epilepsy as a ground
is concerned, I do not suppose that, if its
elimination were thought to be advisable,
there would be any serious objection.
Before resuming my seat I wish to make
a few general remarks. I believe everyone
will admit that our existing divorce laws are
harsh. Lawyers at any rate, can vouch for
the fact that on this account a great many
people have left Canada and sought relief in
the United States, Mexico, or some other
foreign country. In my limited practice I
have had to advise on many occasions that,
under the law as it exists in Canada today,
my clients could have no hope of relief; and
when they asked me what they could do,
my reply was: "You will have to leave this
country, take up residence and become
domiciled in a foreign state, and then you
can get a divorce and marry someone else,
provided that you establish a permanent
home in that country." I repeat: thousands
of people have left Canada for the United
States because, as a result of our harsh laws,
relief for them here was impossible.
There is in this country but one ground
of divorce. It follows that much perjury is
committed in our courts, and there is a
great deal of collusion and connivance in
connection with the proceedings. The newspapers have reported many cases of murder
and suicide which, I believe, resulted from
unhappy marriages for which no legal redress was possible. The couples found they
could not get along together; they were
without hope for the future; and finally one
or the other went "berserk".
Honourable senators, if this bill is not
passed, all these people I have mentioned
will have no hope. What will they do? Well,
they will do just exactly what they say in
these letters-they will live in a common
law relationship and perhaps raise illegitimate children. Would it not be far better
for us to liberalize our laws a little, make
them a little more sane? If they are not
antediluvian, they are at least antiquated.
Let us make them more human. Let us clear
up this cancer, this disease, that is so harmful to the domestic life of this country.

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved the second

He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this legislation is to increase the salary

of the Auditor General of Canada as of July
1, 1954. The present salary of this officiai
is$ 15,000. I arn sure ail honourable senators
know the very important work that he does,
and will be surprised to learn that his
present salary is the same as that which
was received by the Auditor General thirtyone years ago.
Han. Mr. Roebuck: In effeet, his salary has
been eut in two during the intervening
years.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That may be so. I
arn not an economist to that extent, but
taking for granted what the honourable senator says, the proposed increase wiil not bring
the salary of the Auditor General to the
level it was thirty-one years ago. I wiil not
vouch for that, but I thought I should mention the fact that this would be the first
increase in saiary for the Auditor General
in thirty-one years.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If this legisiation passes,
what will the salary of this officiai be?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If this legisiation is

SECOND READING

Hon. James A. MacKinnon moved the
second reading of Bill C, an Act to amend
the Precious Metals Marking Act.
He said: Honourable senators, although this
bill is a short one it is quite important to
retailers
those concerned-manufacturers,
and consumers. It bas been suggested that
I give a rather extended explanation; however, I shall try to make it as brief as
possible.
The Precious Metals Marking Act deals
with articles of gold, silver, platinum and
palladium, and articles plated with gold or
silver.
Under the act, it is not mandatory that
be
articles of, or plated with, precious metals
howmarked as to content. The act does, made
ever, provide that where reference is conto the precious metal content, then that
tent shall be shown in a particular manner.
For example, a gold ring may be sold as
just a plain ring, but if reference is made
to gold, then the gold content must be
indicated. If it is represented as being of
carat quality, say 10K, then it must be
10/24ths by weight gold. In addition, where
such quality mark-that is, the precious metal
content-is placed on an article, it must
also carry a registered trade mark or a trade
mark for which application has been made.
The present bill provides for two amendments. The first deals with the method of
applying quality marks to gold-filled or rolled
gold plate bracelet wrist watches which have
base metal parts. The difference between
gold-filled and rolled gold plate lies mainly
in the thickness of the gold. In the former,
it is 3/1000 inches, and in the latter l/1000
inches of gold which is at least of 10K quality.
Under the act as it stands, where all parts
of the bracelet watch case have gold content,
the quality mark and trade mark can be
applied to any part, but it is usually applied
to the back. Where some parts of the case
are plated or filled, and others are of base
metal, the quality markings must be applied
to those parts which are plated, and the
words "base metal" to those which are base
metal. With the present size of wrist watches,
it is difficult to place marks on the plated parts
without damage; further, if they are put on,
they are often so small as to be indecipherable. As a result, few wrist watch cases carry
any quality marks, and any quality declaration is on an attached tag. To provide informative marking, it is proposed that the
manufacturers be permitted to indicate on
the outer side of the base metal back the
quality mark of the other parts, with an

MARCH 24, 1955
indication of which parts are base metal. No
change is necessary where ail parts are goldplated or gold filled. This additional method
of marking has the approval of the Canadian
Jewellers Association.
The second amendment, which is technical,
resuits from the necessity under the existing
act, of applying to precious metal articles a
registered trade mark or one for which appli-cation has been made under the Unfair Competition Act. The Trade Marks Act,' proclaimed on July 1, 1954, repealed the Unfair
Competition Act. The new Trade Marks Act
did provide that registrations under the Unf air Competition Act are retained as such, and
applications for registration still pending
under the old act are to lie dealt with under
that act. However, there is apparently nothlng in the new Trade Marks Act to provide
that trade marks or applications made under
the old act shaîl lie deemed to have been
made under the new act. The view of the
law officers of the Crown was, therefore, that
the Precious Metals Marking Act should lie
amended to refer to trade marks as having
been registered, and to applications for trade
marks as having been made under either act.
Trade marks are required for identification
of the manufacturer.
Honourable senators, if this bill is given
second reading I will move that it lie referred
to the appropriate standing committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bull was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. MacKinnon, the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
MEMBERS 0F PARLIAMENT RETIRING
ALLOWANCES BILL
SECOND

READING

Han. W. ]Ross Macdonald moved the second
reading of Bill 183, an Act ta amend the
Memliers of Pariament Retiring Allowances
Act.
He said: Honouralile senators, the purpose
of this bill is clearly set out in the explanatory notes, and probably I should refer to
them. They commence as follows:
The purpose of this bill la to provide
(a) that a withdrawal allowance payable under
the act will include any interest that has beea
paid on contributions under subsection (1) of
section 8 of the act. and
(b) to maire it clear that In ail cases where a
withdrawal aflowance becomes payable under the
act, any amount owing under the act, except
interest owing under subsection (2) of section 8,
is, In effect. written off.

As honourable senators are probably aware,
at the present time the members of the House
of Commons contribute a total of $240 per

annum into a fund. If they pay into the
fund in respect of sessions for three Parliaments and then retire from Parliament, either
voluntarily or involuntarily, they are entitled
annually to a percentage of the money they
have paid in. They are entitled to threequarters of the principal amount which they
have contributed to the fund. The maximum
amount of principal payable into the fund
is $4.000, so that the maximum retiring allowance is $3,000. However, if after a member
has contributed in respect of sessions in three
Parliaments he becomes a member of the
Senate, he does flot receive any benefit from
the fund.
When the act came into force a number of
members had been in the House of Commons
long enough to qualify for the full amount
of the retiring allowance. Under the provisions of the act they had to declare within
one year whether they would dlaimi the benefit provided by the act; and if so they then
could elect to pay a lump sum into the fund
or to contribute by way of regular payments.
The lump sum payable by a member was
arrived at on the basis of $240 for each
previous session in respect of which he
wished to contribute, plus interest at 4 per
cent per annum from the date of the final
payment of sessional indemnity in respect of
that session to the date on which he elected
to contribute for this prior service. It will
be seen that in certain instances a member
might elect to pay in the full amount of
$4,000, together with interest over the years,
which could come to, approximately $1,000.
Therefore, some lump payments were as high
as $5,000.
Some difficulty has been encountered in
administering the act where members have
died and it has been necessary to recover
from their estates. Let us take a case where
one member has paid in a lump sum of $5,000
and another member during the same sessions
has made only a small instalment payment;
and then suppose that both members died.
The estate of the member who has paid in
the lump sum of $5,000 would get only $4,000
back, leaving the sum of $1,000 in the fund,
that being interest; whereas the estate of the
member who merely elected to pay into the
fund by way of instalments would only lie
required to pay interest on the unpaid balance
of $5,000 from the time of election until the
date of the member's death. The purpose of
the present bill is to provide that the estates
of both members would be chargeable with
only the interest owing. 0f course, in the
case where the $5,000 has been paid there
would lie no interest, but in the other case
the estate would pay just the interest on
the amotunt owing.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Reid: If a member died would
his widow have to pay what is owing into
the fund?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The estate would be
chargeable for the amount owing, whether
or not the beneficiary is the widow.
Here is another difficulty in the administration of the present act. Suppose a member
has not paid any money into the fund in
respect of prior service and retires from
Parliament. In that case he might still have
a withdrawal allowance, because he has
returnable to him the contribution made for
current service. Take the case of a member
who has agreed to pay in $5,000, and retires
from Parliament. At the end of the first
year he would be entitled to $3,000; but he
would not get it, because he would owe the

fund the $5,000.

Hon. Mr. Reid: The $3,000 would go toward
the debt?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, it would go
toward the debt. On the other hand, if the
member died just before the remaining
$2,000 was paid off, then there would be a
claim on the estate for the balance outstanding, plus interest; whereas if he had lived just
one day beyond the date on which he would
have become entitled to a direct allowance,
the estate would have nothing to pay in,
except some interest. The purpose of this
amendment is to ensure that in such circumstances the estate would not be liable for the
$2,000, but of course in any event the estate
would be liable for any interest that was
owing.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: What would happen if
the member were appointed to the SEnate?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If the member were
appointed to the Senate, he might be entitled
to an annual allowance, which is suspended
while he is a member of the Senate, or he
might be entitled to a withdrawal allowance.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Would he be entitled to
any withdrawal if he had never paid in
anything?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No, he would not.
If he were appointed to the Senate he would
have to pay some interest, but he would not
have to pay $4,000 or $5,000. In fact, I
happen to be in that position myself, as
probably some other senators are.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is why I asked the
question.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If they have not
paid in the full amount they may be required
to pay some interest. If they have not paid
in anything, there would of course be some
interest to pay, at the rate of 4 per cent.
The purpose of this bill is to do away with
claims for principal against estates of deceased
members. The bih received the consideration of the House of Commons and was passed after an explanation of it had been given.
However, I must say that from reading the
debate in the House of Commons Hansard
I did not get much enlightenment on the subject. I hope I have imparted a little enlightenment.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Can the honourable leader
give the Senate any information on the number of members who -are retired and receiving
allowances, and also how the fund itself
stands?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have no information on how many members are retired and
receiving allowances, but I understand there
are not many. As to the fund itself, I understand that at the present time it is actuarially
sound.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: May I inquire again as to
the amount paid in yearly by the member?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: $240. When the act
first came into effect, it was specified as 6
per cent of the sessional indemnity, which
was then $4,000, so that the annual amount
required to be paid by the member was $240.
The indemnity is now $8,000, and at six per
cent the annual amount payable by members
would be $480; but an amendment to the act
fixed the contribution at 6 per cent of the
first $4,000 of sessional indemnity.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: And the maximum amount
that a member will be required to pay in is
$4,000?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, that is the maximum amount.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: What is the amount of
the benefit?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The benefit is 75 per
cent of the amount paid in, and the member
must pay in respect of three parliaments.

Hon. Mr. Hoebuck: It occurs to me that
when the original bill came before us we felt
that as it principally concerned members of
the Commons we should have very little to
say about it or to do with it. Apparently the
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Members of the bill had some bad loopholes. It is unfortunate

It just shows what is lost when the Senate

does not make its usual inquiry.

MARCH 24, 1955
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: I think the bill was
sent to a committee the last time.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, but it was given
perfunctory consideration, because we thought
it was purely a House of Commons measure.
This is an instance of how a defective bill
can "get by" if it is not given proper attention by the Senate.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

CANADA GRAIN BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. T. A. Crerar moved the second reading
of Bill 245, an Act ta amend the Canada Grain
Act.

SENATE
He said: Honourable senators, I presume
that you will require some explanation of this
billHon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -which, I may add, is the
customary practice. Before I come to deal
directly with the proposed amendments to the
Canada Grain Act, it might be of interest to
take honourable members on a brief historical
survey of the development of the act.
When settlers commenced to pour into the
Prairies it was not long before the marketing
of prairie grain became a serious problem.
The Canadian Pacific Railway had been built
through the West, branch lines were being
established and settlers were coming into the
country in large numbers. The open prairies
were easy to plow and develop, and the large
yields of grain even in the late eighties, and
certainly during the period from 1890 to
1900, caused grave problems in marketing.
Grain was already being produced in tens of
millions of bushels. Hitherto, the settlers
who had gone to Western Canada had marketed their small crops in Ontario, Quebec,
or other eastern provinces where they had
come from, but when individual farmers were
producing as much as 5,000 bushels of wheat
the difficulties of marketing became far
greater. It was inevitable that these difficulties should raise serious problems. Elevator
companies, patterned after those in operation
south of the international boundary line, were
formed. They were unregulated, and sometimes they did not treat the producer altogether fairly. There was considerable agitation, so much so that in 1899 a royal commission was set up to examine into the marketing problems of Western wheat.
Incidentally, that was the first royal commission to undertake such a task. Its chairman was Judge Senkler, from Ontario,
assisted by three Western farmers. The report
of the commission recommended to the Government that a grain act be passed modelled
upon the lines of a similar act of the State
of Minnesota. In the year 1900 the first
grain act, known as the Manitoba Grain Act,
was passed. I read the debate on the Act
in the House of Commons Hansard the
other day, and it was very interesting to read
about the establishment of the initial piece
of legislation. In the year 1899 a grain inspection system had been established and the
late David Horn was appointed Chief Grain
Inspector. That was simply an effort to
classify wheat by grades, and to give the
grades Government sanction, and thus afford
a reliable index to purchasers in Europe or
elsewhere of the quality of grain which was
being offered for sale. The original Manitoba
Act had 57 sections, and quite a number of

schedules. The important part of the legislation concerned the duties assigned to the
warehouse commissioner wha was to be
appointed by the Government under the act:
The head office of the commissioner shall be at
Winnipeg, and his duties shall be as follows:
(a) to require all elevators, warehouses, mills,
and grain commission merchants to take out an
annual licence;
(b) to fix the amount of bonds to be given by
the different owners and operators of elevators,
mills, and flat warehouses and by grain commission
merchants;
(c) to require the persons so licensed to keep
books in forms approved of by the commissioner
or by the Governor in Council;
(d) to supervise the handling and storage of
grain, in and out of elevators, warehouses and
cars;
(e) to receive and investigate ail complaints
made in writing, under oath, of undue dockage,
improper weights or grading, refusal or neglect
to furnish cars within a reasonable time, all complaints of fraud or oppression by any person,
firm or corporation, owning or operating any
elevator, warehouse, mill or railroad, or by any
grain commission merchant, and to appiy such
remedy as is provided by statute;
(f) to enforce rules and regulations made under
this act, and to report to the Minister of Inland
Revenue such changes therein as he deems
advisable;
(g) to institute prosecutions at the Government
expense whenever he considers a case proper
therefor.

That was the core of the first Manitoba
Grain Act. It will be observed that by these
provisions a control was imposed upon all
dealers in grain, as a consequence of which
farmers ceased to suffer losses from defalcations. Prior to these provisions, sometimes a
farmer shipped a carload of grain which when
sold would not be accounted to him. That
was overcome, first, by licensing the dealer
and the commission merchant, and, secondly,
by imposing upon the dealer or commission
merchant a sufficient bond to afford the necessary protection to the producers. The first
warehouse commissioner was Mr. C. C.
Castles, who was also a member of the first
grain commission which I have mentioned.
I recall Mr. Castles very well. He was a
very efficient and able commissioner.
In spite of the provisions of the act, not
all of the problems were solved. In 1906
it was deemed necessary to appoint another
royal commission, the chairman of which was
Mr. John Miller, of Indian Head, who had
associated with him two other gentlemen,
Messrs. McNair and Goldie. As a result of
the commission's report further amendments
to the act were made.
In 1912 there was a somewhat extensive
revision of the Grain Act. The position of
warehouse commissioner was abolished, and
the first Board of Grain Commissioners was
provided for. The board was given the
supervision and administration of the act, and
this system continues to the present time.

MARCH 29, 1955
In 1923 another inquiry was undertaken,
presided over by Mr. Justice Turgeon, who
was then a member of the Court of Appeal of
Saskatchewan.
That was an exhaustive
inquiry covering all phases of the trade, and
it resulted in further improvements to the
legislation.
In 1931, when the late Lord Bennett was
Prime Minister of Canada, another royal commission was appointed, of which Sir Josiah
Stamp-an economist from England-was
chairman, assisted by two other commissioners, namely, Mr. Justice Brown, of Saskatchewan, and Mr. Sanford Evans, of Winnipeg. That commission was authorized to
inquire into and report upon what effect, if
any, the dealing in grain futures had upon
the price received by the producer. At that
time there had arisen a great deal of criticism
in the prairie provinces in connection with
the dealing in grain futures by what were
popularly called "options", which it was
claimed operated against the interests of the
producer.
In passing, may I say that I
have never been convinced of that, and I
think the reverse is the case. However, that
is beside the point. The Stamp Commission
made a very thorough but rather rapid survey
of this single matter referred to it. The
commission's report confirmed the impression
held by many people, that while the method
of dealing in futures in grain that was purchased in the country might be improved,
the underlying principle of futures trading
was sound and operated to the benefit of the
producer.
In 1936 another royal commission was set
up, again under the chairmanship of Mr.
Justice Turgeon, and a lengthy inquiry was
conducted. It is interesting to note in passing
that the two commissions headed by Mr.
Justice Turgeon and the Stamp commission
reported in favour of the maintenance of the
futures market as an aid to the Western
producer in the selling of his grain.
Many inquiries were conducted also by
Parliamentary committees on agriculture;
but it is unnecessary to deal With them,
and I do not propose to do so. I would again
remind honourable senators that it is just
fifty-five years since the first Manitoba Grain
Act was placed on the statute books and
became what the Western farmers later
claimed to be the great charter of freedom in
the marketing of their grain.
The proposals in the bill before us are
few and simple. The first amendment would
increase the salaries of the Chief Commissioner and the other two commissioners. My
recollection Is that at the present time the
Chief Commissioner receives an annual salary
of $13,500, which would be increased to
$15,000.
50437-241

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: His present salary is
$14,000.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Thank you. I was a little
conservative, as I usually am.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: But liberal in your
proposed increase.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The second amendment
would provide for one additional assistant
commissioner. At the present time there are
three: one resident in Alberta, and one each
in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The proposed
new assistant would be located in Saskatchewan, which produces more grain-certainly
more wheat-than the other two provinces
combined.
An idea of the scope of the business of
marketing grain is suggested by the fact that
there are more than 5,000 country elevators
in the three prairie provinces; and that in
addition there are terminal elevators at the
head of the lakes, in the cities of Vancouver,
Saskatoon, Calgary and one or two other
places. Therefore, the appointment of a fourth
assistant grain commissioner would appear
wholly justified.
The existing law provides that in the
weigh-up of terminal elevators, surplus grain
may under certain circumstances be taken
by the Government; and hitherto such grain
has been disposed of, under the law, by the
Board of Grain Commissioners. My recollection is that the proceeds therefrom were
paid into the consolidated revenue fund. It
is now proposed to change the method of disposing of the surplus so obtained. Hereafter,
if this legislation passes, the surplus will be
turned over to the Wheat Board for disposal,
instead of to the Board of Grain Commissioners. In that case, I presume the receipts
therefrom would become part of the funds
of the Wheat Board and be available at some
future time for distribution to the producers.
I am not at all clear as to the reasons for this
change, and I did not attempt to learn why
it is being proposed. This bill, I think, should
go to a committee, where we could ascertain
the reasons for this.
There are one or two minor amendments:
one, dealing with the grading of Durum
wheat, results from the experience gained in
the marketing of that product. As honourable
senators know, Durum vheat has now become
an important part of the wheat production
of the Prairies. I have no doubt that the
recommendations made in the bill in this
respect carry the judgment of the Board of
Grain Commissioners and all interested
parties, including pools, and that the recommendations are in the right direction.
Provision is also made for changing the
gradiing f soybeans. It is interesting to note

SENATE
that this product is becoming of some importance from the farmer's standpoint and,
consequently, provision is made to place the
marketing in line with the general marketing
legislation establishing proper grades. That,
honourable senators, covers the amendments
proposed in this bill.
I have one or two general observations ta
make. It was a matter of regret ta me that
some criticism was directed against the
existing Board of Grain Commissioners. The
present chief of the board is Mr. Donald
McKenzie. I am sure the honourable senator
from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. MacKinnon), who
at one time was Minister of Trade and Commerce and had ta do with the board, will
confirm me when I say that in Mr. McKenzie
we have not only a man of ability but a man
of outstanding integrity, who enjoys ta a
remarkable degree the confidence of everyone
associated with the marketing of grain.
There has alsa been some criticism in certain places as ta the appointment of a new
grain commissioner. I do not propose ta deal
with that at the moment. The suggestion
was made that the western wheat pools
should be consulted as ta the proper person
ta fill the vacancy created by the lapsing of
Mr. Vallance's term of office by reason of
his retirement through having reached the
retirement age.
I have always believed-and I have said
this before, if not in this house, certainly in
the House of Commons-that it is a fallacious
and mistaken principle, in the appointment of
responsible public boards and commissions,
ta seek nominations from persons or bodies
directly interested in the functions which
such commissions have ta discharge. It would
not be reasonable ta give railway companies
the right ta name members of the Board of
Transport Commissioners, or allow the banks
ta have the final word in the appointment
of the Inspector General of Banks-who is
a very important official-or ta consuit the
Manufacturers' Association with a view ta
having them nominate or designate members
of the Tariff Board. Sa, I repeat my conviction that it is wrong in principle, and
ultimately subversive of good administration,
ta seek appointments through the agency of
bodies which have a special interest in the
administration with which such boards are
charged.
I have no hesitation in recommending the
amendments ta the house. If the bill should
receive second reading it will be sent ta the
appropriate committee.
The story behind this measure is a long
one. Fifty-five years is quite a lengthy period
ta look back upon; and what astonishes me
is that, with relatively so little knowledge

and experience, the originators of the Manitoba Grain Act, in venturing upon new
ground, produced a piece of legislation which
in its main essentials has stood the test of
more than half a century. It is interesting ta
read the report of the debate when that
measure was introduced. Its sponsor was
the then Minister of Inland Revenue, Sir
Henri Joly de Lotbiniere. The licence fees
which were collected in pursuance of the act
were channelled at that time into the Ministry of Inland Revenue, and it was not
until much later that the administration of
the act came under the Department of Trade
and Commerce-the department which, I
think, is the proper one ta administer it. In
reading the report of the debate on the introduction of the bill, I could not but be impressed with the fact that a group of men
drawn from both the political parties actively
participated in the discussion, with a quite
obvious desire ta produce the best legislation possible. The result, as I said a moment
ago, was an act which in essence has successfully passed the test of fifty-five years; and
I venture ta say that it will be in existence
fifty-five years hence, and that when, at
that time, further amendments may be introduced and considered, those who take part in
the discussion will say, looking back on the
history of the statute, "Those who founded
the Manitoba Grain Act built wisely and
well".
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
senator from Churchill one or two questions
about the bill? I notice that "western grain"
and "eastern grain" are mentioned. Ta what
areas or provinces do these respective designations refer?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: As a matter of fact,
eastern grain comprises a very small part of
the total grain movement.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Does "eastern grain" cover
grain grown in Ontario and Quebec?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That would be eastern
grain.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Why is the word "Mindum"
substituted for "Durum" in clauses 5 and 6
of the bill?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The probable reason is
that Durum is very frequently referred ta
as "Mindum" wheat". I cannot say more
than that I think the two names are interchangeable.
Hon. Mr. Reid: By reference ta the schedule relating ta soybeans it will be noted that,
in relation ta grade No. 1, the standard of
quality is stated ta be "cool, of natural odour,

MARCH 29, 1955
well-screened, of good natural colour". The
word "cool" appears all the way down the
schedule. I should like to know what it
meàns.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I am bound to say that
my knowledge does not extend to that particular point, but I have no doubt that when
the bill gets to committee we shall have a
satisfactory explanation of the meaning.
Hon. John T. Haig: I shall not take much
of the time of the bouse. I rose only because
some bitter words have been said elsewhere
about the Chief Commissioner and one of the
deputies who are connected with the administration of the act, and both of whom I
personally know very well.
If anyone here supposes that my knowledge of grain does not extend as far back as
that of my honourable friend from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar), I want to disabuse his
mind of that idea at once. I can remember
when we used to pile grain on sidings in
bags, for there was nothing else to put it in.
The bags would be piled along the right of
way for perhaps a quarter of a mile. At
many points there were neither elevators nor warehouses. I can recall driving
a horse which pulled the scantlings to the
site of the first elevator which was built at
Alexander, Manitoba, and which was, by the
way, one of the first elevators in that province. I also remember that when my father
was the grain buyer at that point he discovered, when he weighed out the grain in
the spring of his first year's operations, that
he was short a thousand bushels; and the
company made him pay. I can remember
him saying to my mother, "I'l not be short
next year." He was there for nineteen years
and I think that was the only shortage he
ever had. I was a young fellow at the time
and I think I heard the country point of
view far more forcefully than did the honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar). He was in the country too, but I do
not think this was as active an issue in his
day as it was in mine. I can remember my
father saying, "It's a cruel world. I gave the
farmers what I thought was fair and just
weight." As you know, when the grain was
weighed the handlers made an allowance of
two or three pounds a bushel for dirt and
weeds, and he allowed only three pounds
when he should have allowed about four. As
a result he lost money, but the next year I
think he allowed five pounds. The only
objection he raised during all those years
was this. He said, "You know, when I was
behind I paid for it, and when I was ahead
they profited by it."

Quite a feeling has been built up about
the Grain Board, with the real question concerning grading. In my day there was very
little difference between grades 2 and 3, and
a person did not have to put a great deal of
grade 1 into grade 3 to make the equivalent
of grade 2, and you made a profit or otherwise according to the prices of grades 1, 2
and 3, the contract grades. But this sort of
thing has been cleared up by various amendments that have been made to the Canada
Grain Act throughout the years.
Honourable senators, the Chief Commissioner of the Board of Grain Commissioners,
Mr. D. G. McKenzie, is a neighbour of mine
in Winnipeg. I knew his family in Brandon
as far back as September, 1895, when his
brother and I went to school together. I want
to assure you that Mr. McKenzie is still the
same honest, upright, smart farmer that he
was in those days, and it is a credit to Canada
to have such a man at the head of our Grain
Board. I also know something about Mr. R.
W. Milner, one of the commissioners, who I
believe is an expert in ironing out the difficult
problems that arise with respect to the distribution of freight cars. Mr. Milner is one
of the most experienced officials in our whole
grain set-up.
I make this speech for the purpose only of
supporting the honourable gentleman from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). I entirely agree
with what he says about the appointment. of
members of the Board of Grain Commissioners. The Government should always
appoint the men it thinks are best fitted for
the job, whether they be lawyers, farmeï·s,
artisans or anything else.
I must tell honourable senators a little
story about our systemý of marketing grain.
The first member of this house, His Honour
the Speaker, sometimes holds receptions to
which the representatives of foreign governments are invited. At one of these receptions
a year ago a gentleman representing a European country asked me where I came from.
Whën I told him I was from Winnipeg, he
said, "That is where we get No. 1 Manitobas."
I advised him that although Manitoba produced a fair amount, most grain came from
Saskatchewan and Alberta. He went on to
tell me that his government liked to buy
Canadian grain because there never was any
doubt -in their minds that when they paid
for grade 2 they would get it. He said that
the year before they had bought from Russia
some wheat which was supposed to be
grade 2, but in every carload there were
as many stones as there was grain. I thought
he paid a fine compliment to the Board of
Grain Commissioners.

SENATE

I am pleased that the honourable gentleman from Churchill intends, if this bill is
given second reading, to ask that it be
referred to committee for study. Grain is
one of the great basic products of our country
and bas a tremendous effect upon our
economy. It is all right to talk about the
oil industry of Alberta, the fishing industry
of the Maritimes and of the Pacific, the
manufacturing industry of Ontario and Quebec, and so on, but for many years grain has
been one of Canada's basic products. Damage
caused by rust, rain and frost has brought
about a general cut-back in prosperity right
across Canada.
I would like to see every member of the
chamber show a genuine interest in this
legislation. If we can acquire a good understanding of the marketing of grain we shall
be in a position to deal intelligently with any
ideas that are put forth in connection with
grain problems in general.
Honourable senators, I have great pleasure
in supporting this bill on second reading;
and I especially wanted to say a few words
about the two commissioners whom I know.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators, I
move that the bill be referred to the Standing
Committee on Natural Resources.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Honourable senators,
with great respect I submit that the appropriate committee for consideration of this bill is
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce. The bill relates to a marketing
problem and bas nothing to do with the basic
reasons for the existence of the Committee on
Natural Resources. This is essentially a Trade
and Commerce matter and should be referred
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce. Without any invidious references
to personnel, I submit that the membership of
the Banking and Commerce Committee is
better acquainted with this subject than is the
membership of any other standing committee
of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: I disagree. I think
the Standing Committee on Natural Resources
is better equipped to deal with this matter.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Why?
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: This bill has to do
with agriculture. Natural resources and agriculture are closely associated.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The bill has nothing to
do with that at all.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question is on the motion of Honourable
Senator Crerar, seconded by the Honourable
Senator Euler, that this bill be referred to
the Standing Committee on Natural Resources.
Is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: On division.
The motion was agreed to, on division.
PRIVATE BILL
SHARP & DOHME (CANADA)
SECOND READING

LTD.-

Hon. John J. Connolly moved the second
reading of Bill G-10, an Act respecting Sharp
and Dohme (Canada) Ltd.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to grant an effective filing date
of July 20, 1950, to Patent Application No.
672,036.
It might be helpful if I said something about
the prior history of this matter. On September 4, 1947 a patent application was filed in
the Canadian Patent Office, bearing No.
564,079, the subject-matter of which covered
certain chemical compounds for use in antibacterial therapy. I am informed that these
compounds, together with others to which I
shall refer later, are to be used for the treatment of gout and gouty arthritis and to increase the effectiveness of penicillin. The
inventors of the material covered in the
patent application were two gentlemen by the
names of Sprague and Beyer.
In 1950 a new discovery was made for
certain chemical compounds, including one
described in the patent application already
on file. The new material, which was also
used for the same general purposes, is sometimes called by the trade names of Benamid
and Remanden. The applicants claimed that
these new discoveries were based upon an
extension of the research work done for the
material for which the original patent application was filed. However, the inventors of
the new compounds were two gentlemen by
the names of Sprague and Miller. Sprague, of
course, was associated with both inventions,
but Miller was only connected with the second
branch of the research work, while Beyer
was engaged on only the first branch.
When the new invention was made, the
applicants could have proceeded in one of
two ways: they could have filed a new patent
application for the new material, or they
could have filed a supplementary disclosure

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I had expected two bills from the
House of Commons to come to us for first
reading today. One is the Supply Bill; the
other is a bill to amend the War Veterans
Allowance Act. It is quite important that
they should be passed before the end of the
fiscal year, particularly the Supply Bill. My
recollection is that the War Veterans Allowance Bill will come into effect on the first
day of the month following the day on which
the bill is assented to. So if it were given the
Royal Assent tomorrow, it would become
effective on Friday.
These bills will probably be before us tomorrow, and they could be dealt with in all
stages then if the motion that I have on the
Order Paper for suspension of certain rules
is carried. It occurred to me-and I have
been in consultation with the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)-that if Royal
Assent is to be given to the bills tomorrow
afternoon it might be advisable for the house
to meet at 2:30 instead of 3 o'clock. We could
meet in the morning, except that three or
four committees will be sitting then.
I would therefore move that when this
house rises today it stand adjourned until
tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 o'clock.
The motion was agreed to.

Hon. Mr. Gershaw, for Hon. Mr. Roebuck,

That the Parliamentary fees paid during the
session of 1950 upon the petition of Alberta Lomas

McLeod Archibald, of Westmount, Quebec, for a
bill of divorce, be refunded to the petitioner, less
the sum of $25 to apply on printing and other
costs.

He said: Honourable senators, may I explain
that the petitioner paid the Parliamentary
fee of $210 and did not proceed with the
petition.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Can the honourable senator
explain why so long a period elapsed before
a decision to refund the money was made?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: The request to have the
refund made was received quite recently.
Apparently the parties resolved their differences after the petition was filed.

SUSPENSION OF RULES
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved:
That Rules 23, 24 and 63 be suspended until and

jncluding 6th April, 1955, in so far as they relate
to public bills.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators,
while I have no strong objection to the
motion being passed, I would point out that
the War Veterans Allowance Bill, which I
understand proposes substantial changes by
way of increased payments and a different
basis for payments to war veterans, will
come to us tomorrow when, if this motion
passes, these rules will have been temporarily abrogated. There may be no serious
grounds for objection to the motion, but I
wish to make a protest, if I may call it
that, against the sending of this legislation
to us at so late a date. The bill could, I
think, have been considered and passed prior

to the day before it is sought to have it
brought into effect. In my humble opinion
the procedure adopted in this case is not a
desirable one.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Honourable senators, I
think it only fair to say that this particular
legislation had to be referred to the House
of Commons Special Committee on Veterans
Affairs, which naturally took some time to
study the suggested changes. That, I think,
was the main reason for the delay in our
receiving the measure.
The motion was agreed to.

officials of this house will make sure that
copies of the supplementary estimates are distributed in the same way as are the main
estimates. However, in fairness to the officers
of this house I should say that it was no
fault of theirs that there was an incomplete
distribution of the supplementary estimates
this year. But in future it will be up to
them to check and see that some other department does its work.
The bill before us provides for the payment out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund
of a sum not exceeding in the whole
$53,934,585, the details of which are set forth
in the schedule to the bill. This sum is to
cover expenses that have been incurred since
the regular estimates came down for the
current fiscal year.
Honourable senators will notice that the
schedule contains items of votes for the following departments and other bodies: Agriculture, Citizenship and Immigration, Civil
Service
Commission,
External
Affairs,
Finance, Fisheries, Justice, Labour, Legislation, Mines and Technical Surveys, National
Health and Welfare, National Research
Council and Atomic Energy, Public Printing and Stationery, Public Works, Secretary
of States, Transport, and Veterans Affairs.
These votes are for additional expenses incurred during the fiscal year 1954-55, over
and above the requirements estimated by
the departments.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Does this clear off all the
over-expenses?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes; this is supposed
to take care of all the expenses incurred by
the Government up to today.
Hon. Mr. Reid: But I said "over-expenses".
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: These items are overexpenditures in this respect, that they are
in addition to the amounts the various
departments expected to have to spend during the year 1954-55.
Honourable senators, these supplementary
estimates, which are set forth in detail in
the schedule to the bill, have received careful consideration by the members of the
House of Commons, and I now recommend
them to you for your favourable consideration.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my friend a
question? This point may not be very
important, but it is interesting to note that
in a number of the estimates for certain
departments an item of $1 appears. I am
surprised that a department would ask for
as little as $1.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is to keep the vote
alive.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If the honourable
senator from Waterloo will refer specifically
to any items I shall endeavour to get some
information on them.
Hon. Mr. Euler: On page 4 of the schedule,
for instance, there are two items of $1, one
at the bottom of the page and one at the top.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators
will naturally expect me to raise the old
question which I have raised so often, namely,
the delay in bringing the estimates before us.
While the Minister can say that later on the
main estimates of the departments come up
for consideration we shall be allowed to discuss the supplementary estimates, the difficulty is that some items now before us may
not appear again during the coming year.
Secondly, I would point out that in one
sense the supplementary estimates are really
more important than the main estimates,
for the supplementaries cover expenditures
which the government itself did not anticipate when it prepared its main estimates.
As this bill shows, the expenditures which
the Government did not foresee a year ago,
have amounted to roughly $54 million. Included in this sum is an item of approximately $28 million for the Canadian National
Railways, set out under Transport on page
9 of the schedule.
Ever since I have had the pleasure of being
a member of this house, and even long before
that, the problem of financing the Canadian
National Railways has been discussed in public during every election campaign, and frequently between elections. I recall that in
1936, soon after my appointment to this house,
the government of the day brought in a bill
respecting the Canadian National Railways,
and some sixteen of us on this side decided
that we would vote for the bill.
It was only about two sessions ago that
Mr. Donald Gordon, President of the Canadian National, appeared before a committee
of this house in support of a capital revision
bill to transfer $1 billion of the Canadian
National System debt to the backs of the
Canadian people. At that time I asked him
this straight question: "Mr. President, will
this be your last request, or will you be
coming back wanting more money from time
to time?" He replied: "Senator Haig, if this
bill passes and business remains normal, I
do not think we will have to come back to
you." Well, the Government and a great
many business men who like to boost things
have said that 1954 was a normal year, yet
we have the officials of the C.N.R. back asking
for a further vote of $28 million.
If I have correctly interpreted the press
reports of Mr. Gordon's evidence before a
committee of the other house, I gather that

MARCH
on the first day he appeared he refused to
divulge the price at which four C.N.R. hotels
were sold to private individuals, but the next
day he decided to give the figures. I feel
quite keenly about a situation of that kind,
because you and I and all the other people
who pay income tax in this country are
shareholders in that railway, and we are
entitled to know how its business is being
conducted. For the life of me, I cannot see
how the price at which those hotels were
sold could effect the overall picture of the
C.N.R., and why that information should be
withheld from the people of Canada. I think
it was just unadulterated nonsense for the
President of our railway to decline to give
the figures. As a matter of fact, as far as
the Prince Edward Hotel in Brandon was
concerned, I could have gone to the Land
Titles Office in that city and searched the
title. As honourable senators know, before
the transfer could be registered an affidavit
would have to be filed setting out the value
of the building and what it cost.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: What about the chattels in the building?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It would depend on whether
or not the chattels were included.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: But they would not
be shown in the affidavit in the Land Titles
Office.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I may not be a very good
business man, but I believe that transaction
had little effect on the overall financial position of the Canadian National Railways.
Further, during his evidence Mr. Gordon
was asked about the competition between his
railway and the Canadian Pacific. He was a
little uncertain as to what his road was
going to do by way of competing with the
fancy train the C.P.R. proposes to run
between Montreal and Vancouver. His evidence left this impression on my mind-and
I wasn't looking for such an impression-that
the C.N.R. was not going to be able to
compete favourably with the C.P.R. I am
not at all anxious that that should be the
case; indeed, I would be happy to hear him
say that the Canadian National is just as
good as the privately-owned road, and that
his transcontinental train will give as comfortable and efficient service as will be obtainable on the other line. This is a very
important matterto the people of Canada, and
there is no reason why we should not call
Mr. Gordon before a committee of this house.
While he has no doubt gone into the situation
thoroughly before a committee of the Commons, we too have a responsibility to look
into this question.

I say to honourable members that in my
opinion the request by the Canadian National
for more money is something that will recur
year after year. Indeed, I see no escape
from it. The railway has suffered a terrific
loss this past year, and Mr. Gordon has not
given the reason for it. I may be wrong, but
in my opinion the deficit was caused by the
failure of the Government to sell our grain
to the world, as it agreed to do; for as a
result the railroad lost much of the revenue
it expected to get. I think Mr. Gordon would
stand in better light if he put that reason on
the record. He does not need to be afraid of
the Government; certainly, if he shows
ability and judgment, they will not interfere
with his position as President of this railroad
system. I believe he bas all the ability necessary, but he seems to fear something. What
it is, I do not know. He hesitates to place
before the people of Canada the cold facts
about the railway and why it is now in
financial difficulties. We did not have such
bad times last year, and therefore there must
be some good reason why'he finds it necessary
at this time to ask for another $28 million.
As I have said, this bill shows that the
Government underestimated very materially
the expenditures on certain items. It is very
unfair to the Opposition parties to be confronted with total expenditures amounting
to $4,500 million. That is what they will
amount to, because we have to add this $54
million to the original estimate of $4,450
million.
Hon. Mr. Euler: My friend has made a comparison between the Canadian National Railways and the Canadian Pacific Railway. I
have ne particular brief for either of them,
although in the past I have been friendly to
the Canadian National Railways. I understood
my friend to say he had the impression that
the new train to be run by the Canadian
National Railways between Montreal and
Vancouver, April 24, will be an inferior type
of train to that provided by the C.P.R.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is the impression I
got from Mr. Gordon's evidence.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I must say that I never
saw anything to that effect in his evidence.
Another point: Is it not a fact that the
Canadian National Railways had a big
decrease in revenues this year, and that the
Canadian Pacific did also?
Hon. Mr. Haig:
Yes, but the Canadian
Pacific paid taxes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But its revenues also were
down.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The C.P.R. pays taxes, but
the C.N.R. does not. There is quite a difference

SENATE
between the two railways. If your business
is taxed and mine is free from taxation,
there will be quite a difference in the end
result.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I think you will find that
the Canadian National also pays taxes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, the C.P.R. pays taxes,
and its stock is selling at $29 a share on the
market.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is it not a fact that the
Canadian National pays taxes to the municipalities it operates in?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Only to municipalities, but
not to the dominion Government.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The Canadian National does not make a profit. If it made a
profit it would pay taxes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, but it never makes a
profit. Last year I raised this very question.
Last year it deliberately-I saw "deliberately"
-put the accounting in such a way that as to
show a surplus. There should have been a
deficit budgeted for last year, but somehow
or other it was transferred to the next year,
and this is the way it comes out.
My argument is that, whether there is a
profit or not, we, as members of Parliament,
should have the C.N.R. officers before one of
our committees and examine them as to the
facts of the case.
Hon. Mr. Euler: There is no objection to
that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: This bill should not have
been brought in here on the last day of the
fiscal year. It has to be passed today. It
should have been before us two or three
weeks ago.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is fair enough.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We are entitled to have
these things explained to us.
There are a number of items in this
schedule that I would like to discuss. I
am not in favour of spending so much money
as we are spending. For instance, though
I may be a minority of one in the matter, I
am not in favour of spending hundreds of
thousands of dollars to support the price of
butter and other commodities.
I do not
think the way to do this business is to sel
butter at 38 cents a pound when we pay 58
cents for it. You and I pay taxes out of
which 58 cents a pound is paid for this
butter, and somebody comes along and buys
it for only 38 cents. A similar situation exists
as to cattle. We made a deal for the sale
of cattle to Great Britain, and as a result
we are confronted with another $3 million
loss. Representatives of the Government

should be before us so that we could ask
them why they made a deal of that kind.
We senators should look into this. We are
paid a reasonably good salary, we have the
ability and time, and we should do what
we can to have such matters explained. But
we cannot do that if the supply bill is
brought in to us on the afternoon of the day
when we are expected to pass it. I am not
at all satisfied with this procedure. The other
supply bill that we shall have before us
a little later today is different. The items
in it can be reconsidered when we come to
deal with the main estimates, but there will
be no opportunity to reconsider some items in
the present bill. I refer especially to the
provision of money for the Canadian National
Railways and for the payment of a bonus
on production. Why should the people be
compelled to pay a bonus out of their earnings to enable the government to purchase a
product and sell it elsewhere at a much
lower price than it can be obtained for in
this country? That is a question I would like
to put to the minister.
These are matters which we should delve
into. They interest more especially the senators from cities. I come from a city, and a
decent city it is. The prices of the various
articles of food form a very important part
of the cost of living, of the labouring people,
and they would like to know why out of
their earnings they have to pay money
to the government for the purchase of products which are in turn sold at a loss to
Great Britain, New Zealand and other countries. Why, I would like to know, do the
people of Canada have to contribute taxes
to buy beef and butter so that people elsewhere can get these foods at lower prices?
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: You can blame
margarine.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. All the government has
to do is to leave the price of butter alone.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Isn't there unfair competition with margarine?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Quite honestly I did not
look at it in that light. I have been brought
up on butter and have used very little margarine, so I am not a good judge, but I do
say quite candidly that I would rather pay
twice as much for butter as for margarine.
The point I want to come back to is this:
We have got to pass the bill today, because
the Government has spent the money. I am
not questioning the honesty of the expenditures; I do not think that enters into it at
all. What I am complaining about is this way
of dealing with supply, for we have no
chance to question the people who are

MARCH 31, 1955
responsible for these expenditures. How can
we do that when the bill comes here on the
last day of March, the end of the fiscal year?
I would suggest to the honourable leader of
this house (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) that he
urge upon the Government, of which he is
a member, that next session the estimates
be sent to us in February, so that we may
be able to examine officials on the estimates
in our Committee on Finance. We have not
done very much work this session except on
the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes bill.
Had we been given an opportunity to study
these expenditures we could have done a
good job, and materially helped the Government in its administration.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
the question raised by the honourable Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) bas many
aspects, but I do not intend to deal with all
of them this afternoon. However, there is
one point to which I would like to draw
attention. It is that the Board of Directors
of the Canadian National Railway Company
is appointed by the Government to administer the railway property in the interest of
the public of Canada. Now, under our constitution the executive power is vested, not
in Parliament, but in the Government of
Canada. Section 9 of the British North
America Act states:
The executive government and authority of and
over Canada is hereby declared to continue and
be vested in the Queen.

Therefore the Government is accountablebut only accountable-to Parliament. It is
the duty of the Government to administer
public affairs as best it can. When estimates
are presented to Parliament, we may question
the good or bad judgment of the Government,
or ask for further information, but it is not
our function to give administrative directions
to the Government, or to the management of
the Canadian National Railways, which is an
agency of the Government.
If a Minister of the Crown in charge of a
department determines it is in the public
interest that some information should be
withheld, and so declares under his responsibility, then under the rules of debate in
the House of Commons and in this house,
that ends the matter. Therefore, when an
agency of the Government-in this case, the
management of the Canadian National Railways-is entrusted with the administration of
public property such as that of the Canadian
National Railways, in competition with a
privately-owned railway, and if in its discretion, on competitive grounds or otherwise,
it concludes that it would be against the
public interest to divulge certain administrative secrets or competitive factors that enter

into the day-in day-out operations of its
system, I hold that the management is justified in stating that it would not be in the
public interest to divulge such secrets, and I
believe it is the duty of members of both
houses to consider the matter from that angle.
I believe that the statement of the President
of the Canadian National Railways to the
Committee in the other place, that he would
give certain information and withhold certain
other information, cannot be discussed by
legislators, who are invested not with executive but only with legislative powers. It is
our right to inquire into the expenditure of
moneys voted by Parliament for the operation
of the Canadian National Railways, and in
this connection, as well as in matters relating
to sales or leases of properties which have
been made by the company, to ascertain
whether the management is trustworthy; but
unless we are prepared to challenge the trustworthiness of the management of the Canadian National Railways it would not be fair,
in my opinion, to require it to reveal competitive factors which enter into the execution
of the functions entrusted to its care. The
question is a constitutional one, and it bas
been frequently determined. In the House of
Commons the decision of a minister that it
would be against the public interest to
divulge certain information has never, to my
knowledge, been challenged; and if it were
desired to challenge it, the only recourse
would be by a motion of nonconfidence in
the Government.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Or by withholding the
money.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Having reference to the new
hotel which is being built in Montreal, and
in view of the fact that the Canadian National
Railways have asked Parliament to provide
between twenty and twenty-five million dollars to build it, should we not have the right
to ask the President of the company how the
money is to be spent, and what interest he
expects will be obtained on revenues from
the leasing of hotels?
Hon. Mr. Vien: The matter of the lease of
the Montreal hotel was debated earlier this
session, and I do not want to enter now into
that particular subject. If, in their managerial discretion, the administrators of the
Canadian National Railway Company deem it
expedient to lease the hotel instead of to
operate it themselves, that is a question into
which, I believe, Parliament should not
inquire.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not agree with that.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Vien: I am merely submitting my
own opinion on the subject, and with the
utmost deference to that of any honourable
member who may take a different view. If
it were expedient to discuss at this juncture
the situation with respect to the Montreal
hotel, I would do so with pleasure. It was
considered at the last session of Parliament
before a committee of the Senate. At that
time a number of people, including, I believe,
the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), were opposed to the
erection by the Canadian National Railways
of a hotel in Montreal. Others-and I am
one of them-believe that the decision of the
Canadian National Railway management to
build that hotel was a wise one; and I may
point out that, at the request of the honourable senator from New Westminster, very
extensive data as to the results of the operation of all these railway hotels were put on
the record.
Hon. Mr. Howden: May I ask the honourable senator whether it is not the general
belief that, with very few exceptions, the
entire hotel system of the Canadian National
Railways is operating at a loss?
Hon. Mr. Vien: If, by "loss", net loss is
meant, I would agree with that view. But if
the reference is to operating loss, I would say
that in many cases there is no such loss.
For instance, for years the Chateau Laurier
at Ottawa bas been operating at a very
substantial profit.
Hon. Mr. Reid: In that respect, I think, it
stands by itself.
Hon. Mr. Vien: If all fixed charges and
overhead expenses are taken into account, it
might be found that all the railway hotels,
including the Chateau Frontenac at Quebec,
are operated at a loss. But if only operating
expenses are considered, the Chateau Frontenac, the Chateau Laurier and other wellknown hotels are producing a net operating
revenue for either the Canadian National
Railways or the Canadian Pacific Railway.
Hotels operated by the C.N.R. play an important part in the overall operations of this
publicly-owned company. Much revenue is
derived directly and indirectly from their
existence. For one thing, they facilitate the
services of the Trans-Canada Air Lines. If
there were no Chateau Laurier in Ottawa for
instance, many people who now stop over in
this city would not do so, and thus substantial
amounts of revenue now accruing to the
C.N.R. would be lost.
It is the overall picture that must be considered and not just the operation of a single
hotel. You cannot put the operations of a
railway company into various watertight

compartments. You might say that the engine
of a train is a losing proposition because it
does not carry any passengers or freight.
Yet it pulls the cars which carry the passengers or freight. The same thing is true of
the railway system as a whole. A small
countryside station is not a revenue producer,
but it is an essential part of a railway system,
for it provides railway patrons with necessary
facilities. It may be felt that a hotel run by a
railway company does not in itself produce
much revenue, but it is a different matter
when you take into account the amount of
business for which it is indirectly responsible.
Another factor has to be taken into consideration when dealing with the hotel being
built in Montreal. It is a difficult thing for
an independent hotel to get the same sort of
patronage that is enjoyed by a hotel belonging to a hotel chain. The Hilton hotels have
purchased the Statler organization, and
now operate the largest chain of hotels
in the world. A patron of one of these
hotels in the United States intending to go
to Montreal has only to go to the hotel's
registration desk and make a reservation for
hotel accommodation in that chain's hotel in
Montreal.
If the railway-owned hotel in
Montreal is linked with Hilton, then all hotels
belonging to this chain will direct Montrealbound hotel traffic to this hotel.
One also has to take into account the
various conferences and conventions held in
these hotels. If, for instance, some important
American association has held its annual
convention in a Hilton hotel somewhere in
the United States this year and proposes to
hold its next convention somewhere in Canada, the Hilton people will do their utmost
to direct the association to a Hilton hotel in
Canada. This type of business is extremely
valuable to any hotel.
Honourable senators, I am simply giving
a few illustrations to support my point that
as members of Parliament we are hardly in a
position to challenge the managerial discretion of those who have been entrusted by
the Government to administer the operations
of the C.N.R. We are, of course, entitled to
receive information as to how this publiclyowned company spends the moneys which
are voted to it by Parliament, but I do not
believe we should challenge these officials
when they tell us they do not want to divulge
information that would be useful to their
competitors.
In performing our function as legislators
we should be very careful to restrict ourselves to the legislative aspect of questions
and not interfere with any executive power

MARCH 31, 1955
which, under our constitution, is vested, not
in Parliament, but in the Crown and its
agent.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable
senator a question? The first day Mr. Gordon
appeared before the House of Commons Railways and Shipping Committee he said that
for reasons of secrecy he could not disclose
the price paid the railway for the four hotels
sold last year, but the next day he gave the
figure. Why did he change his mind?
Hon. Mr. Vien: It is very understandable
that this sort of thing can happen when an
official such as Mr. Gordon is called before
a parliamentary committee. Could you expect
an executive officer of any large corporation
to have at his fingertips all kinds of information concerning the operation of an annual
business of some $250 million?
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is not it. In the first
instance Mr. Gordon refused to answer the
question at all. Why did he change his tune
the next day?
Hon. Mr. Vien: I do not know what particular question the honourable gentleman is
referring to.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The price paid the railway
for the four hotels it sold last year.
Hon. Mr. Vien: He may not have had the
information at his fingertips.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That was not his reason.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I am not competent to
answer my honourable friend, because I have
not seen the report of what was said. In any
event, I would say that nothing is scandalous
about a man changing his mind. If a question is put to a public official and he feels
the answer should be withheld, and if after
due consideration he feels the information
can be divulged without injury to the public
interest, Parliament should understand. If
rny honourable friend were to appear as a
witness before a parliamentary committee
he might be taken by surprise by some
question.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I interrupt? I
understand that when the question was asked
and he did not answer someone.told him that
the information could be obtained at the
Land Titles Office.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: When he was told
that, 1 think he answered the question. However, I do not thirik the information could
be obtained at the Land Titles Office.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In Manitoba it can be obtained from the Land Titles Office.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: You can obtain information with respect to the sales of land. For
a hotel that is sold, there is a price; if there
is a sale of land, there is another price; if
there is a sale of chattels, there is still
another price; and for goodwill there is an
additional price.
Hon. Mr. Haig: As a matter of fact, the
Brandon paper contained the whole information of what it was sold for. I could have
brought the information, if I had wanted to.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I am not familiar with the
facts concerning the matter to which the
honourable gentleman has referred. Also
I should point out that I am not raising the
question. It is being discussed in a committee of another place, and I do not think it
is a proper subject to be discussed here. However, perhaps I may be allowed to say my
information is to the effect that Mr. Gordon's
first answer was that it would not be fair
to the purchaser to reveal the price; but
that later, after learning that the deed of
sale had been registered he had no objection
to giving the information.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, I
do not intend to discuss either the sale or the
building of C.N.R. hotels, but I wish to make
this observation: I suspect that the reason
why the President of the Canadian National
Railways did not wish to disclose the price
received for the hotels was that he felt
under an obligation to the purchaser. If my
honourable friend the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) will take the trouble
to examine the matter I think he will
find that in the interval between two sittings of the committee Mr. Gordon obtained
the consent of the purchaser to disclose the
purchase price.
As to the hotel now being built in Montreal, it was under consideration in the Senate last session, when we approved an appropriation bill for the C.N.R.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The bill was not approved
by all of us, for it was passed on division.
I did not approve it.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I do not question that the
bill was passed on division, but is my honourable friend suggesting that the minority vote
should prevail?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am trying to keep the
record correct, that is all.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The bill may have been
passed on division, but we approved it, and
the Canadian National Railways were authorized to proceed with the building of the
hotel. However it is not my purpose to discuss that.

SENATE
I would like to draw the attention of the
house to one or two items in the supplementary estimates. Of course, the big item is the
amount required to meet the deficit of the
Canadian National Railways, but I think
other items invite comment. For instance,
under Vote 554 $2 million is included for
freight assistance on western feed grains.
Honourable senators, it may be that at the
end of the last session it was impossible for
the Government to determine within $2
million the amount required for the movement of feed grains, but I think it is very
important to maintain the principle, observed
by Parliament since days long past, that when
a government brings down its main estimates
it should provide for everything that it
believes to be reasonably required during the
next year. Formerly, supplementary estimates
were for relatively small amounts, in contemplation of a possible change of conditions,
and were introduced towards the end of the
session. As regards the supply bill that is
now before us, the main estimates were
known a year ago; extensive supplementary
estimates were brought in before the close of
last session; yet now, at the end of the year,
a further amount of $53 million is required.
In my judgment that is very poor estimating.
Reverting to the proposed subsidy on feed
grains: I think the time has arrived when
it should be discontinued. The provision for
assistance in the movement of feed grains
was a purely war emergency measure, with
which I had something to do. If subsidies
are given when they are no longer needed,
the habit of asking for them will become
fixed in our economy.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There was a change
this year with respect to the payment of
moneys for the movement of feed grains,
and a few weeks ago my colleague (Hon. Mr.
Godbout) explained the change in replying
to a question which was asked by the honourable member from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid).
Hon. Mr. Crerar: The honourable leader
may recall that the change was a reduction
of the amount of the subsidy.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: But the principle is unchanged. We continue to subsidize the movement of feed grains; and the fiscal year ends
tomorrow.
Honourable senators, I ask, is this necessary, and is it equitable? We pay the freight
on feed grains from the head of the lakes
to say, Sudbury. That helps all the feeders
in eastern Canada. If the western farmer

were put on a comparable basis, the movement of his hogs and cattle should be subsidized, so far as freight is concerned, for a
corresponding distance, because his prices are
governed by prices in eastern Canada. I
merely want to point out that it is so easy for
Parliament to fall into the habit of accepting
these things, and that once accepted they
become fixed and you can never get rid of
them. I do not think this is in accord with
sound principles.
The same reasoning applies to Vote 555.
That item represents the loss that the Agricultural Products Board has sustained, and
which, I believe, has something to do with
the importation of New Zealand butter. The
amount under this item to be provided from
the taxpayers' pockets is $278,494. Surely
the time is near when we should get away
from price supports, otherwise this practice
will spread and infiltrate our whole economy.
If a vote to support the price of butter is
justified, why not a vote for lumbermen, or
a subsidy for base metal or, as a matter of
fact, anyone else? The same arguments apply
to the Fisheries Prices Support Board, whose
operating losses last year amounted to
$744,000.
But I come back to the distinction I made
earlier in my remarks. These estimates
should be properly prepared in the first
instance. It is easy, but not commendable to
keep the main estimates down and come in
with supplementaries at the end of the year
to get what is needed.
There are, of course, occasions when supplementaries are necessary and I will give
one instance to illustrate the argument I am
trying to make.
Vote 562 contains an item of $600,000 for
the welfare of Indians. Now, I cannot conceive that any new circumstances have arisen
during the year which could not have been
foreseen, at any rate when we passed the
supplernentary estimates before the end of
last session. The Indian Affairs Branch of
the Department of Citizenship and Immigration knew in advance the requirements of our
Indian population. What happened is that
without having obtained the approval of
Parliarnent, the department went on and
incurred this further expense, and now comes
along and asks for $600,000 to meet it.
On the other hand, a vote which quite
properly cornes within the ambit of supplementary estirnates is item No. 581, for the
relief of the distress caused by that distortion
of nature known to us as Hurricane Hazel.
That event no one could have foreseen, and
on the basis of the principle I am discussing,
Hurricane Hazel vote is entirely justifiable.

MARCH 31. 1955
I have drawn the attention of the house to
these matters because I believe that we should
not depart very fair from the traditional
methods which have always been associated
with the practice of democratic government.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I
would like an explanation of item 556, page 2:
To provide assistance for the replacement of
mnaple production equipment-Further amnount required, $100.000.

Hon. Mr. Euler: The honourable senator
from. Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) can
explain that item.
Han. Cyrille Vaillancourt: Honourable senators, some fifteen years ago the importation
of maple products into the United States was
prohibited, and any shipments in transit were
stopped at the border. The United States
Government took this step because of the
presence of lead in the maple syrup. On
learning of this condition, the industry made
an ïnvestigation and discovered that the
maple sap when coming in contact with the
tînplate of the sap buckets picked up some
lead, which, it was supposed, got into the
syrup. Knowing what importance the health
authorities of various countries attach to the
presence of lead in food products, we in the
industry realized that we were faced with a
serlous situation. *Honourable senators must
know that no longer may tea be packed in
lead foul, noir can chocolate bars be wrapped
in lead foil, and similar precautions aire taken
in the packaging of other articles of food.
The solution of our problem lay in the use
of a different type of sap bucket. This meant
a very heavy loss for the farmers who were
faced with discarding their present type of
maple sap buckets. Discussions were held
with the governments of the United States,
Canada, Quebec and Ontario as to what steps
should be taken to avoid contamination of the
maple sap by lead from the buckets. After
discussions lasting two years, the conclusion
was arrived at that it would be absolutely
necessary to replace the present type of
buckets with buckets made of some other
material.
Experiments were conducted with buckets
made of different materials, including plastic,
paper, and so on, and as a result it was
decided that the best course was to replace
the tinplate buckets with buckets made o
aluminum. To have made that change im
mediately would have worked great hardshp
and so further conferences were held with
the governments of the United States, Canada,
Quebec and Ontario and it was finally decided
that the change-over would have to be made

within a period of ten years. The Government of Canada agreed to pay one-third of
the cost of the aluminum buckets, and the
provincial Governments agreed to pay onethird, so the farmers whose buckets are being
replaced have to pay the remaining third.
The vote under discussion is to provide the
Government with money to pay its share of
the cost of replacement.
In the past the farmers did not take full
advantage of the money voted by Parliament
for replacement of these buckets. If they
had done so the Government would have paid
out $1 million additional. As honourable
senators 'will realize, the farmers cannot be
expected to change over from. a long-establlshed custom in two or three years. It is
very difficuit to convince them that they
should replace their tinplate sap buckets. As
a matter of fact, in order to obtain complete
replacement it will be necessary for the
Government to extend the ten-year period
by another year. Since financial. assistance
was provided by the federal and provincial
Governments, some 17-5 million buckets out
of a total of 21 million have been replaced,
and if a subsidy is provided next year I
think the situation will be entirely corrected.
Then there will be no more lead ini the sap
and consequently no more lead in the bodies
of consumers.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Are the tin buckets being
turned in, to be exchanged for the other type
of buckets?
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: No, we are destroying the old buckets.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is what I thought.
Every farmer is replacing his old type tinplate buekets with aluminum buckets and the
Government is paying part of the cost of
these new buckets.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: Yes. The federal.
Government is paying one-third of the ýcost,
the provincial Governments are paying onethird, and the remaining third is being paid
by the producer.
It is exactly the same principle as is followed by the Government in providing funds
for the purchase of butter at a floor price and
for its storage. The Government also contributes to the cost of cold storage plants for
apples, cheese and other products. But the
maple products industry is not; asking the
Government to fix a floor price: ail that is
required is the provision of one-third of
the cost of new buckets. When yields have
been low this industry has neyer asked the
Government to pay it a subsidy. Ail that it
has asked for, and ail that is beîng given
in this vote, is a grant to help in replacing
unsuitable maple sap buckets.

SENATE
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I am very sorry that a few senators who
spoke to us a short time ago are not now
present, because in reply to their remarks
I wanted to say a word or two.
First, let me comment on the remarks of
the honourable senator from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Vien) concerning the Canadian
National Railways hotels question. I realize,
as he no doubt realizes, that there are certain
questions that it would not be good business
for the railroad management to answer. For
instance, they might be embarrassed by
inquiries as to the salaries that are being
paid to the staff. But on this question of
hotels I think Parliament would be well
advised to watch the attitude of the President of the C.N.R. In many men holding high
office one sees a tendency to refuse to members of Parliament information to which, in
my opinion, we are entitled. It is a fact
that last year I opposed the vote for the
construction of a Canadian National Railways hotel in Montreal. I differ in this matter
from the honourable senator from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien). I am one who believes
that hotel ownership by railway companies
is no longer justified, because it does not
fulfil the only purpose which would warrant
the building and running of hotels, namely
the provision of more business for the railroads. There was a time, in the early days
of this country, when a railway-owned hotel
existed in practically every town or city of
any size. But today people travel by bus
and car and airplane as well as by rail. I
wonder how much revenue will be obtained
by this hotel from the travelling public. And
if the purpose in building it is not to make
revenue, in Heaven's name let us know why
$25 million of the people's money is to be
spent in this manner. It may or may not be
the fact that the management is responsible
to the Government, but, after ail, we members of Parliament are responsible to the
people, and I think the people are entitled
to some information about so large an outlay
of public funds.
Let me point out-whether or not the
information may be divulged later-that no
one in Parliament has at this time any information as to the terms of the lease to a
United States company. My thought in this
respect is, if the hotel should fail to make
a profit, what guarantee will the Government
or the Canadian National Railways have that
interest will be paid? And if the return on
the principal is less than three per cent,
the project must be regarded as a dead loss.
So I repeat that as the people of this country
are putting up $25 million for the hotel, they
are entitled to know what security the

Government has for the payment of interest
on the property. Mr. Donald Gordon has
taken the stand that this information should
not be disclosed. I differ from him, and I
am sorry that the estimates now presented to
us cannot be sent to a committee, where we
might ask him this particular question.
Reverting to some remarks of the honourable member from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar), I must admit my astonishment that
anyone from the prairie provinces objects to
subsidies on wheat. Not much objection was
heard to a subvention of some $65 million a
short time ago to the prairie provinces,
although I am sure that people living in
other parts of Canada did not much relish
the transaction. I think the policy of the
prairie producers should be to make it easy
to market their wheat. I serve notice now
that at the proper time I shall be very critical
about a condition of affairs under which men
who run turkey and poultry ranches cannot
use their own wheat in their own business.
We have set up in this country the greatest
combine Canada bas ever known, yet
little is said about it. As a result, a very
man
who grows wheat in one of the prairie provinces cannot use it to feed his poultry elsewhere, and the Canadian National Railways
will not haul it until a permit is received
from the Wheat Board. I know of cases
in which men bave been prevented from
obtaining wheat in payment of a debt.
As
a matter of fact, to my knowledge at least
half a dozen people in British Columbia who
had sold their prairie farms, and had undertaken to take wheat from the purchasers
feed flocks of turkeys as large as five to
or
maybe ten thousand-and one British Columbian carries a flock of something like 20,000have been forbidden to draw wheat from
their
own farms for feed purposes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I wish to say a word in
justice to my desk-mate, the senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). I believe he
has just been criticizod in connection with a
subsidy of $65 million to the farmers of
Western Canada. Does not the senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) know that
the honourable senator from Churchill voted
against that contribution?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Well, my reference was not
personal; I did not direct my remarks at him.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: He was in the minority.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Just think what a great
combine this is. I well remember that, when
members of British Columbia poultry associations wrote to me, as a member of Pariament, to the effect that unless I supported
the control of wheat marketing by a federal
board, at least 5,000 of their members would

MARCH 31, 1955
vote against me. I told them that they would
regret their attitude, that they were being
led up the wrong path by some very fancy
speakers. Last year I had the doubtful pleasure of speaking on this matter to some
poultrymen who are now complaining that
they are required to pay a very high price
for a very inferior grade of wheat. However,
I will enlarge on these remarks at the proper
time.
I rose particularly to protest, on behalf of
the poultrymen of British Columbia, against
any interference with the subsidy from which
they are now benefiting. After all, what was
the reason for it? It began during the war.
All of us recollect the conditions. The Government wanted an increase in the production
of eggs, poultry, and every agricultural prodduct; and subsidies were provided to encourage the production of wheat and the supplying of feed grains to the West and clear
across as far as the Maritimes. Of course,
when people have come to rely on a crutch
of that sort it is hard to withdraw it. One
could instance a dozen items of the same
kind. But we in this country have reached
a very serious position when the Liberal party,
the party of free enterprise, commits itself
to the maintenance of such combines as we
find in the three prairie provinces. The whole
thing is wrong, and needs a great deal of
investigation.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I believe there is a test
case at present before the courts.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is so, but I am speaking in generalities because I do not want to
seem to interfere with any case on which a
judgment may be pending.
I should also like to know whether the
$58,000 included in the estimates of the
Clerk of the House of Commons has to do
with our elevator service. The service in
fact is nothing to boast about. In my opinion
the new elevators are slower and less efficient
than the old ones. Would the honourable
leader explain that item?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I had intended to
answer all questions when I close the debate.
Hon. George H. Ross: Honourable senators, a year ago we voted a subsidy of $17
million for freight assistance on western
feed grains. Today we are being asked to
vote another $2 million for the current year,
and for the next year commencing tomorrow we are being asked to vote a further
$15,500,000 subsidy on feed grains. I agree
with the honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) that in the interest
of economy this subsidy should be done
away with.

During the last war many controls were
introduced and the payment of many subsidies provided for. They were necessary
during the war and were intended to be of
a temporary nature. Since the war many
of them have been discontinued. In my
opinion, in the interest of economy more
of them should be discontinued; for example,
the payment of freight assistance on western
feed grain.
In giving my reasons for believing that
these payments ought to be discontinued I
think I should state the circumstances under
which the Government decided to pay freight
on feed grains shipped from Fort William
to the Eastern provinces and from Calgary
and Edmonton to British Columbia.
In the year 1941 we had in Canada a surplus of wheat and a shortage of meat and
dairy products. In that year farmers were
bonused to the extent of $4 an acre for each
acre by which they reduced . their wheat
acreage. We were then engaged in a hot
war. Throughout the war, as at present, the
Government kept a close check on agriculture right across the country. . The bonus of
$4 an acre was paid to maintain a balanced
diet, particularly for the armed forces and
those actively engaged in producing munitions. I will quote the words of the Minister
of Agriculture, the Right Honourable Mr.
Gardiner, in sponsoring the bill:
There are certain products that ought to be
produced this year to greater volume than you
have been producing them before. We want more
butter; we want more cheese; we want more hogs;
we want more cattle, and if we are going to be
able to produce these products in Canada we
must have more feed grain . .. Wheat is a product
which will keep for a long term of years. It
will be just as good as a food three or four years
from now as it was when it was grown. 1941
Hansard, p. 3512.

The bonus was accordingly paid. As a
result of this policy, dairy and meat products
rapidly increased. The Minister of Agriculture was also authorized by Order in Council P.C. 5434, passed under the provisions of
the War Measures Act, to pay freight assistance on western wheat, oats, barley, rye
and mill feeds transported from Port Arthur,
Fort William and Armstrong to any part
of Eastern Canada for use exclusively as
feed in Canada for livestock. Shortly afterwards a similar provision was made under
P.C. 6387 for shipments from Calgary and
Edmonton to any part of British Columbia.
They were introduced as temporary measures.
Under these Orders in Council, Canada has
been paying freight charges on such shipments. Up to the end of the last fiscal
year, ending on the 31st of March, 1954,
Canada paid $207,165,850 freight on such
shipments or approximately $6.16 a ton. The

SENATE
reason for paying this subsidy was stated
by Mr. Gardiner in these words:
Last winter the eastern provinces, particularly
the Maritimes, asked us to give some assistance in
the bringing of feed grains from Fort William.
A little later on, the provinces of Quebec and
Ontario became involved in the discussion.
In
the first instance we did agree to pay half the
freight on feed grains from Montreal to the Maritime provinces, but that was not considered satisfactory. The other two provinces were brought
into the discussion, and we finally offered to pay
the freight on feed grain from Fort William to
all the five Eastern provinces. After we had made
that offer, much to our surprise, the only province
that took it up was Ontario, which perhaps needed
it the least. 1941 Hansard. p. 3520.

At a later date he said:
We are paying
to points in all
going west from
Columbia to be
Hansard, p. 3036.

the freight from Fort William east
the provinces east, and on grains
Calgary and Edmonton to British
used for feeding purposes. 1942

For the fiscal year commencing April 1,
1955, the subsidy is reduced from $19 million to $15,500,000, as shown in the Estimates,
p. 122. Now that the hot war is over it
seems to me that no further freight assistance should be voted and that the item
should be deleted from the estimates.
The honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) has suggested that
the payment of this subsidy is providing a
market for our grain. It is not helping the
prairie farmers one bit in so far as the price
of grain is concerned. The farmers have to
sell their grain on the world market. If the
Government wishes to assist the farmers of
the prairie provinces let them pay the prairie
farmers a similar subsidy-that is, $6.16 a
ton-on grain they feed to livestock. If it
is necessary to raise more livestock let the
Government pay the farmers of the prairie
provinces that subsidy, and they will produce
more livestock. They can do it just as well
as the farmers of the other provinces. Furthermore, all farmers in Canada are being
taxed to pay this subsidy.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Al Canadian citizens are
taxed for that purpose.
Hon. Mr. Ross: Yes.
Hon. Mr.
farmers".

Euler:

My

friend

said

"all

Hon. Mr. Ross: All Canadians are being
taxed to pay this subsidy. The farmers of
the prairie provinces are being taxed as well
as the farmers of the other provinces, and
it is not sound economic policy to tax an
industry in one province in order to pay a
subsidy to its competitors in another province. That is in effect what this tax is doing.
We are taxing the prairie farmers to pay a

subsidy to the farmers in the other provinces
who are competitors in raising livestock.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is not one class of farmer
that is being taxed. Everyone in Canada is
contributing.
Hon. Mr. Ross: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is not the farmers alone.
Hon. Mr. Ross: The farmers are being
taxed as well.
Honourable senators, in the interests of
economy, I submit that this subsidy should
be done away with.
Hon. Joseph A. Bradelte: Honourable senators, when the honourable senator from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross) and the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) say
that the subsidy on western feed grains is
of no assistance to the farmers in the West
and should be abolished, I do not know on
what basis they can support their argument.
About four years ago there was no kind of
crop in the northern Ontario clay belt from
Hearst to Cobalt; the grain was left on the
ground and we could not gather it for harvest.
It is hard to visualize the seriousness of the
situation as it existed then. We have been
trying to widen the scope of agriculture in
northern Ontario for some years, and with
that purpose in mind a delegation, of which
I was a member, went to the Department of
Agriculture. We tried to impress the department with the fact that we should get the
same help as the western provinces were
already receiving, but that there was no legislation to provide for it. We also asked for a
further reduction in freight on grain going to
the coast, so as to relieve our serious situation,
but the request was not granted.
Like most members of this chamber, I think
subsidies should be done away with as quickly
as possible, but when they are necessary it is
vital to retain them. When subsidies are discussed we must think nationally and not
parochially. It is a fact that when the farmers
of northern Ontario or northern Quebec suffer
a bad crop situation the rest of the farmers
of Canada to some extent also suffer the consequences. I am of the opinion that this subsidy is one of the best ever voted, and that it
has helped our farmers and stimulated the
growth of industry both in northern Quebec
and northern Ontario. Western producers of
coarse grains and feed wheat have been provided with a profitable market in the eastern
provinces and also in British Columbia. I
venture to predict that if the assistance they
now receive were removed, a good domestic
market would be lost.

MARCH 31, 1955
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, titis
debate seerns to be on the question of whether
the farmers of western Canada are getting
too much, or whether the farmers of northern
Ontario are flot getting enough.
As a humble citizen of Ontario, representing citizens of Ontario, I would like ta have
a word ta say, because, after ail, subsidies
corne out of the taxes which are paid by the
people of Canada, and I think the greater
proportion cornes frorn the people of Ontario
and Quebec.
Hon. Mr. Bradette: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: In principle, I arn absolutely
opposed ta subsidies. I arn opposed ta even
the Crowsnest Pass Agreernent, which is
really a subsidy ta reduce freight rates. However, I arn in favour of carrying out the terms
of an agreement. I think the western farmers
should realize that they are getting a great
deal of money because the C.N.R. have ta
charge rates so low that we in the eastern
provinces have ta help pay the lasses.
Hon. Mr. Ross: It is a profitable 'business for
the railways.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It would be more profitable
if they were able ta charge proper rates
across the country. I do not like discrimination between one class and another. I have
every sympathy for the farmer, but I do not
think farmers have any more right--except
in an ernergency-to a subsidy than people
inx any other Une of business have. There is
distress in aur manufacturing industries inx
Ontario, and I think also in Quebec. Sometimes aur manufacturers-for reasons I will
flot discuss here-are unable ta export their
goods because costs are too high. Must we
subsidize ail aur manufacturers for that
reason?
Hon. Mr. Ross: We are doing it with high
tariffs.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I think the principle of subsidies is absolutely unsound. They are given
ta favoured people. I rnay get into hot water
for saying this, but I think goverrnents are
unduly given ta subsidizing the farmer. I
have nothing against the farmer, but I think
he has becorne the "favourite boy" in this
country, and perhaps in other -countries as
well. I do nat like favouritisrn as between
one industry and another. I realize that inx
Urne of war we have ta adopt rneasures that
are abnarrnal, but as soon as possible after
the war'ends ail such measures should be
dropped. Except in an abnarrnal situation, I
think we should wipe subsidies dlean off the
rnap, because ta grant thern is an unfair discrimination against the taxpayer.
50437-25

Hon. Mr. Beaubien: What about a tariff, is
that a subsidy?
Hon. Mr. Euler: No.
Hon. John P. Hawden: Honourable senators, 1 arn in agreemnent with the honourable
senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler). I
was born in the east, but grew Up in the
west, and I consider myself ta be a western
man. I arn thoroughly in sympathy with the
interests of western Canada. I think we
shauld get the right idea about titis subsidy.
The western farrner graws a great deal of
barley, wheat and oats, but particularly
barley and wheat. Barley is used in Canada
for certain purpases, and the Government
saw fit ta pay a subsidy o! 15 cents a bushel
an the freight rate frorn western ta eastern
Canada, because the eastern farrner was not
able ta even feed his awn pigs and cattie
for market. The western farmer greatly
resented that subsidy, and 1 think lie had a
right ta do so. It is senseless ta say there
should not be anirnasity between eastern and
western groups in Canada.. The basis of business is competition, in every activity or
industry. The western farmer has been at a
decided disadvantage in the matter o! subsidies. Therefare, I arn not inx favaur af thern.
Hon. Mr. Bradelle: The subsidy of which
you spoke did nat caver the whole of the
frelght charges.
Hon. Mr. Howden: It was actually 15 cents
a bushel an the price of barley.
Hon. Mr. Bradette: No, it daes not work
that way.
Hon. Calveri C. Pratt: Hanourable senators, nat being frorn either Ontario or the
prairie provinces, rnay I, nevertheless, say
a word or two on this delicate subi ect of
subsidies? I wish ta refer first ta what has
just been said about subsidies as a general
policy. It is very easy for a persan ta sayas was said a marnent ago-"lI amn not inx favour of subsidies." That could be logical thinking but illogical practice. In theory, my honourable friend might be right, but theories
give a poor living. In practice, subsidies can
be construed, and can be applied, as an equalizatian of opportunity by a payment for indirect benefits which others are denied. Inx
geographical areas where people contribute
proportionately more ta other provinces than
they receive, by trading with those other
provinces, subsidies ta equalize trade andf
opportunity are no doubt necessary. Then
again, aren't protective tariffs on industry
a subsidy? The only difference is inx the formi
of payrnent made by the people. For instance,
the province o! Newfoundland, the province
o! Prince Edward Island, and rnaybe ather
provinces, are exemples of what occurs

SENATE
when the preponderance of trade is one way
only. Practically no trading benefits come to
Newfoundland from the other provinces, and
my province has to sell elsewhere in the
competitive markets of the world to get the
money required to pay for purchases made
in the other parts of Canada. Such a situation, I think, requires subsidies of one kind
or another, depending on the conditions. To
say that subsidies should be wiped out may
sound feasible in theory, but it is entirely
wrong in ethical principle, as between provinces.
I should like to refer to one item in the
supplementary estimates before us pertaining to the movement of coal, which appears
on page 6 of the bill. The vote number is
591, and the amount is $1,604,000. It comes
under the heading of "Mines and Technical
Surveys," and is sub-titled "B-Dominion
Coal Board." The item reads as follows:
Payments in connection with the movements of
coal under conditions prescribed by the Governor
in Council.

foreign competition.
The areas of Newfoundland where this subvention is required
most are where the price of coal is highest,
and where the people can least afford to pay
the highest prices. However, passing over
that, I would say this, that there is a distinct
possibility and a likelihood that vessels will
be bringing in foreign coal to St. John's, and
perhaps some other ports, and local vessels
will be loading this outside coal, and as a
result Sydney will be by-passed. That is
a possibility, and I am told by people in the
industry that it is very likely to happen.
In Newfoundland we have a different condition too because most of the coal, I think
more than 50 per cent of it is handled by
small freighting schooners and is taken from
one place to another. These schooners can
go to Sydney at the present time; in fact
there is a constant flow of the vessels in
and out of Sydney, but I can foresee the
possibility that Sydney Mines will be bypassed and not continue making as substantial shipments as it has made in the past.
This $2.40 subsidy has suddenly been withdrawn and at the moment there is no subsidy
whatever paid on coal from Sydney Mines
brought into Newfoundland, although provision has been made annually in the estimates for something like $10 million susbidy
for the movement of coal in Canada. I
think that is a matter that should be more
closely considered on its merits and in the
light of the special circumstances involved.
I am not speaking now to defend the principle of subsidies and subventions as a
general policy, but it is a policy under whi.ch
scores if not hundreds of millions of dollars
are paid out, and while that is so justice
should be done.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: May I ask the honourable senator a question? I would like to
know if Newfoudland does not receive some
benefit from item 584, which provides for
the amount required to recoup the Fisheries
Prices Support Account to cover the net
operating loss on completed programs of the
Fisheries Prices Support Board as at March
31, 1955, the amount required being $744,382.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: Yes, that is undoubtedly
a payment which is made to assist the fisheries
industry in Newfoundland.

I realize that this item in the schedule
was introduced as a protective measure for
places in the central areas of Canada where
United States competition in the sale of coal
is acute and undoubtedly has a marked effect
on the coal industry and labour situation in
Cape Breton. The subsidy is therefore
highest where coal is cheapest. There are
some areas where coal is very, very cheap
and where the subsidy, I understand, runs
as high as $4.50 a ton.
Honourable senators, Newfoundland has
been a buyer of coal from Sydney Mines
as long as there has been a Sydney mine.
The purchases have been running of late
around 200,000 to 250,000 tons yearly. The
condition of the coal as it arrives in Newfoundland is somewhat inferior to the coal
that can be purchased from sources in the
United States. This occurs by reason of the
facilities for loading on board ships, during
which the coal becomes badly broken, some
of it being reduced to dust. The coal therefore is not as well screened as when
delivered by railway cars.
Now it does not seem right that that
subvention or assistance on coal should be
cancelled out as applying to Newfoundland.
The subsidy recently in force for a period
amounted to $2.40 a ton.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: But you would like to

Honourable senators, I am not too sure ing coal to Newfoundland as to elsewhere.
that that is a broad enough view to have on I would like to see the subsidy paid out

MARCH si, 1955
which, may flot be applicable to the whole
need and the special circumstances.
Hon, Mr. Aselline: That is what I thought
you meant.
Hon. J. Wesley Siambaugh: Honourable
senators, as a western farmer I would like
to make a few remarks with regard to these
subsidies. One point that I wanted to, make
has been covered by the honourable senator
frorn St. John's West (Hon. Mr. Pratt). I
agree with hlm that subsidies often provide
just an equalization of opportunity.
Now, honourable senators, I know that
mnany western farmers would like to see the
freight subsidies on feed grains wiped out,
because these special freight rates actually
subsidize our competitors, the eastern fariners
who are raising hogs and cattie. We in the
west have to ship our stock to the east, ibecause
our market is there. In order for us to get
similarly favourable treatment, we should
have the benefit of special freight rates on
our stock going east.
Speaking for myseif, as a western tarner, I
do flot begrudge these subsidies to the eastern farmers. To repeat: they provide an
equalization of opportunity. We can raise
grain i western Canada more cheaply than
it can be raised in the east. Most eastern
farmers are dairy farmers, and I know they
work very hard, and put in long hours.
The western farmers subsidized the people
of eastern Canada in their food supply for
over three years during the war. Every
time that some of you overweight gentlemen down here in eastern Canada ate a sluce
of bread or a piece of pie or cake, one big
bite out of that was given to you free by the
western farmers, because we were held down
to, a price for our grain much less than we
would have received had we been ailowed
to seli on the open market. At the time I did
not even mind that, but when you saine
gentlemen get up and tell us about the way
you subsidized us and made us a gift of
$65 million, you add insult to injury and you
make me think that perhaps we ted you too
well in those three years. It has been fairly
figured out that the western farmers lost
upward of a 'billion dollars 'by not being
allowed to seli their wheat on the open
market. However, we are used to making
our money the hard way. We do not mind
too much teeding the people of Central
Canada and preventing the grass from growing on their streets ýby 'buying their manutactured articles and keeping their factories
going, but we do thlnk: we should be thanked
for doing this, and not crlticized.
So, honourable senators, 1 would say this.
We are glad to allow our eastern friends
50437-25J

these subsidies on teed grains. I know they
need them and I believe they should be kept
up. I realize that we in the West help to pay
them, and that we are building up a market
which. to some extent operates against us.
In closing, I would like to suggest to honourable senators who oppose subsidies on
teed grain that they should train their guns
on other subsidies. For instance, we are giving millions to subsidize the operation of
gold mines.
Hon. W. Rupert Davies: Honou-rable senators, I arn not going to get mixed up in this
fight. Many years ago I heard the Right
Honourable Mackenzie King state, in the
course of a speech at a public meeting, that
Canada was a very bard country to govern.
After listening to the discussion this atternoon, I assume that hie was right. I simply
got up to ask the honourable leader of this
bouse (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) a question about
a matter that I know something about, under
"Public Printing and Stationery," items 598
and 599. Can the honourable leader (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) teli us, when he is answering
the various questions, why a turther amount
of $55,000 is required for the publication of
the Canada Gazette? Assuming there is a
very able man in the estimates department
of -the Printing Bureau, he should be able
to tell, at the beginning of the fiscal year,
what it is going to cost to produce the Canada
Gazette; and I arn not quite clear why the
additional amount of $55,000 is needed.
Again, under "Printing and binding the
annual statutes" a turther amount of $6,500
is required. The only conclusion I can corne
to is that the Bureau bas had to face higher
wage demands or something of that kind.
Perhaps the leader wili explain these matters
when he answers the other questions that
have been asked.
Hon. Arthur W. Raebuck: Honourable
senators, I should like to say a word before
the debate is closed. Having been busy elsewhere, I arn not in a position to argue this
question of subsidies, but I could not aliow
the occasion to pass without stating my position, lest anyone should mistake it, with
regard to subsidies. AIl my life I have
objected to the granting of subsidies to the
manufacturers in our cities. I corne tram a
city; I arn a free-trader; and I do not believe
in charging people more than commodities
are worth ln order that one man shaîl pay
profits to another. In the saine general way
I arn opposed to, subsidies. It may be that
there are limes when, on compassionate
grounds, or under very special circumstances,
such as in time of war, it is fair and honest
and decent ta ask the taxpayers generally ta

SENATE
pay something to particular classes which are
contributing in a special way to the common
good. But to make a practice of taking from
one business a portion of its profits to make
up the profits of another business is, in my
view, dishonest, uneconomic and disastrous;
and if we go on doing it we shall run into
serious economic and financial difficulties.
The country can stand a little of this kind
of thing without too much hurt, but if the
process goes deep enough it will, beyond all
question and with absolute certainty, run
into disaster.
It is difficult to attack any one specific
subsidy, because the beneficiaries, who depend
on their profits on other business, will say
"Look at this one; look at the other one."
The farmer will tell us to look at the manufacturer. The manufacturer will point to
favours to the gold-mining industry. The
gold miners will ask us to look at some other
interest. Al of them have got their probosces
in the public or the communal treasury. The
use of the Government's power to interfere
in the natural order of things works out badly
all the time.
Let me recall one incident. It will be
remembered that the Government interfered
in the matter of the value of money. It was
stated that our money should be worth so
much in relation to American money, irrespective of the facts, and we poured a billion
and a half dollars down the drain. And so
we go on, poking the nose of the Government
into places where it has no business to be,
and with the same results-loss, and disaster,
and the dishonest exercise of our powers over
other people.
I want to add that I voted against the $65
million grant that has been referred to. I do
not propose to argue this matter again, but
I want it thoroughly understood that I have
had no part in approving the payment of that
grant.
There is one more thing I should like to say
before I sit down. I am not really taking
part in the debate; I am merely stating my
position. The honourable senator from De
Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien), in his comments
with regard to the constitution, read from
the British North America Act to the effect
that the Government of Canada is vested in
the Queen, and he drew from that circumstance the deduction that the business of our
country is to be transacted by the executive.
That is true enough; and there is a special
rule which allows a minister to say that it is
not in the public interest to give certain information: it is out of order to try to compel
him to do so. For instance, were a resolution
passed that, notwithstanding such a declaration by a minister, he be required to give

that information, the Speaker would rule it
out of order. But in my judgment, that rule
does not in any way curtail the rights of
debate, the right of the individual to question
an amount and to declare his mind with
respect to it; and furthermore, to enforce his
views by voting, if he so desires, against the
appropriation. In this matter the supremacy
of Parliament is involved, and that supremacy
was in the first place acquired, and throughout the years has been maintained, by control
over the purse-strings. So, although my honourable friend from De Lorimier is thoroughly
acquainted with constitutional matters and
the rules of the house, I cannot, because I am
jealous of the rights of Parliament, agree with
him when he says that such a statement by a
minister in any way controls the limits of
debate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
if the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) speaks, he will close
the debate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I am sure that this has been a very helpful
debate. Considering the very short time at
our disposal, we have gone into the estimates
thoroughly. The debate proves that honourable senators have studied the Supplementary
Estimates before coming into the house.today.
I quite agree with the honourable Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) that it
would have been much better had we been
able to have this debate two or three days
ago. Last year, which was the first year I
was a member of this house, the honourable
gentleman reminded me that a similar bill
had come to the Senate too late for thorough
consideration. On that occasion I stated I
would do what I could to have the bill come
in earlier this year. Well, I think I started
off all right. I saw the appropriate minister
about it, and he introduced the bill in the
House of Commons a week ago tomorrow.
From my experience I recall that this
appropriation bill was usually introduced in
the House of Commons on the last day of
the fiscal year, which meant that the Senate
had practically no time at all to consider it.
The fact that the bill has not reached us until
today is not the fault of the Government, but
I am not blaming anyone. Probably next
year the minister may be able to introduce
the bill in the other house even earlier than
he did this year.
Honourable senators, we have had a discussion about the operation of the Canadian
National Railway and its hotels. I do not
intend to deal with that subject any further.

MARCH 31, 1955
There is no doubt that both the hotel management and the Government will be made aware
of what has been said here today, and
whether or not it will affect the administration of the railway I cannot say. In any
event, I am sure that the Government will
take notice of what has been said during this
debate.
We have had a very interesting discussion
on subventions, some honourable senators
speaking in favour of them, and others
against. There was a discussion on the
subsidy of feed grains, during which one
honourable gentleman from Western Canada
advocated the subsidy be abolished, while
another said that by all means it should be
maintained. I am sorry that my deskmate,
the honourable gentleman from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Godbout), is not here at the present
time, for he is an expert on the subject of
subsidies and made a very clear statement
when replying to a question that was asked
earlier in the session by the honourable
gentleman from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid).
I think it was my honourable colleague
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) who said
he did not understand why there should be
an increase in the subsidy on feed grains
over the amount placed in the original
estimates. The fact is that more grain was
shipped than had been anticipated. It is very
difficult to estimate these expenditures right
down to the last dollar. My recollection is
that the original estimate was $16 million,
and this is for an extra $1 million.
Hon. Mr. Ross: The original estimate was
$17 million.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: And this is an extra
$1 million.
Hon. Mr. Ross: $2 million.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Well, roughly speaking, that represents an increase of about 12
per cent. In some instances, although not in
many, the original estimates were over the
amount required. I am sure we are al
agreed that the departmental officiais who
submit these estimates do so to the best of
their ability, and that by and large they do
a good job.
Reference was made to the floor price-one
might call it a subsidy-on butter. The
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig), thought there should be no floor
price on butter, so perhaps I should remind
the house that the farming population is one
section of our population whose income has
notably dropped during the past year. This
has had an effect on our dairy farmers, and

as a result the dairy industry is not in a
sound position today. I am convinced that
if the floor price were removed from butter
it would be disastrous to many farmers and
would bring about a chaotic condition in the
dairy industry. It is true that some people
might get butter a little cheaper, but do you
think it would be in the best interests of
Canada to put many dairy farmers out of
business? I certainly do not think so.
The honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) referred to a further
amount required with respect to operation
and maintenance in the Indian Affairs
Branch. The Government is endeavouring to
do what it can to enhance the lot of Canada's
Indians, many of whom suffer from tuberculosis, but before their health can be
improved it is necessary to build them hospitals and improve their general living condition. This item was not foreseen when the
Main Estimates were brought down, but I am
sure we all approve of any effort made to
better the lives of Canada's Indians.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: This is certainly a
justifiable expenditure.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The honourable
gentleman from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) asked a question with respect to the
legislative grant to the House of Commons.
He wanted to know if the money was for
the new elevators in the main building. The
Main Estimates for the House of Commons
for 1954-55 amounted to $1,250,777. There
were additional Supplementary Estimates
totalling $58,000, making the total amount
required $1,308,777. The amount of $58,000
includes an additional $50,000 for the publishing of debates. By way of explanation, I suppose the officiais of the house miscalculated
the length of the debates, and there have
probably been some wage increases. There
are further additional requirements of $3,500
for office stationery, supplies and equipment,
and $4,500 for committee expenses, for witnesses, etc. The honourable senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), who is
Chairman of the Special committee on the
Narcotic Drug Traffic, will appreciate that
as a result of the work of that committee
there may be some unforseen expenses in
connection with witnesses and so on.
The honourable senator from St. John's
West (Hon. Mr. Pratt) referred to the subsidies which had been taken off coal movements to Newfoundland. I shall bring his
representations to the attention of the government. My recollection is that while some
ports could take advantage of the subsidies,
other ports could not, and it was thought that
to be fair the subsidies should be taken off

SENATE
altogether. However, as he has raised the
question, I will see that it is again considered.
The honourable senator from Kingston
(Hon. Mr. Davies) asked me a question with
respect to Votes 598 and 599. Vote 598 covers
a supplementary estimate by the Department
of Public Printing and Stationery for the
printing and binding of the annual estimates,
in the amount of $6,500. The original estimate was, of necessity, conjectural, being
dependent on the extent of the legislation,
on the length and number of pages of the
statutes enacted, and on the number of copies
printed and bound. The costs incurred for
the last session of parliament exceeded the
original estimates and therefore additional
funds are required.
Vote 599 would cover the supplemental
costs incurred for publishing the Canada
Gazette. The original estimate was, of necessity, conjectural, being dependent on the
quantity of printed matter submitted and
upon the number of regular copies printed
each week and extras as required. A consolidation of Statutory Orders and Regulations increased a number of issues of the
Canada Gazette to several times the normal
size. Those are the reasons for the increased
cost.
I hope I have answered all the questions
honourable senators asked of me. I do not
pretend to be an expert on this subject, but
with the assistance of a book which contains
the supplementary estimates from the various departments with an explanation for each
item, I trust I have been able to give satisf actory answers.

WAR VETERANS ALLOWANCE BILL
FIRST READING
A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 164, an Act to amend the
War Veterans Allowance Act, 1952.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved the second
reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, it is certainly very trying on the patience of the
members of the Senate to wait several days
for a bill, especially for a bill that we
realize should be passed today in order that
thousands of veterans throughout Canada may
benefit from it just as soon as possible. If it
were not for the provision that the bill will
come into effect on the first day of the month
following the day on which it receives Royal
Assent, I would not suggest that it should be
considered by us this evening. However, in
view of that provision, and in view of the
splendid service which these men and women
have given Canada I trust that the Senate
will see fit to pass the bill tonight.
The main feature of this bill is to increase
the basic rate of war veterans allowances
by 20 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I have no copy of the bill
here.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The bill has just
reached us from the House of Commons, and
I do not think it bas been distributed. It
is possible that a number of senators have
seen the bill while it was being considered
by the Commons.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: We all received a copy
of it in the mail.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Were any amendments made
to the bill in the Commons?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, there was one
amendment, which I will refer to.
Then I take it that honourable senators
have received the bill which was considered
in the Commons, and which is now before the
Senate with one amendment, to which I
will refer.
As I said, the main feature of this bill is
to increase the basic rates of war veterans

SENATE
allowances by 20 per cent. A veteran under
the act who is single and is receiving $50
a month will now receive $60 a month. Similarly, a married veteran who is now receiving
$90 a month will, under the provisions of
this bill, receive $108 a month.
There is also a provision whereby the
ceiling, that is to say the total income permissible under the act, is increased in the
case of the single veteran from $720 to $840
a year, and in the case of a married veteran
from $1,200 to $1,440 a year.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Is that in addition to the
allowance?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No, not in addition
to the allowance, but including the allowance.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: Does that permissible
income include casual earnings?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No. Perhaps I might
refer to casual earnings at this time. They
are earnings by a recipient or by his wife,
or by both of them for work of an irregular
nature, commonly termed odd jobs-that is,
small jobs complete in themselves for one
or more employers. These casual earnings
are allowed over and above the permissible income. There is also a provision
that earnings by a recipient and his wife, or
by both of them, from part-time regular
employment-for instance, as the caretaker
of a church or a school or a Legion hall, or
a canteen attendant or a crossing guard, or
self-employment at home on a part-time
basis-are exempt up to twenty-five days at
a maximum amount of $2 a day. That is
to enable a war veteran to take a job such
as I have described, and if he works twentyfive days a month-

Hon. Mrs. Hodges: I ask the question because I happen to know of a case where a
claim was based on small earnings, and the
stand taken by the department at the time
was that they were not casual earnings. I
was wondering if there were any definition
in this bill.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No, there is no
change in the act so far as a definition of
casual earnings is concerned, but I think you
will find that in administering the act the
officers will be quite generous in their interpretation of that term.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why the discrimination
against a regular job?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There is no discrimination in the case of part-time regular employment; it is regarded as casual earnings.
But if the man had regular full-time employment which took him well beyond the income
ceiling he would not be eligible under the
act. I am informed that the widest possible
interpretation is given to the term "casual
earnings".
Hon. Mr. Davies: Could the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) tell us
whether, if a married man gets the pension
and also works twenty-five days in a month,
he can also earn a certain amount by casual
jobs? If so, what is the total of permitted
earnings?

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If he were in receipt
of the full amount allowed under the act he
could then work twenty-five days in the
month at the rate of $2 a day, but that would
be the total amount he would be permitted
to earn on a casual basis. Should his earnings exceed that amount, there would be a
reduction of the veterans' allowance.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: Is it a month?
As regards earnings by the recipient or

single man he is entitled under this act to
$840 a year, Sa he would receive in war
veterans allowance the difference between
$480 and $840, which is $360.
His war
veterans allowance would, therefore, be at
the rate of $30 per month.y
Those are the main provisions of the bill,
but if honourable senators wish me ta do
so I will go over the various sections and
explain them.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Has the honourabie
the Government Leader particulars of the
arnendment to the original bill?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There has been one
amendment. Probably, as we are not in a
great hurry, I might explain the bill clause
by clause.
Han. Mr. Roebuck: I think it would be a
service.
Hom. Mr. Macdonald: Clause 1 widens the
meaning of the word "parent" ta include an
adoptive or faster parent or a step-parent.
Sa, under this definition, if the parent should
die, the cbild would be entitled ta the payment of the allawance as an orphan. If the
child is a girl it is ta be paid until she
attains the age of 17 years; if a boy, until
16 years. But if the child, whether a boy or
a girl, is fallowing and making satisfactory
progress in a course of instruction appraved
by the district authority the allowance is ta
be continued until he or she attains the age
of 21 years.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: These parents, I suppose,
rnust be ini loca parentis.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, in ail cases they
have been in laco parentis, although there
may nat; have been an arder of adoption made.
Where there is one child, the amount payable
is $40; if there are two children it is $70;
if there are three children, $85. The last is
the maximum amount.
Section 3 of the present act provides for
an incarne ceiling on a yearly basis; and section 4, an incarne ceiling on a monthly basis.
Under the act the provisions of the ceiling
on a monthly basis apply ta maie veterans
50437-26

oniy, but under the amendment these ceilings
will apply also ta female veterans and ta
widows.
I came ta clause 3 of the bull, whereunder
the new section 5 pravides that the widaw of
a veteran wha is in receipt of war veterans
allawance receives the allowance at the married rate for one year after the death of her
husband. If a man wha is in receipt of war
veterans allowance dies, the ailowance is continued ta the widaw for one year at the
married rate. Sirnilarly, if a waman who has
served in the armed farces and is in receipt
of war veterans allowance at the rnarried rate
an behaîf of hier husband, shauld die, the
allowance is continued ta the widawer for
a year.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is a gaod provision.
Hon. Mr. Reid: What happens after the
year?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: In the case of the
widow, after the year, she wouid get, if she
is eligible in ber own right, the allowanre
under the act as a single persan.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: And if she remarried?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Remarriýage would
affect the entitiement because of the incarne
ceiling. It would depend on the incarne of
bier new husband as well as bier own.
Hon. Mrs. Hadges: If she married within
a year of hier husband's death would the
arnaunt af the allowance be affected?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It would be affected
if ber incame increased.
Clause 3 of the bill makes the increases
applicable ta those wbo are now getting the
benefit of the act as widows or as widowers.
Suppose a veteran in receipt of an allowance
died last January. His widow would be
receiving the benefits under the present act,
and under tbis bill she wauld get the increase
when it goes inta effect.
Clause 3 of the bill has been arnended by
adding a new subparagrapb 2, as fallows:
Where any veteran or surviving spouse of a
veteran was receivlng or was eligible te receive
an amount under section 5 of the said act as it
was immediately prier to the date of the coming
into force of this Act, in respect of a period endlng
on or after that date, the district authority may.
in its discretion and in lieu of any further amount
under that section, award te such veteran or
spouse
(a) in respect of the portion of that 13eriod
that is prier to that date, an amount deterilned
in accordance with subsection (1) or (2), as the
case may be, cf section 5 of the sald act as it
was immnediately prior to the coming into force
of this act, and
(b) in respect of the portion of that perlod
that is on or after that date, an allowance
determined in accordance with subsection (1),
(2) or (3), as the case may be, of section 5 of

SENATE
the said act as enacted by this section, less any
amount received by such veteran or spouse in
respect of that period pursuant to an award made
under section 5 of the said act as it was immediately prior to the coming into force of this act.

That means this. Suppose an application is
pending and will not be determined until
after this bill comes into force. If a person is
entitled to the benefits of the act he will
get them at the old rate up to this date, after
which time he will get the benefits at the
new rates.
Hon. Mr. Davies: If a married man in
receipt of the allowance died, his widow
would receive the same allowance until the
end of the year. After that time would she
benefit only from a single allowance?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Suppose she has two or
three children?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: In that case she can
get additional assistance under the Act. Under
this act there is no provision for paying an
allowance to children if one of the parents
is living, but if both parents are dead then
there is a payment to the children as orphans.
Clause 4 of the bill is for administrative
purposes only. Under the present act it has
been necessary for a widow or a widower,
upon the decease of his or ber spouse, to
make an application under section 5 of the
act. This amendment will enable the board
to make a grant immediately upon notification
of the death.
Clause 5: Under the present Act a veteran
cannot get the benefits of the married rate if
he enters into what is generally known as a
"death-bed marriage". The purpose of this
clause is also to make it impossible for the
widow of such a veteran to obtain benefits
under section 5 of this act.
Section 6 provides for an increase in the
salary of the Chairman of the Board from
$10,000 to $11,000 per annum, and in the
salary of each of the other four members
from $8,500 to $9,500 a year.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is there any definition
of a "death-bed marriage"?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, I think there is.
I have heard of a death-bed repentance. Section 11 of the present act reads as follows:
Notwithstanding anything in this act, no allowance shall be paid to a widow of a veteran who
dies within one year from the date of his
marriage . . .

Hon. Mrs. Hodges: Surely you do not call
that a death-bed marriage? The average man
does not spend a year on his death bed.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If a veteran gets married and dies within one year I think that
marriage would come within the classification

of a death-bed marriage, unless at the time
of the marriage, the veteran was, in the opinion of the Board, in such a condition of
health as to justify his having a reasonable
life expectancy of at least one year.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: What if a veteran died
from a heart attack within one year of getting married, although he had shown no
signs of having any heart trouble? It would
seem very unfair to me that his marriage
should be considered a death-bed marriage.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That would not be
considered a death-bed marriage, for probably he would have had a reasonable life
expectancy of more than one year.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Certainly.
Hon.
things?

Mrs.

Hodges:

Who decides

these

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The Board; and I
think the Board has always acted most fairly.
No question has been raised if a man is likely
to live for a few years. I do not think there
are many women in the world who, for the
purpose of getting certain benefits would
marry a man just because he was about to
die.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There were such cases after
the Civil War in the United States.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators
must remember that this act does not apply
to men only. There are women who served in
our armed forces and are entitled to benefits.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: It is not only women
who contract a death-bed marriage then?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Supposing a woman
veteran eligible for the benefits of this act
became ill. I hope there are not any men
who would marry ber just so that they could
benefit under this act after ber death.
Subclause 1 of clause 7 simply spells out
the definition of a Canadian forces veteran,
instead of referring to the definition in the
Veterans Benefit Act. There is a small change
in subelause 2 for the purpose of clarification
in the meaning of World War IL. The present
act states that World War II commenced in
September 1939, and the amendment specifies
the date as September 1, 1939.
Subclause 3 deals with a common-law
widow, or the widow of an irregular union.
Under the present act, in certain circumstances the common-law wife of a veteran
may be deemed to be his wife for the purposes of the act. The amendment makes it
clear that if the veteran dies she is also
deemed to be his widow.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Then she would not

The woman bas raised tbree cbildren, and she

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I bave been trying

Han. Mr. Roebuck: Supposing his true wife

and he then made his common-law wife an
"honest woman", as the saying is, would the
fact of the marriage cause the waman ta lose
the right she might otherwise have had as a
common-law wife?
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: That is the point.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think that is a very
good point, and I hope the board wil take
note of that situation wbicb might arise. I
arn satisfied that she would not; lose the
benefits of the act.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That question was put ta
one of the commissioners the other day by

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is a question to which
I have been trying for seven years to get
an answer, but without success. I see the
honourable the Minister in the gallery tonight. Perhaps I should refer to hlm. the case
that I rnentioned.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If she has obtained
a divorce she could hardly corne and ask for
benefits under this act.

Han. Mr. Macdonald: Of course, the
woman would have to qualify as a commonlaw wife.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
rnay I return to the rather interesting case
of the man who leaves a common-law wife
and a legal wife. This bill provides that
the total amount payable to the two wornen
shahl not exceed the amount provided for
under either the War Veterans Allowance Act
or the Pension Act, whichever is the greater.

Han. Mr. Haig: Does she not have to live
with the veteran seven years?
Hon. Mr. Davies: When there is a commonlaw wif e and a legal wif e, who gets the
allowance?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Both of thern.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I arn about to corne
to the case in which a deceased veteran leaves
a common-law wife and a legal wife. He may
have been receiving payments of pension
through the Canadian Pension Commission.
As honourable senators know, when a pensioner is rnarried he gets an increased pension
and the increase may be paid direct to the
wife. If the legal wife is receiving her portion of the veteran's pension and the veteran
dies, she may continue to receive the pension
payable to her as a widow under the Pension
Act. The common-law wife is eligible under
the War Veterans Allowance Act at the
rnarried rate. That is provided for under
section 5 of the act. Therefore, under the
act it ýcould happen that two wornen would
receive benefits on behaif of the sarne veteran,
and that the aggregate payments made to
the two "widows" on behaif of one veteran
would be more than the maximum payable
under either act on behaif of one veteran.
Han. Mr. Raebuck: Would you cali that
polygamy?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I would not call it
pclygamy, because when these benefits are
pa.yable the veteran is dead.
Han. Mrs. Hodges: May I ask a question?
In the Divorce Committee and in a recent
debate in the house we have heard a good
deal of discussion about divorced people. If
the wife of a Canadian soldier got a divorce
in England on a ground not recognized in
Canada, and hie, being unable to get a divorce
here, took up with a common-law wif e,
\vould his wif e in England still be his legal
vif e?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I would flot think so.
If she bas obtained a divorce, she bas put hierself out of the picture.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: But would that divorce
be recognized here?

Hon. Mr. Asoltine: The marriage is already
dissolved.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Who loses out?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The arnount is apportioned between the two women as determined by the War Veterans Allowance Board
and the Pension Commission af ter a
conference.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Do I understand that if the
legal wif e is living in England and she refuses
to corne here, the man in Canada is stili
married to hier?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes. 0f course those
cîrcumstances would be taken into consideration by the Pension Commission and the
War Veterans Allowance Board.
Hon. Mrs. Hadges: That was the particular
question I asked, and I understood the leader
te say that she would not be considered in
the matter.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid)
referred, as I understood him, to the case
of a man whose wife was living in England
but had not obtained a divorce there.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: I understand.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: In such a case the
woman would not be divorced.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: And the man in Canada
would be legally married to hier.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes. However, I arn
satisfied that a woman who obtained a divorce
in England could flot corne back to Canada
and dlaimi benefits under this act as a veteran's
widow.
Hon. Mr. Aseijine: The marriage would
have been dissolved, as far as she was
concerned.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes.
Han. Mr. Davies: Honourable senators, I
mnust say that in the light of the explanations
I have heard from the honourable leader I
do not think too highly of this bill. My sympathy is with the widows. Do I understand

MARCH 31, 1955
correctly that when a veteran dies bis widow
is entitled to an allowance of $50 a rnonth?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Under the bull, she
would get $60.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Ail rigbt, let her have
$60, and also let ber have the family allowance for, say, tbree children. Sbe is stiil not
going to bave more tban about $20 a week to
live on. Wbere is she going to get tbe rnoney
to rent suitable accommodation, and dress
and feed berseif and tbe children? I arn
quite sure tbat she would bave great difficulty
living on tbat kind of money in Kingston or
in a larger city like Ottawa.
Despite ail tbe improvernents we bave
made, we still appear to be quite niggardly
with the widows o! war veterans, especially
those witb children. I do not tbink we bave
done very well by tbem.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There is also wbat is
known as an assistance fund out of wbicb an
additional amount can be paid to a widow, to
bring ber total income Up to $840 a year.
Hom. Mr. Davies: But does she benefit from
that fund as a rigbt or as a privilege? And
can sbe get assistance under any provincial
legisiation? 1 know that in Ontario we bave
what is, called tbe Mothers' Allowance Act.
Hon. Mr. AzesUme: There is a similar act
in. Manitoba, and I believe in ail of tbe
provinces.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I know only about Ontario.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does the act not make
provision for children?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, the act does make
provision for widows with children. Perhaps
I should have emphasized that point. A
widow witb cbildren who qualifies under
section 3 of the act will get the allowance at
the married rate.
Hon. Mr. Davies: That is quite a different
situation.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes; she would get a
larger allowance than I indicated to the
honourable member frorn Kingston (Hon. Mr.
Davies). I arn sorry that my explanation in
that respect was not entirely clear.

TABLED-REFERRED

TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
I have the honour to inform the Senate that,
in conformity with Rule 103, the Clerk has
laid on the Table the accounts and vouchers
of the Senate for the fiscal year ending March
31, 1955.
Ordered: That the said accounts and
vouchers be referred to the Standing Committee on Internal Economy and Contingent
Accounts of the Senate.

Honourable senators, at this time I would
like to make a brief statement. The other
day the honourable senator from Ottawa West
(Hon. Mr. Connolly) was kind enough to
commend the committee for making fairly
frequent reports on its progress in dealing
with the large number of cases before it. I
was encouraged by that chance remark, and
since we shall be adjourning tomorrow for
the Easter recess, I take this opportunity to
report the progress of the committee to date.
So far this session 307 petitions have been
heard and recommended, four have been
rejected, six have been withdrawn, and four
have been partially heard. The number of
petitions pending is 152. This makes a grand
total of 473 petitions presented, which is one
more than I reported on a previous occasion.
Of the 152 petitions still remaining on the
docket for this session, I think it is a fair
estimate that probably 100 of them will be
proceeded with after the Easter recess.
It is for the purpose of assisting the Committees Branch in its work that I am asking
that these reports be concurred in tonight.
The motion was agreed to, and the reports
were concurred in.

mons certain control over the retirement of
some of the employees of both houses. That
debate was interesting and illuminating.
Honourable senators, while much of the
information about the act is already known
to many of you, it still may be helpful to
give some general information on the conditions underlying the existing legislation.
In the first place, under the Public Service
Superannuation Act pensions are provided
as a matter of right, whereas under the old
Civil Service Superannuation Act pensions
were given as a matter of grace.
Under the Public Service Superannuation
Act, which is the legislation this bill seeks
to amend, some 67,000 temporary employees
of the Government of Canada became eligible
to contribute and so to qualify for pensions.
At the present time a total of about 130,000
civil servants, both temporary and permanent, can take advantage of the legislation. Before this act was passed only some
63,000 could take advantage of the act and
become available for pensions. I am informed, and perhaps honourable senators
may be interested to know, that 93 per cent
of these 130,000 people are paid through the
Central Pay Office here in Ottawa.
Under the 1953 legislation, the 67,000 temporaries who wished to qualify under the act
and to contribute for their past service had
to exercise an option to do so before December 31, 1954. At that date some 35,000 applications had been handled, or a little more
than 50 per cent of the total. Obviously the
volume of work was very great, and I am
informed it is essential that this option period
which expired on December 31, 1954, should
be extended in order that the applications of
the remaining 50 per cent of the temporaries
who wished to qualify can be handled.
According to information which I have
received, each election involves special attention and the processing of these applications
against a background of a rather complicated
piece of legislation is sometimes slow work.
Therefore, it does seem to me to be reasonable that the time should be extended by one
year. It is proposed that if a further extension is deemed necessary it will be handled
by regulation.
I m.ight say something about contributions.
One aspect covers current service and the
other aspect covers past service. For current
service the contributions required to be made
by male employees is 6 per cent of current
salary, and for female employees it is 5 per
cent of current salary; and for past service
the same rates apply to the appropriate salary.
The Government matches these contributions except where the past service was not in
the Public Service of Canada, in which case

the contributions for past service must be
made entirely by the employees themselves at
the same rate. Therefore, in effect, their rates
are doubled. At the present time some 34,000
employees of the Government of Canada are
not eligible to qualify for benefits under the
Public Service Superannuation Act. These
include such people as prevailing rate employees, seasonal employees, casual employees,
new employees and sessional employees. It is
obvious that a great many of these are temporary employees. I am informed that there
is a considerable turnover within this group.
In the fiscal year ending March 31, 1954,
17,317 people drew pensions amounting to
$16,517,000.
One of the purposes of Bill 189 now before
us is to qualify certain sessional employees of
the House of Commons and of the Senate for
benefits under the Act. Some 365 people
could be affected, 50 of whom are employed
In the Senate, and 315 in the House of
Commons. To qualify under the act a sessional employee would probably be required
to establish a record of some 60 months service. I understand that the requirements with
reference to qualification are prescribed by
policy, and that an order in council ultimately
determines the entitlement of an employee to
participate in the benefits provided by the
act.
The purpose of sections 3 and 10 of the bill

is to extend the application of the act to certain former employees of the Government of
Newfoundland who were transferred to the
Public Service of Canada at the time of union.
These persons are known as "unestablished"
civil servants under Newfoundland law. About
25 persons are affected, and their right to
pick up past service would be determined by
their entitlement as it existed under the Newfoundland act before union. At that time
those civil servants were entitled to pick up
50 per cent of their past service. That is the
entitlement that they will have under this
act by the amendments proposed.
I should say something about the actuarial
position of the superannuation fund, because
in 1953 that was discussed at great length.
The capital deficit of the fund at that time
was $189 million, and I am informed that
the present capital deficit stands at the same
amount. However, I should add that no
interest deficit has accumulated in the meantime, because the government has paid annually into the fund four per cent on account
of the interest on the $189 million capital
deficit. So that while the capital deficit remains the same, the fund is not running
behind in so far as further annual interest
deficit accumulations are concerned.

APRIL 5. 1955
Honourable senators, I am also informed
that the Government made a capital payment
of $38 million into the fund at the time of the
general Civil Service salary increase in
December of 1953, and that again was for the
purpose of maintaining the corpus of the
fund and leaving the deficit at $189 million.
I may say that the capital shortage, which
was reported at $189 million as of March 31,
1953, remains the same.
If honourable senátors are interested in the
actuarial position of the fund, I would direct
attention to a report containing pertinent
information which was tabled in the House
of Commons in March, 1952. I may add that
the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has tonight tabled in
the Senate the report to the Minister of
Finance on the Public Service Superannuation Act for the fiscal year ending March 31,
1954. This document, which was tabled in
the House of Commons on March 31, contains
some useful and illuminating information on
the workings of the act up to the present time.
This bill also contains a few consequential
changes, mostly of an administrative nature,
to which I might refer briefly. Section 5 of
the bill would allow the right to amend or
revoke an election made under the act with
respect to benefits for past service. The purpose of this amendment is to relieve from
hardship persons who elected to pay up for
past service and then found that the calculation of the amount they were required to
pay was inaccurate. I understand that this
happens occasionally, and that as the legislation is at present framed there is no relief
from it. It seems only reasonable that some
relief should be provided in cases of hardship. I am informed, however, that the
adminstrative policy in dealing with this
particular power will be one of caution, so as
not to imperil the position of the fund.
Section 6 of the bill would preserve the
rights of a common-law wife who marries a
pensioner after his retirement. Under the
act as it stands the dependents of a pensioner
who marries after retirement are shut off
from benefits under the act. Section 7 would
preserve the rights of children of a first
marriage, and any other persons who were
dependent upon the pensioner at the time of
his marriage after retirement.
In other
words, the rights of the dependents of a
pensioner who were lawful dependents at the
time of retirement are not, under these
amendments, to be adversely affected by the
marriage of the pensioner after retirement.
The necessity for certain other administrative changes arises out of cases in which
employees leave the public service, take their
superannuation, and later are re-employed
by the Public Service. I am informed that

certain inequities emerge in such cases, particularly by reason of accumulated leaves of
absence without pay. It seems advisable at
this time that in the cases where injustices
arise provision should be made to deal with
them.
Section 9 provides a period for the making
of an election to pick up past service within
a certain time after a medical examination
bas been held. Obviously this is an administrative change too, and I think it would
commend itself to the judgment of honourable members.
Finally, section 11 provides for certain
arrangements where there bas been an interval between services in the armed forces or
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on the
one hand and the Public Service on the
other. I understand that the amendments in
section 11 will make it easier for a person
covered by the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police Act or the Defence Services Pension
Act to come under the Public Service Superannuation Act.
Honourable senators, I must confess that
I find it rather difficult to explain this type
of complicated legislation, and I regret that
the explanation was so confusing.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: May I ask the honourable
gentleman a question? While his explanation
has been clear, the subject is an involved one.
Section 10 of the bill, which deals with Newfoundland civil servants, uses the term
"unestablished civil servant". Under this
legislation have the federal civil servants in
Newfoundland the same rights and privileges
as those who were members cf the federal
civil service prior to the date of union?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: I think the answer is
yes, so far as current service is concerned.
So far as past service is concerned, the
employees you have in mind are in the same
position as any other employees of the
Public Service who qualify under the provisions of this act. They would be entitled
to pick up fifty per cent of their past service.
In other words, their entitlements under
Newfoundland laws are to be recognized
under the measure now before the bouse.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: We are indebted to the
honourable gentleman from Ottawa West
(Hon. Mr. Connolly) for the explanation that
he bas given of this bill, though I must confess that, clear as his explanation bas been,
some of these sections are rather complicated
and difficult to understand. The honourable
senator said that one of the purposes of this
bill is to provide that sessional employees
of the Senate may become contributors to
the superannuation fund. I believe this is
covered by section 1 of the bill.

SENATE
My only purpose in rising is to suggest that
it would be wise to send this bill to committee.
I feel we have a duty to our Senate employees
to find out just what is involved in this proposed legislation and to ascertain what their
position will be if they are brought under
the superannuation account. I therefore trust
that if the bill is given second reading its
sponsor will move that it be referred to a
standing committee of the Senate.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

PRIVATE BILL
SHARP & DOHME (CANADA) LTD.-COMMITTEE
AMENDMENTS CONCURRED IN

Hon. A. K. Hugessen, Acting Chairman of
the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills, presented the report of the
committee on Bill G-10.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private
Bills, to whom was referred the Bill G-10, intituled:
"An Act respecting Sharp & Dohme (Canada)
Ltd.", have in obedience to the order of reference
of March 29, 1955, examined the said bill and now
beg leave to report the same with the following
amendments:
1. Page 1, line 3: after the word "Office" Insert
the words "on the 27th of August, 1954,"
2. Page 1, line 7: after the word "disclosure"
insert the words "to a pending application"
3. Page 1, line 11: after the word "conferring"
strike out the word "the" and insert the words
"an effective"
4. Page 1, line 23: after clause 1 add the following as clause 2:
"2. If any person has, before the 24th day of
March, 1955, commenced in Canada the manufacture
and sale of the invention described in the said
application serial No. 672,036, such person may,
notwithstanding the issue of any patent pursuant
to this Act, continue such manufacture and sale in
as full and ample a manner as if this Act had not
been passed."

I think it fair to say the members of the

committee were satisfied on both points,
namely, that an undesirable precedent would
not be established by referring the bill back
to the Senate with some fairly substantial
amendments, and that there would be no
prejudice to the public or to third parties if
the bill as amended were passed.
As this is a private bill perhaps honourable
senators would consent, in view of the
impending Easter adjournment, to give the
bill third reading this afternoon in order that
it might be dealt with in the House of
Commons before the Senate reassembles.
The motion was agreed to, and the
amendments were concurred in.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Wih leave of the
Senate, I move the third reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I move that when the Senate adjourns
today it stand adjourned until Tuesday,
May 3, at 8 p.m.
The House of Commons is adjourning today
until April 18, at which time, I understand,
it will resume consideration of the budget.
One reason for suggesting that we adjourn
until May 3 is that by then that house may
have passed the budget and sent over some
bills for us to deal with. I think one would
be an optimist to expect the Commons to
pass the budget in less than two weeks. In

SENATE
any event, even if nothing has come over
for our consideration when we resume, there
will be certain other work with which we
can proceed at that time.
Another reason for suggesting that we
adjourn until May 3 is that our Special
Committee on the narcotic drug traffic, which
will commence holding sittings at Vancouver
on April 18, will likely continue sitting there
all that week and possibly run into the
following week.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I take this opportunity to call attention to the fact that the
Standing Committee on Divorce will meet on
May 3 at 10.15 a.m. Although the Senate
will not reassemble until 8 o'clock that evening, it is hoped that the members of the
Divorce Committee will be present in the
morning.
The motion was agreed to.
NARCOTIC DRUG TRAFFIC
COMMITTEE SITTINGS IN VANCOUVERQUESTION OF PRIVILEGE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Gray Turgeon: Honourable senators,
I wish to rise on a question of privilege
respecting certain articles appearing in the
press with reference to the hearings to be
held at Vancouver during the Easter recess
by the Special Senate Committee on the
traffic in narcotic drugs in Canada. While the
articles are undoubtedly well meant, they
might create a wrong impression in the minds
of the public with respect to this phase of
the committee's operation. I am sure the
public would be interested to know that this
undertaking is not being made at great
public expense. On the contrary, these hearings at Vancouver will materially reduce the
cost of the investigation.
Twelve of the 23 senators comprising the
Senate Drug and Narcotic Committee will
attend hearings at Vancouver. The hearings
will begin on April 18, and it is expected that
they will continue until April 25, depending
on circumstances.
Members of the committee are contributing
both their time and effort during the Easter
recess in order to assist in the elimination
of the social hazard caused by addiction to
narcotic drugs. In reaching its decision to
hold the hearings in Vancouver the committee
took several factors into consideration. It
was felt that inasmuch as most of these
twelve senators lived in the West and would
be spending the Easter holidays there, this
was an opportune time to hold the hearings
and thus eliminate the expense of bringing
witnesses to Ottawa. Of the members designated, the Honourable Senators King, McKeen, Hodges, Reid and Turgeon will be

spending the Easter recess at their homes in
British Columbia. The Honourable Senators
Gershaw and Stambaugh will attend from
Alberta, Horner from Saskatchewan and
Howden and Beaubien from Manitoba. The
only Eastern members to attend the hearings
will be the Honourable Senators Vaillancourt
from Quebec and Leger from New Brunswick.
Inasmuch as senators enjoy the privilege of
free transportation on the railways, it was
felt that the cost of this investigation would
be insignificant compared with that of bringing to Ottawa the 25 or more witnesses who
it is expected will be called during the visit
to Vancouver. If they were brought to the
capital an expenditure of well over $10,000
would be incurred.
A further value to be derived from this
project lies in the fact that inasmuch as
approximately 75 per cent of the drug addicts
of Canada reside in and about the city of
Vancouver, members of the committee will
be able to appraise the situation more
accurately for the preparation of the committee's report.
Costs of the undertaking have been reduced
to a minimum by procuring reporters on
the West coast instead of using the members
of the Senate reporting staff who would
normally cover the proceedings of the committee.
The decision to meet in Vancouver was
made by the committee as a whole. It was
based largely on the demand by various
groups in the West wishing to make representations. A wide variety of views are held
on the best way of meeting the drug addiction problem, and the suggested remedies are
so wide in scope and so vigorously supported
that opposing factions wish to be heard. It
will, therefore, be the duty of the committee
to decide which witnesses can make the
greatest contribution to the study of the drug
traffic problem.
For the above reasons it is felt that
invaluable evidence may be obtained at a
minimum of expense, and certainly in an
amount far less than that which would be
necessary to bring witnesses to Ottawa.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
EASTER RECESS

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,

all members of the Senate, their wives and
families, best wishes for a happy Easter.

EMERGENCY GOLD MINING ASSISTANCE
BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Joseph A. Bradette moved the second
reading of Bill 190, an Act to amend the
Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act.
He said: Honourable members, I beg to
move the second reading of this bill, the purpose of which is to amend the Emergency
Gold Mining Assistance Act and to extend
its application, subject to certain modifications, to the years 1955 and 1956.
On March 30 last year I had the honour
to move the second reading of Bill 376, which
also was for the purpose of amending the
Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act, and
I appreciate the fact that this year the
honourable the Government Leader in the
Senate (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has requested
me to move the second reading of the present
bill. Before I proceed with my remarks,
which may be rather lengthy, may I say that
I believe this honour has been extended to
me because it was my great good fortune
and great honour to represent for many years
in the other place one of the greatest goldmining areas of Canada, namely, the Porcupine section in Ontario, which is adjacent
to the Kirkland section and also to Rouyn
Noranda, on the Quebec side. To some extent,
therefore, I am familiar with what the gold
and silver mining industries have done, particularly for the province of Ontario, since
the end of the last century, when great silver
deposits were found at Cobalt, and later,
when the railways were extended into Northern Ontario, including the Porcupine section,
and some great gold mining districts were
opened up.
I should like to make a few remarks by
way of presenting reasons why this legislation
is being introduced at this time.
The Emergency Gold Mining Assistance
Act was inaugurated in 1948, effective for a
period of three years, to assist Canadian gold
mine operators in meeting greatly increased
costs of production. Unlike the situation in
respect of other primary mine products, no
compensating increase in the price of gold
has been granted for many years. The present
measure was designed primarily to assist the
high-cost or marginal mines to continue in
operation over a difficult period and to maintain their dependent communities. Because
of the high cost of production of gold, in
relation to a fixed price, the gold mines

MAY 3, 1955
made strenuous efforts to increase their
effi-ciency and to keep their costs at a
minimum.
In this they have been very successful,
but in spite of these efforts the upward
trend of costs has continued. This trend
bas been aggravated by the appreciation in
the value of the Canadian dollar, the effect
of which, so far as gold mines are concerned, is that they receive less for their
product. The recent change in the exchange
rate will be welcomed by the industry, I
am sure.
The original act would have expired at the
end of 1950, but it was renewed and continued to the end of 1954. In the formula
as originally designed there were two parts.
The first was the rate of assistance. The
second factor was the part of production
to which the rate of assistance applied. These
two factors have, from time to time, been
modified to meet current conditions. It is
an advantage to the gold mines, in order
to allow adequate planning, that the extension should be for a longer term than one
year. As the economic conditions which
necessitated the passing of the act continue
to exist, it is now proposed to extend the
act for 1955 and 1956, on a somewhat reduced
basis.
As indicated, the proposal to extend the act
is based on a new formula which still maintains the two main factors on a revised basis.
Under the new formula the rate of assistance
is two-thirds of the amount by which the
average cost of producing an ounce of gold
from the mine during the year exceeds $26.50
per ounce. But the rate paid per ounce will
in no event exceed $12.33.
In the old formula the number of production ounces to which assistance applied was
dependent on a base year which had been
defined by the act. The new proposal does
away with the base year. The rate of assistance will now apply to two-thirds of the
total production of the current calendar year.
This in effect simplifies the assistance calculations and maintains an equitable distribution of the payments to the mines receiving
assistance.
It will be noted that the rate of assistance
will not exceed $12.33 per ounce. This
means in the application of the formula that
the maximum allowable cost for the production of an ounce of gold under which payments will be made must not exceed $45.
This is the same maximum allowable cost
which was in effect in 1953 and 1954. In
the new formula, raising the factor in the
rate of assistance from $18 to $26.50 makes
some of the lower cost mines ineligible for

assistance, and distributes a proportionately
greater part of the payments to the higher
cost mines.
There has been some change in the policy
here. Personally I would like to see what
was done in previous years maintained. However, I believe this is a step in the right
direction, and at least it should be given
a fair trial.
It is hoped that by this distribution of payments the higher-cost mines will be able to,
continue and employment will be maintained.
Payments under the act vary according to the
cost of producing an ounce of gold in each
mine. The new formula bas been designed
to aid the communities which are dependent
on gold mines for their existence.
I am not going to elaborate on the question
of subsidies. I have always been openminded on that great problem. During the
last war, for instance, I was in favour of
subsidies that were placed on some foods and
commodities. I was absolutely in favour of
their abrogation immediately after, or not
long after, the war ended. The same principle
would also apply to the gold mining industry.
If the day should come when gold receives
the same consideration, as far as price is
concerned, as any other mining or industrial
product, I would be the first to ask for
abolition of such a subsidy.
Honourable senators, I would like to speak
for a brief moment on the present price of
gold, which is the crux of the existing
situation, and the problem that the gold
mining industry is working on at the present
time. When the question of subsidies to assist
the gold mining industry first came up I
was then a member of the other house, and
I told the members of that branch of Parliament that, based upon the experience of the
district which I had the honour to represent,
assistance had to be given to the industry. It
seems to me parodoxical, if not ironical, that
gold, which is synonymous with wealth or
opulence, should require assistance in its
production. Gold is different from any other
metal produced in this country. It is the only
metal universally accepted for monetary purposes, and by reason of that fact it plays a
large part in the national economy of many
countries.
How bas the price of gold fluctuated over
the past 24 years? In the year 1931 the
Governient of Canada asked gold producers
to send all their gold to the Mint, and by
the Gold Export Act of 1932 gold mining
companies were compelled to comply with
that request. That was done at a time when
Britain went off the gold standard, and when
the price of gold was just over $20 an ounce.
Bear in mind, honourable senators, that this

SENATE
was in the year 1932. During the period from
1930 to 1933 the average price of gold
increased each year, until in 1933 it reached
$28.60 an ounce. That was the maximum
price the Canadian producers could obtain,
regardless of the effect of the supply of and
demand for gold on the world market. While
all other metals and commodities have
increased in price tremendously since 1941,
the price of gold has remained rigidly pegged.
On January 31, 1934, President Roosevelt
announced that the price of gold would be
pegged at $35 an ounce, and the price has
remained the same since then.
Honourable senators, I took it upon myself
personally to make two journeys to the United
States-not in an official capacity, but because
my section of the country was so vitally
interested in gold mining production and the
situation was becoming more and more precarious-and I discovered that it had been
definitely decided, so far as the authorities
were concerned, with the Government of the
United States, that there would be no increase
in the price of gold for the time being, at
least, and probably for some time to come.
The stock argument used at the time was
that if the price of gold were increased it
would be inflationary. The only answer I
could give was that if this were true of the
price of gold it must also be true of the prices
of all other products, including all metals,
as well as other necessities of life. Another
argument advanced was that a certain
country had been holding a tremendous
amount of gold which had been taken away
from satellite countries-from Spain, for
example, and other nations-and that the
said country was producing a large amount
of gold by slave labour. Some of the high
officials felt that if the price of gold were
suddenly increased, the American market
would to some extent be flooded by gold from
one country in particular. Whether that prediction was well founded or ill founded, no
one can say. It was argued at that time that
if the gold were ear marked the United
States treasury would know precisely the
country from which it had come. It was said,
and I believe it was right, that it would be
impossible to find out exactly the country
from which the gold came.
During the debate on this bill in another
place there was some criticism, and I believe
it was unfair criticism, concerning the situation as to the disease of silicosis in the gold
mining industry. Every honourable senator
realizes that hard-rock miners are exposed
to silicosis, which is occasioned by silicose
dust, and that it is a disease about which the

provincial Governments and the federal Government have been fully seized ever since
it became known to the medical profession.
For instance, today and for many years past,
no employee is hired as a hard-rock miner
until he has passed a thorough physical
examination in order to assure his employer
that he is unlikely to contract silicosis readily.
I am reminded that the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) while he
was Minister of Mines in the federal cabinet,
visited my section of the country on several
occasions and left a profound impression on
the people of that area. Other honourable
members in this house have also visited
Northern Ontario and Northern Quebec on
several occasions have viewed the extent of
the great development which has taken place
in that part of our country and have become
familiar with the problem of silicosis amongst
hard-rock miners.
Perhaps it would be in order for me to take
a few minutes to inform the house generally
about what has been done to reduce the
incidence of this dreadful disease. I believe
something should be placed on the record to
show what has been accomplished in this
field. With your permission, honourable senators, I will read to you a review of the
experience with silicosis in Ontario as it
appears in the records of the Workmen's
Compensation Board:
A review of the Ontario mining experience from
the Compensation Board records:
(1) The number of cases of silicosis developing
each year has been decreasing at a rapid rate.
(2) The average age at which silicosis develops
has increased from 41-5 years (1926-1930)
to
56-5 years (1951-53), or by 36 per cent.
(3) The average number of years of dust exposure required to develop silicosis amongst the
few who contract the condition has increased from
15-4 years (1926-30) to 24-8 years (1951-53), or by
60 per cent.
(4) Only forty-five cases, or less than 4 per cent
of the 1146 known cases of silicosis in the industry,
have occurred amongst those men who commenced
mining after 1928.
(5) The average age at death has increased
from 44 years (1926-30) to 62-2 years (1951-53), or
by 41 per cent.
(6) Life expectancy after silicosis develoas has
increased from two years (1926-30) to 11-6 years
or by six times.
(1951-53),
(7) The proportion of cases who died of silicosis,
or silicosis plus tuberculosis, has decreased from
91-8 per cent (1926-30) to 55-1 per cent (1951-53).
(8) The average number of silicotic cases from
1926 to 1953 was 40-9 per year, whereas the average
from 1950 to 1953, inclusive, was 14 per year.
There were only 7 new cases in 1953.

Honourable senators, I have also a short
table, consisting of some thirteen lines, which
gives some silicosis statistics over a five-year
period, which, with the consent of the house,
I would now place on the record.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

In this ten-year period the maximum variation has been only two one-hundredths of an
ounce of gold per ton of ore. It might be
easily said that there has been no ore selection, because again I repeat it is up to the
management to see that they have enough ore
blocked out ahead so that there will be no
stopping of the activities in the mine.
I believe these figures show conclusively
that the ore mined has not been affected by
the amount of the payment under the Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act and the ore
mined under other conditions. As I said before, the product of a gold mine is a wasting
asset.
I was also surprised to notice that in the
other place an honourable member in making
reference to the mining industry in general
expressed the opinion that every man working in a mine should be taken from underground and the mine shafts sealed, stating
that a mine was no place to earn a living in,
and hoping these men could some day be
employed in factories and plants where they
could enjoy sunshine and fresh air and work
at producing something useful to mankind.
In answer to that I would say that I do not
think there is any industry in Canada that is
more fundamental to our prosperity and progress than is the mining industry. I am
sincerely convinced that those engaged in
that industry are of the very best class of
people, and they are at that work from choice,
not because they are forced to be in that
industry. I would venture the opinion that
total automation will never be realized in
the gold mining industry, or in the mining
industry in general. In fact, I would venture
to say that it will even be a long time before
total automation will be reached in our
manufacturing plants.
If you will allow me, honourable senators,
I will make a few comments concerning an
interim report of a committee set up a year

ago by the Ontario Government to study the
economics of the gold mining industry, and
I will give a summary of the conclusions
arrived at by that body. The report, which
is signed by Professor F. A. Knox of Queen's
University, Professor E. E. Reilly of the University of Western Ontario and Professor H.
R. Rice of the University of Toronto, was
released last week. No doubt most senators
have received a copy by the present time.
Premier Frost at last year's session of the
Legislature of Ontario announced the appointment of a committee to examine and report
on conditions affecting the position and prospects of the industry, causes underlying
trends in employment, wages, working conditions, profits, dividends and so on, and the
effect of these developments on communities
in the northern part of the province. The
report said known ore bodies will eventually
be exhausted, but that prospect is not
imminent.
I will read from the report:
In a few years the growth of the north itself
may save these communities even if the gold
industry declines.
The last ten years have
brought a spectacular expansion in population and
wealth throughout northern Ontario. This growth
will be continued with the uranium and base metal
developments, perhaps even close to the towns.

Looking to the future, the committee said
agricultural land in a clay belt would support
a large population, providing nearby markets
which would lead to manufacturing. The
arrival of natural gas would give many
advantages to the communities and improve
their prospects of diversifying industry.
Industry was needed to provide alternative
opportunities for the miners.
I quote again from the report:
There are always possibilities of better times for
the gold industry itself. Great improvements in
cost of production may yet occur; new ore bodies
may be discovered; the price of gold may even
be raised.
Any one of these would help to ease some of the
strain of the present problem in the gold mining
communities.

In the concluding observations of the 52page report, the committee said gold mining
is a striking example of industries caught
in a tightening "cost-price squeeze" against
which it struggles by resisting increases in
wages and striving to improve their efficiency.
A "great investment" in more productive
tools and machinery and an improvement in
mining methods have greatly retarded the
rise in the cost of mining. However, costs
have risen considerably and most mines have
made lower profits. Some mines have only
six or seven years of life left. Some mines

MAY
have closed, and others might have done
So had not the federal government extended
emergency aid to gold mines since 1948.
The report states that at the present time
it is not clear when or how the present cost
price situation in the gold mines in Ontario
will change, but there is no ground for
writing the industry off.
Although the United States has shown no
inclination to raise the price it pays for gold,
it is buying gold as it is offered. Production
is still at high levels in the province, many
workers are employed, and important com.nunities are depending on their earnings.
I quote again:
In a country growing so rapidly as Canada is,
and in a region with the prospects which seem
ahead for Northern Ontario, it would be a hardy
-pessimist indeed who would firmly deny the gold
towns a future.

The committee state further:
Before too long the steady increase in productivity now going on in the mines might make it
possible for all but those which are near their end
to pay higher wages without aid.
In the meantime, the Federal Government aid
now being given under the Emergency Gold Mining
Assistance Act should be continued. The mining
communities now receive payments from the
provincial Government, not only through the
regular grants for education, health and welfare,
but also by special grants.
Since standards in the public services of the
province constantly improve and the cost price
situation in the mines is likely to change, both the
federal and provincial governments should keep
under review the levels of aid required to assure
health and education of youth and the maximum
mobility of labour.

Since this report appeared some negotiations have been going on between management and labour in the gold mining sections
of the community, and particularly in the
Porcupine. I take this opportunity to make
an appeal that management and labour shall
find it possible, by means of the conciliation
board or through a round table conference
and all the present machinery at their disposal, to come to an agreement without having recourse to a strike. As I mentioned
in the first speech I made in this honourable
assembly, there was a strike two years ago,
and I know that it hurt everybody in the
section-indeed, everybody in Canada. I believe that the idea of a strike is not in the
minds of any of the negotiators at the present time, and I have implicit confidence in
the good judgment and good Canadianism of
the labour unions and also of the gold miners
and the management.
No doubt some honourable senators are
wondering what has been the cost of the
present subsidy. The details are contained

in a tabulation which, with the consent of the
house, I will put on the record:

For seven years 1948 to 1954 inclusive the
total production of gold was 22,488,843 ounces.
The assistance paid was in the sum of
$82,355,874, representing an average assistance per ounce produced of $3.66. The cost
to the country in those seven years was substantial. I think it is proper to suggest, however, that the net cost is something else,
because if all those mines paid income tax,
not only on the assistance but on other profits,
estimated at from 60 to 75 per cent of the
gold assistance, the net cost for the sevenyear period would be reduced from $20 to $33
million, which is not a very large sum of
money when one considers the results
obtained.
I shall not refer at length, because honourable senators know the facts as well as I do,
to the value and the meaning of our gold mining industry in the Canadian economy. We all
realize that at least 20 to 25 thousand persons
are directly employed, and each, in turn,
keeps four more people engaged in serving
the requirements of these mine activities.
Of course this industry is of particular
interest to the 130,000 Canadians living in
cities, towns and mining centres-some thirty
in number-in Ontario, the Maritimes, Quebec, Manitoba, British Columbia, the Yukon
and the Northwest Territories. Moreover,
honourable senators, we should not forget
that the livelihood of many farmers, settlers
and lumber operators established on lands in
the vicinity of mining centres in the parts of
the country that I have just mentioned depends almost exclusively on the gold mining
industry. These people are greatly concerned,
because the survival of the industry is of
vital importance to them. AU of us recall the
horrible forest conflagrations which, in 1911,
devastated the Porcupine, Matheson and
Cochrane sections, and resulted in the loss
of many lives. Since then, new mines have
been developed, like that at Golden Citywhich is non-existent at the present time-in
South Porcupine, and Timmins. We asked at

SENATE
that time what was going to happen to the
clay belt settlement of Northern Ontario and
Northern Quebec, one of the finest pieces of
agricultural land which can be found anywhere on this continent. We all took heart
and hope when the McIntyre, Hollinger, Dome
and several of the other producers decided to
resume operations. It was quite a struggle
at the time to find sufficient capital to get
started, but in very large measure the great
developments which have occurred in the
northern Quebec clay belt and in Ontario
have resulted from the enterprises which have
been carried on in that great mining section
of Canada. It is difficult to estimate what it
means to the Porcupine, the Kirkland Lake
and the northern Quebec districts. For example, in the fine centres of population of
Timmins, South Porcupine and Schumacher,
all located in the Porcupine mining area, the
future of many thousands of people is closely
linked with gold, and there an agglomeration
of 50,000 people has developed on account of
that industry, and the investing public have
placed many millions of dollars to bring huge
enterprises like the Hollinger, the McIntyre,
the Dome and many others to their present
state of production.
I speak very feelingly on this problem.
What I have said applies to Kirkland Lake
and Rouyn-Noranda on the Quebec side, and
also to the other centres I have mentioned,
and even more forcibly to northern Canada
generally, because we must remember that
most of this area is not suitable for farming
or other settlement or for agricultural purposes generally, and the greatest factor in
the development of most of the great Cambrian shield-that great treasure house-is the
search for mineral wealth, which means a
lot at the present time to Canada, and will
mean much more as the nation continues to
grow.
Before I came into the chamber this evening, one of the honourable senators on the
opposition side remarked to me that he had
never made much money from his ventures in
gold mines. The same observation holds good
of most classes of mining, and it is true as
far as I personally am concerned. Very, very
few men, even those who were "in on the
ground floor", have made very much money
out of mining of any kind, but let it never be
forgotten that it was the investing public who
made possible the developments to which I
have referred, and which have meant so much
to great centres of population like Winnipeg,
Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal. The investing public will always be needed.
Honourable senators, I am very thankful
to you for having listened to what has perhaps been a too lengthy presentation of a

subject in which I am deeply interested, and
with which I have been associated most of
my life in my northern section of Canada.
I leave it to the decision of the members of
this house as to whether or not they desire
this bill to be referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce. I am
positive that all senators realize the necessity
and urgency of voting for the continuation
of this measure, and I hope that it will be
passed unanimously by the Senate.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: Could the sponsor of
the bill inform us how many gold mines were
in production in Canada in 1954?
Hon. Mr. Bradeite: I do not have the
statistics with me, but this information can
be found in detail in the Hansard of the other
house.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Can the honourable
senator tell us how many mines carry on
operations at less than $26.50 an ounce?
Hon. Mr. Bradetie: I do not have that information at hand either. Perhaps it would
be well to refer the bill to committee.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I have quite a few questions to ask, and I am wondering if this bill
is going to be referred to committee.
Hon. Saller A. Hayden: Honourable senators, before the bill is given second reading
there are one or two things I should like to
say. First of all I want to thank the honourable senator from Cochrane (Hon. Mr.
Bradette) for the information he has just
given and to congratulate him upon the
knowledge he has displayed of the mining
industry, particularly the gold mining industry.
I feel that the Government has shown
wisdom in continuing the policy of emergency gold mining assistance. At the moment
I am not prepared to express an opinion as
to whether the curtailment that is involved
in the method proposed in this bill is too
drastic for the well-being of the gold mining
industry. I do not have enough information
to pass such an opinion now, but it appears
to me that this legislation works in the following way. The value of this act becomes
very considerably lessened as the costs of
gold mining increase beyond the $26.50 level
and approach more closely the more or less
fixed price at which the product can be sold.
Therefore, it seems to me that two results
will inevitably flow from implementing by
legislation the formula contained in this bill.
One is that the marginal properties, the high
cost operations, whose costs press up pretty
closely to the price that can be realized for
the product, will go out of business. Nobody
would carry on a gold mining operation

MAY
solely for the purpose of earning his costs
of operation, for he would be dealing with
a wasting asset and he might as well leave
the gold in the ground for a better day and
a stronger sun.
The second result will occur with respect
to these properties whose costs are such as
to qualify for some assistance, but yet which
do not come too close to the price that can
be realized. In order to get any real benefit
out of the operation of this formula it will be
necessary for them to try to reduce still
further their cost of operation by a process
of selection or a mixing of their millheads
so as to mill a higher grade of ore. As you
know, a mine tries to strike an average in
its milling during the year by drawing low
grade ore from certain areas in the mine
and mixing it with high grade ore that is
drawn from other areas in the mine. In
that way a standard of production and earnings is achieved during the year and the life
of the mine is prolonged. Now, in order that
more mines may be able to continue to operate and to get any benefit from the formula
in this bill, it will be necessary for them to
reduce their cost of operation by increasing
the value of their millheads. This means
they will have to put more high grade ore in
the millheads in the year, and that will cause
a definite shortening in the life of the mine.
Many things are dependent upon the maintenance of a standard or average life of a
mine. For instance, other industries and
businesses in the community are dependent
upon the earnings which come out of the
mines. If the effect of this bill will be to
shorten materially the useful life of these
mines, then it will bring that much closer
the serious question of what is going to
happen to the dependent communities and
their people.
At the same time, we should not consider
gold mining solely on the basis of the amount
of money involved, which runs into some
millions of dollars, translated in terms of an
average subsidy of $3.66 per ounce during
the years in which this act has been in force.
Do not let us become too terrified of that. I
can recall that during the war years we were
thankful to have a gold mining industry
which produced a substantial amount of
gold. It helped Canada materially in maintaining balances in its foreign trade, an
exceedingly important thing to this country
at that time.
It has been said that gold mining is of more
value to a country when conditions are bad
than when conditions are good. That may be
so, but do not let us get wrapped up with

2
the idea that we can abandon or water down
our gold mining industry until it becomes
a mere shadow, for in the long run Canada
would have to pay a price for just that kind
of situation.
Until such time as other countries are
prepared to get on the basis of a commodity
dollar, when gold would have no value im
international trade or exchange relations, it
is very definitely of real value to Canada to
have a gold mining industry operating even
if it has to be subsidized. While I am not a
lover of subsidies I am prepared to translate
subsidies into a picture of national benefit.
Do not let us start picking on the gold mining industry as the one whose so-called subsidies should be shut off or cut down to a
basis where they have no significant value.
If we are going to debate the question of
subsidies or no subsidies we should put al
businesses and industries, even natural resources, on the line and analyse them all in
the same way.
Honourable senators, I commend the Government in principle for continuing this legislation, but I say this with some hesitation, for
I am not sure whether the proposed formula
goes far enough to give real benefit to enough
gold producers at this time.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I do not think it does,
but would the honourable senator give the
house his opinion as to whether it would be
better to increase the price of gold from $35
an ounce instead of making a subsidy such
as this?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I thank my friend very
much for flattering me by suggesting that my
view on what the Government pollcy should
be might have any particular value. The price
of gold is regulated by many circumstances.
Under the present Emergency Gold Mining
Assistance Act, mining companies which do
not wish to enjoy the benefit of the payments
under the act do not have to sell their gold
to the Government, but are at liberty to sell
it wherever they can in the world market.
As to whether that is a good or bad thing
may be judged from the fact that very few
gold mining companies have availed themselves of the opportunity. Whether or not an
increase in the price of gold would be the
answer to the problem is a matter on which
I have no opinion at the moment. However,
I will say this, that if the price of gold were
higher, this so-called subsidy, or assistance,
would become unnecessary for the time being,
and more gold mining companies would come

SENATE
into production and remain in production. I
say "for the time being", because of course
the old story remains true in this industry as
in any other: as soon as profits start to grow,
costs of operation go up, the labourer wants
more for his hire, and so on. I am not critical
of that, but you have to face that situation.
The Government, I assume, decided to
approach the matter on the basis of reimbursing the companies with a percentage of
the costs so as to get away from any suggestion that this was an overly profitable

kind of business, which it might be regarded
as being if the price of gold itself were raised.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

NORTHWEST TERRITORIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved the second
reading of Bill 179, an Act to amend the
Northwest Territories Act.
He said: Honourable senators, you will
notice that the first two items on the Order
Paper have to do with the Northwestern part

of Canada. The first is for the second reading

SENATE

of Bill 179, an Act to amend the Northwest
Territories Act; and the next is for the second
reading of Bill 180, an Act to amend the
Yukon Act. I intend to deal with both of
these bills today, as they apply to one section
of the country. This is indeed a section which
is rapidly growing, and its potentialities must
fire the imagination not only of the youth of
Canada but of all our people. Those who
possess the spirit of adventure can find there
openings offering the widest possible scope.
That part of the country is developing so
rapidly that it has been found necessary to
amend the legislation affecting the local
government.
The bill to amend the Northwest Territories
Act is a simple one. Section 1 increases the
sessional indemnity of elected members of
the Northwest Territories Council. The Northwest Territories Act of 1951 -provided a daily
indemnity of $50 for each day of attendance
at a session of the Council, but the total
amount payable to a member in any one
year was $1,000. It was provided in that act
that it would come into effect on a day fixed
by proclamation, and it was proclaimed to
come into effect on April 1, 1955. The reason
for not bringing it into effect in 1951 was
that the former act contained penalties for
certain criminal offences which were not
included in the 1951 act. It was anticipated
that those offences would be provided for in
the revised Criminal Code, which honourable
senators will recall came inte effect on
April 1, 1955. As the Northwest Territories
Act of 1951 did not contain these provisions
with regard to criminal offences, it follows
that if that act had been proclaimed to come
into force in that year there would have
been a period of four years without legislation covering crime in respect to the sections
referred to in the act.
However, provision was made by other
legislation to increase the sessional indemnity
of elected members of the council to $50 a
day, with a maximum annual payment of
$1,000. Honourable senators will appreciate
that the work of members of the council
has increased, with the growth of the Northwest Territories. The bill proposes, therefore,
to increase the indemnity to $100 a day, with
an annual maximum of $2,000. If a session
continues beyond 20 days no additional payment will be made. Perhaps I should say
that it is seldom that the sessions run beyond
that time. These indemnities are paid out of
revenues received from permits and licences
of different kinds, and from grants under a
tax rental agreement between the Northwest
Territories and the dominion Government.
The act provides that the Commissioner in
Council may make payments from territorial

revenues. Section 2 of the Bill deletes the
words "territorial revenues" and substitutes
therefor the word "money", so under the bill
it is clear that moneys received under the tax
rental agreement will be available for distribution by the Commissioner in Council.
Section 3 of the bill states that the act
shall be deemed to have come into force on
April 1, 1955.
To summarize, honourable senators, the
bill provides, first, for an increase in indemnity of the elected members; secondly, for
clarification of the words "territorial revenues", and thirdly, for the coming into effect
of the act as of the lst day of April, 1955.
The Northwest Territories are governed by
a commissioner and a council consisting of
four elected members and five members
appointed by the Governor in Council. I may
say that the four elected members come from
the District of Mackenzie, where most of the
people of the area live, although there are two
other districts, Keewatin and Franklin.
The Commissioner is R. G. Robertson,
Deputy Minister of Northern Affairs and
National Resources. He receives no remuneration for his work on the council. The five
appointed members of the council are the
following:
F. J. G. Cunningham, of the Department of
Northern Affairs and National Resources, who
is the Deputy Commissioner. L. C. Audette,
a member of the Canadian Maritime Commission. Mr. Audette was appointed because
much of this territory extends along the
Arctic Ocean; and it was felt that the Maritime Commission should have a representative on the council. C. M. Drury, Deputy
Minister of National Defence, was appointed
because of the great developments in national
defence in the Northwest Territories. And in
view of the fact that there are within this
area a large number of Indians and Eskimos,
it was felt advisable to appoint to the council
a representative of the Department of
Citizenship and Immigration. He is Jean
Boucher. Then it is obviously advisable that
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police be represented on the council; hence the fifth appointed member is the R.C.M.P. Commissioner,
L. H. Nicholson.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Are these members paid?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No, none of the
appointed members are paid.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: They all receive salaries
from the departments with which they are
connected.

MAY 4, 1955
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: They received no pay
in addition to their salaries as departmental
officials.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is what I meant.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There are four elected
members: Frank Carmichael, from Aklavik,
is the representative for MacKenzie Delta; R.
Porritt, of Hay River, for Mackenzie South;
John Parker, of Yellowknife, for Mackenzie
North, and J. W. Goodall, of Fort Simpson,
for MacKenzie River. At the elections held
last year the members for MacKenzie North,
MacKenzie South and MacKenzie Delta had
ta contest their elections, but the member for
Mackenzie River was returned by acclamation.
Perhaps honourable senators will be interested to know the number of votes cast: in
MacKenzie North, 1,222; MacKenzie South,
753; and MacKenzie Delta, 678.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Do the same regulations
as to residence and other qualifications which
apply to voters in other parts of Canada
apply in the territories?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think there may be
some little difference. Canadian citizens who
have attained the age of twenty-one years and
have been ordinarily resident in the Territories for at least twelve months immediately
prior ta the date of elections are entitled to
vote. The following however are not entitled
to vote: Returning officers, judges and stipendiary magistrates, inmates of penal institutions, insane persons, and persons guilty of
election offences.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Where does the council
meet?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The council sometimes meets at Ottawa, but it can meet at
Yellowknife or at Fort Smith. Honourable
senators will recall that the act was amended
in 1951 to provide for payments of travelling
expenses of members who attend the meetings. I will probably discuss that a little
more fully when I explain the Yukon Bill.
Hon. Mr. Bradette. What is the total number of voters on the voters lists of the different districts?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: In the MacKenzie
North district, there are 2,052 voters on the
list; MacKenzie South, 1,297; MacKenzie
Delta, 1,019; and MacKenzie River, 904.
There was great interest taken in the election in the MacKenzie North constituency.
Four candidates contested the riding, and
1,222 votes were cast, of which the successful candidate received 403. In each of the
other two ridings there was a contest between
two candidates.
50437-27

Hon. Mr. Euler: Do they run as party candidates?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have no information
on that point. I know they run as party
candidates in federal elections, but I am not
sure whether they do so in the elections we
are discussing. I can, however, give the bouse
this information, that when the council votes
it does not divide on party lines. I was told
that on one occasion when an important piece
of legislation was before the council about
half of the elected representatives voted one
way and half of the appointed representatives voted the other way.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is there any municipal
organization?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am not sure on that
point but I am inclined to think that there
is not.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is there any provision
in the act for it?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No, there is not.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: What relationship exists
between that organization and the Hudson's
Bay Company?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No relationship. It is
possible that the Hudson's Bay Company get
licences from the council. I cannot speak
definitely as to that, but so far as the Northwest Territories Council is concerned the
Hudson's Bay Company bas no relationship
with it.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Does the company take
any part in the elections?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I presume the factors
would be entitled ta vote, and no doubt they
would exercise their franchise.
I believe I have explained the main features
of the bill. Considering the important part
this section of the country is playing in our
national development at the present time,
and the large areas from which these representatives come and for which they are
responsible, I think honourable senators will
agree that the
proposed increase
in
indemnity should be granted to them.
Accordingly I move second reading of the
bill.
Hon. Mr. Hardy: Do the Indians and
Eskimos have votes in the territories?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Some of them do, but
not all of them, I am informed. Of course,
many of them live in such outlying districts
that it would be impossible for them ta get
ta a poll ta cast their vote.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, when this bill was before the Senate in
1951 I called attention at that time ta this.

SENATE
utterly undemocratic form of government,
whereby five civil servants hold the majority
over four elected representatives of the
people.
True there was a time when the government of the territories was entirely appointive; so it was a step forward when provision
was made for elected representatives. But
this is an important and a growing part of
Canada, as the honourable senator has just
said, and at some time in the future it may
be a very much more important part than
it is today. Therefore, I would like to see
some indication, some intimation, of a better
form of government than now exists, whereby a little more democracy by way of selfgovernment will be granted to these people.
As I remember the act there is no provision
for municipal organizations at all. If we
gave the different communities an opportunity to form themselves into towns or
villages or townships, or something of that
kind, they could then govern many of their
important local affairs themselves. But so
far as I am aware there is no such provision,
nor has the prospect of anything along that
line been indicated by the sponsor of this
bill. It is all very well to say that people
are separated so widely one from the other
and the districts are so sparsely populated
that local government is difficult, but that
is not a good answer. Difficulties are made
to be surmounted; and democracy has always
met with difficulties. I would like to see
these civil servants gradually withdrawn
from the council and replaced with elected
representatives of the people living in the
territory.
The proposed increase in sessional indemnity does not seem unreasonable. In these
northern lands men are usually self-supporting; they have their living to make and their
families to keep, and it is not to be expected
that, without adequate pay, they will devote a
great length of time to public service. But
I question the limitation of $2,000. It may
be that the subjects to be considered will
require a little longer time than is allowed
under the payments schedule; if so, the
representatives should stay and finish the
business. Were any limitation of that kind
placed upon our provincial governments the
consequences would be disastrous. Most of
the legislatures sit for a longer period than
is allowed for this council. I see no reason
for an arbitrary limitation, under penalty of
working for nothing after the expiry of the
time they may sit. The increase I approve;
the limitation I do not like; the form of government I deplore. At the same time we
must pass this bill now, but I think it ought
to go to a committee before it is given final
sanction.

Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, I
think this is a bill we can support without
reservations. As the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) explained in his
introductory remarks, the area is a huge one.
I have been over most of it, from Yellowknife to Aklavik and from Great Bear Lake
to Fort Smith; and I know the intervening
territories. One needs an experience of that
kind to realize the vast extent of the area
for which we are legislating in this bill.
I agree wholly with the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
in his desire that democratic ideals shall
prevail. If I rightly understood his remarks,
apparently he doubts that the bill goes quite
far enough in the way of self-government,
because, of the council of nine members,
which is really a legislature, five are appointed and only four elected. In fact, the
five are federal Government officials of one
kind or another.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Civil servants.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: But notwithstanding my
adherence-I trust, in full measure-to
democratic ideals, I think that in these early
years it is as well to proceed rather slowly.
When, many years ago, the original Northwest Territories Council was set up, it was
not endowed with full powers of self-government. As the members gain experience, and
with experience wisdom, they are enabled to
deal better with the problems of self-government which affect their various communities.
If my memory serves me right, the present
Northwest Territories Act gives the council
pretty broad powers in legislating for the area
it supervises. It is true that the federal Government reserves to itself the right to veto
legislation or acts of the council; but it does
so in much the same way as it reserves the
right to veto provincial acts which it considers
to be ultra vires or not in the national interest. As the trapper from Aklavik and other
elected members sit in session with the appointed members and they become better informed on the problems with which they have
to deal, they will realize the importance of
sound measures of taxation and, I am sure,
their duty to watch expenditures carefully.
The council will have substantial revenues.
As the law stands, it can expend only revenues collected within its own territory, but,
as the Leader of the Government has pointed
out, it operates in conformity with an agreement modelled on the interprovincial agreements relating to monetary assistance. The
bill would confer on the council authority
to deal with revenues it secures in that way,
as well as the money it obtains through its
own modes of taxation or that it may get, for

MAY 41 1955
instance, from profits on liquor, from trapping and fishing licences, and the like. So I
have no apprehiension that we shall retard
the processes of democratic self-government
if we proceed, as provided under the bill,
with cautious steps. It may be that some of
us here, or those who succeed us in future
years, will be asked to legisiate to set up
another province in that area. No one can
tell. At any rate, I think, the legisiation
proceeds upon quite sound lines.
Regarding the remuneration of members of
the council; as the honourable leader has
pointed out, the per diem allowances apply
only to the elected members. 0f course, if
the appointed members have to travel to
Yellowknife or Fort Smith for a meeting of
the council, their expenses will be paid; the
elected members, when they corne to Ottawa
from their respective constituencies for
meetings-and it is a good experience for
them to attend once in a while meetings
here at the capital-are similarly compensated. It seems to me that the proposed
remuneration is on a f air basis. The maximum that can be paid any elected member in
any year is $2,000. The scheme also gives
effect to a very salutory principle, in that if
a member fails to attend meetings he is
penalized by the withholding of some of his
indemnity.
Honourable senators, from my knowledge
of the whole problem I have no hesitation in
supporting this bill.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
like the honourable gentleman from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) I have some

TnE

Province

recollection of the debate which took place
when the Senate deait with the predecessor
of thîs legislatîon in 1951. As I recaîl it, the
question was raised at that time as to why
there was a nominated mai ority on the
coundil with only a minority actually elected
by the residents of the Northwest Territories.
As I remember it, the answer which was
given to that question, and which satisfied
me, was this: A very considerable majority
of the residents of the territories are Indians
and Eskimos, most of whom arenot entitled
to vote for their representatives, and the
dominion government, considering itself the
guardian of the indigenous population,
appoints members to the council who are
expected to look after the interests of these
people. I assume that is stili the position,
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The honourable
gentleman from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) has referred to the amount of the
indemnity. It is very difficult, of course, to
determine what is a fair indemnity, but the
Governiment has taken into consideration the
indemnities paid to members of provincial
legislatures. I admit there is no direct
relationship and one cannot very well compare the work of a member of the Northwest
Territorial Council to that of a member of,
shail we say, the Ontario Legislature, but at
the same time there is some relationship.
Honourable members may be interested to
know just what the indemnities of the
members of the provincial legislatures are,
and with the permission of the house I will
place the following table on Hansard:

Honourable senators, it has been suggested
that the bill be sent to committee. I have no
objection to that. I think probably it should
go to committee in view of the remarks of the
honourable gentleman from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) with respect to the rights of
Indians and Eskimos to vote.
The honourable gentleman from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and the honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) mentioned the non-existence of municipal governments in the territories. Some
municipalities are being developed there. For
instance, Yellowknife is quite a centre at the
present time. I do not know to what extent
these municipalities have power over their
local areas, and probably honourable members would like to obtain this information in
committee.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Have there been any requests from these municipalities that they be
given local powers?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not know of any
direct request, but I understand that the question bas arisen from time to time. I do know
that the members of the council consult the
inhabitants of these areas on questions affecting local matters. Just to what extent there

is a demand for municipal government I cannot say, but no doubt we could also get that
information from the minister or from an
official of his department.
Hon. Mr. Farris: If there was much of a
demand we would soon hear about it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Probably. As I say, if
the house wishes this bill to go to committee
I have no objection.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Can the honourable
leader put on record how much it costs the
federal Government to administer the Northwest Territories through the council?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have that information in a financial statement, and with the
unanimous consent of the house I would place
it on Hansard.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Could we have the total?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: For the fiscal year
1952-53 the revenue totalled $660,026.43, and
the expenditure totalled $433,762.71.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Where does the revenue
come from?

various kinds. The honourable gentleman

On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald, the bill

YUKON BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved the second
reading of Bill 180, an Act to amend the
Yukon Act.
He said: Honourable senators, some of the
remarks which I made with respect to the

SENATE

Northwest Territories Council, when speaking
on the previous bill, apply also to the Yukon
Council.
The purpose of this bill is threefold: to
increase the indemnity of members of the
Yukon Council; to provide for living allowances to members while in attendance at a
session of the council; and to provide for
payment of the indemnity to a member if he
should become ill at the place where the
council is sitting, and cannot be in attendance.
The bill provides for living allowances to
members when the council is in session but
not actually sitting. It also provides for the
payment of travelling expenses.
The bill specifles that the date on which
the Yukon Act shall be deemed to have come
into force is the 1st day of April, 1955.
Payments are made from the Yukon Consolidated Revenue Fund, and the indemnity
to each member is increased to $100 a day,
up to a maximum of $1,000 per calendar year,
if the total number of days in session is ten
or less, or a maximum of $2,000 if the total
number of days in a session exceeds ten. The
bill further provides for travelling expenses
from the member's home to the place where
the council is sitting, and for an allowance
for living expenses of $25 for each day of
attendance at a sitting. The same allowance
for living expenses is payable to members of
the Northwest Territories Council.
I cannot think of anything which needs
further explanation, but if there are any
questions I shall try to answer them.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable leader for the names of the council
members?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Perhaps I should say,
first, that the five members of the council are
all elected. The form of government is democratic, just as the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) desired
it should be in the Northwest Territories. The
Commissioner, W. G. Brown, resides in the
territory. The electoral districts and the
members elected on August 20, 1952, are as
follows: Carmacks, represented by A. R.
Hayes, total number of votes cast: 86; Mayo,
represented by A. F. Berry, total number of
votes cast: 199; Dawson, represented by James
Mellor, elected by acclamation; Whitehorse
East, represented by J. L. Phelps, total number of votes cast: 472. Whitehorse West,
represented by F. D. Locke, total number of
votes cast: 525. The total number of votes
cast in the 1952 election was 1,282.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I am not sure whether
the leader stated the populations of the
various districts in the Northwest Territories

when he was explaining the previous bill, but
may I ask if he bas these statistics for the
Yukon?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes. In 1951 the total
population of the Yukon Territory was 9,096,
of which approximately 1,500 were natives.
I presume "natives" means Eskimos and
Indians. The populations of the electoral
districts in that year were as follows: Whitehorse, 2,548, plus about 1,500 military personnel and their families; Dawson, 773; Mayo,
236; Carmacks, 154.
The Yukon Council meets at Whitehorse.
I am sure honourable senators will agree that
an increased indemnity should be paid to
members of the council, and that their allowances for travelling and living expenses should
be similar to those of the members of the
Northwest Territories Council. Accordingly,
I would recommend this bill to the favourable
consideration of the house.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
I have listened with much interest to the
explanation of these two bills by the honourable Leader of the Government. It occurs to
me that it will be a long time before the
population of these two areas will warrant
their being made into provinces. When the
Department of Northern Affairs and National
Resources Bill was before the house in December 1953 I suggested that the land comprising
these territories should be incorporated into
the four western provinces: that is to say, that
the portions of the territories above British
Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba should become, respectively, parts of
these provinces. My suggestion received wide
publicity in the press at that time and, I may
say, drew some criticism in the newspaper
published in the Yukon Territory. But I still
think it would provide the proper solution for
the administration of government in that area.
I had occasion to read the record of proceedings of the Special Committee on the
Estimates of the other house when the Minister of Northern Affairs and National
Resources appeared before it and outlined
expenditures involving many millions of dollars to take care of the territories. In my
opinion all that area could well be administered by those provinces in close proximity
to it.
I thought it might be worth while at this
time, honourable senators, to renew my suggestion for the amalgamation of the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Territory
with the four western provinces.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACTS
AMENDMENT BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING POSTPONED
On the Order:
Second Reading of Bill H-10, intltuled: "An Act
to amend the British North America Acts. 1867 to
1952"ý-Hon. Senator Euler.
Hou. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators,
may I be permitted to say that it is not rny
intention to rnove second reading o! this bill
this afternoon; however, I definîtely intend
to proceed with it on Wednesday next.
The Hoa. the Speaker: The order stands

PRIVATE BILL
S & M PIPELINE LIMITED-SECOND

READING

lion. J. Wesley Siambaugh moved the second reading of Bill W-11, an Act to incorporate S & M Pipeline Lirnited.
He said: Honourable senators, as there
have been rnany pipe line bills passed by
this house and more are on the Order Paper,
one begins to wonder whethér so many such
bills are necessary. I believe there is a
valid reason for the multiplicity o! pipe lime
bills, and I shall explain the situation as 1
see it.
In 1953 Parliament; passed a statute known
as the Pipelines Act, section 10A of which
prohibits any person, other than a person
having authority under a special act, frorn
constructing or operating an extraprovincial
pipe line, which is defined in section 2, subsection (cc), as meanîng a pipe line for the
transportation of oil or gas connecting a
province with amy other or others of the
provinces, or extending beyond the limits of
a province. By reason of the above section
the proposed special act company is therefore
required for the purpose of constructing amd
operating small pipe lime gatherimg systems or
bramch lines which cross provincial boundaries.
I arn informed, honourable senators, that
Bill W-11 follows the pattern established by
bills of a similar mature, and our Law Clerk
tells me that it is in the formi recornrended
by the govermmemt.
It should be said that as long as pipe Jime
compamies operate within provincial boundaries federal incorporation is unmecessary.
However, as soon as a company fimds it necessary to transport oul or gas by pipe lime

across a provincial boundary a special federal
act, such as that proposed by this bill now
before us, is necessary.
In the four western provinces there are
numerous oul fields immediately adjacent to
provincial boundaries. For instance, in the
Peace River district of British Columbia,
near Dawson Creek, there are a number of
wells within half a mile of each side of the
provincial boundary. Dawson Creek, which
is in British Columbia, is supplied with gas
from Alberta. In the Fort St. John area,
where there are trernendous quantities of
natural gas but very littie oil, cost of transportation is so high that it is uneconomical to
operate the wells already established in the
area. However, since an Alberta firm is
building a refinery at Dawson Creek this
year, it is expected that the reflning of oil
and manufacturing of oil products will take
place in the very near future, and oil will
probably corne from both sides of the provincial boundary.
The oul industry in Western Canada, and
especially in Alberta, has developed into a
major industry during the past two or three
years. Development is also taking place in
the other western provinces, particularly
Saskatchewan.
In Alberta, at the end of 1954, there were
fifteen large producing fields and about fifty
small ones. To give the house an idea of
how fast this developmnent is continuing to
grow, I would point out that six new oil
fields and eleven new gas fields were discovered in the month of January this year.
I might add, incidentally, that because of
the moderate temperature and frozen ground
conditions, January proved to, be a better
month to operate drilling rigs than July or
August. StUR referring to, the end of 1954,
there were more than 6,000 producing wells
in Alberta, and their present daily production
is about 300,000 barrels. It is estimated that
in the present proven fields there are about
2 billion barrels of recoverable oul, besides
which there is estimated to be between 100
billion and 200 billion barrels in the Great
Athabaska Tar Sand field.
This oul industry has been a major source
of revenue for our western provinces, and
this is true especially of Alberta. Since the
Leduc discovery-which, by the way, was in
1947-the Alberta provincial Government has
received a total revenue from its various oil
and natural gas sources.of $350 million. The
banner year was 1953754, in which the Government received a record amount of $96
.
million.
Now the saie of course is true to, some
extent of Manitoba, British Columbia and
Saskatchewan, although from information I
have I believe that the province of Alberta

SENATE
owns a larger proportion of its oil rights than
does any other province, and that in this
respect Saskatchewan comes next.
In the past two or three years there has
been quite extensive exploration and development in the oil industry in Saskatchewan. At
the present time there are slightly in excess
of 1,000 wells in Saskatchewan capable of
producing oil, and the production in 1954
amounted to 5 million barrels. I might say
that within the last few weeks I saw an estimate made by the Saskatchewan Government
that during this year the output of last year,
would be doubled; that is, that this year the
total production in the province would be
about 10 million barrels.
Manitoba too has profited from the oil
industry, though to a lesser extent. At the
end of 1954 there were in Manitoba 300 wells
capable of producing oil, with a total production slightly in excess of 3 million barrels.
British Columbia has not a great deal of
oil, but it has tremendous resources of natural gas. According to figures issued by that
province, its proven resources are estimated
at something over 3 trillion cubie feet of gas.
Alberta, it is estimated, has from Il trillion
to 14 trillion cubic feet of gas.
The pipe line company which this bill
proposes to incorporate is interested in several
fields in Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta, but at the present time it is particularly interested in what is known as the
Frobisher field, in the southeastern corner of
Saskatchewan. The company wishes to build
as soon as possible a pipe line from the
Frobisher field to Cromer, Manitoba, a point
on the Interprovincial Pipe Line which, by
the way, is the pipe line running from Edmonton to Sarnia.
If honourable senators see fit to give second
reading to this bill today, I will move that
it be sent to the Committee on Transport and
Communications.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

PRIVATE BILLS
PETROLEUM TRANSMISSION COMPANYSECOND READING

Hon. J. W. de B. Farris moved the second
reading of Bill X-11, an Act to incorporate
Petroleum Transmission Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
rather ordinary bill. As honourable senators
know, the Pipe Lines Act, 1949, provides that
no company can construct or operate pipe
lines for the transportation of gas or oil unless
it has been specially authorized by an act
of Parliament. There are many precedents
for the incorporation of companies of this
kind-for instance, Trans-Canada Pipe Lines
Limited, Westcoast Transmission Company
Limited, Interprovincial Pipe Line Company,
Trans Mountain Pipe Line Company, and
others-and I believe there are bills for incorporation of other such companies now on
our Order Paper. Each bill has to be different
from others merely as to the details of capitalization, sponsors, and matters of that kind.
In form, this bill is the same as the others
that have been passed.
I think in this case the high status of the
company will be evident when I name the
petitioners, who are officers of the company.
They are George L. McMahon, William N.
Graburn, A. Patrick Bowsher, of Calgary and
Leonard M. Youell, all of Calgary; and Ronald
C. Merriam, of Ottawa. These men are respectively the president, two vice-presidents and
secretary of Pacific Petroleums Ltd.
Mr. Merriam, the solicitor of that company at Ottawa, is a well-known lawyer of
this city.
Pacific Petroleums Ltd. is one of the great
pioneers in the development of oil in Canada.
I know something about its inception. The
company was incorporated in British Columbia with power to do business in British
Columbia and Alberta. Frank McMahon was
the inspiring head of the company. For at
least fifteen years he has been an outstanding
personality in Canada, in my judgment, at
all times showing great courage, and bent on
one object-the development of gas and oil
in northern Alberta and northern British
Columbia.
I have here a memorandum containing some
information which I think honourable senators would approve of hearing.

own behalf, so it again applied to the Parliament, and at that time was empowered to
issue its own sickness, accident and mortuary
benefit policies. At that time the general
laws with respect to supervision of fraternal
benefit societies were less strict than they are
today. Accordingly one of the restrictions
contained in the Act of 1882 required the approval of the Governor in Council for amendments of the by-laws with respect to the
issue and regulation of its policies. Those
by-laws were a schedule to the act of 1882.
Through the years since that time the
insurance laws of the Dominion of Canada
have been greatly changed in the interests
of the policy holders of the company, and
a detailed supervision is now conducted on
behalf of the Minister of Finance through the
office of the Superintendent of Insurance.
It is therefore felt unnecessary for this company, when it amends its bylaws with reference to the policies it issues, to submit these
amendments to the Governor in Council for
approval. I have been informed that over the
past few years every amendment made to
these bylaws has in fact been approved by
the Governor in Council. I have also been
informed by the office of the Superintendent
of Insurance that it is really a waste of the
time of the Superintendent, of the company
and of Council to require this procedure to
be continued.
It may be of interest to know that the
company has its head office in Toronto, that
there are some 13,000 members in the association and that it enjoys a high status throughout the country, particularly in insurance
circles.

to the Standing Committee on Banking and

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Do other insurance companies submit their by-laws to council for
approval or are they required to do so?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Perhaps I would be a
little too quick if I were to say "No" to that
inquiry. I think, generally speaking, they
would not be required to do so.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I believe you are right.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: As honourable senators

times to the affairs of insurance companies in

all realize that one of the reasons for the
stability of our insurance companies is that

The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

TRANS-PRAIRIE PIPELINES, LTD.SECOND READING

Hon. T. A. Crerar moved the second reading
of Bill U-12, an Act to authorize TransPrairie Pipelines, Ltd. to construct, own and
operate an extra-provincial pipe line.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill that
I am sponsoring today is a comparatively
simple one, and I am sure it will commend
itself to the favourable consideration of the
house. Before dealing with the precise provisions of the bill perhaps a word or two of
general explanation would be useful.
Geologists tell us there is a considerable
area known as the Williston Basin in which
oil and gas will probably be found. This
basin embraces a substantial area in southwestern Manitoba and southeastern Saskatchewan, and extends beyond the international
boundary line into North Dabota and part
of Montana. Over the past four or five years
considerable exploration work has been carried out in the Manitoba part of the
Basin,
with quite substantial results. It may be of
interest to know that the oil production in
Manitoba is now running at the rate of 260,000 barrels a month. The February production alone amounted to 261,000 barrels,
and
at the present time there are 315 producing
oil wells in that part of Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Is it light or heavy oil?

Hon. Mr. Crerar: I am not sure, but if
my
friend is sufficiently interested in that we
can probably obtain the information in committee. However, I think it is not the heavy
kind such as is found in some parts of
Northern Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. Aselfine: That is what I wanted
to find out.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It is the ordinary type of
oil-decent oil.
It will be recalled that a few years ago
an interprovincial pipe line was constructed
to carry oil from the Edmonton area in
Alberta to Superior at the western end of

MAY il 1955
Lake Superior. This line bas since been continued to Sarnia in Western Ontario.
Of course, when these oil fields were discovered i. Manitoba the problema arose of
getting the oil to market. The interprovincial
pipe line passes close to a small village called
Cromer, which is from 10 to 15 miles southwest of Virden. The growing town of Virden
is about 75 miles west of the City of Brandon,
and Brandon is 140 miles west of the city
cf Winnipeg. I mention those distances to
give an idea of the location of the field. North
of Cromer, an oul field known as the Daly
field has been found. Another field north of
Virden has been discovered, known as the
Roselea field, and, indeed, in the town of
Virden itself there are now several producing
oil wells.
I now come te the purpose cf this bill.
A company was incorporated in Manitoba,
under the Manitoba Companies Act, to build
pipe lines within the province, te convey oil
from these fields te where it would tap the
interprovincial pipe line at Cromer. Since
the incorporation of the company the area
has been extended. Cromer is eight miles
from the Saskatchewan-Manitoba boundary,
but over the boundary in the province of
Saskatchewan cil has been discovered at a
point called Alida, roughly 25 miles from
Cromer. Here are now 15 producing oil
wells. This company seeks through this proposed legislation te get power te -cross the
interprovincial boundary line and build its
line into the province of Saskatchewan in
order te tap these new developing fields, and
of course i. seeking such power it necessarily
cornes under the general Pipe Lines Act.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Does tbe company
bave to incorporate in Saskatchewan?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No. Even if it incorporated i. Saskatchewan it would need to came
te Ottawa for authority for the interprovincial
lime under the general Pipe Lines Act. This
bill merely gives the company power-subject
te approval by the authorities under the
general Pipe Lines Act-to extend its pipe
Unme into the province cf Saskatchewan, tap
this oil producing area, and carry oil to these
areas: that is, te Cromer, wbicb is the nearest
point at which it can tap the interprovincial
pipe line, and where, in addition, the interprovincial pipe line bas a pumping station.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Would the company
obtain that authority by virtue of this bull?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes, this bill would give
it power te extend into Saskatchewan, subject
to approval of the proper authorities, under
the general Pipe Lines Act.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The passing of this bill
would simply give the company authority to

EQUITABLE FIRE INSURANCE COMPANY
OF CANADA-SECOND
READING

Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt moved the second
reading of Bill V-12, an Act respecting Equitable Fire Insurance Company of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to extend the period of time
during which the Minister of Finance may
grant a certificate of registry to this insurance
company.
The Equitable Fire Insurance Company
obtained a federal charter in 1952, chapter
61. This federal company is to replace the
company bearing the same name and which
has operated since 1901, pursuant to a provincial charter. Therefore, the purpose is
to transfer the operations of the Equitable
Fire Insurance Company from its provincial
charter to a federal charter.
Subsection 2 of section 4 of the Canadian
and British Insurance Companies Act provides that the charter granted to an insurance
company shall expire unless the certificate
of registry is obtained within a period of two
years after the charter has been granted. In
the present case the delay is due to the fact
that the company had problems to settle with
federal and provincial income tax authorities,
concerning the payment of the capital of the
provincial company and the transfer of the
surplus to the new federal company. These
income tax problems were settled only
recently, and the consent of the shareholders
of the provincial company had to be obtained
for this purpose.
The present bill is similar to other bills
which have been passed under similar circumstances. Reference may be made to
11-12 George VI, chapter 86, and 14 George
VI, chapter 58.
This bill is presented at the suggestion and
with the complete approval of the federal
Department of Insurance. If the bill receives
second reading this afternoon, I will move
that it be referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Before the motion passes,
may I ask the sponsor of the bill whether
any objection has been registered to the use

Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Yes, very old; it
goes back to 1901.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I
think it is usual to extend the time for the
filing of a certificate to a reasonable period
after incorporation, when a satisffactory
explanation for the delay has been given.
I think that the honourable gentleman from
Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) has given
such an explanation in this instance, and
that he is quite in order in asking for the
extension of time.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

YUKON PIPELINES LIMITEDSECOND READING

Hon. William H. Golding moved the second
reading of Bill X-12, an Act to incorporate
Yukon Pipelines Limited.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
seeks to incorporate Yukon Pipelines Limited.
Clause 1 reads as follows:
Frank H. Brown, president of the White Pass
and Yukon Corporation Limited, Clifford J. Rogers,
president of British Columbia-Yukon Railway Company, Edward M. C. McLorg, barrister, and Albert
P. Friesen, accountant, all of the city of Vancouver,
in the province of British Columbia; Alexander
Neill McGregor, barrister, James Ralph Johnston,
barrister, and Diantha Alice Herbert, stenographer,
ail of the city of Ottawa, in the province of
Ontario, together with such persons as may become
shareholders in the company, are incorporated
under the name of Yukon Pipelines Limited, hereinafter called "the Company".

I understand, honourable senators, that this
bill follows the usual pattern of pipe line
bills which have come before the Senate.
Clause 5 states:
5. The Company shall have ail the powers, privileges and immunities conferred by, and be subject
to ail the limitations, liabilities and provisions of
the Pipe Lines Act, and any other general legislation relating to pipe lines enacted by Parliament
with respect to the transportation and transmission
of oil and gas and other liquid and gaseous
hydrocarbons.

MAY !
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: To what territory does
this proposed company's business apply?
Hon. Mr. Golding: The explanation of the
bill given to me is as follows:
The proposed legislation is for a pipe line
bill limited to British Columbia and the Yukon
in Canada, and outside Canada. It will be
noticed that the applicants for incorporation
are officers of the White Pass and Yukon
Route. The immediate purpose of the incorporators, if the legislation is enacted, is to
provide for:
(a) The continued operation of the existing
4-inch pipe line between Skagway, Alaska,
and Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, used for
the transportation of fuel and diesel oils.
(b) The construction and operation in due
course of a pipe line between the same points
for the transportation of gasoline and other
volatile petroleum products.
The existing 4-inch pipe line was constructed by the American Army in 1942 along
the right of way of the White Pass and Yukon
railway for the purpose of pumping all types
of liquid petroleum products from Skagway
to Whitehorse and thence to Alaska. The
petroleums in question were brought up
from California by tanker, unloaded into
storage tanks at Skagway and in due course
pumped north for Army and Air Force use
-both
Canadian and American and for
civilian use in the Whitehorse area.
The pipe line has continued in operation
to the present date, except that since the end
of the war only low volatile fuel and diesel
oils, instead of both gasoline and fuel oils,
have been put through the line-the elimination of gasoline being out of regard for safety
of passenger traffic on the railway.
Some time this summer the American Army
will probably discontinue use of this line in
favour of their new 8-inch pipe line, now
nearing completion, which runs from Haines,
Alaska, to a point on the Alaska Highway
about 100 miles northwest of Whitehorse
and then on to Fairbanks.
The White Pass and Yukon Route has been
intimately associated with the operation of
this line from its -inception. Through its
section hands it maintains continuous inspection. Its repair gangs carry out all required
repairs on behalf of the United States Army.
The line follows all the company's tunnels,
snow sheds and bridges in the railway's
precipitous passage through the mountains.
In many places the line is at the end of the
ties and in a few places is in between the
rails.
The White Pass and Yukon employees are
fully familiar with the pumping and other
operating facilities of the system and are

completely equipped to take over its operation at a day's notice. It thus becomes a
natural thing that when the United States
Army ceases to operate the line the White
Pass and Yukon Route should seek to take
over this function in its place.
That is the explanation of the bill which
has been given to me. If the bill is given
second reading I will move that it be referred
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Honourable senators, I
would draw the attention of the sponsor of
this bill to the fact that in addition to the
provisions concerning the pipe line itself the
bill also contains provisions dealing with
radio, telephone and telegraph communication
facilities. It would seem to me, therefore,
that the bill should go to the Committee on
Transport and Communications.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Are there no provisions in the other bills dealing with radio,
telephone and telegraph communication
facilities?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I do not think there are.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have before me the
bill to incorporate Petroleum Transmission
Company and I notice that in clause 6 there
is authority to operate such facilities. There
is a similar clause in other bills.
Hon. Mr. Golding: Honourable senators, it
would be quite agreeable to me to have the
bill referred to the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question is on the motion of the Hon.
Senator Golding for second reading of the
bill. Is it your pleasure ta adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Honourable senators,
before the motion is voted on, I would like
to ask one question which perhaps the honourable senator from Huron-Perth (Hon. Mr.
Golding) can answer.
Yesterday the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell) presented Bill
Z-12, and Act to incorporate Trans-Border
Pipeline Company, Ltd., the second reading
of which he proposes to move on Tuesday.
Now, the same project is envisaged in the bill
before us as is envisaged in Bill Z-12. I
would like to ask whether the second reading
of the bill we are now considering would
interfere with proper consideration of the bill
to be explained later by the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell).

of these bills would give the two companies

proper committee to consider the present bill.
Hon. Mr. Golding: I think there is some

of the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: When I rose a few

all the bills of this type which have come
before us were sent to the Banking and
Commerce Committee, but it appears that
some have gone to the Standing Committee
on Transport and Communications. I think
it is unfortunate that bills of the same general character have been referred to two
different committees. Apparently the first
measure of this kind was referred to the
Standing Committee on Transport and Communications. I agree with the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)

and the honourable senator from HuronPerth (Hon. Mr. Golding) that the same
committee should have dealt with them ail.
Hon. Mr. Euler: In this matter we should
have uniformity, and if a mistake has been
made, in that previous bills of the same
general subject-matter have been referred
to two different committees, let us decide to
which committee such bills should be referred. If some have already been referred
to another committee, we should reverse
our action and deal with them al on a
basis of uniformity.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: May I be informed, by
either the honourable Leader of the Government or by the honourable Leader of the
Opposition, what authority issues licences

Hon. Mr. Haig: The Department of Transport.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I think that answer should

PRIVATE BILLS
STANMOUJNT PIPE LINE COMIPANYSECOND READING
Hon. W. D. Euler moved the second reading
of Bill T-12, an Act ta incorparate Stanmount
Pipe Line Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
similar to others which either bave been given
the third reading in the Senate or are still
on the Order Paper. However, it differs somewhat from some of the bills which bave been
accepted, in that other charters wbich have
been granted deal with oil or gas produced
in Canada, and which in most cases is transparted to other points within Canada.
This bull would incorporate a campany
which proposes to build a pipe line of approximately 140 miles from the Beaver Lodge field,
North Dakota, through the Tioga field, North
Dakota, through southeastern Saskatchewan
to Cromer, Manitoba, where it would join
the interprovincial pipe lime, which at first is
carried along Lake Superior, and thence to
Sarnia. Tbe reason for doing sa is to obviate
the necesslty of building a line direct ta the
United States markets to which tbis oil is
supposed to be carried. The company proposes not to seil the oil in Canada, but to take
it to the interprovincial. pipe line at Cramer,
which would carry it in bond ta a point in thé
United States where it would be sold and
distributed ta the consurners in that country.
An American company bas been incorporated
under the name Stanmaunt Pipe Line Company, Inc., and it is proposed that it wrnl be
a wholly awned subsidiary of Stanmount Pipe
Line Company.
Hon. MT. Macdonald: It has nothing ta do
with the Interprovincial Pipe Line Company?
Hon. Mr. Euler: Nothing ta do with it at ail,
except that the Interprovincial will transport

the oil at this point, and it will be carried
east and then back into the United States, in
order to save the cost of building a main pipe
line entirely within the United States. I
would judge that there could be no objection
to it; in fact, everything is in favour of using
the interprovincial pipe uine if it has accommodation for 30,000 or 40,000 barrels a day,
and assurance has been given that this is the
case. The cost of the project would be in the
neighbourhood of $6 million, about half of
which, it is said, will be expended in Canada.
I understand that these fields are located in
the Williston Basin, which bas estimated reserves of 600 million barrels of crude ail.
Honourable senators, there is not much
further information that I can give. I should
perhaps point out that the line will be se
constructed that the transportation may be
reversed in case of an emergency. Whereas
most of the oul, perhaps, would come from the
United States to the interprovincial line at
Cromer, it could also be reversed, and oil
could be carried from the Canadian fields into
the United States for use there.
If the bill receives second reading, I will
move that it be referred to an apprapriate
cammittee, where further questions could be
asked and answered.
Hon. Mr. Farris: May I ask my honourable
friend if any consideration bas been given
ta the question of jurisdiction?
Hon. Mr. Euler: I cannot answer that question.

The motion was agreed to, and the bill

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Euler, the bill was
referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
DOMINION OF CANADA GENERAL INSURANCE
COMPANY-SECOND READING

Hon. G. Peter Campbell moved the second
reading of Bill W-12, an Act respecting the
Dominion of Canada General Insurance Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
provides amendments to the original act of
incorporation of the Dominion of Canada
General Insurance Company, which was incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1887.
Naturally, quite a number of changes have
taken place in the business and the capital
of this company since its original act of
incorporation. It is one of the old, leading
insurance companies, having its head office
in the city of Toronto, and it engages in all
branches of insurance business except that
of writing participating life insurance.
Honourable senators may be interested in
a brief history of some of the changes which
have taken place. The company was originally incorporated in 1887 under the name of
the Manufacturers Accident Insurance Company. Its capital at that time was $500,000,
and subsequently, in 1893, its name was
changed to the Manufacturers Guarantee and
Accident Insurance Company; and certain of
its powers to write liability insurance were
extended by the amendment at that time. In
1898 the name of the company was changed
to the Dominion of Canada Guarantee &
Accident Insurance Company, and in 1929 to
its present name, The Dominion of Canada
General Insurance Company.
As I have said, honourable senators, from
time to time there have been many changes
in the capital structure of this company. The
present authorized capital is $6,500,000, of
which $5 million is divided into 50,000 class
A shares of $100 par value each, and 15,000
ordinary shares of the same par value. The
class A shares carry no voting rights whatsoever. The issued and outstanding capital
at the present time consists of 10,103 ordinary
shares, and the total amount paid on those
shares is $1,010,300. No class A shares are
outstanding.
The bill before the house provides for the
reduction of the authorized capital of the

company from $6,500,000 to $2 million, and
for the division of the capital into 200,000
ordinary shares having a par value of $10
each; and the subdivision of the 10,103 shares,
issued and outstanding and having a par
value of $100 each, into 101,030 shares, having
a par value of $10, on the basis of ten new
shares for each one now outstanding.
The explanatory notes to the bill set forth
the changes which have taken place in the
capital structure of this company.
I should draw to the attention of honourable senators the fact that certain technical
questions arise with respect to preference
shares which were at one time outstanding
and which, with the unanimous consent of all
the holders, were redeemed. A technical
question has been raised as to whether the
redemption of the preference shares was
proper within the provisions of the act of
incorporation and amending acts up to that
time. Therefore, this bill would, if passed,
rectify any irregularities which may have
taken place. A full explanation will be available when the bill goes to committee.
The bill would authorize the company to
increase its capital by by-law to an amount
not exceeding $6 million, upon approval
having first been obtained in the usual way
by two-thirds of the votes cast at a special
general meeting of the shareholders called
for the purpose of considering the matter.
Further, the bill would clarify the voting
rights of shareholders after the subdivision
of shares on the basis of ten shares for one.
The original act of incorporation provided
specifically that there should be one vote for
each share of $100 par value. Now that there
will no longer be shares of a par value of
$100, it is necessary to have a declaration
that each shareholder shall have one vote
for each share of stock registered in his
name.
Provision is made that the company shall
be authorized to carry on the business of
insurance in all its forms, except participating
life insurance. That, I may say, is a clarification of the powers of the company, and
merely confirms the various amendments
which from time to time have been made
and which permit the company to write the
insurance it is now writing.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my friend a
question? Is it proposed to change the name
of the company in any way?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: No, the name remains
the same.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Honourable senators, I also
should like to ask a question. Since section
1 of the bill repeals subsection 2 of section

MAY 10, 1955
4 of chapter 105 of the statutes of 1887, why
is it necessary to say in section 5 of the bill:
I'Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection
2 of section 4 of chapter 105 of the statutes
of 1887"? 1 arn merely trying to reconcile
sections 1 and 5 of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Section 5 is merely
to clarify the voting rights of shareholders.
Hon. Mr. Vien: But would it flot suffice to
commence section 5 with the words "At any
meeting of shareholders . .. ?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I be permitted
to say that in 1887 subsection 2 of section 4
of chapter 105 was in effect.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Yes, but this bill would
have no retroactive effect. The provision is
only for the future, and the bull repeals
subsection 2.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: But it was flot
repealed when that earlier act came into
effect.
Hon. Mr. Vien: True; but as I say, we are
legislating for the future, and upon the passage of this bill subsection 2 of the earller
act will be repealed.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I arn not sure that I
follow.

Hon. Mr. Isnor: May I ask a further question as to a point raised a few moments ago?
Do I infer from section 5 that the shareholders represented by $2 million worth of stock
will have full voting power, while holders of
the balance, possibly $4,500,000 worth of
stock, will have no voting power?
Mon. Mr. Campbell: Under the new capittalization all shares will carry equal voting
rights. As I have already said, the original
act of incorporation, which was subsequently
amended, provided for Class A shares and
ordinary shares of authorized capital, but no
Class A shares were ever issued. Upon the
passage of this bill all shareholders will have
voting rights.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Honourable senators, I
would just like to know whether I amn quite
clear in my understanding of what the senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell) has
said. I think he said that this bill would not
add any powers to those which this company
now has in the field of insurance. Is that
correct?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: This company has been

SENATE
CANADIAN UNION CONFERENCE CORPORATION
OF SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTSSECOND READING

Hon. Arthur Roebuck moved the second
reading of Bill Y-12, an Act to incorporate
The Canadian Union Conference Corporation of Seventh-day Adventists.
He said: Honourable senators, the bill itself
is a very ordinary one so far as form is
concerned. In form, it is probably not in
the least degree controversial; but its purpose, of course, is another matter. The purpose is to unite two of the very important
religious institutions of this country into one
conference for all Canada. The bill, I think,
is quite regular, and if it is given second
reading I will move that it be referred to
the appropriate committee.
But while the bill seems so entirely regular,
a few words, I think, are in order with
reference to the organization itself and its
accomplishments, and the reason why the
bill is being introduced at the present time.
Some senators may know very well of the
sect or denomination known as the Seventhday Adventists, for it is spread all through the
provinces of Canada, and in very considerable
numbers of membership. There are others,
however-I myself am one-who until
recently knew it only as a name. That is
why I think that a few words with regard
to the institution, what it is and so forth, may
be found of interest.
The name itself is indicative of the tenets of
the church. An Adventist, as I understand it,
is one who awaits the second coming of the
Founder of Christianity to this earth. And
the Seventh-day Adventist is one who endeavours to follow literally the commandments of both the Old and the New Testaments. The Church accepts the account of the
creation as stated, that it was accomplished in
seven days, the seventh day being the day
of rest, and according to its tenets and calculations that day of rest falls on Saturday.
So, in common with the men and women of
the synagogue, the Church accepts Saturday
as the day of the week to keep holy.
It is not a radical church by any means.
The Seventh-day Adventists are not, as I
understand, innovators in any respect, but
look upon themselves as an orthodox Christian
church. The history of the movement is
interesting at this time, since we are dealing
with it in a legislative way. In the last
few years of the eighteenth century and the
early decades of the nineteenth century there
developed among a good many Christians
of practically all denominations a profound
conviction of the second coming of Christ,
and that that coming was imminent, was at
hand.

Some students of the sayings of the prophets set the date for the return of Christ to
earth in the year 1844. These were the forerunners of the present Seventh-day Advent-

ists. Of course, these good people, devout
Christians as they were, and students of Holy
Writ, were disappointed, and then they seem

to have joined their theological opponents in
interpreting the prophesies to mean a moral
regeneration. They still, I understand, expect
the second coming, and they also expect, as
they phrase it, that righteousness will cover
the earth "as the waters cover the sea"-to
quote the words of Isaiah.
It was out of that movement, a thoroughly
devout and serious movement, that the
present Seventh-day Adventists organization
arose. In its early years, the movement was
very loosely knit and it was not until 1863
that a formal denominational organization
was established. At that time, it had a constituency of 125 churches and 3,500 members.
The headquarters were first located in Battle
Creek, Michigan. That was in 1863; but in
1903 they were transferred to Washington,
where they are at present.
Since that early establishment the Church
has spread throughout practically the civilized

world and has enjoyed a phenominal

growth. By 1954 the Church had just short
of one million members-to be exact, 924,822
baptized, adult members. There were 11,158
churches, with 39,225 salaried workers, in
198 countries

of

the

world. The Church's

educational system comprised 4,842 schools
and 234,000 students. In 1952, the Church
was operating 114 hospitals and sanatoria,
with staffs of 8,785 employees.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Has the honourable
senator the figures for Canada?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, I will quote them
in a moment.
The accredited Church institutions graduate annually about 90 physicians and 450
nurses. In 1953 the members of this Church
gave over $60 million for church work, together with $10 million for welfare work in
aid of 1,200,000 persons. These figures relate
to North America only.
The denomination operates 40 publishing
bouses, of which 34 are overseas. In 1953 it
printed its literature in 198 languages, with
sales running to $17 million.
These statistics, relating to the general
Church, show that it is an institution of very

considerable magnitude.
I will now give some figures relating to
Canada, in which honourable senators will
be more interested, I suppose, than in the
general statistics.
The movement spread to this country over
one hundred years ago. The first orgarized

MAY 10, 1955
church of Seventh-Day Adventists was
founded in the Eastern Townships of Quebec
in 1857, so that in 1957 the Church in Canada
will celebrate its one hundredth anniversary
of organized activities in this country. As
congregations were established in the various
provinces of Canada, they formed themselves
into local Conferences, with certain managerial functions. In Canada today, there are
six Conferences. British Columbia has one
Conference, Alberta another, SaskatchewanManitoba a third, Ontario-Quebec a fourth,
the Maritimes-New Brunswick, Nova Scotia
and Prince Edward Island-a fifth, and the
new province of Newfoundland, the sixth.
There is also what is known as the St.
Lawrence Mission for French-speaking Canadians, with local headquarters in Montreal.
The three Eastern Conferences and the St.
Lawrence Mission decided to incorporate,
and in 1916 they combined to form The
Eastern Canadian Union Conference Corporation of Seventh-day Adventists. They
were incorporated by Act of the Parliament
of Canada on May 18, 1916: 6-7 George V,
chapter 56. The three Western Conferences,
namely British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan-Manitoba, followed suit, and were
incorporated, by chapter 103 of the statutes
of 1920, as The Western Canadian Union
Corporation of Seventh-day Adventists.
I have no doubt that the great distances
and more limited travelling facilities of the
times influenced the leaders to form two
union conferences. But, in keeping with
present-day progress, in communications and
otherwise, these churches have now determined to ask Parliament to allow them to
combine into one Union Conference for all
Canada. The name chosen is "The Canadian
Union Conference Corporation of Seventhday Adventists". The head office is to be in
the city of Oshawa, Ontario.
- Hon. Mr. Quinn: That is the main object of
the bill?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is the object of
the bill.
The rapid growth of the Church movement
in Canada since the incorporation of 1920
is, no doubt, a further reason for the amalgamation.
As of the year 1954, in the Western Union
there were 93 Churches; an adult, baptized
membership of 8,505 persons, 37 ordained
ministers, and 25 employed persons doing
ministerial work.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Does that comprise the
United Conferences?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No. The bill relates
ta all Canada; the Western Union, to which
I have just referred, consists of the three

Conferences of British Columbia, Alberta, and
Saskatchewan-Manitoba; and it is to these
three Conferences that the figures I have just
given relate. In the Eastern Union there were
60 churches, 4,134 baptized, adult members,
23 ordained ministers, and 20 employed persons doing ministerial work. So that, if and
when this bill becomes law, the new all-Canadian Union will comprise 153 churches, 60
ordained ministers, and an adult baptized
membership of 12,639 persons.
The new Union Corporation will operate 48
elementary schools in Canada, with an enrolment of over 1,200 pupils. There is, also, a
senior college at Lacombe, Alberta, and a
junior college at Oshawa, Ontario. There is a
publishing house at Oshawa, with a net worth
of just under $1 million, and a hospital at
Sidney, British Columbia. Another hospital is
now under construction near Toronto.
Honourable senators will observe from this
short and concise outline that the organization of Seventh-day Adventists in Canada is
a going concern of very considerable magnitude, with enterprise and industry to its
credit. It is an institution, I submit also,
which by its virility and good works, and by
the large number of devout, Christian, Canadian citizens whom it serves, justifies our
most careful consideration.
I feel that I am honoured in asking my
fellow senators to join with me in helping
this good work along by giving this bill
second reading.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Would the honourable senator tell the house if the Canadian organization is autonomous and what its relationship
is to the headquarters in Washington to which
he has referred?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The American and
Canadian organization hold the same tenets
and ideals, but the corporation referred to
in the bill is given power to hold property
and to dispose of it, together with certain
managerial authority. The new body is an
ordinary Canadian corporation with entirely
autonomous rights and powers, with no subservience to any other authority in the United
States or elsewhere. The American leaders
will no doubt exercise great influence in
many conferences between the parties, but
there will be no domination or control by the
United States organization over the Canadian
corporation.
Hon. Mr. Vien: The Canadian corporation
is autonomous?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is undoubtedly so.
Honourable senators, I intend to move that
this bill be referred to committee, and so I
need not go over the details. The two present

SENATE

acts of incorporation are repealed by the bill
which creates the new corporation, which is
given authority to hold property and to dispose of it.

ta explain that when the eight-imch lime is

it is likely that this four-inch lime crossing

will probably be available for lease or

Hon. Mr. Davies: Can the Senate grant
two separate companies the power ta establish
pipe lines over an international line at the

Hon. Mr. Campbell: No power is given by
this bill ta construct any particular pipe line,
and Parliament does not deal with that matter
at ail. That is deait wîth by the Transport
Board, upon application of the company after
it is incarporated. By passing an act incorporating the compamy Parliament does not
give any power whatsoever ta construct a
particular pipe lime, or to lease or operate a
pipe lime. But an act of incorporation is
required before any negatiations may be
opened or bef are any application may be
made ta the Transport Board.
To continue with my remarks, there is no
doubt that whoever wrnl be successful in
negotiating a lease or purchase of the foaurinch line crossing the Camadian territory will
be required ta give an undertaking that it
wrnl be maintained at ail times, and subsequently it might be required by the Canadian
authorities for use in transporting petroleumn
produets.
Homourable senators, the rest of the bull is
in the usual f orm. As I have stated, the
purpose of seeking the act of incorporation
is ta ènable the company, if It is successful
in negotiating a lease or purchase of the lime,
ta apply ta the Transport Board for permission ta operate.
The motion was agreed ta, and the bull was

REWERRED TO COMM1TTEE

Hon. Mr. Campbell: Hanourable senatars,
I mnove that this bill be referred ta the
Standing Committee on Transport and
Communications.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I do
flot care what is done with the bill, but I
should like ta point out that the other bill
for the same lime was referred ta the Banking
and Commerce committee.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Were they not bath
referred ta the samne committee?

Hon. Mr. Haig: Unlike some others, I was
here when that bill was referred ta the
Banking and Commerce committee. I think
this bill should also go ta that committee,
so that the whole matter can be discussed by
the same members. If there is a fight between
the two companies, I have no objection. I arn
sure if I were a shareholder in the Yukon
raflroad I would be tickied ta death to see
them flght for the line.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I move, then, that the
bill be referred ta the Banking and Commerce
committee.
Hon. J. Wesley Siambaugh: Honourable
senators, I would like to give same reasons
why I think ail these pipe line bis should
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications. It was a mistake ta refer one or two bis ta the Banking
and Commerce committee, and we should not
make a further mistake of that kind.
I would like ta take honourable senators
back ta the year 1949, when the original
bull was introduced for the regulation of al
companies incorporated to transport gas and
ail by pipe line. It was considered s0 impartant a matter that we had the Hon. Mr.
Chevrier, then Minister of Transpart, came
ta the Senate and explain the bill. It was
painted out that we were breaking new
ground, that it was a new f arm of a bill, and
that because ail and gas had been discovered
in vast quantities, especially in Alberta,
numerous pipe lime companies had asked
for permission to transp)ort oil and gas
across bath provincial and international
baundarles. Mr. Chevrier explained that five
different campanies were waiting far, or had
applied for, federal incorporation, and they
cauld not receive incorporation until that
general Pipe Limes Bill had been passed.
Two of those companies waiting for incorporation were Interprovincial Pipe Line Company and Westcoast Transmission Company
Limited, and they were very important companies. After his explanatian, Mr. Chevrier
said that he hoped we would give very caref ul consideration ta the bill. In order that
the bill might receive the careful consideration that the minister urged, the present
Speaker of this house, who was then the
Leader of the Govermmemt in the Semate,
moved that the bill be referred to the Committee on Transport and Communications. It
was referred ta that committee, as were the
bills for incorporation of the five compamies
that were waitimg for incorporation, which
bills were later passed by both hauses.
Last Thursday it was suggested that legal
questions were involved in these pipe line
bills, and that the Committee on Banking
and Commerce was particularly competent to

SENATE

study the bills and give them the necessary
consideration because many members of the
legal profession are on the committee. I must
confess that I do not see any reason for so
many lawyers being members of a committee.
Two should be enough-one on each sideand when they have given their reasons pro
and con the other members of the committee,
ordinary people like myself, could be, as it is
called in legal phraseology, "a jury of their
peers".
However, if it would make anyone feel
better, I would like to point out that a
number of legal men are members of the
Committee on Transport and Communications. I think the Chairman of that committee
-Senator Hugessen-has the best legal mind
in the house.
Some Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: Looking down the
list I see the names of some other lawyers:
Senators Aseltine, Bouffard, Campbell, Connolly, Haig, Hayden, KinleyHon. Mr. Macdonald: He has not yet been
called to the Bar.
Hon. Mr. S±ambaugh: He talks like a lawyer, so I thought be was one.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In the profession we call
him a "sidewalk lawyer".
Hon. Mr. S±ambaugh: I note also the names
of Senators Roebuck and Vien. No doubt
other lawyers are members of that committee,
but surely I have named enough. And we
always have Mr. MacNeill, the Law Clerk of
the Senate, to keep us on a straight course in
legal matters.
This bill is in the standard form. In view
of the explanation given, I am sure no one
can reasonably object to it being referred to
the Committee on Transport and Communications, where it would receive most careful
consideration.

The motion of Hon. Mr. Campbell was
agreed to, and the bill was referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
RAINY RIVER BRIDGE
SUBSTITUTION OF PETITION-REPORT OF
COMMITTEE CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the fourth report of the Standing Committee
on Standing Orders.
Hon. Charles L. Bishop, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Standing Orders,
moved concurrence in the report.
He said: Honourable senators, when this
report was presented, on Thursday last, the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck), requested an explanation. As I did not clearly grasp at the
moment just what he wished to have clarified,
I asked that consideration of the report be
allowed to stand until tonight.
The explanation is very simple.
On
February 28 a petition was presented to the
Senate asking for an act to authorize the
construction of a toll bridge between the
village of Baudette, in Minnesota, and the
town of Rainy River, in Ontario. That petition has been withdrawn and a new one now
is substituted. The incorporators mentioned
in the first petition were from Minnesota.
Those in the substitute petition are mainly
from the Ontario side, which I am told
brought the petition into conformity with the
usage in the parliamentary incorporation of
a Canadian company.
The motion was agreed to, and the report
was concurred in.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

True, I arn not thinking of the political
implications and considerations which have,
perhaps, actuated governments in delaying
these appointments and permitting this remarkable accumulation of vacancies. I arn
quite sincerely thinking of the public good
and of the usefulness and efficiency of the
Senate, which it is the duty and the responsibility of every senator to defend and to,
protect.
I remember very well the late Prime Minister King's frequent practice of quoting frorn

BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACTS
AMENDMENT BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READENGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. W. D. Euler moved the second reading
of Bihl H-10, an Act to amend the British
North America Acts, 1867 to 1952.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill, as is quite evident to, those who
have read it, is to correct a practice which
bas grown since Confederation itsehf, is contrary to the public interest and is a challenge
to the usefulness of the Senate. I refer to the
practice which seems to have grown into a
government policy of postponing the fllling of
vacancies in the Senate, permitting very large
accumulations of vacancies, until today out
of 102 seats in this chamber 21 are unfiheda fifth of our total membership. To my mind
this policy threatens the integrity of this
branch of Parliament.
This bill proposes to correct that situation
and the possibility of its recurrence by mnaking it mandatory to fili every vacancy within
a period of six months from the date on which
it occurs. Let me emphasize, lest there be
sorne misunderstanding, that in brlnging forward this bill I have flot the remotest desire

The Governor General shall from time to, time,
in the Queen's name, by instrument under the
Great Seal of Canada, summon qualified persons
to the Senate; and, subject to the provisions of this
Act, every person so summoned shail become and
be a member of the Senate and a senator.

Of the present 21 vacancies, 6 have existed
for one year, 5 f or two years, 3 for four
years, 5 for five years, and 1 is well on to,
the seventh year.
Now, surely the clause which I have just
read implies that appointments to the Senate
should be made within a reasonable tirne
after the vacancies occur; and, though I arn
not a lawyer nor the son of a lawyer, 1
imagine that the courts would so construe it.
Surely, also, no senator will say that two,
four, five and seven years is a reasonable
The bill, therefore, makes specific
time.
what is already inherent in the constitution.
I have inserted the term of six months in
the bill because it seems reasonable, and for
the additional reason that we have an excellent
precedent in an amendment which was made
in 1919 to the House of Commons Act. That
year Mr. S. W. Jacobs, a close personal friend
of mine in the House of Commons, of which
I was then a member, introduced a bill
providing that within sixty days after the
Speaker was notified that a vacancy existed
in the Commons a writ must issue for a byelection. It happened in many cases that
when a vacancy occurred in the Commons a
by-election was not called, and the constituency affected was without a representative until the next general election. Speaking in support of his bll, Mr. Jacobs said:
It proposes to amend the House of Commons Act
and It deelares that within sixty days after the
Clerk of the Crown ia Chancery receives a warrant
for the issue of a new writ for the election of a
member, the wTlt in question shail issue. In other'

SENATE
words, it provides that the election shall take place
automatically within a fixed period after the
electoral seat has been declared vacant.

That statement was made on the motion
for first reading. As honourable senators who
are ex-members of the Commons know, it is
the custom to give a brief explanation of a
bill on first reading in that chamber-a
practice which is not usually followed here.
In the debate on the second reading Mr.
Jacobs spoke as follows:
This measure, Mr. Speaker, is designed to correct
certain abuses which have arisen under the House
of Commons Act with respect to electoral matters.
It provides for automatic by-elections. As is well
known, under the present system there is no
provision for elections to be held at a certain
stated period when a seat tas been declared vacant
and the result is that vacant seats have been made
political footballs by the party in power ever
since the House of Commons Act was placed upon
the statute-books. I submit that the law as it now
stands is undemocratic, that it is not according to
British precedent, and that it is high time that
some change be made whereby constituencies which
have become vacant shall not be kept disfranchised
for periods ranging from six months to three

years.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: What is the reference?
Hon. Mr. Euler:
House of Commons
Hansard, September 18, 1919.
Mr. Jacobs, and the House of Commons
also, seemed to think that a period of six
months to three years was a rather long time
for a constituency to be without a member to
represent it; but as I have stated already, in
this bouse we have a good many vacancies
which have extended for a much longer
period.
We note also that the period he inserted in
his bill was sixty days. The bill was referred
to a committee, and there the period of sixty
days was amended to read six months, the
same period as I have inserted in the bill
before us. Perhaps it is remarkable that,
although the Union Government was then in
office, a government to which Mr. Jacobs, a
Liberal, was opposed politically, it accepted
his bill.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Was that a bill to
amend the British North America Act?
Hon. Mr. Euler: No; a bill to amend the
House of Commons Act. But the result would
be the same. Parliament, I understand, now
has the power which it had not at that time,
to amend the British North America Act.
I might remark, perhaps more by way of
jest than otherwise, that if a Government
could accept a bill submitted by a member
of the Opposition-perhaps an almost unprecedented circumstance -it should not be
too much to hope that the present Government will accept a bill which is submitted
by a man who still cails himself a Liberal.

At any rate, I hope the bill will be
accepted. I think it should be welcomed by
the Government. Someone has suggested that
passage of the bill might embarrass the
Government. That may be one argument
advanced against the bill-I do not knowbut I think it can be argued that the present
condition is a greater embarrassment to the
Government than there would be if this bill
were passed. I submit that, once the present
vacancies are filled, there should be very
little embarrassment to the Government, if
any at all, for there would no longer be any
great accumulation of vacancies.
From time to time suggestions have been
made for the reform of the Senate, but I am
not going to make any proposals of that kind.
These suggestions have been made in the
press, in the House of Commons and in the
Senate itself, some regarding the method of
appointment-on which I have my own
opinions-some for an age limit-and I believe there is a bill before the House of Commons now with regard to that-some for an
elective Senate, and some even for its abolition. I have some views with regard to reforms that could be made, but this is probably
not the time to discuss them. None have
received strong support, and so nothing has
been done. I have not included any of them
in the bill before the house, for I felt they
would merely create unnecessary discussion.
The amendment which I propose is a legitimate and logical one, upon which I think all
senators might well agree without offence to
the government or the Senate.
I am not even suggesting that the Senate
should continue. I am on record in another
place with regard to that, and I have no
particular apologies to make for it. However,
I do submit in all sincerity that if we are
to have a Senate at all it ought to be fully
constituted, and not be destroyed by this
slow process of attrition.
This bill is not primarily a criticism of the
Government; it is a criticism of a practice
to which the Government bas fallen heir
and which it bas continued, and for that it
must assume its share of responsibility.
The Senate, when fully constituted, has
102 members: 24 from the three Maritime
provinces, 24 from Quebec, 24 from Ontario,
24 from the provinces west of Lake Superior,
and 6 from the new province of Newfoundland.
Let me give some facts and figures to
substantiate my statement that other administrations have been guilty of this practice.
I could go back practically to Confederation,
but shall confine myself to the last six Parliaments, some twenty-five years.

of being equal before the law, are, I am sure
all honourable senators will agree, the priceless freedoms which we should cherish and
protect at all times. Now, if we are going to
preserve those freedoms, I submit that it is
most important that we in Parliament should
conduct ourselves in such a way that the
people will have respect for and confidence
in not only the legislative programs that may
be put forward, but in our great institutions
of freedom.
We have no guarantee, honourable senators,
that the present state of affairs will continue
indefinitely. The greatest danger to free
institutions is the apathy and indifference of
the electorate. It is frightening to note that
at Uies in municipal elections, for instance,
only 25 or 30 or 40 per cent of the electors
think it worth while to register a vote for
the candidate of their choice; indeed, that is
too often the result after large sums of money
are spent on publicity and promotion of
various kinds to induce the electorate to vote.
And under similar conditions in provincial
and federal elections, on occasion, less than
two-thirds of the electors have voted.
I submit that if that state of apathy and
indifference increases we shal be nearing a
slippery slope which we should do everything in our power to avoid. Particularly
is that a danger sign in these days when
our free institutions are challenged throughout the world. Every one of us who follows
events in the world today knows that there
is a grave challenge to the whole concept of
freedorn and liberty, as we have understood
if and practised it. Therefore I submit that
it is of the utmost importance that we maintain our own house in order, that we keep
alive not only in our own bosoms, but in
the hearts of the people throughout the land,
the great blessing of freedom; for there is
something more important even than old age
pensions or social security, more important
than anything else, and that is the preservation of individual freedom. I believe this
measure is one that will tend to increase
interest in public affairs, and that it will
find a good reception among the Canadian
people. Let us seek the cause for this apathy,
this indifference that we see around us. Let
us seek the cause for the remark that was
made to me by a pretty intelligent voter when
I asked him what interest he was taking in
the election and he said: "Not very much.
I am going to vote for the party that will
promise to do the most for me". He was a
sincere individual, and quite honest in
expressing that view.
That attitude represents a serious state of
affairs which should never be absent from
our minds.
50437-29½

There are two dangers, it seems to me,
to this great cause of freedom. In a generation two wars were fought which have undoubtedly upset and disturbed the balance of
constructive and reasonable thinking in
matters of government. There can be no
gainsaying that. This phenomenon is not
confined alone to Canada. You will see it
elsewhere throughout the democratic nations.
Now, another thing-in saying this I trust
I shall not be misunderstood-I do think that
the philosophy of the welfare state has made
a very definite impact on the thinking of our
citizens everywhere. The more the idea grows
in the mind of the individual that in some
beneficient fashion the state is going to aid
him and look after him the more you undermine his concept of freedom and liberty and
his concept of responsible government. And
so today we have-not widespread, it is true
-those who advocate that some forms of
social security should be increased. We have
some who advocate that family allowances
should be doubled. We have some who
advocate that old age pensions should be
increased to $60 a month. I am not arguing
at the moment for or against thern, but I ask
honourable senators to reflect on the possible
effects, the growing effects, the expanding
effects of that upon the judgment of many
voters who should be guided as much as
possible by their reason and judgment as to
the policies this country should follow.
I come now to a brief discussion of the
Senate itself. Sometimes we talk a good
deal about what the Fathers of Confederation
had in mind when they framed our constitution. They provided for a Senate, that is, a
second chamber, in our legislative machinery;
and it is not too much to say that, whatever
the reasons for At may have been, confederation of the Canadian provinces could not
have been achieved if there had not been
provisions for a second chamber.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That was in keeping of
course with the practice in almost every
democratic country. I am using the term
"democratic" in the sense of a self-governing
country, where the people govern themselves
through their elected representatives.
Now, those who framed our constitution
recognized that the Senate should be a
different kind of body from the House of
Commons; and so in order that it might as
far as possible be free from, shall I say, the
gusts of emotion that sometimes arise in the
elective chamber, this house should be an
appointive chamber to which the members
should be appointed for life.

SENATE
But so far as my study of the matter
indicates, it was never in the minds of the
Fathers of Confederation that the Senate
should be merely a body to support whatever
legislation came to it from the Government
in power; and that is where I sometimes have
found myself at variance with honourable
colleagues in this house who belong to the
sarne political party as I do. In my judgment it is not enough-and I say it very
respectfully-it is not enough for this house
to cross the t's and dot the i's of all the legislation that comes to us from the other place.
I do not think that is fulfilling our function.
Of course there is a difference between the
Senate and the House of Commons. When
I was in the House of Commons I was a
partisan: I wanted the Government of which
I was a member, and the party which I
supported, to win the next election, and I did
all I modestly could to ensure that. There,
that kind of thing is entirely appropriate.
Issues are debated, and the only way people
have an opportunity to register their decision
cn those issues is through the candidates they
vote for in general elections. That is quite
proper, and no exception can be taken to it;
but I do think that when legislative proposals
come to the Senate this house should act as a
sort of court of review. That does not mean
that this body should flout the decisions of the
House of Commons. Far from it. Once the
people have clearly registered their verdict
on a question of public policy, whether we
consider that verdict a wise or unwise one,
I certainly do not wish to stand in the way
of passing such legislation. But I do think
there are occasions, frequent occasions, when
measures from the Commons should be
further considered, and I take it that the
main function of the Senate is to amend such
measures, or perhaps delay them-to give, if
I may use again the phrase that has often
been used before, an opportunity for a sober
second look at the proposed legislation.
One other point I wish to mention; and I
trust I shall not be misunderstood. This bill
merely provides that appointments to the
Senate shall take place within a certain time
after the vacancies occur. But there are other
matters of sorne importance for this house
to consider with a view of making this body
more effective. There have been many criticisms of the Senate, deriving mainly from the
idea it is a useless sort of body which does
whatever the Government of the day wants it
to do. I would like to briefly refer to this
notion that the Senate is an assembly of old
men;-I once heard them described as dod.dering old men".
An Hon. Senator: And young ladies!

Hon. Mr. Crerar: I have heard some excellent speeches in this chamber during the
session. I listened to what I thought was a
very powerful speech by the honourable senator frorn Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris)
when the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes
Bill presented by the honourable senator
from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) was under
consideration; and I thought that, for "a
doddering old man" in his seventies, be did
pretty well.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: What about yourself?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I am, I believe, senior to
the honourable senator from Vancouver
South. I offer no opinion whether I am
"doddering" or not; I leave that to the judgment of the house. But the criticism is both
silly and false, and we need pay no attention
whatever to the sources from which it comes.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Another criticism one
hears is based on the theory that the Senate
should be elective. I cannot agree with that.
If honourable senators are to be elected,
though even for a terrn longer than members
of the House of Commons, there will be
brought into this body the political differences which exist in the other house, and we
shall cease to be what in my judgment we
should be, a more or less independent body,
and become partisans, holding aloft the banOn that
ners of our respective parties.
ground, if the choice were between an elected
Senate and the abolition of this chamber, I
would vote to abolish the Senate altogether.
The next criticism to which I wish to refer
is that appointments should be for a fixed
term; that the Fathers of Confederation erred
when they provided that appointments should
be for life. I am bound to admit that argument is worth consideration; but if there are
to be tern appointments, the period should
be, in my humble opinion, at least twelve
years. I have an open mind concerning this
proposal: I am willing to consider it.
It bas also been suggested that there should
be a different basis of selection. There again,
it might be possible to make some improvement. Today, as everyone knows, the selection is made by the Prime Minister, though
usually with the approval of the Minister
from the province concerned, and of the Government as a whole. Is it possible to have a
wider basis of selection; to find ways whereby those who have served in, for example,
provincial legislatures, municipal work, and
other fields of the kind, could be brought in
more frequently than at present, to add their
experience to ours? I am not advocating that
proposal; I am merely putting it forward as
a suggestion. But I think that the subject

11, 1955

MAY
as a whole should have some consideration.
We hear talk of a constitutional conference,
and if it is to be held, not only these but
other matters might be considered. Of one
thing I am firmly convinced: it would be a
mistake to modify or change in any substantial degree the territorial representation in
this house; and this I say as one who comes
from one of the smaller provinces. I hope
that the balance as between the two central
provinces and the outlying provinces will be
held about where it is at the present time.
All these matters could, perhaps, profitably
engage our attention.
I have already referred to the confusion,
the apathy and the indifference so evident
in popular thinking everywhere, and which
we al deplore. I repeat that nothing is more
important for the preservation of our freedoms than that Parliament, in both its
branches, should not only earn but maintain
and increase the respect of the people, because, if we forfeit popular respect, some
demagogue may come along and say, "Let
us sweep these institutions away, and I promise you a new heaven and a new earth if
you will let me do it." We have too often
seen what has resulted from that sort of
appeal to contemplate without misgiving anything of the kind happening here. Some may
say that it is not possible in a country like
Canada. I do not agree. Maybe I am wrong,
but I believe it is possible for public opinion
to become so dulled, so atrophied, so indifferent that by default our liberty may go and
tyranny take its place. The only safe principle is to be eternally on guard.
In closing, I suggest that our paramount
duty is to do our work honestly and faithfully
at all times. If we do so, one need have
no doubt what the verdict of tomorrow will
be. If we fail, there can be no question but
that history will mark our failure. And so
in these difficult days there is a great obligation resting upon both branches of Parliament
to maintain the respect and confidence of our
people in order that our institutions may
grow and prosper, and that liberty and freedom shall always prevail.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. James H. King: Honourable senators,
I do not propose to detain the house, but I
feel I should follow the honourable gentlemen
who have just spoken, for they were former
colleagues of mine in the Government of
Canada. During the last session I had occasion to refer in this house to some 12 or 15
vacancies that were then existing in the
Senate. I did not do so with the hope that
I could influence the Government, but I did
feel that the attention of the Government
and of Parliament should be called to those

vacancies. I felt that the situation then prevailing was not in the best interests of
Parliament, and that the vacancies should be
filled as soon as possible. I realized at the
time, of course, that the filling of vacancies
in the Senate presents one of the most
difficult problems which confronts the Prime
Minister of Canada.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. King: I must say that I was
pleased to hear the speech made this afternoon by my colleague from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler). He spoke in a modest and moderate tone. I agreed almost entirely with
his remarks, but I hesitate to follow him to
the point of agreeing that we should approve
legislation requiring the Government and the
Prime Minister to fill Senate vacancies within
a six-month period.
The speech of the honourable gentleman
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) was a
masterpiece which was well understood and
recognized in this chamber, and it will be
highly thought of throughout the country.
However, I had hoped he would conclude
his remarks by saying that the honourable
gentleman from Waterloo would be well advised not to insist on any time limit for the
filling of vacancies. I am sure that both
speeches have served a useful purpose and
will be looked on with favour by the present
Government and governments that follow.
However, I am not inclined to support a time
limit for the filling of vacancies. I think
this is a matter which should be left to the
responsibility of the Prime Minister and his
colleagues in the Government.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
this is a difficult question to speak on, but
let me describe the situation with which I
am faced today. When I came to the Senate
in 1935 I was one of 65 Conservative members, only 7 of whom are alive today. The
reason for the difficulty in which the Senate
finds itself is really simple. I can quite understand why the honourable senators from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) and Kootenay East (Hon. Mr.
King) did not mention the reason, and if I
were a former member of the Liberal Government I would not mention it either. The
fact is that the Senate was created on the
basis of what had occurred between the
In those days the
years 1841 and 1867.
government changed frequently and there was
no danger that the nominees of any one
party would constitute an overwhelming
majority in the upper chamber.
The trouble today is that there is insufficient opposition to bring out the best in the

SENATE

Government party in this house. We can
talk as we like, but that is the real crux of
the argument. The four representatives of
Manitoba in this house are all former members either of the House of Commons or of
the Manitoba Legislature. Senator Beaubien
served nineteen years in the House of Commons, Senator Crerar twenty-three, and
Senator Howden twenty, and I was a member
of the Manitoba Legislature for sixteen years.
That accumulated experience should give the
four of us a pretty good understanding of
the present problem. I remember well that
whenever there was a strong Opposition in
the Manitoba Legislature there was a far
better Government. In 1920 the Government's
majority was small and the Opposition was
very stern; in 1922 the Government was
3trong and the Opposition was weak, and in
1927 the Opposition became strong-in fact,
so strong that the Speaker had to decide
numerous contentious points.
There is nothing personal in my viewpoint.
No one bas received finer treatment from his
associates in this chamber than I have. In
all my public life, including thirteen years'
service with the Winnipeg School Board and
sixteen years' service in the Manitoba Legislature, I have never been better treated than
I have in the Senate. But I maintain that a
democratic parliamentary system is based on
the idea of a Government and an Opposition.
What has been the experience in Great Britain? There a three-party system was tried
but, as predicted by many people, one of the
parties fell by the wayside. A third political
party was introduced in the United States,
but it got nowhere. Democratic parliaments
which try operating a multi-party system
usually drift back to a two-party system.
However, people who live in different sections
of a country the size of Canada are bound to
differ a little in their thinking. The country
is just too big for everyone to travel from one
end to the other. For example, how many
Maritime members have visited the Prairie
provinces and British Columbia, and how
many members from the West have visited
the Maritime provinces? I know a good bit
about Ontario and Quebec and I have done
some curling in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, but I am ashamed to admit that I have
never been in Prince Edward Island or Newfoundland.
A stronger Opposition is needed in the
Senate, but the question is how to achieve it.
I want to say a few words about Canada's
Prime Minister, a gentleman for whom I have
a very kindly feeling. Perhaps that is not
something which the Leader of the Conservative party in the Senate should say, but that

is my feeling. I am sure that the Prime
Minister is just as much concerned about the
problem of Senate appointments as anyone
else is. On various occasions he has chatted
with me about the judiciary in my province,
and from what he has said I know that he
feels a heavy responsibility regarding appointments to the Bench and to the Senate.
As to Senate appointments, a great variety
of opinion has been expressed. In Maclean's
magazine, a year or so ago, suggestions were
made by persons from all parts of Canada.
One man from Quebec, an author, said: "They
should appoint me, because my dad would
like to know I was a senator." A man from
New Brunswick said that his wife should be
appointed, because she was a smart woman
and he knew she would be smart in the
Senate. Another man, from somewhere else,
who forgot that one must be 30 years of age
to be eligible for a Senate appointment, proposed that a 19-year old girl, described as
Canada's best looking girl in 1953, should be
made a senator because she would make a
good exhibit in this house. That kind of
nonsense, published in Maclean's, was circulated all over Canada.
It is all right for the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), to say
that before selecting a person for appointment as senator the Prime Minister usually
obtains the approval of the minister from
the province concerned and of virtually the
whole Cabinet, but the final say in making
an appointment is by the Prime Minister. I
speak with authority. I know how I was
appointed. I was not appointed by any committee. A man telephoned me long distance
and said, "Will you accept a senatorship?"
I said, "What?" He said again, "Will you
accept a senatorship?" I replied, "Well, I
thought you had to be a member of the
House of Commons to become a senator."
He said, "Oh, no; anybody can be a senator
if he is appointed." So I asked, "Will the
P. M. appoint me?" The reply came back,
"He says he will." I said, "But he doesn't
like me." The man answered, "Oh, that
doesn't make any difference-he wants you."
So I became a senator.
Honourable senators, as I have mentioned,
Manitoba bas four senators in this Parliament now. I will challenge any province in
Canada to produce four senators who have
given longer public service than the four
members of Manitoba.
I am of the opinion that, to qualify as a
senator, any man or woman should have at
least experience as a member of a school
board, a city council, or a legislature, or as
member of Parliament. It is quite truc that
in this chamber there are men and women

Cerbe quite as useful as if they had it.
tainly, greater service can be given with the
background of that experience than without
it. There may be differences of opinion on
that, but that is my opinion, based on what
I have observed here.
I hope the Prime Minister will accept the
resolution moved by my honourable friend

thought the bill would make any trouble for
the Prime Minister I would not vote for it.
I am willing to vote against the Prime
Minister, absolutely, on political questionson the budget, or on financial matters that
I do not agree with. This, however, has to
do with the choice of members for the
Senate. My experience of 20 years here has
taught me that the task of the Prime Minister
in making appointments to this chamber is
very, very difficult. I think he should appoint
men and women to this house from a crosssection of the people of Canada, not some
man or woman with a high social status, or
a free spender, or some notable person who
has written a book. There should be no
nonsense like that. Every appointee should
be a man or woman who has given real public
service to the people of his or her province,
the type of person who responds when
volunteers are called for to raise money for
federated charities or the Community Chest.
That is the type of person we need. I urge
the Prime Minister to accept the word of the
honourable member from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) that he is not introducing this bill to
embarrass him or the Government. I accept
his word for it. Waiting is not going to
improve the situation one iota.
The Prime Minister has the difficult task of
considering appointments from among those
who have been workers on behalf of himself
or of his party, and whose appointment is
recommended by other members of the party.
On the other hand, he must remember that
he has got to do something about appointing
to this chamber some men and women who
will not be on the Government side. That is
a hard thing to do, but that is the very thing
he must do, whether he obtains assistance by
putting the responsibility on the Leader of
the Opposition to make recommendations or
by some other means, I care not. The probhem will never be solved so long as the Government restricts appointments exclusively to
persons of its own political party.
I might mention, incidentally, that criticism
of the Government by a Conservative senator
is not regarded in the same light as criticism
by a Liberal senator. For instance, anything
I say against the Government is struck out,
or at least all the political part is, and they

say, "That is what John Haig thinks." But if
I were a Government supporter they would
say, "That is what he really thinks; he is a
traitor underneath, and we didn't know it."
I did not intend to speak at length on this
bill. From discussion I had with them today,
I know that many senators thought they
would vote against this bill. Well, I do not
believe they would be helping the Prime
Minister by voting against the bill. I think it
should be referred to a committee where it
could be examined and we could hear one
another's opinions. If we are then so advised
by the Prime Minister, directly or indirectly,
as far as I am concerned I will not vote for
the bill to come back, because I will trust him
to do what is right. I think he is as much
interested in, and as loyal to, Canada as I am,
and that he is just as determined to make the
Senate of Canada great, as any other man in
Canada is.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: He is bound to do that, and
I am trying to do that, too. I think that he
owes it to Canada, as I do, to give that kind
of service to our great country. The Prime
Minister has been very highly honoured by
the people of Canada, and we hold him in
deep respect. He has the great responsibility
of dealing with the problem of vacancies in
the Senate; in fact, I think it is one of the
greatest problems he has had to face, to
organize the Senate so that there is sufficient
opposition-which may only require 25 members-to properly express the opinion of the
minority of the people of Canada, so that
when the majority comes to a conclusion it
knows what the minority thinks.
Probably I have spoken long enough. I
have not consulted my own supporters; I have
not many to consult. I do not know what
view they will take, and I am speaking for
myself. An appointment to the Senate is a
personal matter, it is not and never was a
party matter. One hundred and sixty-five
people wanted the place I occupy here. I
never asked for it. The others asked too hard,
and the Prime Minister at the time didn't
listen to them. If I had asked, I think he
would have turned me down.
Honourable senators, I hope that when I
leave this chamber any man or woman who
speaks of my life here will say, "John T.
Haig made many mistakes; he made a lot of
poor speeches, and cast a lot of bad votes, but
we never once caught him voting against
Canada".
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
it was not my intention to take part in this

SENATE
debate, because I think it is the kind of
debate no one would desire to take part in.
However, because of certain remarks made
by the mover (Hon. Mr. Euler) and the
seconder of the bill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), and
also by the Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig), I feel obligated to say something,
at least. I went along with the opening
remarks by the honourable Leader of the
Opposition when he indicated that what was
wrong with the Senate was the large number
of Liberals on one side and the small number of Conservatives on the other side. Then,
after eulogizing the Prime Minister, he expressed himself as feeling that he should
vote for the bill. I was quite unable to follow
his reasoning in reaching that conclusion.
However, I emphasize that in my opinion
his opening remarks touched on the very
heart of this problem.
In all kindliness I say to the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
that in my opinion the Prime Minister is
much closer to the public of Canada than
he is. If my honourable friend does not know
it, I will tell him that there has been a
rising tide of criticism of the Senate because
of the very situation referred to by the
Leader of the Opposition, namely, the overwhelming strength of the Government members and the scarcity of Opposition members.
I do not know what is in the mind of the
Prime Minister on this point, but I am quite
sure that he is as fully aware of the situation as I am, and that, being a good Liberal
and a democrat, he is paying some attention
to the criticism expressed by the people.
The honourable mover of the bill (Hon.
Mr. Euler) is trying, improperly I think, to
draw an analogy between the situation in
the House of Commons as it was prior to
1919 and the present situation in the Senate.
My reason for saying there is no relationship
between the two is that prior to the amendment of the House of Commons Act it was
possible for a government which had a very
small majority in the house, and which lost
one or two members by reason of death or
otherwise, to delay the holding of by-elections for fear of losing its slim majority. It
was to prevent that situation that the House
of Commons Act was amended. But that act
applies to the people's elected representatives, not to members of the Senate, who are
appointed for life.
While I differ strongly with some of the
remarks of the honourable mover of the bill
and the honourable senator from Churchill, I
hope neither of them will take my criticism
in a personal way. It was rather amusing to
hear the mover talk about the impairment of
the Senate by reason of some twenty-one
vacant seats. I have not been in this bouse

very long, but I spent twenty-one years in
the other house and have had considerable
experience in public life, and I know something about what happens around parliament.
May I say to my honourable friend that I
have never been afraid of embarrassing the
Government. As a matter of fact, when I was
in the Commons I was regarded as the rebel
of that house, and I did not wait to become
a cabinet member or to join another party
before becoming a rebel. I came to Parliament as a Liberal to fight the battles of the
people I represented, and although that may
have prevented me from being appointed a
cabinet minister, I had to do my duty as I
saw it. However, it did not prevent my being
summoned to this house.
Talking about independence, let me say
that I take second place to no man, ex-cabinet minister or anybody else, and whether
in the House of Commons or in the Senate
I am still an independent. With that in mind,
I am wondering how much more independence this house would have with twentyone new appointees. In my opinion it is not
numbers that count, but quality of appointees.
One of the things that is wrong with the
House of Commons today is that many members on the Liberal side are afraid to get up
on their feet and express their views. They
are looking for promotions or other favours.
When I was in that house I spoke out rebelliously on behalf of the people I represented.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I should like to ask my
friend whether he really knows very much
about my actions in the House of Commons.
Is he aware that, in the first instance, I was
elected as an independent Liberal, and that
on occasions I have voted against the Government in that house? Does he know that I
exercised as high a degree of independence
as he did, or perhaps a little higher?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am glad to hear that my
friend exercised independence, but he did not
do it during my time in the other house. I
say he was a different man then, and I
know whereof I speak.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Not entirely.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The most amazing statement in this afternoon's debate was that of
the honourable senator from Churchill that if
he had a choice between making the Senate
an elective body or abolishing it, he would
vote for its abolition.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: He was wrong.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Now, I do not ask that
everyone share my views, but if I had any
feeling in favour of abolition of the Senate I
would resign right now.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Not a chance.

MAY

Hon. Mr. Reid: I did not interrupt my honourable friend when he was speaking, and
I would ask him not to interrupt me. I am
giving my views, and I hope that he will not
take any criticism in a personal way.
I am all in favour of an elective Senate. I
was elected to the House of Commons five
times, and I think I could win another five
elections. I had an independent mind and
was not afraid to stand up and express my
views before the Government, irrespective of
whether I was made a cabinet minister or not.
My honourable friend from Churchill stated
that he did not believe there would be any
sharp criticism if this bill went to the House
of Commons. I can only say to him that he
had better get wise to the general feelings
of some of the members of that house and
how they carry on. Those who would tear
this bill apart are members who have no
hope of ever getting into the Senate. When
they go out to their constituencies they make
great political capital by running down the
Senate. I, as one who has tried to uplift the
Senate, feel very much annoyed at the way in
which some members of Parliament deride
this body when they are speaking before their
constituents. Therefore, in my opinion, if this
bill were to go to the other house, certain
members would have a field day with it.
I come back to the comments made by the
honourable Leader of the Opposition. How
the state of imbalance between the two
parties in this house can be corrected, I do
not know, but I am sure the same problem
troubles the Prime Minister.
Honourable senators, I am not opposing this
bill because of any fear that it might embarrass the government. I am voting against the
bill, with apologies to no one for the stand
I have taken.

il,

1955

of "The Senate's Future" there appears the
following editorial comment:
The Senate reconvenes on Tuesday. The Government may soon have to face up to the question of
what to do about it. Senator W. D. Euler bas
introduced a bill that would make it obligatory
to fill Senate vacancies within a reasonable timesix months after they occur. If the Senate approves
the bill, it will go to the House of Commons for
debate and the Senate issue will then be squarely
in the Government's lap.
The Government has three courses open to it.
It can amend the British North America Acts and
abolish the Senate. It can continue the present
process of abolishing the Senate piecemeal, by the
slow attrition of leaving vacancies unfilled. Or it
can embark on a vigorous program of Senate
reform.
Abolition of the Senate has been advocated by
some members of Parliament. Yet, even though
the Senate is so often treated as one of our oldest
public jokes, no one who understands and values
the principles of our federal constitution would
Continued
a unicameral Parliament.
advocate
criticism bas created a mood in which the good
work performed by the Senate is often overlooked,
but it cannot be set aside indefinitely. For instance,
had it not been for the Senate, Canadians would
not be able to buy margarine today. Senator
T. A. Crerar's courageous and thoughtful committee bas had an influence on economies in
Government spending far greater than is generally
appreciated.

The article continues, but I need not read
more.
Honourable senators, I repeat that my only
criticism of the bill is that it does not go
far enough. It still does not satisfy the public
demand. If alternate senators were nominated
by the various provinces of Canada it would
make for a much better representative institution of Government, and thus do away with
the criticism that we hear on all sides almost
daily.
Hon. Senaors: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Roebuck, the debate
was adjourned.
PRIVATE BILL

Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John P. Howden: Honourable senators,
after listening to some very able speeches
this afternoon, my contribution will perhaps
seem monotonous. But let me say at the
outset that I am in full accord with the bill
and intend to vote for it. My only criticism
is that it does not go far enough.
There can be no doubt in any one's mind
that a great deal of criticism has been
directed at the Senate. However, I should
like to quote from an article in the Winnipeg
Free Press of May 2 last which throws some
light on the other side of the picture. Incidentally, the Right Honourable Mackenzie
King said to me on more than one occasion
that the Free Press carried the best editorials
of any paper in Canada. Under the heading

MORTGAGE CORPORATIONSECOND READING

Hon. Nancy Hodges moved the second read-

ing of Bill A-13, an Act to incorporate Gillespie Mortgage Corporation.
She said: Honourable senators, this incorporation, under the Loan Companies Act, is
being sponsored by a long established real
estate investment and mortgage company in
Vancouver, R. Kerr Houlgate and Summerfield Limited. The sponsoring company at
present acts as principal in placing funds in
conventional mortgages for some of the
largest financial institutions on the continent.
The purpose of the incorporation is to further
establish the position of this company in the
mortgage lending field and to enable it to
participate in insured loans under the
National Housing Act.

SENATE

The bill is extremeiy brief and follows the
form prescribed by the Loan Companies Act.
It mereiy specifies the name, head office and
share capital and, in ail other respects, the
proposed company will be subject to the Loan
Companies Act. If incorporated, the company wouid be subi ect to the meticulous
supervision of the Superintendent of Insurance in ail its operations.
If the bill is given second reading I shahl
move that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce, where
the sponsors of the bill will be available to
answer any detailed questions reiating to the
operation of the proposed company.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the

Acts, 1867 to 1952.

Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

SENATE

It is of no use to brush aside such a statement in an act when it is concise and perfectly clear. The section says: "The Senate
shall . . . consist of seventy-two members".

Honourable senators will note it does not say
that the Senate shall consist of seventy-two
members, or the survivors of them. On the
contrary, the wording of the section is as
clear, short and concise as it could be. It
says that the Senate shall consist of seventytwo members-and that is the Constitution of
Canada.
The distribution of the membership is also
very important in the Constitution of our
country. Honourable senators will remember
-and we need not be constitutional lawyers
to be thoroughly familiar with the fact-that
the Senate was created, devised and designed
to protect the numerically weaker provinces
from being outvoted and perhaps not well
used by the larger and more populous provinces. For that reason, the Senate was devised
to give territorial representation and thus
to offset in some degree, numerical representation in the House of Commons.
May I now be permitted to read section 22
of the original act:
22. In relation to the constitution of the Senate,
Canada shall be deemed to consist of Three
Divisions:
1. Ontario
2. Quebec
3. The Maritime Provinces, Nova Scotia, and
New
Brunswick; which three divisions shalI
(subject to the Provisions of this Act) be equally
represented in the Senate as follows: Ontario by
Twenty-four Senators; Quebec by Twenty-four
Senators; and the Maritime Provinces by Twentyfour Senators, Twelve thereof representing Nova
Scotia and Twelve thereof representing New
Brunswick.
In the case of Quebec each of the Twenty-four
Senators representing that Province shall be appointed for One of the Twenty-four Electoral
Divisions of Lower Canada specified in Schedule A
to Chapter One of the Consolidated Statutes of
Canada.

Of

course,

the Senate

now includes

as

well representatives from Prince Edward
Island, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland, and the full membership is 102. The provision for additional
numbers did not, however, change the principle involved in the act. Therefore, to leave
any one of these divisions unrepresented for
any appreciable time upsets the whole balance
of the constitution, and deprives a section of
the community wholly or in part of the protection which representation in the Senate
would afford. To that extent, the constitution
of Canada is destroyed.
The maintenance of the specified number
of members in the Senate was very carefully
taken care of by the wording of two sections
of the act. The Senate was not merely
launched by the planners of the constitution

and then left to its own devices; rather, they
foresaw what might happen, and as well as
arranging for appointment of the original
members of the Senate, provision was made
for the maintenance of their numbers. Section
24 reads thus:
24. The Governor General shall from Time to
Time, in the Queen's Name, by Instrument under
the Great Seal of Canada, summon qualified
Persons to the Senate; and, subject to the Provisions of this Act, every Person so summoned
shall become and be a Member of the Senate and
a Senator.

The act specifically provides that the successors to those whose seats have been vacated
through death, resignation or otherwise, shall
be appointed when the vacancy occurs. Just
because a provision happens to be short and
concise, and seemingly not emphatic, it should
not be brushed aside. Personally, I am more
impressed by short, clear and direct sentences,
than by long and involved passages. With
that in mind, I quote section 32 of the British
North America Act:
32. When a vacancy happens in the Senate, by
Resignation, death, or otherwise, the Governor
General shall by Summons to a fit and qualified
Person fill the Vacancy.

Honourable senators will observe that the
duty of making appointments is placed upon
the Governor General, not upon the Governor
in Council; but of course, in accordance with
modern parliamentary procedure under a
limited constitutional monarchy, the Governor
General acts upon the advice of his constitutional advisers-in this instance the Prime
Minister who, of course, consults his cabinet.
This does not change the form of the
appointment, which is by the Crown. The
principle of the appointment of Senators is
identical with that of the appointment of the
Prime Minister and cabinet ministers: all are
appointed by the Crown on the advice of
constitutional advisers, and all subscribe to
the oath of office. When, therefore, a question
arises as to the maintenance of the constitution of the Senate by its members, it is
inappropriate to bring too strongly into consideration the convenience of the Prime
Minister or anyone else. By their appointment, the Prime Minister, members of the
cabinet and members of the Senate are of
co-ordinate jurisdiction; all of them are
appointed by the Crown, and all are charged
with very important responsibilities. Therefore, I submit to my fellow senators that on
great questions of this kind we must each
take his own responsibility for the course
which we think right to pursue, and we must
let the chips fall where they may.
I am sure that no one in this chamber has
the slightest desire to inconvenience or
embarrass the present Prime Minister or the

the holding of by-elections than in the
appointment of senators, more difficulties to

through, and yet that provision made in the

Government. I am sure we all share the
confidence in the Prime Minister, which was
so ably expressed yesterday by the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig). None of us would wish to place
obstacles in his way. As a matter of fact, I
am strongly impressed that the passage of
this bill by Parliament will assist him in
carrying out the provisions of the Act of
Confederation. However that may be, we
each have a duty to perform, just as he has;
both duties are important, and each individual
in public life must stand on his own feet and
carry his own responsibilities.
Some honourable senators have questioned
whether the filling of vacancies in the Senate
is any part of our responsibility. That very
thought may have passed through the minds
of the framers of our constitution, because
the British North America Act answers the
very question. I read section 33:

SENATE
Senate, the Governor General may by summons to
Three or Six qualified Persons (as the case may
be) representing equally the Three Divisions of
Canada, add to the Senate accordingly.

I am reading the original text, honourable
senators; of course the figures have been
changed by amendment in the meantime, but
not the general wording of the Act.
In 1915 it was provided that, when additions were made by the Queen, no further
appointment shall be made except by her
until the number of members has been
reduced to the normal 24 senators for each
division, and then follows this significant
section:
28. The Number of Senators shall
Time exceed Seventy-eight.

not at any

That was revised in 1915 to 104. At the
same time, a provision was inserted that,
in event of Newfoundland's admission to
Confederation, the normal number should
be 102 and the maximum 110, and that as I
understand it is the law today. And then
there is added this further significant phrase:
"and no more".
And so the framers of the constitution took
care that there should be no possibility of
swamping the Senate by the appointment of
new members in order to carry out by
coercion the wishes of some Government of
the moment against the will of this body.
If there ever bas been any desire to swamp
the Senate by the addition of members over
and above its normal complement, any such
manoeuvre has been effectively prevented
by the Act.
But now, gentlemen, a different possibility arises. I am not accusing anybody of
having ideas of this nature. I do not think
it is in the mind of anyone at the moment,
but there is now a possibility of the Senate
being swamped, as another great house
within the empire once was threatened to be.
This danger does not lie in the appointment of senators over and above the normal
complement, but rather in reserving for an
unreasonable time the filling of vacancies, and
then filling them all at once, with pledged
members.
Now I do not fear anything of that kind
under the present administration, or indeed
when a Liberal party is in power, but who
knows what the future has in store for Canada? Who knows who will be in control of
Parliament in perhaps a very short time, in
accordance with Parliamentary procedure in
this country? How easy it might be when
21-and who knows whether that is the end
of it-when 21 or 31 or 41 seats in this house
are vacant, how easy it would be to subvert
the intentions of the framers of the constitution and override the wisdom of this house

by the appointment of a number of instructed
senators. It is a possibility. Some may say it
is a very remote possibility, a figment of the
imagination: I hope it is. But I suggest that
you and I, in the quiet of the present moment,
should see the possibilities of the future and
provide for them as we can. This bill will help
to maintain the integrity of the Senate.
The honourable senator from Kootenay
East (Hon. Mr. King) suggested that the purpose of the honourable senator from Waterloo had already been accomplished and that
he might now well withdraw the bill and
leave the future to take care of itself. Well,
were I assured that the present Government
would remain in office for all time, or that one
of the other great political parties would
control the destinies of Canada with the
degree of responsibility which is now exhibited, I might agree with him. But I am unable
to look far into the future, and I fancy that
my fellow senators are in the same position.
Now when this question has been raised is
the time for us to take our courage in our
hands and settle the matter. I believe that
senatorial seats should be filled within six
months after they become vacant. It is destructive of the institutions of our country to
allow a beggarly array of empty benches to
remain unfilled, such as one now sees in
this chamber. No less than twenty-one chairs
are unfilled. They ought to be filled. I think
the Senate would be a better place, that its
purposes would be served more effectively,
if twenty-one more senators were added to
our numbers. Speaking as chairman of the
Divorce Committee, I would like to have
added to our number two or three more lawyers. The honourable senator from Calgary
(Hon. Mr. Ross) looks at me and smiles: he
and I are two of the lawyers on that committee; and in carrying on its most important work we could very well use the services
of several more. I mention lawyers only because the reference happens to be pertinent.
So fully engaged are the members of the
Senate that it would be impossible or at least
very difficult at this time to constitute another special committee of inquiry. The number of members of the Senate was, no doubt,
intelligently set. The obstacles, if any, to
the making of these appointments should be
surmounted; the chairs should be filled, so
that the Senate may carry on its work to the
best advantage. That being my opinion, I
do not see how it would be possible for me
to vote against this bill. I shahl support it.
Hon. J. W. deB. Farris: Honourable senators, I regard this subject as one of considerable importance. Its consideration involves
the integrity and composition of the Senate
itself-an issue which at any time demands

MAY 12, 1955
our serious consideration. I congratulate the
mover of the resolution on his speech, though
not so much on the bill he has introduced,
because I have some criticism of the measure
itself. He made a dignified and statesmanlike presentation of a question which is very
important to the Senate and, I believe, to the
people of Canada. I also congratulate my
good friend the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), who seconded the
motion. le presented the philosophic aspects
of this matter as, perhaps, no other member of
this body could do, and he did it with credit
to the Senate and to himself. With all deference to the honourable senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), who is one of
my closest friends here, I do not think that
either of the gentlemen I have mentioned
merited his fulminations.
Let me also compliment my honourable
friend the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) on the broad tolerance with which he
expressed himself on this question. His conments concerning the Prime Minister of this
country, coming from a dyed-in-the-wool
Tory like himself, reflected great credit on
him, on the party he represents, and on the
Senate itself. He touched a point which
it took a little courage to mention when he
said that one of the greatest problems affecting the Senate at this time is the lack of an
active Opposition. I agree with him, and I do
so without any reflection on himself or the
small remnant of his party which survives
here, in contrast to the situation nineteen
years ago, when I became a senator and when
the Conservative party was a dominant influence in this assembly.
I have some comments to make on the
form in which the issue before us is raised.
It purports to amend the British North
America Act-a proceeding which until the
method was changed a few years ago, was
confined exclusively to the Parliajnent of the
United Kingdom. A part of that power, but
only a part, has been delegated to the Canadian Parliament. Whether amendments of
this kind are to be made by the British
Parliament or the Canadian Parliament, they
are not to be lightly undertaken. With al
deference to the honourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), a constitutional
question is a little different from an amendment of the House of Commons Act. True, it
may relate to the same subject-matter; but
the Fathers of Confederation, who inspired
the provisions of the British North America
Act, saw fit to make a distinction between the
constitution of the House of Commons and
changes therein, and the constitution of the
Senate, which is incorporated in the British
North America Act itself.

I should like to make a comment on the
address just delivered by the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). I have nothing in my notes about
congratulating him on it, for I wrote these
notes before hearing him speak, but I am sure
his remarks will be indelibly recorded in the
annals of this chamber.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Whether I agree with all
the results which he expects would flow from
the bill, I find myself in complete accord with
every pronouncement he made. He referred
to a number of sections of the B.N.A. Act,
particularly section 32, which deals with
Senate vacancies. It reads:
When a vacancy happens in the
Resignation, Death, or otherwise,-

Senate

by

That covers the entire field.
-the

Governor General shall-

It does not say "may".
-by
Summons to a fit and qualified Person fil
the Vacancy.

No lawyer would stake his reputation upon
the proposition that this means the vacancy
shall be filled some three, five or even seven
years after it occurs. The question is entirely one of what is a reasonable time. It
cannot possibly mean an indefinite time in
the indefinite future.
That brings me to the first consideration
of the amendment. It arbitrarily fixes a time
of six months. No penalty can be provided
for the failure of the Governor General to
carry out the mandate of the constitution.
Under our constitutional practice the responsibility for any failure to perform a duty by
Her Majesty or ber representative must fall
on ber constitutional advisers, and in Canada
that responsibility must fall on the constitutional advisers of His Excellency the
Governor General.
I am not building up to an attack on our
Prime Minister, Mr. St. Laurent, When he
was nominated for the leadership of the
Liberal party it was my privilege and pleasure
to support him against all comers, and I have
never regretted doing so. Our Prime Minister
possesses advantages enjoyed by few political
leaders. To begin with, he is an outstanding
constitutional lawyer, and as such he is fully
conscious of his responsibility as Prime Minister of Canada.
Had the sponsor of this bill (Hon. Mr.
Euler) asked me for my opinion I would
have suggested he adopt a different method
of approach. I jotted down in my notes what

occurred to me as being a way to deal with
the subject without becoming involved in

SENATE

the complications of the constitution; and I
am bound to say that I am not entirely
satisfied as to the constitutional aspects of
this question.
By this proposed legislation we are seeking
to take unto ourselves the power to amend
the constitution in matters that are purely
federal. I do not know whether my honourable colleague from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) has given thought to this
question, and I must confess I have not given
it sufficient thought to justify offering an
opinion. However, I have considered it
enough to raise in my mind a question
that might be given further consideration.
The honourable senator from TorontoTrinity pointed out that under the constitution the Senate was created as a body to be
representative of the different parts of
Canada, the representation being designated
by provinces. In the light of these circumstances I ask this question: can we say that
in all its aspects the matter of Senate appointments is so divorced from provincial
consideration that it comes entirely within
federal jurisdiction, and that therefore the
dominion has full power to deal with it?
This issue should not be lightly raised; whenever members feel something is not going
just right in the Senate they should not jump
up and offer amendments to the constitution.
That sort of thing gives me concern. It may
be presumptuous on my part, but if the
honourable senator from Waterloo had asked
my opinion I would have suggested that he
present a resolution something like this:
The Senate views with concern the practice of
undue delay in Senate appointments and would
urge on the Government discontinuance of the
practice as being contrary to the intention of
the constitution, not contributing to the efficiency
of the Senate, and not in the public interest.

However, that is not the form in which
this matter is before us, and whether any
individual member is in entire accord with
the bill he cannot escape giving it careful
consideration.
In listening to the speeches that have been
made so far it occurs to me that one question
has not been dealt with. There seems to be
complete unanimity of opinion in this house
that Mr. St. Laurent, as Prime Minister of
Canada, is conscious of his responsibility.
Those of us who know his constitutional
capacity have no doubt that he fully appreciates the significance and importance of
section 32 of the B.N.A. Act, but yet he has
deliberately delayed filling vacancies in the
Senate. There must be some reason for it,
and it is only proper that we ponder on what
that reason may be.

I was rather hopeful that the Leader of the
Government in this house (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) would have given direction to this
discussion immediately after the bill was
introduced, and no doubt he may still give us
direction. Certainly the reason the Prime
Minister has failed to make certain appointments to this chamber cannot be the one
implied by the honourable senator from
Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson), when he
asked the mover what the total saving to
Canada in dollars amounted to by reason of
the Senate vacancies. Let us deal with that
question. If it had any significance it would
mean that the country is better off because
of the money it has saved in this way. To
put it in other words: any persons appointed
to fIl these 21 vacancies would not be worth
their cost to the country. If that were so, it
could apply not only to new appointees but
to existing members. I am sure my honourable friend never seriously meant to make
any suggestion of that kind. If he did, he
could always cure it to a certain extent.
Some Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Farris: In looking for reasons for
the delay in filling vacancies-there was a
lapse of seven years in one case-I am sure
one reason cannot be that the Prime Minister
is unable to find anyone willing to sacrifice
himself by accepting a senatorship. Honourable senators, my own feeling is that an
appointment to the Senate is the greatest
honour available to a Canadian citizen.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: The position carries with
it the responsibility of independent thought
demanded by no other position in the public
life of this country. It also carries with it
an honour that cannot be surpassed by any
other appointment in our public life, from
that of Prime Minister down. I have been a
senator for 19 years, and I have always had
a very proud appreciation of the great honour
Mackenzie King did me when he recommended
me for membership in this house. And
throughout I have felt a very serious sense
of responsibility toward my appointment,
although I am afraid I have not always lived
up to it.
Some among us who have to earn our livings independently of what we receive in the
Senate are at times confronted with a problem arising out of the fact that our homes
are a long distance from Ottawa. As the
honourable Leader of the Opposition has
complained more than once, we kick our
heels from Thursday night till Tuesday night,
week after week. If the Senate were free to
act in dealing with public questions, it could

MAY 12, 1955
do so effectively, and give them the best of
consideration in far less time than we are
obliged to waste by remaining in Ottawa
unnecessarily.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: However, I have ceased to
"kick against the pricks", for I see no solution to that problem, because of the great
distances between different parts of Canada.
The House of Commons has a full constitutional right, a duty and an obligation to discuss questions from many aspects that we
in this bouse are not called upon to do. We
are only called upon to discuss, and we only
should discuss, questions entirely divorced
from politics.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: The other house could not
be asked to take the same position. We must
accept the situation as it is.
Honourable senators, I have not had the
honour to discuss this question with Mr. St.
Laurent or his immediate advisers, but I
have heard a good deal of talk and also
formed some conclusions of my own about
the matter, and I am of the opinion that there
is in the mind of the Prime Minister today a
conflict of thought which presents great difficulty to him in considering the vacancies in
the Senate. First, there is the constitutional
problem that my honourable friend from
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has
Toronto-Trinity
drawn attention to in section 32 of the B.N.A.
Act-that these appointments should be made
with due dispatch within a reasonable time.
But, honourable senators, the Prime Minister
undoubtedly recognizes, as we all do, that a
new constitutional problem has arisen with
the development and growth of Canadian
public affairs. In looking to the past we see
that representation in the Senate adjusted
itself by practical conditions. Representation
by provinces was provided for in the constitution, but there are other kinds of representation which, in my humble opinion, are
even more important than provincial representation, and they have been left to the
exigencies of the occasion. It worked out
very well that way until it seemed that the
people found it necessary to keep the Liberal
party in power almost in perpetuity. Under
the old system it was assumed that there
would be a two-party system. Naturally, one
party would appoint its supporters to the
Senate, and after a certain period of time
would "load it up" quite a bit, but in course
of time it would go out of office and the other
party would have a chance to make appointThe two-party system was selfments.
adjusting.

But two new conditions have developed in
Canada. One is the unprecedented length of
time that the Liberal party has stayed in
power; and may I say, not offensively, the
serious possibility that that condition may
continue into the indefinite future. My honourable friend the Leader of the Opposition
was very frank when he said that what the
Senate needs today is a stronger Opposition.
I agree with him, and I say so without any
reflection on the fine work accomplished by
the few men left of the great array of Conservatives who were in this house when I
first came here. I know that some of my honourable friends' colleagues are not in a condition of good physical health, and they can
no longer give him any assistance whatever.
However, it is a fact that not only is there a
lack of representation in the Opposition in
this house today, but there is also a lack of
political thought representative of the people
of Canada in the Senate, and this condition
will exist while the old system prevails. I
believe the Prime Minister recognizes his obligation to the public to see that the Senate is
what it ought to be.
We have heard and talked a lot about
representation by provinces as provided by
the constitution. In my opinion, that is of
secondary consideration at present. Perhaps
it will become of paramount importance
again some day, but as far as our immediate
problems are concerned it is a secondary
consideration. The primary consideration at
this time is that the Senate should be representative of the political and public thinking
of the people of Canada.
Honourable senators, let us look ourselves
over. I am a Liberal, and I was born into a
politically active Liberal family. Both my
father and grandfather were in politics, and
I myself got into politics before I was 30
years of age. Indeed, I had several defeats
in my scalp before I ever got elected to
office. But I always was a Liberal. I would
say to my honourable friend from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) that he and I are
both independents, but at the same time I
think we both are good partisan Liberals.
That is our political thinking. As I said on
another occasion, a man who has no political
convictions is no good. He can have political
convictions and still be independent in his
thought, but he cannot represent a party
whose policy is contrary to his political
thinking. That, I think, is what is in the
mind of the Prime Minister of Canada, and
we ought to keep it in mind too.
When my honourable friend, the Leader
of the Opposition says we need a stronger
Opposition in the Senate, he is probably
thinking of representatives of his own party.

SENATE
Let me remind him of the new conditions
which have developed ln Canada. While the
Liberal party today holds a big majority in
the House of Commons I do not think it
holds a majority among the people of Canada. Canada has not only a Liberal party
and a Conservative party, but a Socialist
party with a very large following. Incidentally, I have watched with much
interest the amalgamation of the two great
labour unions in this country, to see whether
they will agree that the new organization
will also be the arm of the Socialist party.
To date they appear not to have made a
declaration in that connection, but it may be
in the offing. Whether it comes about or not,
it is true that at least in Western Canada
there are four political parties: Liberal,
Conservative, Socialist, and Social Credit.
But there never has been a representative
of the Socialist or Labour party in this house;
never has there been a man to stand up
and express the views and thinking of the
people who belong to that group. To that
extent the Senate of Canada is not representative of the public thought of this
country today. Nor has there been a representative of this newer body which has
sprung up with a name and a policy that
have no connection one with the other. I
have often felt that I would like to see a
representative of that body in this house
who could be goaded into telling us what is
the connection between the name "Social
Credit" and the policy of that party.
Hon. Mr. Reid: They could not tell us,
because they do not know themselves.
Hon. Mr. Farris: At least we would find
that out.
I recall that on the last occasion on which
this subject-matter was before the house the
late Senator David said to me, "Surely you
don't want representatives of the Nationalist
party of Quebec here, do you?" I said: "Yes,
I would like to see one of those fellows here.
I have never heard one of them speak, and
I might get some inspiration from knowing
what they think and talk about."
In order to give effective representation in
this house we should have some opportunity
to know about political bodies in Canada
which at present are not represented here.
I believe the Prime Minister of Canada is
giving consideration to that very question.
There is another division in Canada, namely
that represented by thinking men not engaged
in public affairs in the accepted political
sense. Incidentally, I noticed in a press

dispatch the other day that among others
receiving honorary degrees was H. R. MacMillan, a man from the West, whom I admire
very much. Now, I do not know what his
political views are, but I do know that from
a business standpoint he has been a great
pioneer in the building up of Western Canada.
Of course, I would not want to see brought
into this house a selection of business men
who knew only business. Kipling wrote:
What should they know
England know?

of England who only

It would be a poor policy to bring here a
business man who knew about nothing but
his own sphere of activity in the business
field. However, there are many men who
are part of the life of the country but are not
identified with politics. It is men of that
kind whom I think the Prime Minister might
well give consideration to in making appointments to the Senate.
As I have said, honourable senators, the
whole political aspect has changed in Canada,
making it imperative that the Prime Minister,
if he is going to recognize the necessity for
adequate representation in this body, should
depart from the traditional policy that has
existed since Confederation.
I do not want to be accused of talking with
my head in the clouds. As I say, I was born
in a political atmosphere, and for many of
my active years in the West I was closely
associated with political activity, so I have
no illusions about the question of patronage.
I well remember being in the Opposition
camp under the leadership of Mr. Brewster.
At one political gathering our leader made
the statement that when his party came into
office it would wipe out every vestige of
patronage in this country. Ralph Smith, who
was a sagacious and experienced public man,
shook his head, leaned over to me and said,
"The man doesn't know what he is talking
about." He might as well have said we will
wipe out every vestige of human nature.
I make no claim that I am superior to the
problems that confront men in public life.
But I do lay down this as a fundamental
principle which every man in public life
must recognize, that however essential it is
that party organization be carried on for the
benefit of the public, you must not overlook
your friends, with the one qualification that
friendship must not interfere with publie
interest and welfare.
In view of the peculiar systems that have
developed in Canada over the past few years,
and the existence of various parties, and in

MAY 12, 1955
view of-as I see it-the prospective continuance of the Liberal party in office, I am of
the opinion that the Prime Minister is confronted with the problem that within his own
party he must challenge the theory on which
appointments to the Senate have been made
since Confederation. If I am right, I hope
that those of us now in the Senate can, by
our views and expressions, give him support.
Honourable senators, whether I vote for this
bill or not-and I may say that I have not
quite made up my mind-I am in entire
accord with the thought that has been provoked by it; and if the Prime Minister feels
there is a new constitutional problem which
necessitates change in policy in order to give
the Canadian people wider representation in
the Senate, I am sure we are all wholeheartedly behind him.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Connolly, for Hon.
Mr. Hayden, the debate was adjourned.

THE LATE SENATOR FAFARD
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Before the Orders
of the Day are proceeded with, I would like
to refer to the grievous passing of our late
colleague Senator the Honourable J. Fernand
Fafard, who died on Saturday last. For many
years I had enjoyed his friendship; and I
recall that I appreciated greatly his kindness
to me when I entered the House of Commons
in 1935. At that time he had been a member
of that house for about eighteen years. I
remember especially his fairness as a chairman of the Liberal caucus: he never failed to
give an opportunity to the new members to
express their views. I recall too his kindness
and hospitality during my sojourn at Quebec
in that memorable summer of 1951 when I
enrolled as a summer student at Laval University. Indeed, I would feel disloyal to an
old friend if I did not say a few words in his
native tongue.

(Translation):

an Act respecting Westcoast Transmission
Company Limited.
The bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Thursday next.

My wife and I often recall how glad we
were to meet Mrs. Fafard and the late senator
during our stay in Quebec, when we followed
a course in French at Laval University, in
1951. We will never forget the hospitality
and many kindnesses of the people of the
city of Quebec; Mrs. Fafard and the late
senator, in particular, showed us great
courtesy.

NEW BRUNSWICK POTATO MARKETING
BOARD

You may readily understand that our visit
in the old and historic city of Quebec not

INQUIRY AND ANSWER

only proved most interesting, but was also
very helpful to us.

Hon. Mr. Pirie inquired of the Government
pursuant to notice of May 11:
1. Did the Department of Agriculture authorize
an investigation in connection with the 1953-54

(Text):
The late Senator Fafard was born in 1882,
at L'Islet, Quebec, the son of Auguste and

MAY 17, 1955
Alphonsine Fafard. He was educated at
L'Islet and Levis colleges, and graduated with
the degree of Bachelor of Arts. He left
college in 1901 and became a land surveyor
in Northern Saskatchewan and Alberta. In
1905 he received a diploma as a surveyor, and
pioneered in the North, where he made the
first survey of the fertile region of Abitibi.
He also explored the Upper St. Maurice region
and the Lake St. John district.
His years in Parliament represented one
of the most outstanding records of public
service in the history of our country. He
was first elected to the House of Commons
in the general election of 1917, and was reelected in the general elections of 1921, 1925,
1926, 1930 and 1935. He was summoned to
this chamber in 1940.
The late Senator Fafard possessed a lovable
personality. Although outwardly quiet and
gentle, he bore within himself a firm and
indomitable spirit which had characterized
his forebears in the early days of Canada.
This is amply attested to by the adventuresome spirit which encouraged him to go into
the great West and the North. It is through
the efforts of such men as our late colleague
that the boundless treasures of these regions
have been unearthed, and in this respect his
achievements will prove a great inspiration
to young men of vision.
Senator Fafard has left a great legacy to
those who follow him. With men of his
calibre, willing to bear the responsibilities
of public life, I feel that our country's future
will be secure. After his long years of public
service and our long-established friendship,
it is difficult to believe that we shall never
see him again in the halls of Parliament. In
ours hearts his memory will always remain.
I would like to express my deep sympathy
to his widow in the loss which she has
sustained.
Hon. John T. Haig: Ilonourable senators,
I came to know our late colleague after he
entered this chamber. I did not know him
well while he was in the other house, although
during the latter part of his membership there
I. was in the Senate. I had the honour and
pleasure of serving with him on one of the
committees of which he was chairman, and
I was greatly impressed with his fairness and
uprightness in dealing with all the questions
that came before the committee.
We shall miss Senator Fafard very
much. He was one of those quiet, unassuming
men who make up such a large part of the
population of this country, yet he served his
fellow Canadians in a way that will not be
forgotten. For long years after some of us
are gone he will be gratefully remembered

by the people of Canada and especially by
those in the province of Quebec.
Those of us who were privileged to be
associated with him in Parliament will always
cherish the memory of his kindness.
Honourable senators, I join with the Leader
of the Government in expressing sympathy
to our late colleague's widow. May Mrs.
Fafard and all the friends who mourn his
passing be consoled by the fact that their grief
is shared by many others who have enjoyed
the friendship, love and comradeship of
Senator Fafard.
Hon. J. J. Duffus: Honourable senators, on
an occasion like this it is difficult not to repeat
sentiments already expressed. It is with
mingled feelings of sorrow and pride that I
rise to make a few brief observations on the
passing of my late colleague and deskmate.
We had been warm friends since we were
both members of the House of Commons. The
late Senator Fafard was continuously a
member of the House of Commons from 1917
to 1939, and he was summoned to the Senate
in 1940. For a number of years he was the
capable Chairman of the general Government
caucus of the Government of the late Right
Honourable Mackenzie King. While he was
of a quiet disposition he was always affable,
exceptionally friendly and in fact quite witty.
Of late years he had not taken a very active
part in the debates in this chamber, but he
was always faithful in his attendance at
meetings of committees to which he had been
appointed. He will be greatly missed by all
members on both sides of this chamber, and
particularly by myself.
By profession, Senator Fafard was a land
surveyor, having received his diploma in
1905. In 1924 he was president of the Quebec
Land Surveyors Association.
Honourable senators, it can be truthfully
said that the late Senator Fafard was a
great Canadian, and a true lover of his
native province.
Our late colleague is survived by his
widow, to whom we extend our very deepest
sympathy.
(Translation):
Hon. Aristide Blais: Honourable senators,
even though a man is growing old and getting
closer to the great adventure, he is none the
less overcome when the Grim Reaper strikes
a dear one and deprives him of a deep
friendship which, even yesterday, was one
of the joys of his life.
I met Fernand Fafard in Edmonton, in
1902, when he was a surveyor apprentice with
the firm of Coté and Roy of Quebec city,
which was engaged in making surveys along
the Pembina and McLeod rivers, northwest

SENATE

of Edmonton. He was at that time a tall
and handsome young man, barely twenty
years of age, pleasant looking, bright eyed,
square shouldered and of athletic bearing.
He was the picture of vigor and action,
although modest and reserved in word and
manner.
We were not long in discovering that we
had several things in common. He came, as
I did, from the south shore of the lower St.
Lawrence, and at that time those who came
from that part of the country were very
clannish; moreover, he had attended the
Christian Brothers' College of L'Islet, where
my two brothers were studying at the time.
I saw him at infrequent intervals during
two years, when he came for supplies at the
general store of friends of mine, Larue and
Picard, in Edmonton. Then, his contract having come to an end, he returned to the province of Quebec and I saw nothing of him
for many years.
He became a full-fledged surveyor in 1905,
and shortly after having received his degree
he was assigned the difficult task of surveying for the first time the whole fertile district
of Abitibi. He acquitted himself of this
work with rare ability. Later on, he was
sent by the Brown Corporation to explore
the upper St. Maurice river and the Lake St.
John district. He was thus given the chance
to feast his eyes upon the scenic beauty of
this lovely river and of the many lakes located
along its course.
As for the Lake St. John district, he was
quite dazzled by its great forests and beautiful lakes, still in their virgin state. He combined the faith of a discoverer and the
instinctive sense of observation of an Indian.
He was a good walker and was endowed with
remarkable stamina. Swamps, mosquitoes,
floods, rain, snow, cold, be could face them
all and, by his optimism and resourcefulness,
overcome all difficulties.
Not only was be well grounded in his
profession and of a generous nature, but he
was endowed with a splended disposition. He
was affable, good-natured, jovial, he had a
pleasant voice, a quick and delicate wit, and
he was a charming companion, who loved
sports, hunting and fishing and was the pride
and joy of his men, on whose affection, esteem
and devotion be could count.
Those long months spent in constant and
close contact with nature, when he slept under
canvas or under the stars, and was awakened
by the first chirps of the birds or by the
sting of the wind, gave him the soul of a
poet, hardened him to the inclemencies of
the different seasons and developed in him an
almost instinctive knowledge of the things
around him, of the ripple and sighing of the

trees he came to recognize, of the rivers on
which he loved to meander at sundown.
In January, 1940, we found each other again
in the entrance hall of the Senate, on the
very day when both of us had the great
honour of being summoned to this house.
We had not seen each other for 38 years.
He had changed very little, although he had
aged a bit and become a little heavier and
slightly stooped, but his step had the same
spring and his face the same and even more
accentuated good nature, the same kindness
and sincerity, the same gentle irony glistening nearly always with a kindly smile; and
the joy of living was oozing from his whole
person.
In a reminiscing vein, we recalled for a
few moments the days of his apprenticeship,
near Edmonton, in 1902. He had come a long
way since then and met with success at every
step. He was first elected to the House of
Commons in 1917 and such was his popularity
that he was returned five times thereafter,
once by acclamation.
He was noted for his deep understanding
of men and things and kept well abreast of
political problems.
He was highly interested in social security
projects and never lost an opportunity of
helping to bring them into being or of
improving the living conditions of his constituents.
Thanks to the clear and penetrating turn
of his professional mind, he was accustomed
to find his way through the most complicated
situations so that, without any apparent
effort, he could do a great deal of work in a
short time.
He had the confidence of the leaders of the
party who respected his perfect honesty and
appreciated his advice.
He enjoyed the
friendship of several ministers, including the
late the Right Honourable Ernest Lapointe,
the former Minister of Justice, who loved
him as his own brother.
There was never a more simple, straightforward and truly patriotic man, although he
guarded jealously his freedom of action. He
did not pretend to know the classics, but he
expressed himself in warm, stirring and colorful terms which well depicted his feelings
and the interest he took in his electors.
Neither was his judgment warped by the
subtleties of higher education. His was a
natural and sometimes spontaneous judgment, emanating from the true common sense
which was his chief asset and the envy of his
friends; it was allied to an almost feminine
intuition, so acute, so sensitive that he could
almost foresee events and know their consequences beforenbd.

MAY 17, 1955
He was a most generous man, who opened
his door to any distress, whether small or
great. But he was also very discreet and so
modest that he hesitated to give openly.
In addition, he was endowed with that
courtesy, that exquisite politeness and that
hospitality which characterize the true gentleman.
Such was, as I knew him, the
outstanding and distinguished man we have
just lost. He will long be mourned in this
house and throughout the country, wherever
he passed in doing good.
(Text):
Hon. Armand Daigle: Honourable senators,
I would like to add just a few words to what
has already been said of the late Senator
Fafard.
We of the Senate have certainly lost a
great colleague, for Senator Fafard was
keenly devoted to all his Parliamentary
duties in this house, as he had been in the
other house, where he sat for many years.
Senator Fafard was always an inspiration
to the new-comer to this house; his calm
and dignity and his willingness to advise all
of his new colleagues gave confidence to new
senators.
To his wife and his immediately family
I offer my deepest sympathy.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, I would feel very remiss indeed if
I did not take this opportunity on my own
behalf and in association with the honourable senator from Peterborough West (Hon.
Mr. Duffus) and on behalf of those of us
whose designations in this house are in the
neighbouring province of Ontario, to pay
respect to the memory of our late colleague.
He was intimately associated with a period
of Parliamentary affiliations that is becoming
rather overshadowed by the passing of so
many old members and associates.
I had the great privilege of being a deskmate of Senator Fafard when he entered
this chamber, after having served so many
years in the House of Commons. I had
known him slightly while he was in that
house, mainly because, as has been so felicitously pointed out by the honourable senator from St. Albert (Hon. Mr. Blais), be was
one of the closest of friends of a friend of
so many of us, the late Right Honourable
Ernest Lapointe. Senator Fafard entered the
Senate two years after I did, and I shall
always remember him for words of approval
and encouragement which he uninvitedly
but very graciously extended to me on one
of my first attempts at expressing myself
in this house. It was on the occasion of the
passing of another old friend, Senator J. C.

Elliott, who was a member of this house for
a few years. The Honourable J. C. ElliottJack Elliott, as he was known-was also a
close friend of the late Right Honourable
Ernest Lapointe. In my remarks I suggested
that that association between those two men,
one from Ontario and the other from Quebec,
extending so intimately over so many years,
was a symbol of the growing bond of attachment and understanding that had fortunately
and with great results to us all, developed
between these two provinces.
It was on that note that my deskmate of
that time spoke to me with most encouraging sympathy and approval. I have always
thought since then, and I am glad to be
able to do so now, that I might have associated him with that triangular friendship
as the solid, firm base of the relations that
existed amongst the three of them, whose
contributions to the ever-present problem of
better understanding and more cordial feeling between different parts of this country
have been far more valuable-far richer in
their results, possibly-than most of us have
ever appreciated.
I have always felt that the late senator bore
the indelible impress of a man who had spent
a great part of his early life in the wilderness
of this country, exploring and helping to
develop the vast hinterland areas not only of
his own province of Quebec but of the middle
western provinces of Canada as well. Although we did not hear him in this chamber
as often as many of us would have liked to,
he possessed a serenity of mind and strength
of character which could not but impress
those of us who had the great privilege of
knowing him.
At this time I should like on my own behalf
and those of us from the province of Ontario
to extend to his charming wife, who did so
much to lighten and glorify his later years,
our warmest and most sincere sympathy.
Hon. Charles B. Howard: Honourable senators, I want to join with the previous
speakers in paying my respects to the memory
of the late Fernand Fafard. By his integrity,
his honesty and his enthusiasm he endeared
himself to the people of his constituency, and
they elected him at six general elections. I
was in the other house with him for fifteen
years, and was appointed to the Senate at
the same time that he came to this body. In
my opinion he represented the real mentality
of the province of Quebec. He will be much
missed: he was one of Quebec's distinguished
sons. I join with other honourable senators
in extending my sympathy to Mrs. Fafard in
her bereavement.

SENATE

(Translation):
Hon. Paul Henri Bouffard: Honourable senators, I should feel remiss in my duty if I
failed to add my tribute to those already
expressed to the memory of our lamented
colleague, Senator Fafard. If more worthy
Quebec representatives than I cannot express
their sympathy here this evening, it is because
they will attend the funeral of our late friend
tomorrow morning.
I am not surprised to hear a large number
of senators say that they will miss Senator
Fafard.
I accompanied the remains of our late colleague to his favorite home, in his electoral
division of L'Islet, in his beloved section of
the country; a large number of his constituents, sad and weeping, came to pay their
respects.
Although he had left L'Islet, he returned
there each summer.
I had the good fortune to number myself
among the recipients of his valuable advice,
based on his long experience, which he dispensed freely in a humble and generous way;
indeed, he made you feel as if you were
doing him a favour by accepting his counsel.
Not only was Senator Fafard gifted with good
judgment, but he was also a marvellous host.
During the summer, I had an opportunity of
passing his home frequently at L'Islet, in the
lower St. Lawrence district, and he would be
aggrieved if I failed to stop. He liked to
welcome his friends and to listen to them.
He was anxious to know their views. In
return, he gave them useful advice.
We, from Quebec, will sadly miss Senator
Fafard. We shall miss his experience, his
hospitality and his sound counsel. But this
is life and we must make the best of it.
I wish to express to his worthy and distinguished wife my deepest sympathy.

BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACTS
AMENDMENT BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, May
12, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Euler for the second reading of
Bill H-10, an Act to amend the British North
America Acts, 1867 to 1952.
Hon. Salier A. Hayden: Honourable senators, the principle of this bill directs the
attention of the Senate to a very important
question and one which, in affecting the
Senate, affects thereby one of the legislative
bodies which make up the Parliament of
Canada. It is a serious as well as an important question, having to do with the
increasing number of vacancies which have
occurred in this body. Unfortunately, even
since this bill was introduced we have had
occasion, this evening, to note the loss of
another member of our body, which brings
the number of vacancies to twenty-two. This
number, compared with a full representation
of one hundred and two, represents a very
substantial reduction of membership in a
body which, even when filled in accordance
with the requirements of our constitution, is
not very large.
So far as the principle is concerned, I think
it is an important one, and the sponsor of the
bill is to be commended for having brought
up the matter for public discussion and the
expression of the views of the Senate, because
it affects senators themselves in a very particular way. As these vacancies mount and
the public press faithfully records their increasing numbers, there is a growing public
tendency toward disparaging comment on the
Senate, to the effect that under these conditions it cannot properly function and perform its duties. In the end this reflects upon
the dignity and the usefulness of the Senate
as a legislative body. If, in fact, 80 members
constitute a sufficient representation for the
performance of the public duties for which
the Senate is responsible under our constitution, then we should face the issue and take
some positive action towards providing for a
Senate consisting of 80 members. That was
not the notion or the idea that moved those
who took part in the drafting of the constitution and its provisions for a Senate with
a fixed numerical representation.
It seems that a special plan was followed
in formulating the various qualifications concerning the setting up of the Senate. Four
great divisions of Canada are provided with
equal numerical representation in this house
-Western Canada, Quebec, Ontario and the

MAY 17, 1955
Maritimes. There is a separate and additional
provision for representation from Newfoundland. These territorial divisions for representation in this bouse were undoubtedly
designed to provide one legislative body in
the Parliament of Canada where equal representation and voice could be given during
consideration of any legislative measure that
might affect minority rights-whether racial,
religious or of any other kind-arising by
reason of whatever wind of popular fancy
happened at that moment to be blowing
through the elected House of Commons.
Maintenance of a large number of vacancies bas persisted for a period of some twenty
or twenty-five years, and we should at this
time face the issue and decide whether the
original plan of those who provided the constitution of the Senate of Canada is still required for the proper functioning of our
Parliament, or whether a reduced membership in this house with equal recognition to
the various parts of Canada would serve
the purpose. I say that we should face this
issue now, so that the public might retain
their confidence in this legislative body and
feel that it is perfectly capable and willing to
carry out its duties.
There are two questions involved here. One
turns on the ability of the Senate to do its
job, and the other turns on the acceptance
by the public-in some measure, an uninformed public-of the idea that the Senate
with reduced numbers can effectively perform
its functions.
In my view the second question is just as
important as the first, for the continued
successful functioning of the Senate is dependent upon some measure of public confidence
as well as public interest in the Senate.
We do not get anywhere by attempting to
excuse ourselves for inaction. We do not
get anywhere by looking the other way and
saying that there is no problem, for there
is indeed a very serious one and it affects
the well-being of the Senate and its standing in the public mind of Canada.
Honourable senators, having said that, I
should like to turn to some of the other
political and national questions which are
provoked by the principle of this bill. Some
of the present vacancies have persisted for
possibly five years. A study of the record in
respect of those provinces where some of
those vacancies of that duration exist will
show, I think that some subsequent vacancies
have been filled.
The sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr. Euler)
told us that one vacancy has continued for
at least seven years.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Nearly seven years.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: Nearly seven years. If
failure to make the particular appointments
is embarrassing to the Governor in Council,
the advisers of the Governor General in
Canada or the Prime Minister of Canada, my
feeling is that by this time the embarrassment must have become chronic. If under
the present system some vacancies cannot be
filled within five years, and this leads to
embarrassment, it would seem to be time to
take positive and affirmative action to provide
for a systern that would avoid such
embarrassment and the kind of situation we
have in the Senate at this time. In any event,
this discussion, to the extent that it will
provoke the thinking of the people as to
what should be done, having regard to their
constitutional right to have 102 members in
the Senate, will have accomplished a useful
purpose, even if nothing more comes out of
it. On that phase I shall have something
further to say in a few moments.
Honourable senators, I am merely expressing my own views on this subject. However,
as a senator I do feel quite keenly about it.
I was made more conscious of the importance
of the subject tonight when we were expressing our respects to the late Senator Fafard
and our regrets at his passing. Our late colleague and I came to the Senate together,
in February of 1940, and an occasion like this
makes one realize the passage of time. I have
always enjoyed my association in the Senate,
and I have learned to appreciate fully the real
function and purpose of this body and its
importance in the legislative scheme of things.
Therefore I am extra sensitive, shall I say,
to anything that might reflect in the public
mind, rightly or wrongly, on the usefulness
of the Senate, such as even the merest suggestion that the ability of the Senate to function properly is impaired because of failure
to keep its strength up to the numbers required by the constitution.
Honourable senators, in my opinion the
position of the Senate will not be improved
by delaying consideration of this. question.
Sooner or later it will have to be faced and
some action will have to be taken. In
these circumstances I turn my attention to
a study of the bill before us. I was urged
on to most favourable consideration of this
measure because of one of the factors I have
mentioned, namely, the public interest, which
is so important if the Senate is to continue
to function as a legislative body in our
scheme of Parliament. The work of the Senate
is substantially committee work, and when
a number of committees are sitting the probhem of small attendance, on account of 22
vacancies in the Senate, becomes more and
more acute. If we must carry on with 80
members instead of 102 I think we should

SENATE

proceed to reorganize our committee systern
into one suitable for a membership of 80
instead of 102. Let us be realistic about it.
In considering the legal aspects of the question, I looked first at the provision in the Act
requiring the Governor General to appoint
senators to fill vacancies. The language is
mandatory; it says "shall". Now, it does
not say "shall forthwith", it says "shall". In
my view, the interpretation most likely to
be given to that language, if it ever became
the subject of interpretation, would be, "shall
within a reasonable time after the vacancy
occurs make an appointment to fill that
vacancy". When I examine the language of
the bill, the only difference I can find between
the provision in the constitution and the provision in the bill is that instead of saying
"the Governor General shall within a reasonable time" fill vacancies, the bill says "the
Governor General shall, within six months"
do so. Based on the little experience I have
had in matters of interpretation I am inclined
to the view-and I think the courts would be
inclined to hold-that the six months limitation provided by the bill is a reasonable time.
Honourable senators, having got that far
in my rationalization of the subject, I have to
face this question: Am I going to pile frustration on futility? The provision in the constitution at the present time has permitted a
system to develop over a period of 25 years
by which, constantly and persistently, a
substantial number of vacancies have occurred. I think possibly the number of
vacancies at this time has reached a highwater mark.
Hon. Mr. Euler: There were twenty-three
in the last Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Then it is approaching
a high-water mark.
If the provision in the constitution has not
resulted in the flling of these vacancies,
what is the hope that a change in wording,
and the six months limitation, would be
more likely to bring it about? And if there
were failure to make an appointment within
six months, what would be the consequences? Under the constitution as it stands,
no legal sanction can be invoked for failure
to fill a vacancy in the Senate within a
reasonable time.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my friend a
question? Not being a lawyer, I would like
to be informed on this point. My friend has
stated that under the provisions of the constitution as it now stands it is practically
mandatory to make appointments within a
reasonable time. With that in view, does he
think that application could be made to a
court for a mandamus to have senators
appointed?

Hon. Mr. Hayden: I had proposed to deal
with that, but I will try to answer my friend
now. I know of no provision in law under
which an application could be made for a
mandamus against the Crown for failure to
proceed under this section of the British
North America Act. As I stated, I am unable
to find in the constitution any legal sanction
that can be invoked for failure to fill a
vacancy. If the present system is to be
changed it must be by force of public
opinion, and there must be the sort of expression of opinion which has been given in
this debate thus far. I think it is important
that we should express our opinions in this
regard, because if we are satisfied to sit
back, if we are satisfied to make excuses for
inaction, then we are contributing to an
increasing volume of public opinion which
may hold the Senate in disregard, as an
unimportant body whose membership should
be permitted to wither away.
After reaching that stage in my comparison of the bill and the present provision
in the constitution, I then came to the most
disturbing feature of the whole thing, as far
as I am concerned, and I said to myself,
"What then is the course of action that
should be taken?" Honourable senators, I
shudder to think what public reaction would
be if an announcement were made that the
Senate of Canada, on a recorded vote, expressed itself against the principle enunciated in this bill, which merely requires that
vacancies in the Senate shall be filled
promptly. Having regard to that enunciated
principle, I could not interpret a recorded
vote against this bill as anything less than
evidence that the senators who voted against
it were not in favour of filling vacancies in
the Senate within a reasonable time. That is
what gives me concern.
Honourable senators, that is my sincere
view. I hope the members of this house will
credit me with sincerity, for I have never
yet expressed a viewpoint here that was not
sincere.
The important consideration, in my view,
is what the reaction of the public, informed
or otherwise, would be if the bill were rejected in the Senate. So far as the legal
aspect is concerned, except for implication
contained in the specific limitation "within
six months", as against "within a reasonable
period"-which I think is inherent in the
present provision of the constitution-I do
not see enough difference between the two to
justify putting an equally ineffective and
unenforceable provision in the constitution
in the place of the one already there. That
is the rationalization that I have done, and
I have tried to give my reasons; indeed I felt

HISTORIC SITES AND MONUMENTS BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Charles G. Hawkins moved the second
reading of Bill 182, an Act to amend the Historic Sites and Monuments Act.
He said: Honourable senators will recall
that two years ago the Historic Sites and
Monuments Board was placed on a statutory
basis. At that time provision was made for
a board of twelve members, ten to be
appointed by the Governor in Council representing each of the provinces, the other two
being the Dominion Archivist and the Chief
Curator of the National Museum. It was
further provided that the chairman should bo
appointed by the Governor in Council, that
members would hold office for periods not
exceeding five years and that any retiring
member might be eligible for reappointment.
The board, which meets each year, performs an advisory function only. The implementation of its recommendations is subject to the approval of the minister and to
funds being voted by Parliament. The board's
powers and duties are to receive and consider recommendations respecting the marking or commemoration of historic sites, the
establishment of historic museums and the
administration of such places, and to advise
the minister in carrying out his duties under
the act.
Before proceeding to explain the changes
in the act proposed by the legislation before
us, I am sure that honourable senators will
agree that the efforts and work of this board
deserve the highest commendation. Joseph
Howe once said:
A wise nation fosters national pride and love
of country by perpetual reference to the sacrifices
and glories of the past.

I am sure that we all agree with this
philosophy. In my belief, however, there
is a tendency to emphasize the significance
of the role played by a few famous people
without sufficient consideration being given
to the roles of many ordinary citizens whose
fortunes did not lead thern into a position
where their valour was questioned or their
leadership put to the test. By this I do not
wish to minimize the magnificent work of

such great men as Champlain, Wolfe, Montcalm, Brock, Macdonald, Laurier or a host
of countless others whose names have become
household words, and who have played such
important roles in the initial stages of our
country's development. I do wish, however,
to say that our greatness is just as much due
to the industry, virtue and endurance of
thousands of individuals whose endeavours
are not recorded in history and whose final
resting place may for ever be unknown to
those of us who are the beneficiaries of their
honest toil. Lord Carnarvon, who was Secretary of State for the Colonies at the time
of Confederation, expressed this very eloquently when he said:
Individuals pass swiftly like shadows across the
normal scene, but the life of the state is a long
one; that which to the individual is so long is to
the state a very short affair. Party politics may
seern to divide us; statesmen may make trying
demands; but in spite of all, these individuals may
do much.

I think it is significant and quite appropriate that the administration of the Historic
Sites and Monuments Board should be under

the aegis of the Minister of Northern Affairs
and National Resources. While our frontiers
are being pushed back to the west and north
it is appropriate in this progression that we
should mark for succeeding generations the
course by which we are managing to bring
this rich land of Canada to a place of preeminence in the world of today.
The actual changes proposed by the bill
are simple. The first amendment comprises
a broadening of the definition of "historic
place". Since the act was passed a good deal
of thought bas been devoted to the question
of preserving buildings and structures which
would form living memorials to the past and
which would generally be of more interest
and value to the Canadian people than some
sites, however well marked, where some
celebrated structures formerly stood. Some
of the buildings that may be considered by
the board from time to time may be of very
great interest because of their age or because
of the architectural design used in their construction. They may be excellent examples
of a particular period or style of architecture
which would be of significance in illustrating
the cultural development of Canada in different areas over the years. In fact, the Royal
Commission on Arts, Letters and Sciences
recommended that this type of structure be
preserved for these reasons wherever it was
possible. The present definition of "historic
place" is not broad enough or appears to
preclude consideration of buildings that have
no particular association with an historic
event or personage and buildings that are of
interest because of age or design alone would,
therefore, seem to be excluded. As I pointed

MAY 17, 1955
out earlier, however, it is important to remember that the way of life of the early pioneers
who laid the foundation of this country also
merits recognition in the story of Canada.
It is, therefore, proposed to amend the definition so that consideration could be given such
buildings and if justified, action might be
taken to preserve them.
The second amendment touches the matter
of representation on the boardL At the present
time the Act provides for a representative
from each province. However, as the provinces of Ontario and Quebec are the largest
in Canada in extent and as they were both
settled very early in Canadian history, the
volume of work arising from them is
naturally much greater than in the case of
the other provinces. It has become apparent
that the present situation is not satisfactory
and it is, therefore, proposed at this time to
provide for an additional member to represent each of these two provinces. While I
hope that honourable senators will forgive
the digression and also recognize the reason
for these additional members being appointed
to the board, I would not be true to my
native province if I did not remind the house
that the earliest white settlements were
established on the Bay of Fundy in Nova
Scotia by Champlain. Indeed descendents of
this hardy band of settlers will celebrate
this year the 200th anniversary of one of
the most unfortunate incidents in our history,
the expulsion of the Acadians from the
country which they had struggled so hard
to develop and maintain.
Returning, however, to the composition of
the Historic Sites and Monuments Board,
one other minor change is contemplated at
this time. Under the present act the Chief
Curator of the National Museum is 'an ex
offcio member of the board. While the
present incumbent of this position has
knowledge and experience which is of particular value to the board, the duties of the
position do not necessarily require this. It
is, therefore, deemed practical that the
minister should be able to designate, as a
member, whichever officer of the department
can be of most assistance to the board.
The third and final change concerns the
basis of payment, to members of the board
appointed by the Governor in Council, of
their fees and expenses. Prior to the passing
of the present act members of the board
held an honorary status for which they drew
a daily allowance when on duty and were
reimbursed in respect of transportation expenses. When the present act was enacted
it provided that members be paid a fee for
each meeting of the board and that they
should be reimbursed for their actual living
and travelling expenses incurred on the

board's business. There is now a unanimous
wish by members of the board to return to
the former basis. They feel that although
the board is now established by statute that
the work itself is of an honorary nature and
that they should not be paid a fee of any
kind. In response to this request this change
is being made. Under the arrangements
existing prior to the act and to which they
are now returning, each member received a
living allowance of $15 per day when on
duty. This was found inadequate and was
increased to $20 a day when on duty for
the board in addition to which they received
transportation expenses. This is a reasonable
suggestion and it is estimated that the cost
of the proposed new basis would represent
a very small increase, if any, over the
present system.
Finally, reference is made to the proposed
provision for a stenographic allowance of
$75 per year to the chairman and $30 a year
to the other members. Provision of a stenographic allowance of $30 a year was in effect
before the passage of the present act.
I am sure that honourable senators may
wish to ask a number of questions and it is,
therefore, my intention, when second reading is given, to move that the bill be considered further in committee. I believe that
the bill is sound in principle, and I commend
it to the house for favourable consideration.
Hon. Thomas A. Crerar: Honourable senators, there are one or two observations I
would like to make on this bill. Before doing
so however, could the Leader of the Government in this house (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)
indicate to us what department it is proposed
to have this board corne under?
Hon Mr. Macdonald: The Department of
Northern Affairs and National Resources.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It is not mentioned in
the bill.
Before the Department of Mines and
Resources was reorganized some years ago
into two or three departments, the administration of the Historic Sites and Monuments
Board was in that department.
The former definition of "historic place"
reads as follows:
A historic place means a site, building or other
place of national historic interest or significance ...

The amendment proposed here widens
that definition, and, it appears to me, widens
it rather indefinitely. The new definition is
this:
Historic place means a site, building or other
place of national historic interest or significance,

SENATE

Honourable senators will recognize that
the words I have just quoted form the
present definition. The amendment adds
these words:
and includes buildings or structures that are
of national interest by reason of age or architectural design . . .

That may be all right. But in my judgment
it tremendously widens the application of the
bill and, if I am not mistaken, will bring
down upon the department a flood of applications for recognition of buildings which have,
perhaps, no more than a peculiar architectural
design or are recommended by reason of their
age. I think we should go rather cautiously
about widening the present definition. When
the bill goes to committee, as I assume it
will,Hon. Mr. Macdonald:
proposed that it should.

The

mover

has

Hon. Mr. Crerar: -that is a point on which
I think we should get some information.
Though it is of much importance to maintain
historic sites and monuments and to mark
places of historic significance, the practice
may become so common and so general that
its real significance and intention will be
lost. That is a matter we should watch rather
jealously and carefully.
So far as the other amendments are concerned, they seem to me to be quite in order.
The board is enlarged from nine members,
one representing each province, to fourteen,
two of the five will represent Ontario, and
two Quebec; and the Dominion Archivist is
added to the board.
The proposals for expense allowances seem
to me unobjectionable. Under the provisions
of the act which this bill is to amend,
members of the Historic Sites and Monuments
Board hold honorary positions, and they
receive only their travelling and hotel
expenses when the board has occasion to
meet at Ottawa or at some other point. This
method involves some work in the recording
of expenses, so it is proposed to change the
practice and allow the members of the board,
for the purpose of attending meetings, $20
per day and actual travelling expenses, that
is, the railway fare and presumably meals
while on the trains. As I say, that is merely
a procedure to simplify matters, and I can
see no objection to it. The only point in
which I am really interested is the change
in the definition of "historic place".
On motion of Hon. Mr. Haig the debate was
adjourned.

PRISONS AND

REFORMATORIES BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved the second
reading of Bill B-13, an Act to ýamend the
Prisons and Reformatories Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill proposes to amend the Prisons and Reformatories
Act, with particular application to the province of New Brunswick. Before discussing its
provisions in detail, probably I should refer
to the fact, which may astonish some honourable members, that a measure which relates to prisons and reformatory institutions
operated by a provincial government should
be the subject-matter of legislation by this
house.
Head 27 of section 91 of the British North
America Act, gives to the Parliament of Canada exclusive legislative authority in respect
of the criminal law, except the constitution
of courts of criminal jurisdiction, but including the procedure in criminal matters.
Head 28 gives to Parliament exclusive legislative jurisdiction in relation to the establishment, maintenance and management of penitentiaries. On the other hand, head 14 of section 92 provides that the provincial Legislature may exclusively make laws in relation
to the administration of justice in the province, including the constitution, maintenance
and organization of provincial courts, both of
civil and of criminal jurisdiction and including procedure in civil matters in those courts.
Parliament has provided in section 634 of
the Criminal Code that a person who is sentenced under an act of the Parliament of
Canada to imprisonment for life or for a term
of two years or more shall be sentenced to
a penitentiary. A person who is sentenced
under such an act to imprisonment for a
term less than two years is required to be
sentenced to imprisonment in a prison or
place of confinement other than a penitentiary, that is to a provincial institution.
It is not enough, however, for the Criminal
Code or any other act of the Parliament of
Canada to provide that a person who is convicted of an offence and is sentenced to imprisonment for less than two years shall be
sentenced to a place of confinement other
than a penitentiary. It is necessary to make
provision for the courts to commit such persons to particular provincial institutions and
to authorize the keeper of the institution to
detain them in lawful custody. Provision must
also be made for the transfer of inmates between institutions.
The conditions under
which inmates are to be employed inside
and outside the prison must be established,
and provision must be made for the maintenance of discipline within the prison. All

MAY 17, 1955
these matters and others relating to the
custody of inmates in provincial penal and
reformatory institutions are dealt with in
the Prisons and Reformatories Act, which it
is now proposed to amend.
The act goes further and has particular
provisions relating to institutions in each of
the provinces of Canada such as reformatories, industrial farms and industrial schools,
all of which are operated and maintained by
provincial governments or municipalities.
Particular provisions governing the custody
in New Brunswick provincial institutions of
persons convicted under the criminal law of
Canada are to be found in Part V of the
Prisons and Reformatories Act. At the present
time adult off enders in New Brunswick can
be sentenced for periods of less than two
years only to gaols maintained and operated
by municipalities, commonly known as
"county gaols". In February of this year the
Attorney General of New Brunswick wrote
to the Minister of Justice as follows:
This province is in the course of modernizing its
penal system. We plan on erecting a central penal
institution to be known as the New Brunswick
Central Reformatory and it is hoped that the
institution will be ready for partial occupancy, at
least, during the latter part of this year.
The province is also assuming regulation of the
county gaols, and in some cases is closing existing
county gaols which are insecure or which, for
other reasons, such as health and safety, it is
considered undesirable to keep open.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does the granting of
that power to the parole board set aside the
authority of the Remissions Branch or does
that branch also function?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I had intended coming
to that point later, but I can answer the
question now. At the present time in the
province of New Brunswick it is necessary to
make application to the Remissions Branch
under the Ticket of Leave Act, but if this bill
comes into effect the parole will be granted
by the board that is set up in that province.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Exclusively?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Exclusively. At the
present time there are boards similar to this
in the provinces of Ontario and British
Columbia. As the honourable senator knows,
the parole board in Ontario deals with these
questions exclusively.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: If this legislation is
passed will it apply to all provinces in
Canada?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No. The provisions
contained in these amendments will apply
merely to the province of New Brunswick.
Probably I should say further, in reply to the
question of the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), that the
bill proposes that a local parole committee, to
be appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in
Council, shall have jurisdiction to authorize
the release of boys from the institution at
appropriate times during the course of their
detention, upon general conditions to be laid
down by the Minister of Justice. Once those
conditions are laid down, then the parole
board will function apart from the federal
Department of Justice.
I intended to read in part another letter
which the Attorney General of New Brunswick had written, setting forth in more detail
his plans in respect to this home. Perhaps it
is sufficient to say that he has also requested
that the bill be amended so that the parole
committee can be set up by the Lieutenant
Governor in Council of that province.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Did I understand the Leader
of the Government to say that this bill is
designed solely in the interests of the province
of New Brunswick and will not affect the
other provinces?

In order to carry out these plans the Attorney General of the province of New Brunswick has requested Parliament to pass the
amendments which are now before this house.
Presumably the New Brunswick Central
Reformatory will be a modern type of institution where up-to-date principles of penology
are applied with a view to effecting the
rehabilitation and reform of inmates. I think
all honourable senators will agree that since,
as the Attorney General of New Brunswick
says, his province has embarked on a course
of modernizing its penal system, the Parliament of Canada should do everything it can
to assist in this laudable undertaking.
The other purpose of this bill is to vest
authority in a parole board, provincially
appointed, to release inmates of the Boys'
Industrial Home at any time during their
confinement. That is an institution designed
for the custody, care, and treatment of juveniles, that is, boys under the age of sixteen

all encourage our provinces to take forward

There must be some punishment for them, of
course, but there must also be rehabilitation.
That is what the Province of New Brunswick
has in mind in requesting this house to pass
the bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Question!
Hon. Mr. Reid: There are boys in industrial
homes in every province, and there must be
an act under which these institutions are
governed.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, there is one, for
instance, in the province of British Columbia. The parole board in that province comes
under separate provisions of the act as it is
now stands. However, the provisions in that
respect do not at the present time prevail
in the province of New Brunswick.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I see.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The purpose of this
bill is to bring those provisions into effect
in New Brunswick.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: This measure will not affect
Dorchester Penitentiary in New Brunswick?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No. This legislation
will not affect penitentiaries: they are under
dominion jurisdiction. Remissions, in so far
as they apply to penitentiaries, still come
under the Remissions Branch of the Department of Justice. In fact, as Solicitor General,
those applications come before me.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,

Hon. Mr. Haig: Next sitting.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: As I have said, I have
no objection to the bill going to committee,
but an honourable senator suggested that

I suggest, therefore, that the bill be read the
third time at the next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The bill seems most
commendable, and perhaps it is not necessary
to send it to a committee.

BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACTS
AMENDMENT BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Euler for the second reading of Bill H-10,
an Act to amend the British North America
Acts, 1867 to 1952.
Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
in rising to speak on the motion for second

reading of this bill, I think it is well, for
the purpose of emphasis, to refer to its title:
An Act to amend the British North America
Acts, 1867 to 1952. It therefore is an Act
to amend the constitution of Canada; and
as such it is of great importance and should
receive careful consideration in all its
phases.
I listened with great interest, as I am sure
all members of this house who were present

did, to the speech of the sponsor of this bill,

MAY 18, .1955
the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler). His remarks were clear, concise and lie was specific in what lie proposed.
After listening to his exposition of the facts
and the logic of the matter, I would say
lie made a very strong case, but, on reflection, it occurs to me that what appears on
the face of the bill is not all that there is to it.
And after considering speeches made by other
members of the house also, especially by
those who seem to be in favour of the bill,
I have come to the conclusion that it would
be unwise for the Senate to send such a bill
forward to the House of Commons at this
time, and as a consequence I intend to vote
against the bill.
The sponsor envisages amendment of the
constitution of Canada by repealing the
present section 24 of the British North
America Act and substituting therefor a new
section 24 which lie considers would make
it mandatory to fill Senate vacancies within a
certain time after they occur. I believe that
a Senate bill having this for its purpose is
a wrong approach to the matter. In this
view I am supported by one honourable
senator, an eminent member of the legal
profession.
I think the bill is too blunt and it is, no
doubt, futile; moreover, it is not a friendly
bill. If the matter is at all urgent it could
be better approached by a resolution directed
to the Prime Minister and his Government
expressing the wishes of this bouse, telling
them what we desire and what we think
should be done and asking for their consideration of the matter. For us to pass the
bill before us would look as though the
Senate wanted to be its own physician, to
cure its own ills.
Hon. Mr. Euler: And why not?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: If instead we approached
the Prime Minister and the Government we
could have a much more friendly discussion
of the matter and perhaps come to an
amicable settlement of the whole problem.
I personally believe, and in this I think
I am supported by some senators who are
members of the legal profession, that a bill
to amend the constitution of the country,
especially one which affects the Senate and
the House of Commons, should be a matter
of Government policy; and unless it is a
matter of Government policy I do not see
how it could pass Parliament. If we were
to send the present bill to the House of
Commons, I am afraid it would become the
subject of speeches and opinions that might
make us wish we had not sent over there
this "take it or leave it" proposition, a bill
which would indicate that we are not

flexible in the matter, that we want the
existing practice changed in our way and
no other.
Several lawyers members of the house
have made excellent speeches on the bill.
I think that debates of this kind are salutary; and if the bill has any real value at
all it is in the discussion that it provokes,
which brings into the open a matter that
could be very troublesome in the future.
The sponsor of the bill was ably supported by the honourable member fron
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). I am reminded
of the fact that both of them are ex-cabinet
ministers, who served long and well in the
government of the country. Both had great
powers as ministers of the Crown for a considerable period of time. Perhaps that is
what has given them the confidence to introduce and support in the Senate a bill that
would change the constitution, without first
consulting their former colleagues in the
other house.
The honourable senator from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) spoke on the bill last
night. He is one of the best debaters in the
house, and we usually look to him for leadership in debate, but in this particular case
I must say I was disappointed. The honourable gentleman did not really discuss the
issues. Instead, he gave us more or less of a
lecture and said, in effect, "Now, be careful
how you vote on this bill, because if you
vote against it you will impair the reputation of the Senate in the eyes of the public."
I thought that was rather strange advice
to give, but as he continued with his speech
I found that lie came to no conclusion. He
told the house that lie did not know whether
lie was going to vote for the bill or not.
because of certain features in it, and he did
not know just what to say about them. Here
we have a senator, one of our leading legal
lights, giving us a little lecture on the bill,
and then saying lie does not know whether
lie is going to vote for the bill or not. If I
had originally been in favour of the bill,
I think that after listening to the speech of
the honourable senator from Toronto, knowing him as I do, I would be convinced that
lie was not very firm in his convictions one
way or the other and would conclude that
it was my duty to vote against the bill.
The honourable member from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) and the honourable
member from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck), also made excellent speeches. They
paid high tribute to the Prime Minister,
describing him as one of the great constitutional lawyers of this country, and as
a sincere and resolute man who can be
depended upon to lead this country as successfully in the future as in the past. Then,

SENATE
after praising the Prime Minister in this
way, they stated that in the matter of
appointment of senators under sections 24
and 32 of the British North America Act he
is acting in an improper manner. Evidently
there is a difference of opinion between the
Prime Minister and these legal lights of the
Senate as to what his duty is in this matter.
The Prime Minister, they say, is a great
constitutional lawyer, whose integrity is not
to be questioned. Then is it not fair to assume
that he is properly carrying out his duty
as he sees it, and that the criticisms one hears
at the present time are at variance with
what should be done in connection with
appointments to this house?
Legal members of both houses-I have
listened to many of them during the thirty
years I have been in Parliament-invariably
look for a precedent and will always quote
one if it is available. Have honourable senators noticed that no precedents were quoted
in this debate by the lawyer members who
favour the bill? Why? Because all the
precedents are against them. If the present
Prime Minister is wrong, all the others who
have held office since Confederation have
been wrong. The sponsor of the bill admits,
in effect, that that is so, because he says that
the present practice has grown up during
the years, and it seems now to be the policy
of the Government.
Hon. Mr. Euler: And also I condemned it.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: One admission I will
make in favour of rny honourable friend from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) is that his speeches
are clear and concise; and one knows what
he means.
The first appointments to the Senate were
made under a section-No. 25, I believewhich has been deleted from the British
North America Act. Reading it, one gets the
impression that the British Government kept
a pretty close tab on those appointments. We
realize, frorn a knowledge of such men as
Sir John A. Macdonald, George Brown of
Toronto, and Sir George Etienne Cartier, of
Quebec, that the first appointments were
pretty much a co-operative business, that
the members were not drawn from any one
party, because various parties entered into
the scheme of Confederation. It would seem
as though the names of the first appointees
were submitted to the Crown and, after
review, those chosen became the first Canadian senators.
If the present Prime Minister, the Right
Honourable Louis St. Laurent, is acting
wrongly in this matter, so did Sir John A.
Macdonald, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Sir Robert

Borden, Viscount Bennett, and the Right
Honourable W. L. Mackenzie King. Indeed,
on this assumption, Mr. Mackenzie King was
more guilty than the rest, because he, perhaps
more than anyone, took very great pains in
selecting persons for appointment to the
Upper Chamber.
This is not the only body created by
our constitution to which men are appointed
by the Governor General on the advice of
his ministers. Judges are selected in practically the same way. I do not believe that
there are any restrictions on how long a
judgeship shall bo vacant before a new
appointment is made. We often hear conplaints that the courts are crowded with
cases, the judges are overworked, and there
should be more appointments to the Bench,
but it is not often that such complaints come
from the general public. We believe that
we in Canada have excellent law courts and
that the judges who preside over them are
appointed in the proper way; and if the
Government delays the process of selection a
little while there is not very much we can
do about it. After all, it is a salutary practice to select the best men for judges, and, I
believe, our Canadian judges are among the
best. The appointments are made by the
party in power. At the present time most
of them are of adherents of the Liberal
party. That is the way it should be. Merit
should be rewarded; and those who are
eminent in the law, who have given good
service to their country, who support and
forward the principles of the party in power,
are the ones who should be appointed to high
positions during the time the Government
they support is in office. The sarne systern
governs the appointment of senators. The
Governor General is required to summon to
the Senate suitable persons from time to
time, and that has always been done. I am
not aware that the quality of the Senate has
ever suffered froin that practice. We are
told that there are now twenty-two vacancies,
and that this approaches the high-water mark
of unfilled positions. But perhaps that number will not remain unfilled very long.
It has always been one of the privileges
and prerogatives of Prime Ministers to
naine persons to the Senate. It is a common
criticism of the Government that it makes
party appointments to the Senate, the Bench,
and other bodies. But does it not accord
with the spirit of responsible government
that those in power, while they are in power,
shall select those whose duty it is to administer the country's business? To my mind
this course is of the very essence of responsible government. The Government in power

MAY 18, 1955
makes appointments and is responsible for
them; when another administration follows,
the duty passes to them.
Hon. Mr. Euler: This bill does not touch that
point at all. It has no connection with it.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: The legal aspects of the
bill have been discussed by honourable senators who also are lawyers, and I shall not
refer to that question except to remark that
they assume to base their argument on what
is reasonable, and have decided that a proper
period within which vacancies should be
filled is six months.
What are some reasons for the existing
delay? There are in the present House of
Commons 265 members, of whom 172 are
Liberals, and, presumably, potential candidates for membership of this body. Many
of them have spent a long time in public service and proved their merit; and I have no
doubt that the Government has a number of
them in mind for preferment when the proper
time comes. The House of Commons is
directly elected by the people for five years,
unless it is dissolved sooner by the Governor
General, acting on the advice of the Government. It may be difficult for the Prime
Minister to take a person from that house
and translate him to the Senate, for as a representative of the people in a certain constituency he may be needed in the House of
Commons.
The sponsor of the bill reminded us that
an amendment to the House of Commons Act
in 1919 provided that whenever a vacancy
occurred in that house it must be filled within
six months, and he said that amendment
served as an excellent precedent for his bill
that is now before us. I do not see any connection between them. The House of Commons is an elected body, and the Government
must maintain its majority there or cease to
exist. Therefore, it can be seen that when
the numerical strength in that house is evenly
divided it might prove a very serious matter
to appoint one of its members to the Senate,
for a by-election would have to be held within
sixty days to fill the vacant seat. Actually
this bill would set up an obstacle to appointment of members of the Commons to the
Senate.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my friend if he
is not in favour of the policy of appointing
members of the House of Commons to the
Senate?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I did not say that.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What you have said comes
pretty close to it.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I think we should be
practical about this. In years gone by the

majority of Senate appointments were made
from the ranks of those who had served well
and faithfully in the House of Commons,
and I am merely arguing that if the Prime
Minister has in mind some member of Parliament whom he wishes to appoint to a certain
seat in the Senate, it is reasonable for him to
wait until it is convenient to do so.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Might that not take seven
years?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: It is not a case of just
letting the matter drift. There may be a
definite appointment in view and the vacancy
is left unfilled until a convenient time. The
vacancy that has existed for seven years is
the exception that proves the rule.
Hon. Mr. Euler: There have been five vacancies of five years' duration each.
Hon. Mr. Horner: They occurred before the
last general election.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Many honourable senators believe that the numerical weakness of
the Opposition in the Senate is disturbing to
the Prime Minister. It has been suggested in
certain places that a number of Conservatives should be appointed, but is it natural
that the Prime Minister would appoint to
this high place, the Senate, someone who
has opposed his party and friends? However,
if the Prime Minister is considering making
such appointments in order to try to give
more balance to the Senate, we should not
make his position more difficult.
The personnel of the Senate is constantly
changing. My transportation number when I
first came here was 93, and today it is 42.
People talk about imposing an age limit on
Senators, but when you realize that during
the ten years I have been in this house 51
members have passed on, you see that nature
looks after the situation fairly well. I believe there is a bill before the House of
Commons now to impose an age limit for
senators. I would point out that two of the
leading statesmen in Europe are over eighty
years of age, Chancellor Adenauer of Western
Germany and Sir Winston Churchill of Great
Britain. I think Chancellor Adenauer is the
most progressive man in Europe today. Men
and women gain wisdom and judgment as
they grow older; and while their bodies may
fail, their minds usually remain strong. If
people were to judge senators as individuals
they would realize that there is much virtue
in the Senate of Canada.
It has been argued that the existence of
vacancies in the Senate deprives various
provinces of their rightful representation in
this house, but I do not think any one province is being discriminated against, except
perhaps Quebec, which is the home province

SENATE

of our Prime Minister. More of the vacancies
are in the two larger provinces, so when you
consider that the Senate was designed to protect minorities and give the smaller provinces
strong representation in the affairs of Parliament, there is not much to complain about.
There is no doubt that the Government
has its eye on the representation level in
this house, and if there is an inequality of
representation it does not impair our work.
Let those who feel they are being prejudiced
come forward and complain to the Government.
In the United States each state, no matter
what its size, is represented in the Senate by
two members. For instance, the State of New
York, which is a big state, has the same representation as the relatively small state of
Rhode Island. It can be seen that there was
great virtue in the way the Fathers of Confederation designed the provisions which control representation in the Senate. We in the
smaller provinces believe that this system of
reprosentation assures us that our voice in
public affairs will not be drowned out by
those who come from more rapidly progressing provinces which are becoming wealthier
and more populous.
It is said that the Hon. W. S. Fielding
once proposed in the House of Assembly in
Nova Scotia that it would be well to let the
provinces choose a proportion of the representation in the Senate of Canada. He thought
this would strengthen the Senate and result in
greater unity between the provinces and the
dominion. But would any Government surrender its privilege and right to appoint
senators? Governments do not do that sort
of thing. Under our constitution the federal
government, which represents all the people
of Canada, appoints senators, and that system
bas worked out well.
The Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig), in delivering a friendly speech, said he
would not like to see the Prime Minister
embarrassed because of the existing difficult
situation in the Senate, where the Opposition
now consists of only seven members. I do
not knov just how the problem of the weakness of the Opposition can be settled. The
Government elected by the people, appoints
the Senate by virtue of the power vested in
it by the people. It is natural that the people,
having elected a Government to power would
want it to make appointments from the viewpoint of the policies of the Government. The

Liberal party's long term in office, while it
may be detrimental in respect of appointments to the Senate, has proved to be a
splendid thing for the country, and I am
glad to say that it looks as if that party is
going to remain in power for some time.

Some people say that the Senate should be
elected. If a majority of the people want to
make it an elected chamber, all right, but
doing so would throw the whole constitution
of Canada out of balance. An elected Senate
would be more aggressive than the appointed
body bas been, and the House of Commons
would find that we had become more like the
United States Senate. Under our system the
House of Commons sustains the Government,
and the Government must maintain the confidence of that house or resign. In the United
States, although members of the Senate and
House of Representatives are elected, members of the Cabinet are appointed by the
President. I think our system is a splendid
one. The louse of Commons is elected, but
senators-men and women chosen for their
experience and achievements-are appointed,
indirectly by the people, to review the legislation of the country and to give advice to the
Government.
Honourable senators, we are told that the
Senate is short of manpower, because the
present 80 members are not sufficient to carry
on our business properly. That makes me
smile. I would hate to put an expediter in
the Senate, as is done in business, to make
a report as to whether or not there is a shortage of manpower.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Some of us are not away
from the Senate so long as others.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Many of us come from
long distances, especially those of us from
the Maritimes.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: And also those from the
West.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Others, who live nearer,
can leave Ottawa Thursday night and come
back Tuesday night. We must stand by during
the interval, but if every member remained
here and worked I do not think there would
be any evidence of a shortage of manpower
in the Senate. What happens at the beginning
of each session? Practically every chairman
of a committee moves that its quorum be
reduced from 10 to 7, or from 10 to 4, as
the case may be. He wants to reduce the
quorum so that the committee can do more
effective work, but he could say that this
objective would be achieved if more members
attended the committee's meetings. Certain
committees consist of 20 or 30 members, and
some of more. When a committee consists
of that number and the quorum is reduced
to, say, 9, don't tell me we are short of manpower in the Senate. I think we have plenty
of senators to carry on. No doubt it would
be advisable to have the present vacancies
filled. The additional members would be
valuable here, and we would like to have

MAY 18, 1955
them. However, to pass a bill in this house
telling the Government that they must fill
vacancies in the Senate within six months
seems to me to be doing a little more than
we should do as senators.
The honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) made what
seemed a novel suggestion. He said that by
delaying the filling of Senate vacancies for
some years, so many would occur that a new
Government coming into office could appoint
and fill all the vacancies and thus overwhelm
the Senate. Well, this chamber alone could
not abolish the Senate; that could only be
done by the Senate and House of Commons
together. If a House of Commons wanted to
abolish the Senate, and you could get senators
to come here and vote for its abolition, a
state of affairs would obtain, reflected by
public opinion, against which no fortifications
could stand. I think, however, we need have
no fear of that. I feel that at the end of the
present Parliament there will be, as always
on such occasions, many appointments to the
Senate.
Ever since Confederation the appointment
of senators has been the prerogative of the
Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister, in
his wisdom, wanted to select some outstanding persons outside the Liberal party, as was
suggested by the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig), to keep the Opposition in
the Senate alive, I think he would have the
backing of the country. But do not tell me
that just because someone is a big business
man, or a doctor, or this or that, he will make
a good senator. To appoint a good senator,
I think you have to choose a man or woman
who has given good public service, in Parliament or elsewhere, and who has the support
and respect of the people. In the Senate such
a person can render service beneficial to the
whole nation.
In closing, may I say to the honourable
member from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
that I return to him the quotation which he
said was a favourite of Prime Minister Mackenzie King:
The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my friend a
question? How would he interpret section
32 of the British North America Act, which
says in effect, that when a vacancy occurs,
the Governor General shall appoint?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: From time to time.
Hon. Mr. Euler: No, it does not say that.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I am not arguing the law
with my honourable friend, but I have talked
to people who are learned in the law on the
subject, and they say that is not a serious
point at all.
50437-32

Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I think we will all agree that the discussion
on the second reading of this bill has been
carried on on an exceedingly high level, and
that some most interesting and instructive
speeches have been delivered.
As has been truly said, the bill introduced by my honourable friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) is one of considerable
importance, and is necessarily so because it
deals with a part of the constitution of this
country. Indeed, any measure which purports
to deal with our constitution is extremely important and deserves very thorough consideration by this house. I feel that those
of us who have made any sort of study of
the constitution have a duty to take part in
the present debate.
I must say, and in this I am in agreement
with I think every speaker who has preceded me, that I was greatly impressed by
the speech of the honourable senator from
Waterloo in his introduction of this measure.
It seemed to me that his remarks were
moderate, that they were concise, and that
he made a good prima facie case for his bill.
I do not want to appear invidious, but I
should like to point in particular to the
speeches made last Thursday afternoon by
the honourable senators from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris), and to say that I think they
were outstanding contributions to the discussion. I single them out because in what I
propose to say this afternoon I shall deal
with and comment in some respects on some
of the thoughts which they expressed, and
perhaps attempt to carry their ideas a little
further.
The discussion has ranged over a wide field,
and I must say that in certain respects it
has had little if anything to do with the
present bill.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Some of what was said
by my honourable friend from Queen'sLunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) was extremely
germane and to the point, but I fail to see
what reference this bill has to an age limit
for senators, to provincial appointment of
senators or to the question of an elected
Senate.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Except that those matters
were referred to by former speakers.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Then my honourable
friend and the former speakers are equally
in the wrong.
I propose to confine my remarks for the
most part to a consideration of some of the
legal implications of the bill, and for that

SENATE
purpose I shall have to inflict upon my colleagues a discussion of certain legal principles
which appear to me to flow from or relate
to the bill which we now have under consideration. However, I think that when honourable senators have listened to these legal
principles and their application to the bill,
they will realize that they are of considerable
importance and may have some bearing upon
the attitude which honourable senators may
feel called upon to take when they come to
vote on the second reading of the measure.
I need refer only briefly to the basic facts
from which this measure takes its origin.
Under the British North America Act the
Parliament of Canada consists of the sovereign, the Senate and the House of Commons.
At the present time the Senate is supposed
to consist of a maximum of 102 members,
24 from each of the great territorial divisions
of the country, namely, the Maritime provinces, Quebec, Ontario and the Western
provinces, with an additional six members
from Newfoundland. Senators are named for
life by the Governor General, as provided for
under section 24 of the act, and their replacement is provided for by section 32. Both
sections are quite short and I shall take the
liberty of reading them. Section 24, which
this bill proposes to amend, says:
The Governor General shall from Time to Time,
in the Queen's Name, by Instrument under the
Great Seal of Canada, summon qualified Persons
to the Senate; and, subject to the Provisions of
this Act, every Person so summoned shall become
and be a Member of the Senate and a Senator.

That is a general procedural provision with
respect to senators and their appointment.
Section 32 says this:
When a Vacancy happens in the Senate, by
Resignation, Death, or otherwise, the Governor
General shall by Summons to a fit and qualified
Person fill the Vacancy.

Now, actually at this moment there are
only 80 senators in office. The Senate is
under-manned, or perhaps to be more accurate, I should say the Senate is under-manned
and under-womannedHon. Mrs. Hodges: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: -to the extent of more
than 20 per cent of its full membership. That,
as we all know, is the result of failure to
appoint senators to fill some of the vacancies
which have occurred during the last few
years, extending back in one case to as many
as seven years. That is the state of affairs
which the bill before us seeks to remedy for
the future, and the first question we should
consider is how it seeks to achieve that
object.
The bill proposes to amend section 24 of the
British North America Act by providing that
when a vacancy occurs in the Senate the

Governor General shall fill the vacancy
within six months. That immediately raises
the first legal question which I want to consider: What is the legal result of a statute
which calls upon a public officer to take
certain action within a limited time? This
question has often been considered by the
courts in England. I have done some slight
research on the problem over the past weekend, and I should like to refer very briefly
to one of the standard authorities on this
subject, an authority which will immediately
be recognized by my friends of the legal
profession, that of Maxwell On The Interpretation of Statutes. I have in my hand the
eighth edition of that work, produced in the
year 1937, and with regard to this particular
question I want to quote a few sentences
which appear on pages 326 and 327:
On the other hand, where the prescriptions of
a statute relate to the performance of a public
duty and where the invalidation of acts done in
neglect of them would work serious general inconvenience or injustice to persons who have no
control over those entrusted with the duty without
promoting the essential aims of the Legislature,
such prescriptions seem to be generally understood as mere instructions for the guidance and
government of those on whom the duty is imposed,
or, in other words, as directory only. The neglect
of them may be penal, indeed, but it does not
affect the validity of the act done in disregard
of them. It bas often been held, for instance,
when an act ordered a thing to be done by a
public body or public officers and pointed out the
specific time when it was to be done, that the
act was directory only and might be complied
with after the prescribed time.

Then Maxwell refers to what I suppose is
the first case that ever arose on this subject
in the English courts. There was an act
passed in the reign of Henry IV which
required justices to try rioters within a
month after the riot. In a case which arose
under that act, the decision was that this
provision did not limit the authority of the
justices to that space of time but that it only
rendered them liable to a penalty if they
neglected to try the rioters within the prescribed period.
And then on the next page, 327, I quote
one sentence only, in which Maxwell says:
It is no impediment to this construction that
there is no remedy for non-compliance with the
direction.

Now, what is the effect of this legal principle on the bill before us? The bill requires
the Governor General to fill a vacancy in
the Senate within six months. It provides no
penalty for his failure to do so, and the
reason for that is obvious. We all recognize
that it would be absurd to seek to impose
a penalty on the Governor General for not
doing something which everybody recognizes is not a personal act of his own, but
one which he can only take upon the advice

MAY 1
of those of his advisers who hold office in
the Government at the relevant time.
I conclude, therefore, that in the light of
the principles laid down in Maxwell this
bill would have little, if any, effect from a
strictly legal point of view. If the bill should
pass, the Governor General would still have
the right to delay appointments of senators
to fill vacancies for as long as his advisers
might desire, and the appointment of senators to fill those vacancies would still be
perfectly valid if made after the expiration
of the six months which the bill prescribes.
Now, I emphasize that this is the effect of
the bill solely from a strictly legal point of
view.
Its moral effect, its practical effect, or the
practical effect of writing a provision of this
kind into our constitution, is another matter
entirely, and in that connection different
considerations arise which I propose to deal
with in a few minutes.
But there is another consideration which
supports my belief that the legal effect of
the present bill would be negligible, and
that arises from a consideration of the
remarks of the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) on
Thursday last. He quoted section 32 of the
British North America Act as follows:
When a Vacancy happens in the Senate-and
he told us that on the generally
accepted principles of legal construction any
court would interpret the words "when a
vacancy happens" in section 32 as meaning
within a reasonable time after a vacancy
happensby Resignation, Death, or otherwise, the Governor
General shall by Summons to a fit and qualified
Person fill the Vacancy.
The honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris), agrees with the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) in that interpretation,
and if I remember rightly I think the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
yesterday evening expressed the same view.
I certainly would agree with them, and I
think any lawyer would do so; and I would
be much interested to learn who was the
legal authority which the honourable senator
from Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley)
quoted a few moments ago in the contrary
sense.
Now, honourable senators, that brings us
to this: The position is that as the British
North America Act now stands it requires, at
least by implication, that a vacancy in the
Senate be filled within a reasonable time after
the vacancy occurs; so that, in substance, the
only effect of the bill now before us is to
pinpoint or, if you like, to crystallize something which is already in the Act by defining
50437-32J

the words "a reasonable time" within which
Senate vacancies are to be filled as being a
period of six months.
In that light I want to discuss for a
moment the interesting constitutional question
raised by my honourable friend from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris). As the house
is aware, since the passing of the British
North America Act of 1951 Parliament has
enjoyed the power to amend the British
North America Act in all matters relating
solely to federal affairs. My honourable
friend from Vancouver South raised the
point, which he said he had not yet decided
in his own mind, as to whether this bill falls
within the class of matters relating solely
to federal affairs, and therefore lying within
the jurisdiction of Parliament to pass, or
whether on the other hand it affects provincial rights and is not therefore within our
power.
Now, if my view of this bill is the correct
one, if it does nothing else but to pinpoint
and to crystallize something which is already
to be found in section 32 of the British North
America Act, I suggest to my honourable
friend that he should not have any great
difficulty in reaching a conclusion that this
bill is one which is solely within the federal
ambit and therefore is one which we have
every right to pass. I remind him in that
connection-although I am sure he does not
need reminding, but I would remind the
house-that in the following year, 1952, acting on the powers granted to Parliament in
1951, Parliament did pass a bill amending
the British North America Act, radically
changing the basis of representation in membership of the House of Commons. Well,
now, if we have the power to do that under
the amending act of 1951, surely we also have
the power simply to interpret a provision of
the British North America Act which has
been there all the time and which deals only
with the method of appointment to one of the
houses of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask, did Parliament
not do the same thing in increasing the
membership of the Senate from 96 to 102?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No.
Hon. Mr. Farris: That was an Imperial act.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, I think that was an
Imperial act, which was passed before the
1951 amendment.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: 1950.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes: I am obliged to
my honourable friends for their help.
I have expressed the view that the strictly
legal effect of this bill, if it were passed,

SENATE
would be negligible, but its moral or practical effect would, I submit, be an entirely
different affair. Suppose this bill becomes part
of the British North America Act. It would
be taught, as part of our constitution, in all
the law schools of the country, and whenever any member of Parliament or public
man had occasion to refer to our constitution, the British North America Act, this
provision would stare him in the face. I think
the practical effect of that would be very considerable, and for this reason. No government, and no Prime Minister, likes to put
weapons in the hands of political opponents.
If, with this provision inserted in the British
North America Act, a future Prime Minister
should ignore it, he would immediately lay
himself open to the charge by his political
opponents that he was flouting the constitution of the country. That might be-depending upon the circumstances-a damaging and
effective charge.
Let me give an example to my honourable
friends, which I am sure they will all remember when I direct it to their attention, of
something which occurred very recently in
our political history in a somewhat parallel
case. Honourable senators will remember the
unholy row-shall I call it-which developed
in the House of Commons two years ago
when the Minister of Justice was accused of
failing to table within the period called for
by the act, a report of the Commissioner under
the Combines Investigation Act respecting
an alleged combine in the milling industry.
I repeat therefore that, in contradistinction
to its strictly legal effect, the moral or practical effect of writing a provision of this kind
into the British North America Act might be
quite considerable.
Now I am afraid that I must burden the
house with a second legal principle which is
implicit in this bill. Perhaps I may be
allowed first to state the effect of that legal
principle, and then to discuss the principle
itself. I say that this bill would not affect
in any way the twenty-two vacancies which
now exist in this chamber. The legal principle on which I base that statement is a
very fundamental one in the interpretation
of statutes. It is this: No Act of Parliament
has retroactive effect unless it so declares
in the clearest and most unambiguous terms.
Again may I refer to the authority whom
I have once quoted already. Maxwell On The
Interpretation of Statutes, and read a very
few sentences. First, from page 189:
Upon the presumption that the Legislature does
not intend what is unjust rests the leaning against
giving certain statutes a retrospective operation . . . They are construed as operating only
in cases or on facts which come into existence

after the statutes were passed, unless a retrospective effect be clearly intended. It is a fundamental
rule of English law that no statute shall be
construed to have a retrospective operation unless
such a construction appears very clearly in the
terms of the act or arises by necessary and
distinct implication.

And

then

a part

of one sentence from

page 190:
Every statute, it has been said, which . . .
creates a new obligation or imposes a new
duty .

. . must be presumed . .

. to be intended

not to have a retrospective operation.

Hon. Mr. Horner: That would apply particularly where a penalty was involved,
would it not?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think my honourable
friend is right to this extent, that a court
would react even more strongly against giving a statute retrospective operation if it provided a penalty, but the principle is the
sarne, whether there be any penalty or no.
If honourable senators will examine this
bill they will see very clearly that it provides in no way for it to have any retroactive
effect. No, it deals only with the future. If
it should become law it would relate solely
and exclusively to vacancies which may occur
in this chamber after it bas become law.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: So that honourable
senators need have no apprehension and
must not rest under the delusion that this
bill, if it should be passed, would force the
Governor General and his advisers immediately to fill the 22 vacancies which now
exist in this bouse. I am not very sure,
but I rather think from some remarks which
dropped from the honourable senator from
Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) that he did
have that impression. But I can assure him
that it is not correct.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: Does that mean that, if
this bill should pass, when six months have
elapsed after the passing of the bill it would
not come into operation as regards these
vacancies?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: It would mean that
only vacancies which occurred in the Senate
after the bill came into operation would have
to be filled within six months.
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: That is, it would not
apply to vacancies which would still be vacancies at the time the bill came into effect?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No; that is exactly the
point I was trying to make. I am obliged
to my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Can I supplement that by
another question: Would not the moral effect
be just the sarne as my honourable friend
bas already mentioned?

hence. I do not think any senator would contradict me in saying that such a government
would be far more likely te pay attention te
a formal declaration embodied in the British
North America Act as part of our constitution,
than to a resolution adopted by this house several years before. Therefore, if I had te
make a choice as between this bill and the
suggested resolution, I would have to choose
the bill.
Honourable senators, let me summarize the
result of this legal part of the discussion.
First, the strictly legal effect of the bill would
be small. Second, all that it does is to crystallize and to put into focus provisions which
already exist, by implication eat least, in the
British North America Act. Third, its moral
and practical effect, as against its strictly
legal effect, might be quite considerable.
Fourth, it would not affect the present position or the 22 vacancies now existing in this
body, for it deals only with future vacancies.
Il should like to discuss, for a moment only,
one detail of the bill which in my view
deserves criticism. It establishes a period of
six months for filling vacancies in the Senate.
I think that period is too short. The sponsor
of the bill gave what at first sight appeared
te be a good and logical reason for fixing
this period of six months. It is the period
within which under the present law vacancies arising in the House of Commons are
required to be filled. I suggest respectfully
to my honourable colleague that as between
filling vacancies in the House of Commons
and vacancies in the Senate different considerations apply.
In the House of Commons the object of
the six-month limitation is that the particular
constituency concerned shall not lose its representation in that house for too long a period.
The electors of that constituency are therefore
required to elect a new member within that
period to fill the vacancy. It is their business,
and their business alone, whom they choose
to elect, and the man or woman whom they
do elect will have to account to them for
his or her stewardship within a reasonably
short period of time, that is, when the next
general election comes around.
Now, I submit that the appointment of senators is a different matter. Senators are
appointed for life, and they represent the
whole province from which they come, so that
no province is ever entirely deprived of representation in this house. Furthermore, there
are certain practical considerations which
have to be taken into account by the advisers
of the Governor General in selecting a senator
from a province. We all know what those
considerations are. In some cases it is necessary to maintain the ethnic balance between

various elements of the population. In others,
there has te be a proper representation of
religious groupings; in still others, it is necessary to provide for representation of certain
territorial areas within the province. Not
seldom some of these factors conflict, and
their adjustment takes time. I suggest, therefore, that the period of six months proposed is
too short, under the circumstances, and personally I would be willing to see it extended
to at least one year. I further suggest to the
sponsor of the bill that if at the appropriate
time he were to accept an amendment lengthening the period within which senators have
to be appointed to fill vacancies the result
would be that we should have a more practical
and more workable measure.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I say to my honourable friend that in my remarks on the second
reading of the bill I stated that I was not
particularly confining myself to the six months
limitation and that if the bill did go to committee perhaps the committe could decide a
more suitable period of time, whether longer
or shorter than six months. I adhere to
what I then said.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am very grateful to
my friend for reminding me of what he had
said, because I confess that I had forgotten
until he reminded me. I am very glad that
he made that statement.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Before the honourable
senator continues, may I ask him a question?
He suggested a limitation of a year instead
of six months. Would it make any difference
to his reasoning if he felt sure that if this
bill were passed by the other house it might
be a stepping stone to further amendments
to the constitution? Is it not true that this bill
assumes the form of a step-an incidental
step, but a necessary one-toward a measure
remodelling and reforming the Senate?
I
am wondering if in those circumstances, my
honourable friend would change his point of
view.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I find it rather difficult
to answer my honourable friend, but I think
I would say this to him. It seems to me that
if we are going to contemplate a lot of other
measures of Senate reform in connection with
this bill, it is going to make no difference
whatever whether we put in a period of six
months, or a year, or any period at all.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I do not think I can
appreciate the logic of my honourable friend's
suggestion, if he will allow me to say so.
Honourable senators, before I come te my

I think that quite a distinction is to be
made between legislation which uses the
words "a reasonable time" or any fixed period
of time, as against legislation which leaves
the matter completely open, as the act does
at the present time.
I would submit further for the consideration
of honourable senators that the intention of
the Fathers of Confederation could not have
been that vacancies should be allowed to
remain unfilled for a period of from five to
seven years. On that account it seems to
me that in debating this question and trying
to find an answer to it we are taking a constructive step. I must admit, however, that
an answer is most difficult under the present
circumstances, when many vacancies exist and
demands are made by the public that they
be filled by non-partisan persons selected
from the country at large. I do not wish to
get into an argument on that point, because
none of us here have any control over appointments to the Senate. However, we must
all realize that the problem that exists today
is likely to continue for some period of time.
I would be so bold as to say that there is
not much chance of a change in government
at the next general election, and it is therefore likely that the problem of filling future
vacancies must sooner or later be faced.
Honourable senators, the principle to be
considered in dealing with this bill is simply
whether or not the Senate should function as
a full body or as a greatly depleted body
with vacancies running from 20 per cent
to 25 per cent or more of its membership.
If I am to interpret the remarks made by
the honourable gentleman from Queen'sLunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley), his reasoning
is that these vacancies should be allowed to
continue indefinitely and that there is no
need for filling them at the present time. I
would suggest that there is no one in this
house, in the other house, or even in the
country at large who would seriously say that
these vacancies should remain unfilled indefinitely and that this house should attempt
to function with 25 per cent or perhaps 50
per cent of its membership vacant.
Many questions come before the Parliament
of Canada involving different sections of the
country, and the very purpose of the creation
of this house was that all sections of the
country should be represented, and the number of representatives required to be appointed from each province is specifically
stated in the statute.
By supporting this bill we are simply proposing to write into our constitution some
specific provisions clearly showing that there

is an obligation on those who have the responsibility of making appointments to the
Senate to fill vacancies within a reasonable
time, whatever that time may be. I was impressed with the statement by the honourable
senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
that maybe six months is too short a period
of time, and that we should consider this
matter in committee.
If I have interpreted the remarks of the
honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) correctly-and I may not
have done so-I must conclude that he has
some fear or concern as to what might take
place in the other house should this bill
pass the Senate. I for one have not the
slightest concern as to what may be said
there.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: This matter has been

honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) is able to interpret the
remarks made by honourable senators, and
if the members in the other place take time
to read the debates in this house and
seriously consider this problem from a
national point of view they will I think agree
that some provisions should be written into
the British North America Act to ýprevent
the recurrence of a situation such as exists
at the present time. We as members of
this honourable house must remember that
we have a great responsibility to the public
in all national matters. We are appointed
for life, having equal jurisdiction with the
other house except in financial and money
matters. We have complete power to initiate
legislation and to change legislation, I submit
that in order that we may properly fulfil
our great responsibility, it is extremely
important that we should have a full complement of members who come from all
sections of the country and who are able
to express the views of all sections on matters
of pubile concern.
I am going to try to avoid repeating some
of the things that have been said, because
I am sure that I could not express them
as well as they have already been expressed,
particularly by the honourable senators from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), and
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen). It occurred
to me that we might consider some of the
functions of the Senate, and, at the risk of
this subject not being particularly relevant
to the present bill, if honourable members
will bear with me I would like to put on
record a reference to some of the work that
this honourable body has done in the past,
and to some of the legislation which has been
framed in this house or its committees. The

MAY 18, 1955
reason I mention this particular subjectmatter today is that I have a feeling that if
the members of the Government had an
opportunity of seeing how the committees
of this house function they would realize
that there is a great deal of legislation which
could be referred to this honourable body
and dealt with in committee much better,
I submit with ýall respect, than it is dealt
with in the committees of the House of
Commons.
We do not engage in political discussions.
But I submit that a great many pieces of
financial and commercial legislation could
originate in this house from time to time.
Also there are a number of matters that
might well form the subject of investigation
by our committees when deemed necessary.
For instance, there is an important matter
which is now the subject of study by a Royal
Commission in Canada, namely our shipping
laws. And here I wish to refer particularly
to the Shipping Bill which was dealt with
some years ago in the Senate. Prior to the
passing of the Statute of Westminster in
1931, Canada had not the power to enact
shipping legislation having any extraterritorial effect, without the consent of the
Imperial Parliament, but after the signing
of that statute Canada obtained that power.
The then Minister of Marine, the late Hon.
Alfred Duranleau, had the responsibility of
studying and drafting the first Canada Shipping Act. This was an extremely important
piece of legislation necessitating careful consideration of constitutional questions and the
bringing together of many facts affecting
shipping not only in Canada but throughout
the commonwealth.
The department engaged eminent counsel,
and in the year 1933 Bill "J", a draft bill,
was introduced into this honourable house.
I had the privilege at that time of representing a number of Great Lakes shipping
companies and so was in a position to observe
the method in which the committee carried
out this work, and I must say that, like all
others who appeared before the committee
on that occasion, I was greatly impressed
with the knowledge and the experience of its
members and the care taken by them in
dealing with that very important subject.
May I be permitted to read from the
House of Commons Hansard of June 8, 1934
at page 3814, the remarks of the then the
Minister of Marine in presenting this
important legislation before the Commons:
This house will remember that when, during the
session of 1933, Bill J was withdrawn in the

SenateI may say by way of explanation that the
bill was introduced in 1933; it was studied;

it went back with full reports to the department; changes were made; and it was introduced again in 1934.
-a small bih was introduced in this bouse providing for certain amendments to the Canada
Shipping Act respecting our coastal trade. That
bill became law, and stood as chapter 52 of the
statutes for 1932-33. May I add that the provisions
of chapter 52 have been incorporated in the
present bill.
I do not wish to close my remarks, Mr. Speaker,
without paying tribute to the Right Hon. Leader
of the Senate, Mr. Meighen, and to the members
of the Senate, and especially to the members of
its Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce and the subcommittee for the tremendous
work they have done in studying this measure.
They had to spend weeks upon weeks in studying
it, and so complete bas their work been that they
have rendered comparatively easy the task of
the house in studying the measure. I am not an
expert in maritime matters but I have perused
and studied this bill with my officials and I can
say that this measure is surely one of the most
complete pieces of legislation ever presented to
this house.

That, honourable members, is but one
illustration of the many things which have
been done by this honourable house. It is my
opinion that work of that kind cannot be
undertaken unless the Senate is at its full or
approximately full complement. It is not fair
to the various sections of the country that
legislation of this character should be dealt
with unless all sections of the country are
represented. I doubt whether the Government
of the day realizes what great contributions
have been made in the past, and are being
made today, by Senate committees. I know
that little publicity is given by the press to
their work; but any associations, organizations or individuals that appear before these
committees realize that they are dealing with
experienced people who conscientiously try to
solve public problems and produce suitable
legislation.
I think I would be remiss if I did not refer
to one other matter which was dealt with
by this honourable body. I do so humbly,
because I was the author of the resolution
on which it acted, and I mention it on this
occasion because the splendid work carried
out at that time was largely due to the able
chairmanship of that committee by the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler). My reference is to the special committee appointed in 1945 to examine into
the provisions and workings of the Income
War Tax Act. When first it was proposed
to deal with that matter, the then Minister
of Finance was of the opinion that this bouse
should not tackle it. Upon reconsideration
during the following session, when it had
been decided that the resolution should be
introduced in this chamber, the Government
supported our investigation, and the honourable Leader of the Government in the Senate

SENATE
at that time, who now occupies the Speaker's
chair (Hon. Mr. Robertson), stated that the
Government welcomed our action. Honourable members will recall that at that time
there was a great public demand for changes
in the legislation. The Income Tax Act had
grown, as it were, like Topsy, and was practically incapable of interpretation. It provided for many ministerial discretionary
powers, which necessitated taxpayers obtaining rulings before they could interpret the
law. The task of revision, an extremely
important one at that time, because it was
at the period of the commencement of reconstruction following the war, was undertaken
by the special committee named in the resolution; and that was as a result of the independent action of this honourable body and
its members in really insisting that they
should have the authority or the approval
of the Government to go ahead with this
work.
The committee did its task extremely well,
and I am sure that honourable senators who
were members of this chamber at that time
were gratified at the complimentary references on behalf of the Government to the
committee in respect of the duties they had
undertaken. The procedure followed was that
a report was made, and annexed to it was
a draft of a new income tax law, and this
was adopted in almost its entirety-with a
few amendments and refinements made by
the other house upon the recommendation
of the Minister of Finance and the Minister
of National Revenue.
I mention these things merely to indicate
what in my opinion is the proper function to
be performed by this honourable house. The
includes people of
Senate membership
experience, of independence, of good judgment. Tasks of this kind could be readily
undertaken from time to time; and I submit
that occasionally, when the Government is
asked to consider the appointment of a
Royal Commission to deal with some important matter, it might, by referring the
matter to this house, have the subject as
capably and thoroughly investigated as
could be done by an outside commission, and
relieve the taxpayer of the cost of such a
commission.
I feel I have gone a little astray from the
specific subject-matter of this bill, and I
would now like to add a few remarks-regarding the constitutional question. After
having listened to eminent constitutional
lawyers express their opinions, I must
apologize for attempting to speak on this
subject. I do not hold myself out as a
constitutional authority but I think I am

quite capable of interpreting the statutes. I
must say I have not the slightest doubt that
the Parliament of Canada has power to make
the proposed amendment. To my mind it
would not in any way change the constitution except to provide what you might call an
interpretation of the present act and, I
submit, clarify the intention of the Fathers
of Confederation.
The honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) had some doubts
about the right of Parliament to pass this
bill without the consent of the provinces.
My honourable colleague is known in this
house for his fine speeches and his ability as
a constitutional lawyer, and I was rather
interested to note that he admitted he had
not carefully considered the matter. I am
confident that had he done so he would have
come to the conclusion that there is not the
slightest doubt that an amendment such as
now proposed is within the constitutional
authority of the Parliament of Canada.
In conclusion, may I request that each
honourable senator very seriously consider the
only principle involved in this bill as being
one requiring this chamber to be maintained
at its full complement of members in order
that the work which can best be done by the
Senate and its various committees, may be
carried on with full representation from all
sections of the country and with the greatest
possible efficiency.
May I recommend to the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) that he should draw to the attention of the Government the important work
which has been carried out by this honourable house and its committees over past
years, and that further consideration be
given to assigning more legislation and
studies of important subject-matters to this
body.
I support the principle of the bill on the
grounds which I have indicated. I reserve
my right to consider certain matters as they
may come before the committee to which
the bill may be referred, but propose to vote
in favour of this bill because I am firmly
convinced that its principle is a simple one
which must be seriously faced by every
member of Parliament, by the Government
itself and by the public at large. I am sure
that if the bill goes to committee we can
overcome some of the objections that have
been raised, and it is my hope that before
the bill passes through the committee stage
the matter will be seriously considered by
the Government in the light of the discussions which have taken place during this
debate. I think that the Government slould

reasons for desiring to broaden the scope of
this act. I have always favoured the work
that has been carried on by the Historic
Sites and Monuments Board, because it is
to a large extent related to our efforts in
the province of Nova Scotia to sell-and I
use the word advisedly-and promote tourist
traffie in our province. Nova Scotia, of
course, is somewhat differently placed, with
regard to historic sites, than many other
provinces. Many historic sites, from one end
of the province to the other, greatly attract
tourists. Other provinces also have their
sites of historic importance, especially the
province of Quebec. A notable historic site
in Ontario is Fort Henry, which I understand
attracts large numbers of tourists.
In dealing with the bill itself and, the
proposals to broaden its scope, I cannot help
but disagree with the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) who fears
-to
use his own words-"a flood of
applications". I noted that the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
expressed agreement on that point today.
I do not fear a flood of applications at all. In
my opin'on, the more that are received the
more publicity that will be given to the
value of these historie sites in Canada; and
I have enough confidence in the board, which
has done splendid work down through the
years, to believe that it will meet the requirements and will carry on its functions as
provided by the act. Instead of merely
erecting monuments by the side of the road
for motorists to drive by at 50 or 60 miles an
hour, and scarcely notice them, the board
will in future give recognition and prominence to outstanding buildings.
The history of Nova Scotia goes very far
back, and I feel that the earlier definition
of "historie place" was not sufficient to give
adequate recognition to our historie sites.
I think the ampler definition in the amendment is important and desirable. It adds these
words:
and includes buildings or structures that are of
national interest by reason of age or architectural
design.
Section 2 of the bill provides that the
provinces of Ontario and Quebec shall have

two representatives on the board instead of
one. I am not in accord with that provision.
I do not say so in a narrow sense, but I
think those two provinces will also be
represented to a very large extent by a
representative of the Department of Northern
Affairs and National Resources, under whose
jurisdiction the board operates. I think one
representative for each province, with one
representative from the department, should

be sufficient. That applies equally to Nova
Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward
Island, as well as to British Columbia and
the Western provinces. So many bills which
are introduced seem to centralize Canada
in Ontario and Quebec, and that is why I
hesitate to say that section 2 of the bill
meets with my approval.
I mentioned that we have many interesting historie sites in Nova Scotia. A book
recently published, entitled, "Done at Grand
Pré", by Will R. Bird, tells of the expulsion
of the Acadians in 1755. Honourable senators
will remember, of course, the sad story about
the large number of residents of Grand Pré
who were put on transports and sent to
Boston. We are holding a celebration of that
historie event during the coming summer
months, which will be attended by about
50,000 people from all parts of Canada and
the United States, including approximately
10,000 from Louisiana alone. That celebration is something which comes close to the
scope of this act, and I think the board
should lend its assistance to the Department of Northern Affairs and National Resources to see that publicity is given to
the venture in all parts of Canada, so that
a large number of Canadians will visit Nova
Scotia and become familiar with the part
of the country about which Longfellow wrote
in his poem Evangeline. The well which
served the people in those days is still there,
and is an historie attraction to the visitors at
Grand Pré.
We in Nova Scotia, of course, can look
back to the first social club in America,
which was formed in 1605. The club still
functions, and an invitation is extended to
every visitor to join. This creates goodwill
and brings more tourists to our part of the
country. In 1632 the first Canadian school
was founded in Nova Scotia. For the information of my honourable colleague from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), Chairman of the Divorce Committee, I may say
that the first divorce court in Canada was
held in Nova Scotia in the year 1749. Nova
Scotia has many firsts-

Hon. Mr. Quinn: The first post office.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Yes, and the first printing
press established in 1751. We are the only

province in Canada to have our own flag,
granted to us in 1621 by King James VI of

Scotland, James I of England.
I should like particularly to draw the
attention of the department to the Duke of
Kent's Lodge, located at Princes' Lodge, about
six miles from Halifax, which was occupied
by the Duke from 1794 to 1800. This historie

MAY le, 1955
site is badly in need of restoration and
should, I think, corne within the purview of
the act and be recognized by the board. At
Windsor, the shire town of the Hants Company, can be seen signs of old Fort Edward,
built in 1749. This is another site which
should be recognized by the board.When we visit Quebec City and see there
the Citadel and the Plains of Abrahamn we
are reminded o! the large sums o! money
spent every year to maintain the site in
order to attract visitors to that part of Canada.
May I say that in the city of Halifax we
have an old citadel, erected well over 200
years ago. If I remember correctly, the
Parks Commission reported that last year
something like 84,000 people visited the
citadel at Halifax.
Honourable senators, I have touched only
briefly on the sites which I feel shoul be
recognized by the board. I arn in favour of
the principle o! the bill to expand the

definition of "historie place", but I ar n ot
entirely satisfied that the provinces of
Quebec and Ontario each need an additional
member on the board.

BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACTS
AMENDMENT BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Euler for the second reading of Bill H-10,
an Act to amend the British North America
Acts, 1867 to 1952.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, I propose to support Bill H-10,
mainly on the ground that it is a step-an
incidental step, perhaps, but a very necessary
one-in the direction of improving the usefulness and strengthening the status of the
Senate as an integral part of the Parliament
of Canada.
I am greatly indebted to those senators who
have already spoken in this debate for having
helped me to boil down some of the thoughts
I would like to express today; but even so,
I fear that by the time I have finished I shall
have failed to provide a good model of condensation.
Broadly speaking, there are two outstanding
aspects of this bill: first, that of its constitutional implications; and second, its broad
political and practical applications to the
status and functions of the Senate.
I have been influenced to some extent in
what I have to say today by a desire to follow
a line consistent with the position which I
took in this chamber on a similar occasion
some four years ago. Consistency, of course,
has no great virtue; it is sometimes referred
to as the bugbear of little minds. In any
event, I take this opportunity of repeating
now what I said then, that certain measures
of reform as applied to the Senate are long
overdue, and should be attended to just as
soon as the Government, which is the leader
and custodian of Parliament, finds it convenient to do so. I would repeat a further
statement I made earlier: that the responsibility for Senate reform does not rest here
alone, but involves all branches of Parliament and the provinces as well. In the working out of details to this end we must depend
upon the Government to take the initiative
and lead the way.
Suggestions and even participation in a
co-operative way with any other representative branch of government in dealing with
proposed changes in the Senate, we can give,
and give freely, and we should very properly
have the privilege of contributing in this way
in the event of definite steps to such an end
being taken by the Government at a later
date. My support of this bill is based on the

MAY 19, 1955
hope that it will open the door to an early
consideration of the whole question of Senate
reform.
The bill in its purpose, it seems to me, has
the advantage of focusing attention-not only
our own attention and that of our associates
in other branches of Parliament, but the attention of the whole country upon this subject
in a way that could not be provided by a
resolution.
The honourable senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) yesterday in
his very effective presentation emphasized
this in his reference to the legal implications
applying to the bill. He pointed out the legal
implications with regard to future appointments, and not as applying necessarily to the
filling of the present vacancies.
The importance of keeping the machinery
of our democratic parliaments up to date and
in good repair so as to serve the needs of the
people who support them as efficiently as possible can hardly be overstressed.
This
mechanical side of democracy, if one may so
describe it, expressed in such constitutional
documents as the British North America Act,
is apt to be taken so much for granted that it
is almost overlooked altogether. Democracy,
if it is to be any good at all, it seems to me,
has to function practically through a number
of imperfect human beings brought together
in committees, councils, legislatures and parliaments from time to time. Their functions
in such organizations certainly cannot be
properly carried out unless forms of procedure are devised to enable them to exercise
their power of action on behalf of the people
at the right time and in the right way.
It is no idle platitude to say that the price
of all that is involved in the way of freedom
and liberty in our democratic system-as
was so eloquently expressed by the honourable member from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) in this debate-is eternal vigilance
in seeing that the machinery of that system
is adequately maintained. If I may develop
this thought a little further, I should like to
point out what must be evident to any casual
observer of political conditions in this
country during recent years, namely, the
widening gap between the rank and file of
our people, the Canadian electorate who pay
the taxes and vote, and the State, which is
represented mainly by the Government,
members of Parliament, and civil servants.
That gap has been appearing increasingly as
a sort of no man's land, and it is the business
of us all to narrow down that area in every
possible way by bringing into closer
proximity and contact the machinery of the
State with the men and women who vote. It
has been said, I think with all truth behind
it, that the fuel of that system which we call

democracy, and which imparts power to the
machinery of the State, consists of the
political will and consciousness of ordinary
folk whom we are in the habit so often of
describing as "the common people".
Much of what I have been saying may
seem to be a pretty platitudinous play of
words on a hackneyed theme of democracy,
but I am not apologizing for it, because I am
attempting to justify the submission of any
constructive suggestion or criticism from
this chamber which will reflect a conscious
and sincere effort to modernize and improve
the representative institutions to which we
subscribe our loyalties and beliefs.
I regret that it has been found necessary
to introduce into this debate the personality
of the Prime Minister. To me there is something rather distasteful about a diversion
from the consideration of a meritorious issue
by protestations of loyalty and admiration
to one who neither invites nor requires such
encomiums from anybody. It all savours
too much of protesting the virtues of one's
own family.
My honourable friend from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) semed to have some
misgivings about the possible attitude of
members of the House of Commons toward
this bill. I do not think he need concern
himself about that any more than about any
of the sallies pointed in this direction from
many quarters.
As a matter of fact, as many arrows from
outside are aimed, I think, at the House of
Commons and Parliament as a whole, as are
directed at the Senate. The House of Commons in its laborious attempt this session
to revise its rules of procedure is doing the
best it can to improve its position in this
respect. In this connection, may I divert to
say that I agree very much with something
that was said in England recently by the
Right Honourable Hugh Gaitskell, who was
in the
Chancellor of the Exchequer
Attlee Government. In an address entitled
"In defence of politics" he said that he was
not concerned with the good-natured chaff
illustrated by the bus conductor's call at
Parliament Square, "Anybody here for the
gas bouse?". This kind of attitude toward
legislators, he thought, represented in reality
a form of public respect modified by a characteristic Anglo-Saxon urge to debunk, and
I

think this applies as much to Canada as it
does to England. We might have more reason
for concern if complete silence and indifference prevailed in place of the more active
attention which is paid to us from time to
time.

SENATE
As the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) made so lucidly
clear in his worthy speech of last week, members of this chamber, appointed by the Crown,
are advisers of the Crown through the Prime
Minister and his colleagues in the cabinet. It
is that high position of his that commands our
respect, and it is a fortunate circumstance
that the man who fills it becomes his eminent
nosition with such great distinction. Everything that has been said about him in this
vein here and elsewhere over the last years,
and during this debate, surely provides abundant evidence of an understanding which
will receive gladly, on behalf of himself and
his associates, reasoned and sincere proposals
relating to the welfare of this country.
The word "check" is often applied to the
functions of the Senate in relation to legislation presented here, and use will be made
of that word later in the course of my remarks. I think here it should be emphasized
that that word should not be interpreted as
meaning obstruction or interference but
rather as advice offered to the Governmentto the executive branch of Parliament-not
to the House of Commons. The constitutional status of senators, as pointed out by
the honourable gentleman from TorontoTrinity-that of being appointees of the
Crown-gives to the word "check" a different
meaning and significance from its ordinary
application. The federal system of government in the United States is often referred
to as a series of "checks" and "balances".
There is a rigidity in the use of that term in
the United States which does not apply here
at all. The difference essentially between
these neighbouring countries in the use of
this word "check" reflects the constitutional
difference between a "limited monarchial
form of government" and a republic.
That is why Sir John A. Macdonald, in the
pre-Confederation discussions at Quebec in
1865, defined Canada's prospective system as
one indicating "constitutional liberty as opposed to democracy". It is only fair to say
now, ninety years after those words were
spoken, and in the face of profound world
changes, that those two phrases applying to
our respective systems of government on this
continent have become interchangeable. Each
stands today for the freedom and dignity of
the individual citizen as opposed to the totalitarian conceptions of some other lands.
Discussion on the subject of Senate reform
bas been heard before in this chamber. Only
some four years ago an interesting debate
took place here on the subject of improving
the status of the Senate. It was ably introduced by the Leader of the Senate, who now

occupies the Speaker's Chair (Hon. Mr. Robertson); and he made it quite clear that he
had been encouraged to do so by the previous
Prime Minister, Mr. Mackenzie King; and
he also intimated that he had been given
a free hand by the present Prime Minister
to proceed independently with the subject.
So I say, we have good precedent for dealing again with suggestions which have in
mind the betterment of conditions in this
chamber.
In all of the discussion that bas been
devoted to the Senate throughout the years,
both inside and outside of Parliament, no
serious or substantial claim has been made to
dispute the important place of a second
chamber in our federal system of government. To my mind that is the real question
raised by this bill. It is also a question to
which the people of this country and the
members of their government and Parliament
should address themselves in any consideration of the Senate. I should like to make
further references to this point in certain
citations before I conclude.
I should like now to refer to the speech
made by my very good friend the honourable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) last Thursday. There was so much
of it with which I agreed and admired that
I am rather reluctant to suggest that upon
reading it more closely in Hansard I found
that I was a bit mystified by his uncertainty
of mind regarding the constitutional aspect of
this bill. He commended the purpose of the
legislation wholeheartedly, but seemed to
have some doubts about the constitutional
means or procedure by which the bill might
be given effect. This is what he said-I am
quoting from page 465 of Hansard, dated
May 12:
I have some comments to make on the form in
which the issue before us is raised. It purports
to amend the British North America Act-a proceeding which until the method was changed a
few years ago, was confined exclusively to the
Parliament of the United Kingdom. A part of that
power, but only a part, bas been delegated to the
Canadian Parliament.
Whether amendments of
this kind are to be made by the British Parliament or the Canadian Parliament, they are not to
be lightly undertaken. With all deference to the
honourable senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr.
Euler), a constitutional question is a little different
from an amendment of the House of Commons Act.
Truc, it may relate to the same subject-matter:
but the Fathers of Confederation, who inspired
the provisions of the British North America Act,
saw fit to make a distinction between the constitution of the House of Commons and changes
therein, and the constitution of the Senate, which
is incorporated in the British North America Act
itself.

Then further, on page 466, he said:
The honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
pointed out that under the constitution the Senate
was created as a body to be representative of the
different parts of Canada, the representation being

designated by provinces.
circumstances I ask this question: can we say that
in ail its aspects the matter of Senate appointments is so divorced from provincial consideration
that it comes entirely within federal jurisdiction,
and that therefore the dominion has full power to
deal with it?

As I say, I was a bit mystified by these
reservations on the part of my honourable
friend as I read them in Hansard, because in
February 1951, during the debate to which
reference has already been made, he expressed
a much more definite and certain opinion
regarding the power of Parliament to amend
the constitution as it applied to the Senate
than he did last week.
Let me quote frorn the report of that
debate as shown on page 124 of Hansard of
February 19, 1951. I had asked my honourable friend about the obligation of consulting the provinces in connection with any
amendment of the British North America Act
relating to the Senate. He said this in reply:
As I understand the situation, at the last session
we amended our constitution on the theory that
the Senate was part of the Government of Canada,
and that we did not require to have the consent
of the provinces when we asked the Imperial
Parliament to make the amendments. Now then, if
we, as a part of the Government of Canada, decide
to amend the constitution, we have the complete
constitutional power and right to do so, and if
any one province were to say: "We refuse to
appoint the senators for our province"-if my
honourable friend really thinks there would be
any danger of that-I would suggest that in amending the constitution we should provide that if any
province did not make its appointments within,
say, six months, the Dominion Government would
be authorized to make them.

A little

Hansard reads as

Hon. Mr. Farris: I said that Parliament had the
fullest power to do so; but what it would do I
do not know.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Has it the fullest power?

authority, when at the last session an act was
passed on the basis that we had full power to
amend our constitution in regard to the Senate.
There is no question about that. The Parliament of
Canada has that power.

Hon. Mr. Farris: Which opinion do you
think is the better?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I am aware that my
honourable friend may fairly say to me now
that I am quite welcome to his discarded or
revised opinions.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: He bas given us his
"sober second thought."
Hon. Mr. Lambert: But when I was reading
in Hansard what he said last Thursday I
could not help feeling that the positiveness
of his declaration on the same constitutional
point some four years ago would have made
a much more fitting conclusion to his speech
last week than the rather cloudy and uncer-

tain view which he did express and which,
I felt, did not carry the weight of a very
firm conviction. As a matter of fact, honourable senators, as I read over that part of his
speech I could not help thinking of the old
scriptural injunction:
For if the trumpet have an uncertain
who shall prepare himself to the battle.

sound,

I think that at this point I should quote
what the Prime Minister said on this matter,
as reported at page 7 of the Proceedings of
the Constitutional Conference of the Federal
and Provincial Governments on January 10,
1950. Before I read it, however, may I say
that one does not need to be a lawyer to
see that the subject-matter of this bill does
not come under any of the specified exceptions
which are cited here. This is what the Prime
Minister said at that time:
You are, of course, aware that the federal Government submitted to Parliament at its last session
an address requesting an amendment to the
British North America Act to vest in the Parliament of Canada authority to amend the constitution of Canada in its purely federal aspects.
That amendment, known as the British North
America (No. 2) Act, 1949, has now been enacted
by the United Kingdom Parliament, and has become
a part of the constitution of Canada.
Under that statute, jurisdiction is transferred
to the Parliament of Canada to amend the constitution of Canada with the following five important exceptions:
(1) matters coming within the classes of subjects
assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the
provinces by the British North America Act of
1867;

So far as the exception in No. (1) is concerned, the subject-matter of this bill certainly
does not apply there.
(2) rights or privileges granted or secured to
the legislature or the government of a province
by any constitutional act;

This bill certainly does not come under the
purview of that exception.
(3) rights or privileges granted or secured by
the constitution to any class of persons with respect
to schools;

This bill has no reference whatever to that
subject, and therefore does not come under
that exception.
(4) constitutional provisions regarding
of the English or the French language;

the use

And I am sure the bill does not come under
that exception.
(5) the constitutional requirement that a session
of Parliament must be held once a year and that
a general election must take place at least every
five years, with a proviso for possible postponement of an election in cases of real or apprehended war.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask if the Prime
Minister is not quoting the act almost word
for word, when he makes that statement?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Those classes were contained in the text of the British North America (No. 2) Act, 1949, which amended the

SENATE
constitution at that time. I simply quote those
passages for the purpose of trying to give a
layman's understanding of what actually
takes place when powers of this kind are
given to the Government to deal with such
matters as are represented in the bill
before us.
I will now deal with the practical aspect of
this bill, which has for its objective the early
appointment of new senators to fill the vacant
seats in this chamber. The truth is that with
more than one-fifth of its membership lacking,
the work that should be done here in standing
committees and in possible committees of
special inquiry, cannot be done properly, for
there are not enough members to go around.
Reference was made by the Prime Minister
in the other house last week to the inability
of that house to set up a special committee of
inquiry, as had been indicated in the Speech
from the Throne, because too many members
are now engaged in attending various other
committees. If such is the situation in the
House of Commons with its fairly full complement of members, it is many times worse in
this chamber with its deficiency in membership. I do not intend to cite examples of this
shortcoming that could be mentioned; but I
would refer particularly to the Standing Committee on Divorce, upon which the most constant and heavy demands are being made. The
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) referred to the needs of
that committee in the course of his contribution to this debate last week. The character
of the work in that committee is not only
exacting in volume, but it requires as much
experienced legal knowledge as it is possible
to have in its membership; and that fact in
no way casts any invidious reflection on
members of that committee who are not
lawyers and who have contributed so effectively to the decisions that have been brought
to this chamber for approval. The work of
the Divorce Committee is being endangered
by empty seats in the Senate. And I think it
might be fairly said further that no branch of
our parliamentary activities is doing more to
preserve national unity in Canada than this
same committee.
The honourable senator from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Campbell) yesterday took occasion
to mention particularly the work of the
special committee appointed in 1945 to inquire into the operations of the Income Tax
Act. One should not fail to mention the
work of one or two of the standing committees of this house. I think we too easily
forget such a contribution as was made to
the interests of the country by the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce with
respect to foreign exchange control legislation. As a result of representations heard,

evidence taken and reports later submitted,
legislation which had been directed to the
establishment of a Foreign Exchange Control
Board in Canada for all time was limited to
a period of two years, and after the end of
that period it was completely removed from
the financial machinery of Canada. Time has
shown clearly that that action was for the
benefit of the country as a whole.
There comes also to my mind the tremendous amount of work done by the Banking
and Commerce Committee in connection with
the Bankruptcy Act. That work was continued over a long period of time and required
the skilful application of the best legal brains
in this chamber.
I am reminded also of the work done by
the Senate in the revision of the Criminal
Code. True, a joint committee of both houses
dealt with the subject, but great tribute must
be paid to the special subcommittee of the
Senate's Banking and Commerce Committee
for its very valuable contribution toward
amending our criminal law.
I should like to emphasize that a great
deal of the possible service of Senate committees to the present and future welfare of
Canada is being sacrificed because of the
vacancies in this chamber.
In one of the most effective references in
his speech the honourable senator from Vancouver South ventured the opinion that the
problem confronting the Prime Minister and
his colleagues in connection with the Senate
was not its constitutional implications so
much as its broad political difficulties. I agree
with him that the broad political aspect of
this question is far reaching and very difficult
to meet. But I think also that never was
there a more opportune time than now to
reconcile some of the realities of our fast
changing political scene in this country with
the practical workings of government and
parliament. The transitional features of political professions and affiliations have not
developed all at once out of the recent war
years or its immediate aftermath of reconstruction. In so far as the identity of old
traditional two-party affiliations is concerned,
the process of change in federal as well as
provincial fields was noticeable toward the
end and after the conclusion of the First
Great War. The fact is that a new era for
Canada was eloquently envisaged by outstanding leaders of thought and action in
this country many years before the Second
World War. But the realities have finally
caught up with the operation of our political
institutions, which must be adapted to them
if democratic forms of government and
administration are to meet public needs and
public demands.

to grow at the expense of the House of Commons.
In Canada the Senate is not so much a check on
the House of Commons as it is upon the cabinet,
and there can be no doubt that its influence in
this respect is salutary.
In twenty years at
Ottawa, I have never known a case in which a
Government was anxious to take the verdict of
the people on a bill rejected by the Senate.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Then further on he said
this:

For the five sessions I was Leader of the
Senate, and for three later sessions Leader of one
section of that house-the section favourable in a
general way to Mr. Bennett's party. Throughout
that entire period, and it was a long one, the
Leader of the Conservative Party recognized, without limitation, the distinct and independent status
of that branch of Parliament. The Senate, during
his term of Premiership, altered Government

should take another course. He had a right understanding of how the constitution of Canada should
work.

It is worth observing that the Right Honourable Arthur Meighen, while he was Leader
of this house and a Minister without portfolio
in the cabinet of Mr. Bennett, did not ordinarily sit in the cabinet but devoted himself

SENATE
almost exclusively to the interests and
purposes of the Senate. I think it is only
fair to sound this non-partisan note in dealing with this bill.
And finally, I would refer to the view
expressed by the late Sir Allen Aylesworth
when he spoke in this chamber in 1932 on the
subject of the Senate's past accomplishments
and its future outlook. He stated that he
would gladly support legislation if it were
presented in this chamber, to disfranchise
members of the Senate and thus prevent
them from participating or voting in general
elections, so that their independent and judicial status might be duly recognized. He
believed that the Upper Chamber of Parliament should fill the role of a political and
legislative court of appeal and review.
I believe, honourable senators, that Sir
Allen Aylesworth's fine definition of what
the Senate should be, comes more nearly
than any words I know to describing the
kind of institution that was conceived by our
founding fathers when Confederation was
accomplished.
I simply submit these expressions of opinion from the well-qualified minds of our
great men of the past as constructive suggestions to anyone who cares to consider them.
I am fully aware that they invite further
comment and analysis, but I do not propose
to do more now than place these offerings
on the record.
One more word needs to be said. Whatever
may be the fate of this bill, whatever action
may be taken by the Government in consequence of it, the responsibility for the
future work and activity of the Senate rests
right here amongst its members. Even the
present British North America Act provides
this body with enough power and authority
to exert a profound influence on this country, if it only possesses the will and the
energy to apply it. In the review of legislation which comes here; in the discriminatory
examination of proposed public expenditures
presented here for approval; and in special
inquiry into matters which call for attention
and enlightenment, much remains to be done.
It is truc that additional members are required to do the job properly. Possibly, however, a fair question, which every member
of this chamber might think about, in relation to the work done here is this: Is it the
constitutional provisions behind the Senate
that need reform, or is it the senators
themselves?
Hon. W. H. Golding: Honourable senators,
in listening to the honourable senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) I gathered that
he is under the impression that the Divorce
Committee has not been able to handle all

the cases that come before it. I think I
am in order in saying that so far this session
there is no case which has been ready to
be heard before that committee which has
not been heard. And I might add that on
many occasions, when as many as four subcommittees were ready and available to carry
on, there was not enough work for them
to do.
The honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has mentioned
that the committee could do with some more
lawyers, but I would like the house to know
that the present membership of the committee includes a number of lawyers who do
not attend at all. My main purpose in rising,
however, was to impress on the house that
every case which has been ready for hearing
by the committee has been heard.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I rise on a point
of privilege, to assure the honourable senator
from Huron-Perth (Hon. Mr. Golding) that,
as far as I can recall, no word of mine was
spoken in disparagement of the present
Divorce Committe and the work it is performing. What I intended to convey was that
the exacting demands on the committee and
the pressure of its work require that, in this
relation, stock should be taken of the future
as well as the present. While it would be
advisable to have in reserve a greater complement of legal talent, of legally trained
minds, that in no way reflects invidiously
upon the lay members who, as I said, have
contributed in a very valuable way to the
decisions which have been presented to this
chamber. We must remember that we are
not immortal, and that the future strength
of our committees depends almost as much
upon a reserve supply of candidates as it does
on those who are performing the functions
now.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald, the
debate was adjourned.
HISTORIC SITES AND MONUMENTS BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Hawkins for the second reading of Bill 182,
an Act to amend the Historic Sites and Monuments Act.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
the sponsor of this bill very clearly explained its terms, and I have only a few
brief observations to make, and some requests
which, I hope, will reach the ears of those
who are to be on the commission.
About the time of Confederation very little
was known by the people of Canada of that
great prairie region which extends from

MAY 19, 1955
Lake Superior to the foothills of the Rocky
Mountains. It is true that explorers had
penetrated that area: there were trading
posts in different places; there were some
settlers around the trading posts, and there
were quite a number of lawless men who had
core in from other countries and were
robbing and debauching the roving tribes of
Indians who lived in that area. There was
tribal warfare; there were very cruel practices: old, decrepit people were left on the
trails to their terrible fate-starvation, or
death from the elements. The cruel sun
dance was indulged in; and there were murders, but the perpetrators were not punished
because there was no law enforcement at
that time.
Then, one night in the year 1873, a group
of Indians and their wives and families were
encamped by a little stream in the Cypress
hills when a number of whisky smugglers,
with some evil purpose, crept up the ravine
and from the cutbank shot about thirty of
these helpless people. The few who escaped
did so by fieeing up into the wooded hills.
When this gruesome story reached Eastern
Canada recruiting started at once for the
Northwest Police Force, and about three
hundred young men volunteered to embark on
the dangerous enterprise for which they were
engaged. These men in scarlet and gold
assembled at Fort Dufferin, in southern Manitoba, made an amazing march-some two
thousand miles-to reach the scene of their
activities, and there performed a great work.
They quickly stamped out the whisky smuggling; they established law and order in that
country so that the lives and property of the
settlers were more secure; and more than all,
they gained the confidence, the trust and the
respect of those Indian bands. What they
accomplished makes bright pages in the history of the West; and my plea is that the
record of their achievements shall not be
allowed to go into the limbo of forgotten
things, but that it shall be preserved as an
inspiration to those who come after. Because
those young men never again returned to
their homes; they never again saw the scenes
of their childhood. They lie in unmarked
graves under the sod, and it is said that,
especially at this time of year "The prairie
flower blows softly and the scented rosebud
trains its wealth of summer beauty o'er the
Riders of the Plains".
Captain Clark, who was a nephew of Sir
John A. and Lady Macdonald, died in the
first bloom of young manhood and is buried
near historic Fort Walsh.
Constable Grayburn was the very first
mounted policeman to die by gunshot at the

hands of a treacherous Indian. For a time
his grave was marked by a little fence and
cross; but, as years went by, cattle moving
about in that ranch land began rubbing
against the fence until it was completely
ruined and practically everything was destroyed. Those are graves which should be
marked.
Then there was another outstanding figure,
Jerry Potts. He joined the Mounted Police
in 1874, and for 22 years he served the force
well and faithfully. He had an uncanny
sense of direction and guided his fellow
policemen in their work in times of darkness
and storm. He was a matchless diplomat and
could speak six or seven Indian languages.
He directed the police on many expeditions
against lawless groups, and he often provided their food by his skill with the rifle.
There were plenty of buffalo in those days,
and on many occasions he saved his comrades from being overrun by stampeding the
herds. He was a tower of strength to the
force. Today his remains lie in a small
cemetery at Fort McLeod, and the single
slab above his grave is marked with the one
word "Interpreter".
I think the Historic Sites and Monuments
Board would perform a splendid service if
it took such cases as these under review and
established suitable memorials for those
early heroes of the Mounted Police, and
others, who accomplished so much to save
Canada's white people from the bloodshed,
misery and destruction which the white
people in the northern states suffered at the
hands of Indians. It would not be an expensive undertaking, for in almost every
town, village and city historical societies
are anxious to do something of this kind
before the opportunity passes away.
A broad, hard-surfaced highway is being
built through this western country which
was once the home of roving Indian bands.
Along that highway today many highpowered motor cars travel at great speeds
and it seems to me we might slow these
cars up a little if here and there we were
to erect monuments which depict the striking
events of local history. If this were done I
believe the tourists who travel along our
highways in Cadillacs would get a better
picture of the way of life of our pioneers
whose only mode of transportation was
paddle boat, ox cart or covered wagon.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
it is not my intention to delay passage of
this bill, but in view of an event which
happened not so long ago I have one suggestion to make.
First of all may I compliment the sponsor

ALBERTA-BRITISH COLUMBIA
BOUNDARY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. George H. Ross moved the second
reading of Bill C-13, an Act respecting the
boundary between the provinces of Alberta
and British Columbia.
He said: Honourable senators, the sole
object of this bill is to confirm a survey made
by the Interprovincial Boundary Commission,
appointed in 1949 to delimit the boundary
between Alberta and British Columbia.
An Imperial act, 29 and 30 Victoria, chapter 67, sections 7 and 8, established a natural
topographical boundary line along the crest
of the Rocky Mountains from the international
boundary as far north as the most northerly
crossing of the 120th meridian of west longitude, thence following the said meridian
northerly to its intersection within the 60th
parallel of north latitude, which is the northern boundary of Alberta and British
Columbia.
In April 1913 a survey was commenced and
was carried on from the international boundary for a distance of 522 miles. This survey
was approved by both the provinces of Alberta
and British Columbia in 1931, and confirmed
by Parliament by the Alberta-British Columbia Boundary Act, 1932.
In 1949 Alberta and British Columbia asked
the Surveyor General of Canada to participate
in a survey of the rest of the boundary, a
distance of 176.9 miles. A commission was
appointed to have the survey made. The
survey has been completed, and it has been
approved by both provincial Governments.
We now seek the approval of Parliament, pursuant to the provisions of the British North
America Act, 1871, section 3. This is the
sole object of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
senator what is meant by delimiting the boundary? Section 2 of the bill says that the
boundary line was surveyed in 1950, 1952
and 1953 to delimit the boundary between the
provinces.
Hon. Mr. Ross: Monuments are erected on
the ground on an average of 1-1 mile apart,

fixing the boundary between the two provinces. The Imperial act simply said that the
boundary should follow the mountains for
a certain distance and then go north, but
this provision would fix, or delimit, the
boundary on the ground itself.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this blil be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Ross: With leave of the Senate,
next sitting.
PRIVATE BILLS
WESTCOAST TRANSMISSION COMPANY
LIMITED-SECOND READING

Hon. J. W. de B. Farris moved the second
reading of Bill B-14, an Act respecting Westcoast Transmission Company Limited.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
brief and simple bill. It seeks an amendment
to increase the capital stock from 5 million
shares without nominal or par value to 25
million shares without nominal or par value.
It is not proposed at the present time to
increase the capital of the company, although
if occasion for it arises it could be done under
the present bill. The proposed change in
the authorized capital is to facilitate financing
by making more shares available when
required.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my friend a
question? Before that is done, is it necessary
to have the consent of the Board of Transport
Commissioners?
Hon. Mr. Farris: The Board of Transport
Commissioners has practical control. While
the Pipe Lines Act contains no express provision of that nature, it is my opinion that
the whole supervision and control of the pipe
line is within the board.
I understand from the Clerk that the practice is to refer all bills such as this to a
committee. I would suggest that it may not
be necessary to refer this limited amendment.
I may say that the only persons who could
give the committee any information on it
would be an officer of the company from
Calgary, or Mr. Frank McMahon, head of the
company, who is at present in Washington in
connection with the company's application for
the right to dispose of gas in the United
States. He will have to come to Ottawa again
when this measure is considered in the House
of Commons. Honourable senators who
attended the meeting of our Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce on May 11
last will recall that a correlated bill to incorporate Petroleum Transmission Company was

SENATE
considered. Mr. McMahon was present at that
time, and because of the close relationship
between that company and this company he
was asked about the overall picture. The
senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
in particular asked him about the Westcoast
Transmission Company and its prospects. I
now propose to give honourable senators what
information I have as to the present bill
which, I may say, is more than was requested
when the Petroleum Transmission Company
bill was before the committee.
This company was incorporated by the
McMahon group by a bill passed here in
1949 and in February, 1952, after almost three
years of hearings in Alberta, the provincial
Government granted it the right to export
northern Alberta gas. The matter then came
before the Board of Transport Commissioners, which has control over such matters of
an interprovincial nature, and after full hearings granted leave to carry the gas across the
border in an interprovincial pipe line. In
addition, Mr. Howe's act, which honourable
senators will recall, comes into play, and permission was asked for and given under that
statute.
One hitch developed. In June 1952 hearings
commenced before the Federal Power Commission in Washington for the right to move
gas into the United States. Honourable senators will recall that the application was
opposed. In June 1954 the Federal Power
Commission turned down the application by
Westcoast Transmission Company, which
meant either that the company had to throw
up its hands and that no gas would be carried to the Pacific coast under the then
proposals, or that some new arrangement
would have to he made. A new arrangement
was made when Westcoast Transmission
Company in December last signed an agreement with the Pacific Northwest Pipeline
Corporation, the firm that won Federal Power
Commission approval on June 18, 1954, to
supply Washington and Oregon with gas. This
firm, in turn, signed with the El Paso Natural
Gas Company, one of the largest gas pipe line
firms in the United States, whereby El Paso
will purchase gas from Pacific Northwest. The
agreements call for the firm purchase of
natural gas from Westcoast at the British
Columbia-Washington border near Sumas.
01 and Gas Journal, the most conservative
and highly respected publication in the
petroleum industry, in its December 20th
issue, named the agreement the "biggest deal
in gas history' and one that is extremely
beneficial to all areas and all parties concerned.

As I have said, honourable senators, Mr.
McMahon was before our Banking and Commerce Committee about a week ago and was

asked expressly about this company and its
prospects. When speaking before the house
on the motion for second reading of the first
bill I gave complete figures as to the extensive
exploration work that has gone on in the
northern parts of Alberta and British Columbia primarily through the activities of this
company and its associates, where it has
spent some $30 million.
Honourable senators, this company has the
blessing of the Alberta and British Columbia
Governments, the Transport Board and Mr.
Howe's department, for the handling of gas
from the Peace River area and British Columbia, and transmission of it to Vancouver and
thence to Sumas, a few miles away, for
delivery to the company that now has the
franchise on the American side. At our
Banking and Commerce Committe meeting
Mr. McMahon was asked when he expected
to get the United States permit to do that.
He stated at that time that the application
pending before the Federal Power Commission in Washington would come up within
the next two or three weeks andi he expected
that some time early this summer approval
would be granted; that there is no reason in
the world why it should not be granted
because the only interest opposing his application has received a permit and now is
working hand in hand with this company to
handle it in the way I have indicated.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is that the Pacifie Northvest Pipeline Corporation?
Hon. Mr. Farris: That is right.
All that is being asked for in this bill
is authority to increase the number of shares
comprising the capital stock.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Have they put any value
on those shares yet?
Hon. Mr. Farris: The first draft of the data
sent to me stated that they were considering
$2 a share, but they have abandoned that,
and the shares will be, as before, of no par
value. It is also stated that there is no present
intention to increase the capitalization but
only to facilitate financing by making more
shares available.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Do they not have to
put a value on the shares when incorporation
is given in this way, in order to calculate the
fees, for instance?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I can tell my honourable
friend about that. The fee paid on the incorporation of the company in 1949 was based
on 5 million shares at a maximum value of
$10 per share, having a total valuation of
$50 million. By establishing 25 million shares
at a value of $2 a share the total approximate
capitalization of the company, on which a fee

MAY 19, 1955
bas been paid, remains at $50 million. It is
not intended at the moment to insert that
figure of $2 in the bill, nor to change the
aggregate capitalization. Does that answer
your question?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, but I suppose the
company is bound in some way. Is there an
undertaking given to the department as to
what value is to be placed upon each share?
Hon. Mr. Farris: No, no value bas been set.
I arn now authorized to state that it is not
the present intention of the company to increase the total capitalization.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I arn just wondering if
that is satisfactory, because by this bill you
are actually creating five times the original
number of shares, and thereby you are really
getting a larger incorporation, unless there
is a distinct and recorded understanding that
the share value is to be reduced proportionately. If there is just something said
as to an intention which may or may not be
carried out, then there is no certainty in the
matter.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I would remind My honourable friend that the Board of Transport
Commissioners has control. over these matters;
that body bas the general supervision of al
activities of these pipe line companies and
I do not think that a step could be taken by
any of them without its approval. However,
if there is any doubt about that, additional
information can be secured. I thought it
might be a simple matter to pass the bill
without having to refer it to committee, but
if my honourable friend feels that it should
go to committee I will so move.
The Hon. the Speaker: May I remind the
bonourable senator that there is no option
in the case of a private bill: it must go to
committee.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Unless there is unanimous
consent for omitting that stage.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I tbink the bill ought to
go to committee.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I arn
glad that this bill is going to committee.
As perhaps the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris), already
knows, this company bas provoked a serious
dispute in my home province, British Columbia. I arn a littie perturbed, because tbe
information I got wben the Westcoast Transmission Company bill first came before the
Senate was that they were to lay their pipe
Uine rîgbt tbrough to Vancouver, Burnaby and
New Westminster; wbereas now the information is that they are not doîng that, and as a
resuit a controversy is raging over the dlaim
50437-33

of the British Columbia Electric Company
that they have the right to buy the gas from
Westcoast Transmission Company at Huntingdon. We contend that Westcoast Transmission Company got the rigbt to take their
pipe Uine into Vancouver and New Westminster, where the great market is. Wben the
bill to incorporate this company was before
tbe committee it was stated tbat they were
going to build the pipe Uine themselves; but
now we are told they are stopping at the
boundary and that another company is taking
it over in their place.
Now, honourable senators, that is something I would like to have explained. It is a
bot question witb our people in tbe Fraser
Valley and calls for some explanation. I
want to find out wby we were apparently
wrongly informed wben the matter was before
the committee in the first instance. I arn
keenly interested, because this pipe line will
be laid tbrough tbe district I live in and
represent. 1 might say that at present two
officials are in Ottawa at the moment to
protest this.
I know that the Board of Transport Commissioners has control over individual pipe
lines, but 1 arn particularly interested in the
statements that were made when the franchise
was given to this cornpany, the terms of wbich.
I dlaim are not being carried out.
Hon. Mr. Farris: But that has nothing to
do with the present amendment.
Hon. Mr. Reid: No, but we can get the
information when it is before the committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACTS
AMENDMENT BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, May
19, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Euler for the second reading of
Bill H-10, an Act to amend the British North
America Acts, 1867 to 1952.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, in rising to take part in this debatt
may I at the outset compliment all who have
spoken, on the high level at which the discussion bas been kept. The debate has been most
interesting and, I feel, most profitable. There
is no doubt that the introduction of this bill
has served a very good purpose. We have
had the opportunity of hearing the views and
getting the opinions of outstanding constitutional lawyers on the constitutional aspects
of the bill. I think we are very fortunate i%
having in this assembly men who are recognized by the Bar as eminent in this branch
of their profession. Of course, their views
have not invariably coincided. It has been
said that lawyers never agree entirely with
one another: I might add that lawyers never
disagree entirely either. In some respects,
however, our constitutional experts are in
complete accord. They all agree, I believe,
that if this bill were to pass, and the constitution were amended, constitutional procedure with respect to the filling of vacancies
in this chamber would be no more effective
than it is at the present time. There has
been some disagreement on the question of
whether Parliament is competent to pass this
legislation without consultation with the
provinces. But there is one respect in which,
whether we are lawyers or laymen, we are
agreed, and that is that we should like to
see some, at least, of these vacancies filled.
When appointments will be made I know
no more than you do, but I am sure that we
would receive wholeheartedly any new
appointees to this chamber.
But while the newcomers would be weIcome, I personally do not believe that the
fact that vacancies have not been filled is
attended with the dire consequences which
some of my colleagues suppose. It bas been

his duties and issue a writ, then, under the
amendment, a writ of mandamus could be
issued against him and he could be forced
to do so. The honourable senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) in what I
regarded as an outstanding speech before this
house, pointed out that the words in the bill
before us were probably only directory. I
do not know whether he would place the
same interpretation on the language of the
House of Commons Act, but I do feel that
when the House of Commons Act was passed
the members of that house thought they were
placing on the statute book an effective piece
of legislation.
Every constitutional lawyer in this house
who has participated in the debate thus far
has told us that if we amend the constitution
as proposed in the bill it will be no more
effective when we are through than it is now;
that all we will have done is some pinpointing. Is there any member of this house who
would want to amend the British North
America Act merely by pinpointing? As I
say, we are told that the bill, if passed, will
be ineffective, and that nothing more could
then be done under the act than can be done
under it now. That is probably what the
senators from Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr.
Kinley) and New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) had in mind when they asked, "What
will the members of the House of Commons
think of this bill"? Some honourable senators
replied, "What do we care what they think
about it"? Certainly we care what they think
about it. Have we no dignity? Does any
honourable senator want a bill to go to the
House of Commons and have the members of
that house laugh at it, at our expense-and, I
think in this case, rightly so? They would
point to this measure and say "Look at what
the senators have done: They have passed
an ineffective bill and they ask us to confirm
it". If that happens our dignity would not
only b" impugned, but it would be completely
shattered indeed, it would be impugned and
shattered not only in the House of Commons
but in the minds of the Canadian people.
Honourable senators, the reasons which I
have expressed, without further discussion,
I think are sufficient to cause us to vote
against this bill. But there are some practical
objections to it too. Before I come to that
branch of my argument, let me deal with the
constitutional question.
The honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) said he was not
sure that we have the right to amend our
constitution as this bill seeks to do it. The
honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) pointed out that he had given a
different opiniDn a few years previously, and

the honourable senator from Vancouver South
asked, "Which opinion do you think is
better"?
He is in effect saying, I have thought about
this matter for two or three years and I
now come to the conclusion that I was
wrong previously. Honourable senators, I
do not set myself up as a constitutional
lawyer, and am not expressing an opinion one
way or another. When constitutional lawyers
disagree with one another, I think we should
be most careful before making any change
in our constitution.
One interesting point which I expected one
of our constitutional experts might raise was
as to whether the bill seeks to amend the
right section of the constitution. I am sure
none of us would want to ask the House of
Commons to concur in a piece of legislation
that amended the wrong section of the act.
The bill proposes to amend section 24, which
reads as follows:
The Governor General shall from Time to Time,
in the Queen's Nane, by Instrument under the
Great Seal of Canada, summon qualified Persons
to the Senate; and, subject to the Provisions of
this Act, every Person so summoned shall become
and be a Member of the Senate and a Senator.

The bill would delete that section which
provides for the summons, the instrument to
be used and the consequences of the summons.
The bill would substitute for the present
section 24 a new section which deals with
a vacancy. Now, as I read the act, the section
having to do with vacancies is section 32,
and although I am not a constitutional lawyer
I think that would be the section which the
bill should perhaps seek to amend. That
section says:
When a Vacancy happens in the Senate, by
Resignation, Death, or otherwise, the Governor
General shall by Summons to a fit and qualified
Person fill the Vacancy.

Honourable senators who like myself are
not constitutional lawyersHon. Mr. Reid: Don't apologize.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: -would think that
section 32 is the one that should perhaps be
amended.
Hon. Mr. Euler: If my friend would like
to make a motion to amend the bill to deal
with section 32 in that way, I would be quite
willing.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I would merely suggest to my honourable friend from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) that he consult his constitutional experts, and if they agree he might
choose to amend his bill in that respect. I
am raising this point only to indicate that

MAY 24, 1955
this bill has not received the mature consideration it should have received before being introduced in this house. We all agree
it is an ineffective measure,Hon. Mr. Euler: No, we don't.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: -and that there is
a difference of opinion as to whether we have
the right to amend our constitution; and
now I raise the question as to whether the
bill proposes to amend the proper section.
For the reasons I have given, honourable
senators, I do not think the bill should be
passed by this house. But there are still
further practical reasons, as distinct from
the legal considerations.
Before I cite a few of these practical considerations let me say frankly that I do not
think that men or women who have previously sat in the House of Commons or in a
provincial legislature make necessarily any
better senators than those who come to us
directly from the outside. I could point to
a number of outstanding members of this
house who have had neither parliamentary
nor legislative experience. In my opinion,
we need some members from the House of
Commons in this house, for they can contribute greatly from their wide and practical
experience. But if this bill were to pass,
fixing a limit of six months within which
vacancies must be filled, what might happen?
Within a year after a new parliament meets
a vacancy might occur in the Senate. There
might be in the House of Commons a member
who would make an excellent senator; he
has served his country well; he has been in
that house for many years, and in the Senate
he could continue to contribute greatly to our
country. If this bill passes, and if the Prime
Minister wanted to appoint that member of
the Commons to the Senate he would have
to call a by-election right away.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Would that be terrible?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not say it would
be terrible, but I say it might be an unnecessary expense and cause unnecessary trouble
throughout the country. I am sure you all
agree that we do not want by-elections unless
they are necessary. Unfortunately, when
there are deaths among members there have
to be by-elections, but as a rule by-elections
are not wanted. Would it not be far better
to leave the Senate vacancy until the end of
the Parliament, when the member could be
appointed here? That is merely one of the
practical considerations which I have to
mention.
Earlier in my remarks I stated that I
would return to the question of whether the
non-filling of these vacancies has lowered the

respect of the public for the Senate, and I
said then I wondered if that were so. I
wonder if in 1935 for instance, public confidence in the Senate was increased when it
was brought up to full strength by the
appointment of 19 senators on the eve of the
election of that year.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Do not criticize us too
much, for I am one of them.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Well I am sure the
respect of the public for the Senate was
increased when my honourable friend was
appointed.
I wonder if public confidence was increased
in 1940, when it was brought up to full
strength by the appointment of 14 senators
on the eve of the election. I wonder if the
public had greater regard for and greater
confidence in the Senate in 1945 when 18
vacancies were filled on the eve of the
election.
On the contrary, honourable senators, I
have no doubt that in 1949 the people of this
country had more confidence in the Prime
Minister and a higher regard for the Senate
when he refused to fill the vacancies on the
eve of the election, but left 8 appointments
which could be made by an incoming government. Again, in 1953, I have no doubt
that the confidence of the people in the
Prime Minister and their regard for the
Senate increased when on the eve of the
election of that year he left 13 vacant seats
in the Senate. This was something new in
the history of our country.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It surely was.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Never before had a
Prime Minister left vacant seats in the Senate
on the eve of an election except perchance
a few vacancies which occurred between
dissolution of Parliament and the election
day. And I repeat, most emphatically, that
in my opinion the confidence of the people
in the Prime Minister and their regard for
the Senate was increased rather than decreased as a result of his action by the
non-filling of these vacancies, and the Senate
remained a more dignified and respected
legislative body in the eyes of our fellow
citizens.
The Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) in a very forthright speech, spoke in
the highest terms of our Prime Minister. I
am satisfied that when he realizes the courageousness of our Prime Minister in leaving
these seats vacant, that neither he nor any
of his followers can support this bill.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Would it not have been
the opportune time just prior to the general
election for the Prime Minister to have filled

SENATE
the vacent Senate seats by appointing deserving members of the Commons, as suggested
by the leader?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) must not
be cross with me. I am not at all cross with
him.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But you are getting so
emphatic in this that I thought I would
get that way too.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think when I get
through with my statement that he will agree
with me that it was a very courageous thing
for the Prime Minister to leave these seats
vacant.
In all seriousness I say to the Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) and to the
members of his party that I think they will
hesitate for a long time to vote for this
bill when they realize what the Prime Minister did at the time of the general election
in 1953. Honourable senators very well know
there is no assurance that a government
will be re-elected when it goes to the country.
There was no assurance that a new Government would not come into power at that
election, and if a new government had come
in at that time it could have immediately
appointed 13 senators, which would have
increased the incoming government's representation in the Senate at the outset of the
new Parliament to 21 members; and with
the additional 8 vacancies which have occurred since that time the new government
would have had at this time 29 members.
It is for that reason that I ask my honourable
friends of the Opposition: Do you not think
that the Prime Minister was very fair in
leaving those appointments open so that had
your party come into power it would have
had a substantial following in this house?
I do not know whether a similar condition
will prevail at the dissolution of the present
Parliament, but I do know that it has occurred on two occasions, namely in 1949
and 1953, when our present Prime Minister
asked that Parliament be dissolved. He left
the way open for a new government to have
a sizeable following in this house, and I hope
the honourable members of the Opposition
will take that into consideration when voting
on this bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Before he leaves that question will the Leader of the Government
assure me that there is no danger that the
present Prime Minister will not be leader of
his party at the next general election?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Well, that is the $64
question, which I cannot answer.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would like to know.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: All I can say is, and
I think this expresses the feeling of both
the Leader of the Opposition and myself,
that I would be happy if the present Prime
Minister continued in office.
Let me say to the honourable members of
the Opposition that of course if you do not
approve of what the Prime Minister did in
that respect, and if you want to tell him so,
then vote for this bill; but if you approve of
what the Prime Minister did, then in my
opinion you have no alternative but to vote
against the bill.
I trust I have been fair in my arguments.
I have not consciously said anything for the
purpose of persuading honourable members to
vote on the bill other than in the way they
feel they should vote. I have tried to present
the issues clearly and fairly.
I am hoping that the honourable senator
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)-who has
always been my friend and whom I hope to
claim as my friend throughout the years that
lie ahead of both of us-will take the very
sage advice of the honourable senator from
Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King). However,
at the time it was offered I could see why my
honourable friend probably would not follow
it, because he thought that the amendment he
is sponsoring would be effective.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I still think so and in my
reply I will tell you why.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I thought my friend
had been convinced otherwise, because every
constitutional lawyer in the house who has
spoken so far on the bill is convinced that it
is ineffective. But when the honourable senator from Kootenay East spoke, that point had
not been made, nor had the question come up
as to whether the right section was being
amended; nor had the point so well presented
by the honourable senator from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) been made that this bill
does not affect existing vacancies. When the
honourable senator from Waterloo explained
the bill he said that it was for the purpose of
having the present vacancies filled.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I said nothing of the sort
in my speech, nor does it appear from the bill.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not want to misquote the honourable senator; I have tried
not to do so; but he did refer to existing
vacancies and he said, as reported on page 447
of Hansard:
This bill proposes to correct that situation.
T do not know what this means if it does not
mean that the purpose is to have these
twenty-two vacancies filled. I point out these
considerations to him because he did not
know, and none of us knew at that time, that

MAY 24, 1955
the bill was ineffective, that a constitutional
difficulty existed, and that the bill could flot
be made retroactive. Ail of us are now aware
of these facts.
Having given the matter very careful consideration, I believe that the effect of the
passage of this bill would be to greatly lower
our prestige, and therefore it is flot in the
interest of the Senate, for is it the sort of
legislation that we should pass.
For ail the reasons 1 have expressed, if
there is a vote I shahl have to record my
vote against the bill.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) a question? He has argued that
these vacancies do flot affect the efficiency
of the Senate. Would he give an opinion as
to how far this practice of flot filling vacancies cauld go before the efficiency of this
house would be affected?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I arn quite satisfied
with the way this matter of vacancies has
been handled during the time that our
present Prime Minister has held the reins
of government, and I arn prepared to leave
the decision with him. I arn told by the
honourable senator from Waterloo that at
one time there were twenty-eight vacancies.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I did flot say that. Probably what the honourable senator is referring to is my statement that in the hast
parliament there were twenty-three vacancies.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Probably that is the
right number. There were more then than
there are now. But 1 ar nfot going to attempt
to say j ust when the Prime Minister should
begin to fill vacancies. It is my conviction
that hie will do what is in the best interests
of the Senate and of the country.
Hon. George H. Ross: Honourable senators,
I had flot intended to take any part in this
debate, but after listening ta the speeches
that have been made in favour of the bill I
have corne ta the conclusion that I shauld
express some of my reasons for voting
against it.
As 1 read the British North America Act,
we senators, as a law-making body, have no
legal duty or jurisdiction with regard to the
appointment of senators. Absolute authority
in that respect is vested in the Governor
General, which means the Governor Generai
acting on the advice of the Prime Minister
and his cabinet. Let me quote what the act
says:
32. When a Vacancy happens in the Senate by
Resignation, Death, or otherwise, the Governor
General shall by Summons to a fit and qualified
Person fill the Vacancy.
50437-34

But, you rnay say, though the Senate has
no legai duty with respect ta fiiling vacancies in the Senate, it should be interested,
as it is, in good government. The sarne
might be said of the Canadian Bar Association. It, too, is interested in good government. Each has the same duty as the other
as ta filling vacancies in the Senate-which,
in my opinion, is nil. Suppose the Canadian
Bar Association were ta pass a resolution
saying, "The Governor General shah, within
six months of a vacancy occurriflg in the
Senate, fill such vacancy" and send it ta the
House of Commons, asking their concurrence
in it. Would you flot consider the Bar wag
meddling in the business of the Prime
Minister and his cabinet? Yet that is precisely what this bill does. For my part I have
faith in the Prime Minister and his cabinet,
and will flot undertake ta dictate ta them.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask rny friend a
question? Is he seriously suggesting that the
functions and the responsibilities of the
Canadian Bar Association in any way
resemble those of the Senate of Canada?
Hon. Mr. Ross: In 50 far as appaintments
of senators is concerned, yes. The right and
the duty of making these appointments
belong ta the Governor General in Council,
and ta na other body. If the honourable
member fram Waterloo can produce any
authority ta the contrary, I hope hie wili
bring it forward when hie concludes this
debate.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am flot questioning that
statement at ail, but I do flot see where the
Bar Association cames into this.
Hon. Mr. Ross: The f utility of the bill if
enacted was cleariy and eloquently explained by the honaurable senatar for Inkerman (Han. Mr. Hugessen). Suppose the bill
became law: there would be fia way of
enforcing it in the courts, as no court can
compel the Sovereign ta perforrn any duty.
The Governor General cannot compel himself ta act. If the haw were otherwise, it
would be a case of the Crown suing the
Crowfl ta compel the Crown ta act. Such an
incangruous action is flot toherated under
Canadian iaw.
To surn up: I amn apposed ta the bihl
because in my opinion it amnounts ta a vote
of want of confidenice in the Goverfiment;
and for the further reason that, if enacted,
it wouhd be futile.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourabie senators, the debate on this bill has devehoped
two main points of discussion. The first has
had ta do with canditions in the Senate,
and the second with the amendment ta section 24 of the British North America Act.

SENATE
I do not propose to engage in a long discussion on either point. I must confess too
that I rise to participate in this debate with
great diffidence because of the high quality
of argument which has been made by the
outstanding members of this chamber who
have already spoken. I may also confess that
at this stage of the debate it is most difficult
not to repeat some of the points which have
already been made.
Every honourable senator has been impressed by the description given of the
record of achievement of this house and of
its committees. Those members of the
general public who read those excellent
speeches will also be gratified.
It should be said too that all honourable
senators have been impressed by the sincerity of those who have spoken, in urging
that greater advantage be taken of the
facilities and capacity of the Senate to
assume continuing responsibilities for the
betterment of Canadian conditions. For these
reasons we are all indebted to the honourable
gentleman from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
for introducing this bill, and for discussing
the situation with reference to Senate vacancies in so objective and moderate a way.
Everyone interested in the welfare of the
country and in the protection of parliamentary institutions is concerned about the
shortage of senators. It is not desirable that
the quality or the quantity of the work donc
here should be impaired. Moreover, no one
likes to contemplate that segments of the
Canadian population entitled to representation in this chamber should lack it for any
xtended period.
i will not labour either of these points
except to repeat that the annals of the
Senate have been enriched by the speeches
which have already been made.
The honourable gentleman from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) referred to the
desirability of making appointments to the
Senate on a basis other than the purely
political. This view was expressed also by
the honourable Leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig), and if I may venture an opinion I
think that view would be generally endorsed
for the reason given by the gentleman from
Vancouver South. I listened with deep appreciation to the views expressed by the senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) with reference to reform. But these important matters
I leave in the capable hands of the gentlemen
who have already handled them. They are
occasioned by this measure but they do not,
strictly speaking, emerge from the bill. They
do, however, indicate the nature of the problem faced by any government in the circumstances obtaining in this chamber today.

If I may have the indulgence of the
house-and perhaps immediately be out of
order-there is another point that I should
like to deal with. It is a consideration which
has affected parliamentary institutions in our
time and which has a bearing not only upon
the Senate but as well upon the House of
Commons. The problem exists in all countries governed by the parliamentary method.
I refer to the recognized position of ascendancy which the executive, the cabinet, has
exerted to an increasing degree over legislative bodies. This was also mentioned by the
senator from Ottawa. It is not a new development but it has been the object of concern
to students in Great Britain. Lord Campion
bas put it this way:
The development of party machinery, the growing stringency of party discipline, the replacement
of the House of Commons by the electors as the
government-choosing agency, have all worked in
the same direction to increase the ascendancy of
the Executive over Parliament. The Government
has also been the chief beneficiary from the
restriction of the legislative powers of the flouse
of Lords. There has been a deterioration in the
position of the House of Commons, as a body,
and in the status of individual members.

The Right Honourable L. S. Amery, who
had long experience in public life in Great
Britain, has added this comment:
The ever-growing volume of administrative and
legislative business to be dealt with by Parliament
adds greatly to the danger of party caucus dictatorship.
Some substantial easement could be and
should be afforded by once mure making a reality
of the House of Lords.

It may be small consolation to members of
this body to know that there is concern expressed by thinkers that modern conditions
of life are shaping the institutions of parliamentary government in a manner somewhat
different from what was originally contemplated. It does not follow, of course, that
governments or individual members of
governments necessarily subscribe to the trend
simply for the purpose of consolidating
In a
greater power unto themselves.
measure the situation in the Senate complained of today has a background in this
problem. I said it may be small consolation
to know this, but at least in knowing it
we can realize we are not alone. To say
all this, is not to recommend either inaction
or despair. Governments must cope with the
problem to assure that the best advantage
be taken of facilities afforded by legislative
bodies like the Senate and the House of
Commons. Perhaps, too, in the light of the
most interesting discussion of section 33 of
the British North America Act given by the
honourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) last week, the Senate
perhaps has an onus cast upon it to approach
this problem in a constructive way.

MAY 24, 1955
I had some remarks to make with reference
to whether or not section 24 was the section
to be amended rather than section 32. I
have listened with extreme interest to what
the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has said on that point
tonight. There may be some worthwhile
consideration that should be given to it. Perhaps some reference, if there is an amendment
to be made to one section specifically, should
be made to the other section. My only suggestion on that would be that if the bill
should go to committee it could be considered
carefully there.
There bas been general agreement from
the lawyers who have discussed this bill,
that if a court were called upon to say when
the summons to be issued by reason either
of section 24 or section 32 of the B.N.A. Act
should be issued by the Governor General in
the event of a vacancy, it would say that the
summons should be issued "within a reasonable time".
An opinion bas been expressed by the
honourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinity
that "a reasonable length of time" may be six
months. Others have said a year, and perhaps
even longer. There seems ta be general
agreement, however, that a period of seven
or five or even a number of years might not
be construed as a reasonable length of time.
Perhaps, too, the party-standing in the chamber at a given time would have a bearing
on the problem. Obviously the spirit of the
two sections and, indeed, the spirit of the
British North America Act is this, that the
Senate should as far as possible have its
full complement of members both because of
the representative character of the chamber
and as well to ensure the efficiency of its
work.
I was most impressed by the legal argument and explanation given by the honourable
gentleman from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen). It was but another demonstration of
the clarity of his thought and the felicity of
his language. I do not propose to discuss
that branch of his argument which dealt with
the retroactive effect of a statute. In my
short experience here I have noticed that
honourable senators are careful to guard
against the use of words in statutes which
might give them retrospective effect. If this
amendment is passed, it is clear that it cannot apply to existing vacancies. It might
have a moral effect thereon, but that is all.
The standard rules of construction for the
interpretation of statutes bear out this view
completely.
What interested me most in the speech of
my honourable friend, however, was his
analysis of the legal effects of the proposed
50437-34j

amendment. I had been reading some of the
authorities on the subject and, of course, it
was gratifying to find that he should have
resorted to the same authorities upon which
I would rely. He quoted Maxwell on
Statutes, Bth Edition. There have been two
subsequent editions of Maxwell, but there
has been no variation in the opinion quoted
by my friend from the 8th Edition. That
is the basic law, and it is repeated in other
authorities like Craies and Beal and the
Digests, and indeed in the cases I have read
in Canada, in England and in the United
States.
In the opinion of my friend-and in this I
think we can all concur-the practical legal
effect, if indeed there is any legal effect at
all in this proposed amendment, is very slight.
The proposed new injunction to the Governor
General would not be mandatory. It could
be no more than directive. No writ of mandamus and no comparable judicial process
can run against the Crown. This is long
settled law.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Would the same thing apply
with reference to vacancies in the House of
Commons, so far as the House of Commons
Act is concerned?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: I am going to deal with
just that point, if my honourable friend will
kindly wait.
To repeat, honourable senators, no writ of
mandamus and no comparable judicial process
can run against the Crown. This is long
settled law. In the result, the proposed new
section must be without any legal sanction.
The honourable gentleman from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) derived some help for his
amendment from sections 10 and 13 of the
House of Commons Act. These sections
require the Speaker of that house to issue his
warrant in the event of a vacancy, in the
manner which the honourable Leader of the
Government described. They further require
the Chief Electoral Officer, upon receipt of
that warrant, to issue a writ for an election
within six months. The sponsor of this bill
is justified in claiming that the six months'
period provided in these sections is a useful
precedent here; and I think, with all due
deference to the Honourable Leader of the
Government, that was all the honourable
gentleman from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
sought to get out of sections 10 and 13 of the
House of Commons Act. And while he
claimed no more help from the House of
Commons Act, it should be pointed out that
there are legal and other sanctions available
to enforce the House of Commons Act against
the Speaker, if necessary, and against the
Chief Electoral Officer, if required. But there

SENATE
are no legal sanctions available against the
Governor General. In other words, even if
this bill is passed, the Governor General could
ignore any time limit which the bill might
impose upon him for the filling of a vacancy
in the Senate. And if the Governor General
did ignore this time limit, but should he
thereafter fill the vacancy, the appointment
would still be valid. The law on this point
I think is clear and can be expressed in this
way:
Where a statute specifies the time within which
a public officer is to perform an official act regarding the rights and duties of others, it will be
considered as directory merely, unless the nature
of the act to be performed or the language used
by the legislator show that the designation of the
time was intended as a limitation of the power
of the officer.
Thus far my honourable friend from Inkerman and myself are in agreement. Here, however, with deference and with considerable
diffidence, I must part company with him,
and I hope that by doing so I shall not fall

into bad company. The honourable gentleman
says that a moral effect will flow from the
introduction of a specific time element of
say six or twelve months. He says that this
moral effect will be so cogent that no Prime
Minister would risk incurring a charge from
his political opponents that he has flouted the
constitution by ignoring it. Successfully to
charge any cabinet minister with breaking
the law upon a serious issue, can have serious

political consequences for him, and perhaps
for the Government of which he is a member.
To charge the Prime Minister with flouting
the constitution, in letter and in spirit, could
be more serious still. All this is true.
But it is my submission that if section 24
and section 32 now mean what they say, or if
they mean what the courts would hold they
now say, the constitution is already flouted.
And if there are no extenuating circumstances, the situation is now as serious as
the honourable gentleman from Inkerman
suggests it would be if the proposed amendment becomes the law.
Let me repeat: section 32, it is agreed,
means that the Governor General must fill
Senate vacancies within a reasonable time. It
is argued that some of the vacant seats here
have been empty for a period longer than is
reasonable. The failure to fill such vacancies
must, therefore, be viewed as a violation of
section 32, if these views are right.
And what is the legal sanction for this condition now? Obviously there is none. And
what is the moral sanction? Perhaps it lies in
whatever support from public opinion can be
developed. This debate might have that
effect. But perhaps, too, the extenuating cir2umstances to which I have referred earlier,

and which have been mentioned by the honourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris), modify the position. In any
event, I think that the legal sanctions or the
moral or practical sanctions, which would
flow from the adoption of this amendment,
would not be greater in similar circumstances
than they are under the existing law. I must,
therefore, conclude that the amendment is
nugatory and ineffective to accomplish the
purpose desired. I, therefore, would not feel

that I could support a constitutional amendment of this character.
Finally, I think a question might well be
raised also as to the wisdon of introducing
an ineffective amendment to the constitution
of this country. In the first place we must
remember that one of the functions of the
Senate is to review and revise defective
legislation. The Senate might quite properly
question this amendment if it originated elsewhere for the reasons I have already given. I
think we should hesitate more to pass an
ineffective constitutional amendment which
originates here.
In the second place, I think that we should
approach with great caution, any amendment
to the constitution of this country. It is an
historic fact that constitutional changes in
Britain are undertaken after the most searching investigation, and frequently they are
accompanied with considerable political upheaval. The amendments which were made
to the Parliament Act in 1911, and perhaps in
1948, are cases in point. They were much
more far reaching than this amendment, but
they serve as an example.
In the American system of government the
machinery for constitutional amendment is
elaborate and perhaps cumbersome. Generally
speaking, it requires a two-thirds majority in
each house of the Congress, the consent of
the President and the approval of the legislatures of three-quarters of the States. As a
consequence the constitution is much more
rigid; perhaps more rigid than we would like
to see ours. Viscount Bryce discussing this
aspect of the matter, makes this comment:
Ought the process of change to be made easier?
Say by requiring only a bare majority in Congress
and a two-thirds majority of the States? American
statesmen think not. A swift and easy method
would not onIy weaken the sense of security which
the rigid constitution now gives, but would increase the troubles of current politics by stimulating a majority in Congress frequently to submit
amendments to the States. The habit of amending
There
wculd turn into the habit of tinkering.
would be too little distinction between changes in
the ordinary Statute law which require the agreement of majorities in the two houses and the
President, and changes in the more solemnly
enacted fundamental law.

Honourable senators, it could be argued
that more than a bare majority in our two

MAY 24, 1955
Houses of Parliament; should be required
before the British North America Act be
amended, even in purely federal matters. I
do flot make that argument now. But I think
the honourable senator from Vancouver South
was most wise when he commented that a
change in Canada's constitution should not
be lightly undertaken.
There is a bill on the Order Paper in the
other place which proposes a retirement age
for senators. I think, among other things
about that bill, that a charge of Iltinkering
with the constitution" could be levelled
against it. I would not be happy if such an
allegation were made successfully about a

measure passed here. I conclude by saying
that while I cannot support the bill for the
reasons I have outlined, I believe that there
has been great value from this discussion for
the Senate, for Parliament and for the country. The Senate has asserted its views with
dignity, with clarity and with commendable
moderation. I would not relish it if we
adopted an inoperative constitutional. amendment.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Turgeon, the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACTS
AMENDMENT BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING NEGATIVED
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Euler for the second reading of Bill H-10,
an Act to amend the British North America
Acts, 1867 to 1952.
Hon. Gray Turgeon: Honourable senators,
it is not necessary for one rising today, near
the closing of this debate, to state that during
the course of the debate we have heard some
extraordinarily good speeches. If I were not
rising at so late an hour in the debate I would
make some comments on a number of these
speeches, but time will not permit one to
do that now.
However, there are one or two points that
I do wish to bring before the house. First
of all I am going to refer to a statement made
by the honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris), and I will do so
partly because it has been referred to by

MAY 25, 1955
other speakers and partly because I am in
hearty accord with it and made a similar
statement myself. The honourable senator
said, as reported in Hansard, page 467:
Honourable senators, I have not had the honour
to discuss this question with Mr. St. Laurent or
his immediate advisers, but I have heard a good
deal of talk and also formed some conclusions of
my own about the matter, and I am of the opinion
that there is in the mind of the Prime Minister
today a conflict of thought which presents great
difficulty to him in considering the vacancies in
the Senate.

My honourable friend related that view to
suggestions which he proceeded to make
about types of appointments, and then he
said:
It is a fact that not only is there a lack of
representation in the Opposition in this house
today, but there is also a lack of political thought
representative of the people of Canada in the
Senate, and this condition will exist while the
old system prevails.

While there is an element of truth in that
statement, I believe the honourable senator
has so far overshot the mark he has in view
that I must disagree with it. He went on:
I believe the Prime Minister recognizes his
obligation to the public to see that the Senate is
what it ought to be.

Then he stated:
The primary consideration at this time is that
the Senate should be representative of the political
and public thinking of the people of Canada.

Honourable senators, I hold in my hand
an article which appeared in the Montreal
Gazette of December 5, 1953, and from which
I will briefly quote. It is headed "Liberals
Scan Non-Party Rule on Senate Seats"; and
it states:
Prime Minister St. Laurent today hinted that
the Government may be moving away from party
appointments to the Senate. In filling the current
thirteen vacancies in the Upper House, he said be
is looking for a general policy that will strengthen
Canada's confidence in the Senate.

I will make just one citation of a friendly
article. It is from the Ottawa Journal of
December 20, 1951:
We trust that the Prime Minister and the Government Leader in the Senate pay attention to
speeches made away from Ottawa by parliamentarians. We have observed that Senator Gray
Turgeon, speaking in a round table discussion, has
suggested that appointments on the basis of public
service in varied fields be made to the Upper
House.

The article goes on, but I shall not read
further from it.
I am going to read now from a statement
that I made on September 28, 1951, on
"Town Meeting of the Air", which is a
radio panel discussion. Before quoting from
my statement I want to say that on that
occasion I participated in a debate with Mrs.
Angus MacInnis, the daughter of Mr.
Woodsworth, whose husband is a member
of the House of Commons. I understand that
at the moment Mr. MacInnis is sick at home,
in Vancouver, and I do hope he will have a
complete recovery soon. While he and I do
not agree in politics I regard him as one of
the most honest men we have in our Canadian Parliament. The debate I took part in
was about the Senate, and the remarks I
made on that occasion brought me some
criticism as well as some favourable comment. I will now quote from my own statement:
In making appointments it is essential to remember that the Senate is a deliberative and legislative
body and has a responsibility with respect to the
constitutionai rights of our provincial Legislatures
and of our federal Parliament. Therefore, to a
large extent, men and women with parliamentary
experience must continue to be among those
appointed.
Today, however, more than ever before, except
during actual all-out warfare, one of Canada's
most urgent requirements is a positive recognition
and acknowledgment of community responsibility.
Every individual has a moral obligation of citizenship. It is especially binding upon those engaged
and in
education
school and university
in
journalism or other forms of publicity. And this
obligation applies very strongly to those who are
active in business and manufacturing and farming
associations and in labour unions. It also applies
to the members of our councils of women and our
consumers associations.
In my opinion and I
intend to press for its acceptance, it would be
to appoint members of these and other
proper
groups to the Senate regardless of their politics
or their lack of politics.
This would bring to
Parliament a greater intimate knowledge of dayto-day conditions than now prevails.
And as
indicated above, some appointments of this nature
would make the Senate an even more representative body.

The writer goes on to praise the Prime
Minister, and develops his thoughts in this
connection. I will not at the moment go
further into that matter, but I propose to
repeat a statement which I made some while
ago, and which, I admit, although it drew
some approving comments, also elicited
strong criticism. I concede that that criticism
was quite sincere, but it may have been
And as the honourable senator from Vanbased on the mistaken impression that what couver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) pointed out
I was saying was that party politicians -and I believe it to be true-it would make
should not be appointed to the Senate, or the Senate more highly appreciated by the
that members of the House of Commons or of public of Canada, generally speaking. It is
other legislative bodies should not be called largely because I made that statement years
ago that I am taking part in this debate, and
to this chamber.

SENATE
I was further tempted to do so after hearing
the honourable senator from Vancouver South
state that he thought there was some disturbance within the mind of the Prime Minister as to the nature of the appointments that
should be made.
In connection with the subject-matter of
the discussion on this proposed amendment
to the Canadian constitution, I want to say
quite clearly that I am definitely opposed to
this bill, and if it comes to a vote I intend
to vote against it. While I believe that the
debate will do a great deal of good, I am
afraid that even the taking of a vote, whichever way it should go-and if we do have
a vote, I hope the motion will be negatived
-would do harm in the mind of the public
as to the general makeup of the Senate.
I want to say a word of praise for the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) who presented this bill. It has been
implied that he was indifferent as to whether
the introduction of the bill would embarrass
the Prime Minister or not. I know the
honourable senator very, very well, and I
owe to him as a former minister, as well as to
other honourable senators who formerly were
ministers, a real debt for the extraordinarily
good work done by him and thern as ministers when I happened to need their help in
the House of Commons. I feel positive that
there is not the faintest feeling within the
mind of the honourable senator from Waterloo
that the bill if passed would embarrass the
Prime Minister. I am quite sure, although
I do not agree with him, that he thinks the
passing of this bill would do some good.
Personally, I feel that, apart from the benefit
derived from this debate, if a vote is taken,
particularly if it is an affirmative vote, the
bill would do a great deal of harm.
It has been suggested here that the Senate
vacancies could be filled by members from
the political parties in the Opposition.
Frankly, I do not agree with that, although
I know I shall not be making myself any
more popular in some quarters by saying so.
I do not agree with it, because I think we
have had examples enough in some of the
countries of Europe to show not only the
uselessness of a system of that nature but
also the very injurious effects that can result
from such a system. That idea, of course, is
more or less based upon what is called proportional representation, although it is a
digression from it. We have seen it worked
out in some of the countries of Europe, and
what have we found? We have found that
under such conditions a government never
knows where it is. One of the troubles of
the so-called Western world today is that
it never knows if an agreement, in which

certain European countries are participants,
will be carried out, because their governments do not last more than a few weeks
or a few months at a time.
It was suggested here, in a similar vein,
that the provincial governments should make
Senate appointments. That systen exists in
Europe, too. Until lately everybody was
wondering what would happen in Germany
because of the uncertainty of the result of
the provincial or state elections, whichever
they are called, and uncertainty whether a
certain percentage of the Upper House would
be appointed to positions of authority. That
system might have destroyed us in our
efforts during last year to bring about a
proper standing between the countries of
Europe. So I do not agree with either of the
two suggestions made. However, I want
members of this chamber to recall that I
suggested that people who had shown a true
sense of community responsibility should be
appointed to the Senate, regardless of their
politics, or their lack of politics-for some of
them perhaps have no political background
at all. The honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has said that
many members of this chamber were never
at any time members of the House of Cornmons or of legislatures, and yet they are
just as good senators as those of us who
have had that experience. While I have made
the statement that many members of this
body should have former parliamentary
experience, because this is a deliberate and
legislative body, I do not think such experience is essential.
I listened with a great deal of interest to,
among others, the speech made by the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert).
He quoted fron a statement made by Sir
Clifford Sifton to the effect that persons who
had held high government offices-for example, ministers and lieutenant governorsshould be entitled to appointment to the
Senate, but that in order to make such
appointments it would be necessary to refrain from filling vacancies for a period of
time. That condition is true of appointments
of every nature. Particularly is it true of
the suggestion which I made, and which was
endorsed by the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) and by
editorial comment in various newspapers
across Canada. If that is going to be the
policy, time for deliberation must be given
to the Prime Minister to consult with his
advisers on the making of appointments. To
pass legislation fixing a time limit within
which Senate appointments must be made,
and to so direct the Sovereign through ber
representative the Governor General, would
be to destroy our significance as a legislative

MAY 25, 1955
body. The honourable senator from Calgary
(Hon. Mr. Ross), in his speech last evening,
brought this thought to our minds, and
warned that we must be careful of the nature
of the legislation which we pass.
A good deal has been said by many people
about the position of the Senate, and we are
all aware of the many expressions of lack
of confidence in this chamber. The question
of long continuing vacancies in this bouse,
does not contribute to the confidence of the
public in this body. Therefore, I sincerely
hope that that question can be cleared as
quickly as possible.
Honourable senators will recall an article
about the Senate which appeared in Maclean's
magazine some time last year. This carefully
written article had some praiseworthy comment about the Senate and was also very
critical of it. The article pointed out that,
from Confederation up to the year 1954, of
some 7,352 bills which had come from the
House of Commons to the Senate only 214
had been rejected by this bouse; also, that
within the same period the Senate had seen
fit to amend some 1,666 bills. Attention was
drawn to some important statutory amendments which were initiated in the Senate,
such as the amendments to the Income Tax
Act recommended by a special committee
which met under the chairmanship of the
sponsor of this bill (Hon. Mr. Euler); and
mention was made of the work of the Finance
Committee, under the chairmanship of the
co-sponsor of this bill (Hon. Mr. Crerar).
While it had some good words to say about
the effect of major amendments, in general
the article did not attach much significance
to the great majority of amendments proposed
by the Senate.
Time permits mention of only one or two
amendments which I think are significant
and which in fairness to the Senate should
be noted. For instance, an amendment to
the Public Service Superannuation Bill was
brought in last session at the instigation of
the honourable lady from Fredericton (Hon.
Mrs. Fergusson) and supported by the
honourable lady from Rockcliffe (Hon. Mrs.
Wilson). My attention was first drawn to
that bill by a complaint from the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
about its compulsory feature. The action
taken by the Senate was such as to remove
this undesirable feature and to substitute
strictly voluntary conditions. While we did
not reject the measure, we were able to
correct and improve it. I am sure that was
counted amongst the 1,600-odd amendments
to which the article referred as not being
very important. To me it is significant that
Government legislation, dealing with the

relationship between the Government and its
employees, was interfered with in the Senate
largely at the instigation of a relatively new
appointee to this chamber. Certainly that
destroys any suggestion that undue pressure
or influence is exercised on senators by the
authority who makes the appointments.
The article in Maclean's went on to mention
the Naval Aid Bill of 1913, on which I should
like to make brief comment. The honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell),
in his speech of a few days ago, referred to
the amendments to the Income Tax Act
recommended by the special committee
headed by the senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler). He made reference also to the
action taken by the Senate with respect to
the Canada Shipping Act. It was pointed out
that until the passage of the Statute of Westminster Canada had no authority to deal
with shipping outside ber own boundaries.
In this connection I would remind the house
that had it not been for the action taken by
the Senate with respect to the Naval Aid Bill,
in 1913, the Statute of Westminster would
never have been passed, or at least not for
a very long time. As I have said before, the
Naval Aid bill was sponsored by Sir Robert
Borden.
Regardless of the fact that just a few years
earlier, in 1909, the House of Commons had
unanimously passed a resolution against any
naval aid of that nature, this bill was
accepted by the Commons in 1912. While it
was under debate the statement was made
over and over again that the time was coming fast when the people of Canada should
be entitled to representation in the House
of Commons of Great Britain.
Now, honourable senators, I submit that
if anything of that nature had happened we
never would have had the Commonwealth as
we have it today. If the Senate had not
killed that bill in 1913 how could Sir Robert
Borden have taken the positive and noble
stand that he did take when dealing with the
Versailles Treaty at the end of the First
World War, a stand whereby he refused to
permit the delegation from Great Britain to
sign the treaty for Canada? He insisted on
that point and finally won out, with the
result that a Canadian signed the Versaille
Treaty for Canada. I repeat that if that
Naval Aid Bill had not been defeated by the
Senate in 1913 that action by Sir Robert
Borden would have been utterly impossible.
What led up to the passing of the Statute
of Westminster was the so-called Balfour
Memorandum, passed as a result of the 1926
conference of various members of the Commonwealth, as we call it now, in London,
and the leading agent in that discussion was

SENATE

our then Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Mackenzie King. In the agreement
reached at that time, which brought about
the Balfour Memorandum, it was stated that
each of the various countries within the proposed Commonwealth was equal, that none
was superior to the other; and that is the
circumstance which eventually brought about
the Statute of Westminster. That is why we
have today the Queen as Queen of Canada,
and we are all very, very proud of having
her as Queen of Canada.
I am just mentioning these things in a
brief resumé of what the Senate has done in
the past, and of some of the things that have
taken place not only in Canada but in other
parts of the Commonwealth following from
actions of the Senate. If that memorable
event of 1913 had not taken place, and if
the Commonwealth had not, after the conference of 1926, been put upon the basis
which was founded upon the Balfour Memorandum, the Commonwealth conference of a
couple of years ago in London could not have
achieved the success of which we are all now
so proud. I am referring to the conference
at which the present Prime Minister, the
Right Honourable Mr. St. Laurent and the
present Secretary of State for External Affairs,
the Honourable Mr. Pearson, played so important a part in having India and Pakistan
remain openly within the Commonwealth in
spite of the nature and forms of government
which the people of those two countries were
contemplating. Today we are all part of
the same Commonwealth, and proud of the
fact that we are playing a marvellously
important part in the affairs of the world;
and I know that I am right in stating that
these accomplishments result from the action
of the Senate in 1913.
In closing, I am going to take the liberty
of doing what the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) did last
night. He approved the suggestion made by
the honourable senator from Kootenay East
(Hon. Mr. King) that our very good friend the
honourable senator from. Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler), the sponsor of the bill, withdraw it
so that there should be no vote upon it. I also
am endorsing that suggestion, and in addition
I am making a personal appeal both to the
sponsor and to the co-sponsor that, at least
for this session, until we see what happens,
they withdraw the bill. It is evidently the
consensus now that if this bill passes it would
not have the slightest effect on the present
vacancies, and it could not have any effect
until a vacancy occurred after the amendment
to the constitution had received Royal Assent.
The great desire of the sponsor and the cosponsor of the bill is to stir up feelings of
appreciation of the Senate among the people

of Canada, and I think such feelings have
been strengthened by what has taken place
in this debate. I honestly believe that this
debate will improve our position. Let them
therefore withdraw the bill, and then their
action will be definitely good and have no
bad effects whatever on the Senate or on our
parliamentary system. I make that appeal
in a friendly fashion and I do hope they will
give it consideration, because I am sure that
in time to come all members of the Senate
and countless other Canadians will, in their
minds at least place a halo around the heads
of both of them for the good they will have
done by withdrawing this bill.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, in
rising to take part in this debate I do not
intend to offer any apology at all. We have
heard from a number of lawyers and some
professional politicians. As I am an ordinary
layman I will express my views as such,
because this Senate was originally set-up for
the very purpose of having all the diverse
opinions of Canada freely expressed in this
chamber.
I would like at once to express my reaction
to the suggestion of the honourable senator
who has just taken his seat that the bill be
withdrawn. I am of the opinion that that
action, if taken at all, should have been
taken before many of the speeches were made,
particularly those which implied that the
Government or the Prime Minister would be
embarrassed if we passed the bill. Now,
honourable senators, if that is to be the
considered opinion of this body, then we are
just sitting here to please the Government.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I did not say that.
Hon. Mr. Horner: No, but that was the
implication. I could draw no other inference
from what you said, than that we should
always act in such a way as to please the
Government.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: If you took it in that
way I certainly did not express myself
properly.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I could take no other
meaning out of your remarks.
Honourable senators will perhaps be somewhat surprised to hear that I am supporting
the bill. As I look around our little group
in this corner I ask myself if the filling of
any of the present vacancies would increase
our numbers, and what a hope I have of that!
However, there is a matter of principle at
stake.
Last night, the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) made a
good speech, and I thought he was "the lawyer for the defence". Had he been on the
opposite side, supporting the bill, he could
have done so much better with less effort.

MAY 25, 1955
One hears a great deal here and there to
-the effect that, to qualify as a senator, a man
should have experience in some legislative
body. I know a little about the subject,
because-unfortunately-I was on two occasions a defeated candidate in northern Saskatchewan; and last year I had some difficulty with the honourable senator from
Prince (Hon. Mr. Barbour), over a nasty,
bad-tempered remark he made, as he went
out of the chamber, that, anyway, he had been
elected to a legislature. As a good deal of the
discussion on this bill has not been strictly
in order, I assume I may be allowed the
privilege of being a little irrelevant, on what
is purely a personal matter. I would like to
draw to the attention of honourable senators that today an election is being held in
beautiful Prince Edward Island; there are
some 60,000 registered voters, and some 30
candidates. Assuming that 70 per cent of
the registered voters will attend the polls,
it follows that each candidate will have, on
the average, no more than 1,300 votes. Now
let me say, in no spirit of boastfulness, that
for many years I was a member of my local
school board, and at the time of my appointment to this chamber I was reeve of my
municipality; and there were just about the
same number of voters in my municipality as
there are in the honourable senator's constituency in Prince Edward Island-to say
nothing of the fact that some three to four
million bushels of grain are grown in my
district.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: What has all this to do
with the bill?
Hon. Mr. Horner: A lot of things that have
been said here have not had anything to do
with the bill, and among them were some
of the arguments used by the honourable
senator who has just taken his seat. Further,
while the honourable senator from Prince
remained in his fine province of Prince Edward Island, where his family have lived
for generations, and where he was surrounded
with relations and friends, I as a young man
went to Western Canada and settled in a
district where there were few people of my
own race and kin. The surrounding country
was filled with people from Europe who came
here as immigrants. They were told when
they arrived that the Canadian Conservative
party resembled the reactionary conservatism
which oppressed them in their native lands;
and the Liberals promoted the idea, not from
the public platform but by a whispering campaign, that if these people voted Conservative
they would lose their homesteads and be
deported from Canada. That was the story
which was circulated just before the federal

election of 1917. And I will say this to the
honourable senator, that had Our Saviour
come down to earth and run in that constituency as a Conservative candidate he would
have been defeated. Naturally, I was defeated. I felt I should mention this matter
to show what sorne of us have had to contend with. By the way, I was told by my
own leader that to the city of Winnipeg
belongs the honour, or dishonour, of having
elected the first Communist to any legislature in Canada.
To complete what I intended to say-I agree
with the Leader of the Government, and I
have said so before in this chamber, that
people who, though they may never have sat
on a school board or any other public body,
have rendered great service to Canada may
be ideally fitted for appointment to this chamber. I would not object to selections of this
kind; and in the very nature of things there
will be appointments to the Senate from
members of the House of Commons.
I intend to support this bill. I disagreed
with a number of remarks made by the
Leader of the Government. Every day lately
two or three messengers have been calling on
senators in their offices to try to get a quorum
for various committees.
Some Hon. Senators: No.
Hon. Mr. Horner: That is true. There were
three in my office this morning. A man can
sit on only one committee at a time; and I
am sorry to say that some honourable senators do not attend to their committee duties.
It might not be a bad thing to have the
honourable the Speaker read, in addition to
the prayers, the oath of office which honourable senators take on entering this chamber.
The intention of those who created the
Senate was to have it filled with men of
various opinions. When 22 in a membership
of 102 are absent, it is hard to estimate what
the Senate is losing. The question is not
whether our business can be carried on with
a smaller number, but whether we are not
depriving ourselves of the advantage of having new men with new ideas. When you take
grist to the mill, though there may be in it
some chaff and some leaves, you grind that
grist. On a former occasion, when the subject of Senate reform was before us, I was
definitely opposed to the fixing of an age
of retirement, because I realized then, and
I believe now, that, though men might be
appointed to and sit in this chamber at the
age of eighty, if during their long lives they
have been gathering experience and are still
mentally alert, we would get "grist from the
the mill", and in the very nature of things
they would not be here too long.

I have read all the speeches delivered well afford to have three or four hundred

to hear. I was greatly interested in the very the Senate should continue to exist. Like

An' foolish notion.
Hon. Mr. Reid: And I am looking at you
now.
Hon. Mr. Horner: We have been told during
this debate that senators should have nothing
to say about this question of filling Senate
vacancies. I would at this point read section
26 of the British North America Act:
If at any Time on the Recommendation of the

Governor General the Queen thinks fit to direct
that Three or Six Members be added to the
Senate, the Governor General may by Summons to
Three or Six qualified Persons (As the Case may
be), representing equally the Three Divisions of
Canada, add to the Senate accordingly.

That provides for at least six extra members. Section 27 of the same act reads:
In case of such Addition being at any Time made
the Governor General shall not summon any Person
to the Senate, except on a further like Direction
by the Queen on the like Recommendation, until
each of the Three Divisions of Canada is represented by Twenty-four Senators and no more.

Honourable senators, another point not
raised in this debate concerns the volume of
business now done in this country. When I
was appointed to the Senate the federal bud-

get amounted to some $450 million-less than
the

present budget of Ontario

alone-and

would have been first-class politics.
When Newfoundland joined Confederation

most Newfoundlanders were neither Liberals
nor Conservatives as we know them in
Canada. I said then and I still say that the
only just and fair thing to have done was to
have appointed three senators from Newfoundland to sit on the Opposition benches in
this house.

Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Suppose they had refused to sit there?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Not a chance. I can name
some who would have gladly sat on this side.
I do not think any reasonable person inside
or outside the Senate would argue that such
appointments would not have been fair and
just. Furthermore, in order to right the wrong
that has been done I would suggest that such
appointments could still be made whenever
vacancies occur in Newfoundland constitu-

encies.

Two former Newfoundland members

in the House of Commons, Gordon Higgins
and William Browne, would be delightful men
to have here.
The honourable Leader of the Government
made a play on the fact that the Prime

vacancies before elections.

appointments to a year. I think that would
be a backward step. As the honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
said, if the Senate defeats this bill it will
be a very serious thing. I think it will be
much more serious than just the defeat of
the bill, because the people of this country
will say: "The Government didn't want that
legislation, and as the Senate has a large
Liberal majority it of course defeated the
bill." So I ask honourable senators who talk
as independents to show a little independent
action and support the bill.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators,The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, may I remind the house that if the
honourable gentleman, the sponsor of the
bill, speaks now he will close the debate.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, as
seems to be the custom, I should compliment
those who have participated in the discussion upon the high level at which the debate
has been maintained. In fact, I think perhaps I ought to compliment myself in that
my little bill, which I thought was simplicity
itself, should have provoked what has been,
in my opinion, the best debate since I came
to the Senate, fifteen years ago. There was
only one slightly discordant note, which has
already been referred to by my good friend
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner). The
senator frcm New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid), without any provocation or relevancy
to the bill itself quite unfairly, I think,
charged the senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) and my humble self with a lack of
independence. Under all the circumstances
I think honourable members will understand
me when I say that I thought he was joking,
but it seems that he was serious, for he compared our lack of independence with his
own fearless course in the House of Commons, where ho had been, as he said with
considerable pride, a rebel; and he twice
intimated that perhaps his independence had
cost him a seat in the federal cabinet. Well,
perhaps he is right. But for some reason I
was rerninded of a little incident that
occurred a fev weeks ago when I was being
taken upstairs in the Senate elevator cn the
way to my breakfast. The operator of the
elevator seemed to be in a cheerful mood,
and was singing a little song to himself, se
I said to him, "I am glad to sec you are so
happy this morning." He replied, "Oh, well,
senator, I am just kidding myself."
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The reputation of my deskmate the senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) requires no defence whatsoever in

this house. I would say that his record of
probably 40 years of public service in Canada
would bear fair comparison with that of
anyone else here.
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I proceed to discuss
w'th becoming seriousness the question of
this bill. In doing so I hope to stay within
the confines of the bill, and not go far afield
as many previous speakers have done. I
understand that in closing the debate I am
not supposed to raise any new issues or
discuss any new matters. I am therefore
pretty much limited to a discussion of the
remarks of those who expressed opposition
to the bill. In doing so I shall perhaps pay
considerable attention to what the Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)
had to say last evening, and if I seem to
overlook what some other senators have said
I hope they will take no offence.
May I refer first to the good speech made
by the senator from Queen's-Lunenburg
(Hon. Mr. Kinley). Although he roved far
and wide, he finally touched on what I think
is the crux of the question before us today.
He said-I do not have his exact words-that
he thought I had made a pretty good case,
but that upon reflection he came to the conclusion that my bill was not a friendly one.
While this bill is neither friendly nor unfriendly, this is the first intimation I have
had that any manner of sentiment can be
injected into a bill. If my friend can show
me how I can inject any kindly or affectionate
feeling into any bills I may introduce in the
future-and I am sure they will be few,
because my experience in introducing bills
has not been happy-I shall be glad to consider the matter. However, I do not know
what my hard-boiled legal friends would do
to any bill of that kind. From what my friend
from Queen's-Lunenburg said I gathered the
distinct impression that in his opinion it was
entirely outside the duty or right of a senator
to introduce legislation which might be at
variance with the policy of the Government.
To that concept, I take absolute exception.
The senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck), in the best speech I ever heard
him make, established in the most convincing
fashion, to me at least, that under the British
North America Act the Senate, like the House
of Commons, is an integral part of the Parliament of Canada, neither inferior nor superior,
but equal, with one doubtful exception,
namely, that of our inability to interfere with
financial measures.
If I believed that a majority of the members of this chamber shared the concept that
we were merely an appendage of the House
of Commons or of the administration, then

MAY 25, 1955
it would be difficult for me to defend the
continuance of the Senate as a part of the
Parliament of Canada.
The distinguished lawyer members of this
house-I need not name them, because they
are well known-have quite definitely stated
that there is no constitutional obstacle to this
bill such as was referred to by the Leader of
the Government last evening. Opinions were
expressed by the senators frorn TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen), Ottawa West (Hon. Mr. Connolly), Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris),
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden), and other distinguished and unimpeachable authorities, all
of whom say Parliament has a perfect right
to enact this bill.
Let me come to the principle involved,
which leads me to the objections that have
been advanced against the bill. There bas
been almost complete unanimity amongst all
speakers that the present practice of accumulating senatorial vacancies is wrong; I have
heard no one defend it. The speech of the
senator from Vancouver South was freely
quoted to bolster the arguments of my friend
the Leader of the Government. But the
senator from Vancouver South also said this:
Whether I agree with all the results which he-

Referring to myself.
-expects would flow from the bill, I find myself
in complete accord with every pronouncement he
made. He referred to a number of sections of the
B.N.A. Act, particularly section 32, which deals
with Senate vacancies. It reads:
When a Vacancy happens in the Senate by
Resignation, Death, or otherwise,That covers the entire field.
-the Governor General shallIt does not say "may".
Summons to a fit and qualified Person fIl
-by
the Vacancy.
No lawyer would stake his reputation upon the
proposition that this means the vacancy shall be
filled some three, five or even seven years after
it occurs. The question is entirely one of what
is a reasonable time. It cannot possibly mean an
indefinite time in the indefinite future.

I could read further along the same line,
but perhaps that is sufficient.
The Leader of the Government-who I
hope will take my remarks in good part, as
I took his-said in his speech last evening
that he would like to see the vacancies filled.
Of course he would, and so would all the
other senators who have spoken. All the
speakers and especially those who are lawyers
have said that under the present law it is
legally a neglect of duty-I do not think I
am putting it too strongly-not to fill these
vacancies within a reasonable time. Thus we
have this situation: undoubtedly, Parliament
has power to enact this proposed amendment; and eminent lawyers express the
opinion that the present law is not being

observed, in that appointments are not being
made within a reasonable time. The senator
from Inkerman made the interesting observation that while the law is there, it is not
enforceable. Presumably that is on the basis
that since appointments are made by Her
Majesty's representative, the Governor General, the well-known principle that "the
King can do no wrong" applies and the law
cannot be enforced. Not being a lawyer, I
am perhaps treading on dangerous ground
when entering this field. But it is not so long
ago that anyone who had a grievance against
the Crown or one of its representatives
could not bring an action for redress in the
courts unless the government consented and
a fiat was obtained. That practice has been
abandoned, and quite rightly so. Today any
aggrieved citizen who believes be has a
claim against the Crown can sue in the courts
without first obtaining consent. I fail to
see any distinction between that principle
and the one which would be involved upon
enactment of this bill. If this bill became
law and the Governor General were thereby
instructed to fill vacancies in the Senate
within a period of six months, why could that
law not be enforced and the vacancies filled?
After all, it is only a polite fiction to say that
the Queen fills the vacancies. Everyone knows
that no appointments are made except upon
the advice of the head of the country, the
Prime Minister. Why one cannot apply the
very same rule in this case as is now applied
when a citizen has a grievance against the
Crown, I fail to understand, and I wish
there were some opportunity for some of my
legal friends to go into that question just a
little more fully.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I ask the honourable senator a question? In the light of
what he has said I think section 20 of the
British North America Act has a good deal
of relevance, and I would like to ask him
if he has read that section.
The point I tried to make on Wednesday
last was that the bill which he has introduced could not be legally enforced, because
you cannot make the Crown do anything,
but I went on to point out, as clearly as I
could, that if a provision of that kind were
in the British North America Act it might
have considerable moral and practical effect.
Section 20 of the act reads as follows:
There shall be a Session of the Parliament of
Canada once at least in every Year, so that Twelve
Months shall not intervene between the last
Sitting of the Parliament in one Session and its
first Sitting in the next Session.

Now, legally, that provision is completely
unenforceable. It makes no provision for
penalty, and the Governor General cannot

SENATE
be forced to convene Parliament within a
year after the previous Parliament has adjourned; but from a moral and practical point
of view the effect that that provision has in
the constitution is so strong that, I think
I am right in saying, no Prime Minister and
no Government has ever tried to contravene
it since Confederation.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I thank my friend for his
interjection. In fact, we are in entire agreement. I am not questioning his legal opinion
-as I say, I am not a lawyer. I merely state
I do not see why there should be a distinction between the one case and the other. So
far as he states his opinion-and he did it
the other day very, very well-I entirely
agree with him that even if there is no
possibility of enforcing the proposed amendment if it becomes law, the moral force of
these words "within six months" in black
and white in the British North America Act
would have far greater effect than a resolution passed by this house. Knowing the
Prime Minister of Canada, for whom I have
the highest regard, I am sure that if this
time limit were inserted in section 32 or
section 24, I do not care which, he would
not dare to flout such a provision in the act.
And no future Prime Minister would dare
do such a thing. The moral force of the section would be too great to permit that, even
though in law, as I agree, the section would
not be enforceable.
So we have the strange and I say the
sorry spectacle of senators admitting that
the practice that has been followed for 25
years or more is wrong. They admit that
the law is being flouted-that word was used
by the senator from Ottawa West (Mr.
Connolly). I read his speech at noon today,
and noted that be actually advances the
idea, which I think is vicious, that because
the law cannot be enforced it can properly
and morally be neglected, disobeyed and
dishonoured. With that I do not agree, nor
does the senator from Inkerman. The latter
takes the moral view that morally there is
an obligation to carry out the law, even
though it is legally unenforceable, and for
that reason he is voting for this bill.
The suggestion was made or at least implied
by the senator from Kootenay East (Hon.
Mr. King) that I might withdraw this bill;
and before my friend does any speculating
as to whether I am going to do that may
I say to him, as a young man to an older one,
that I cannot accept his fatherly advice.
May I repeat that the senator from Ottawa
West agrees entirely with the argument of
the senator from Inkerman as to-

Hon. Mr. Connolly: Will the honourable
senator allow me to modify that statement?

Hon. Mr. Euler: I had not finished my
sentence. I was about to say that you agree
with the senator from Inkerman as to the
legality. You agree with the idea that the
practice of accumulating vacancies is wrong,
but you part company with the senator from
Inkerman on the basis that because the law
is not enforceable, one is justified in ignoring it.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Oh no, that is not what
I said last night.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am quite willing to yield
so that you can let us know just where you
do stand. As I understand your speech,
you abandon the moral view, as do some
others, and I think I may include the Leader
of the Government.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not think that
you can read that into my speech.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I will take your word for it.
I do not believe for one moment that the
Prime Minister of Canada would support
such a concept of political morality. I believe that if a definite time limit were placed
in the act in black and white no Prime
Minister would or dare to ignore it. That
is why I have not presented this matter in
the form of a resolution.
The senator from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris) said twice in his very eloquent
speech that if I had consulted him be would
have suggested that I bring this forward in
the form of a resolution. Well, I had acquainted the honourable gentleman with the
fact that I was going to present this measure
as a bill, and at that time he made no suggestion whatsoever that I should present it in
the form of a resolution.
Resolutions, they say, are made to be
broken, and the road to a certain place is
paved with good intentions.
While the
present Prime Minister might be influenced
by such a resolution, I am afraid that in
time it would be consigned to the political
ash can and we would then be exactly where
we are today.
The senator from Vancouver South, after
condemning the practice which this bill seeks
to correct, feels that the Prime Minister must
have some good reasons for not making these
appointments. He thinks that in this changing
world-I have not his exact words before me
-the Prime Minister may feel that persons
appointed should be truly representative of
all the people of Canada at the present time.
Perhaps that is so, and I could wish that it
were se, but I have been in politics long
enough to believe that that is not the compelling reason why these vacancies have been
allowed to accumulate. The chief reason is

· MAY 25, 1955
the same as the one that caused accumulations of vacancies for 25 years past, and it
cannot be denied that that reason was political in its nature. I believe most of the pressure comes from members of the other house
who would like to be promoted ta this chamber, although some of them, in their public
utterances, declare they would like it ta be
abolished. That this pressure is political, and
comes from the source I have mentioned,
was confirmed by my friend the Leader of
the Government in his eloquent speech yesterday. I hope he will not take offence if I
criticize his remarks severely. I do not want
to misquote him, but the effect of what he
said is that he thought Senate vacancies
should be left unfilled for extended periods
ta provide places for appointees from the
Commons; and that it is embarrassing ta the
Prime Minister ta make these appointments,
because they involve by-elections, which are
undesirable. I do not agree that they are undesirable. A by-election is a very good gauge
of public opinion, and it is an excellent thing
that once in a while during its tenure of
office a government shall have the opportunity of learning what the public thinks of
its actions and policies.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: But not necessarily
within six months after a vacancy.
Hon. Mr. Euler: If the Government believe
that vacancies in the other place should be
filled within a few months, why in the world
should not the same principle apply ta vacancies in the Senate?
I do not want to burden my friend the Government Leader with too many criticisms,
but I am obliged ta reply ta the speech he
made last night. From his point of view
it was a very good speech, and it was delivered with a vehemence of which I am not
at all capable.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: And for that, I do not
criticize him.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not agree with
the statement of the honourable senator.
Hon. Mr. Euler: He said that vacancies are
held open for the benefit of members of
the Commons.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not believe I
ever made that statement.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Then what did the honourable Leader say?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If my honourable
friend got that impression, it was not my
intention ta convey it.

Hon. Mr. Euler: I shall leave it ta the
judgment of the house whether or not the
thought was advanced that the Prime Minister
left some of these vacancies unfilled sa that
he could appoint men who have given good
service-perhaps, good political service, and
that their elevation ta this house involved or
might involve by-elections.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not think I said
that the Prime Minister left vacancies unfilled for any reason. I merely gave my
opinion as ta why appointments were
deferred.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I do not wish ta misrepresent my friend.
Hon. Mr. Fournier: The honourable senator,
in his version of the remarks of someone else,
is referring to a speech which has already
been printed. I think he should quote the
statement from the official record.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I will accept any denial
which the leader desires ta make. I have not
had time, since he made his rather lengthy
speech, ta read it in Hansard, but I shall do
sa. It is decidedly my impression that I have
correctly quoted him, but if he states that he
said nothing approaching it, I shall accept his
denial.
Appointments ta the Senate, if promptly
made, would enforce the holding of byelections. Perhaps this proceeding would be
undesirable from the Government's point of
view, but is not that the logical course if the
desire is that members of the House of
Commons shall be raised ta this chamber?
I believe that persans who have had experience in the other chamber, or in any legislative body, can be of great use in the Senate.
But if it is desired ta translate members of
the House of Commons into the Senate, and
without recourse to by-elections, would it not
be the logical thing ta appoint them at the
time a general election is called?
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: There might not be any
vacancies here then.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But my friend changes
ground. He made an appeal ta the Opposition
when he said that the Prime Minister was
particularly generous-and I am not quarrelling with that statement-when he went into
a general election with vacancies unfilled,
because the thought in his mind was that if
his Government were defeated and a Conservative administration took its place, the ranks
of the present Opposition here would be
increased. But that does not accord with his
previous argument: you cannot have the two
things at once.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not want ta be
represented as having said that I presume ta

SENATE

report what the Prime Minister had in mind.
1 was flot quoting him, I was merely saying
what the resuit could have been.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It may have been with a
more or less humorous intention. that my
friend held out to the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) the hope that, if his
party believed that some of these vacancies
would be filled by a Government of their
political persuasion, they would have gooci
reason to vote against the bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We did not fail for that idea,
though.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I dîd flot think for one
moment that you would.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think it was a very

sound idea.

Hon. Mr. Euler: If vacancies are left open
iii order that members of the House of Commons can be appointed, and they are not
appointed before the election, that represents
a change of pelicy. If the Liberal Government is returned to office, and the proposed
appointees are members of the House of
Commons, they cannet be transferred here,
because that would necessitate the by-electiens which, from the Government point of
view, are SO undesirable. So we go through
the dizzy round once again, and I admit that
I arn cenfused.
The real remedy, in my opinion. is te fill
vacancles within a reasonable timne after their
occurrence. Besides, if the Governent wants
to strengthen the ranks of the Opposition
here-a move te which I weuld flot objecteven though this bill is carried it will stili
have the power to appoint anyone it pleases,
whether he be a Liberal, Conservative, Social
Crediter, Socialist or anybody else; because,
as was peinted out by the senator fromn
Inkerman this bill is net retroactive; there
are now 22 vacancies; and the Prime Minister
can appoint anyone he pleases and take al
the time he likes te do so. But I would
suppose that if the present bill gees on the
statute books, and a six-month limit is set
for future appointments, hie would regard it
as pretty much of a mandate net te delay
tee long the filling of the present vacancies.
The six-month provision applies only to
future vacancies.
Seme concern has been expressed as te
what effect this bill would have upon the
public. I must say that I cannet understand
a certain remark made in this chamber last
night by the Leader of the Government.
There must be an errer in the report, which
I will read to my honourable friend:
1 hope before 1 arn through that heneurable
senators will agree with me that if ail the

vacancies had been filled our dignity flot only
would have suffered but would have been completely shattered.

He is reported te have made that remark
after saying hie was in favour of having the
vacancies filled. I think my honourable friend
must have been misreperted because the two
things do flot go together. It does not make
sense.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think it makes complete sense along with the rest of my speech.

Hon. Mr. Euler: The Leader said hie was in
favour of the vacancies being filled.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Not necessarily al
at once or within a six-rnonth period.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I arn net saying that, but
my friend said hie was in faveur of the
vacancies being filled within a reasonable
time, and when hie said if they had been
filled our dignity net only would have suffered but would have been cempletely shattered. I admit I do net understand that.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It would be cernpletely understandable if rny speech were
read in full.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Perhaps I arn a hittie duil
of comprehiension.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Oh, ne.
Hon. Mr. Euler: With regard to the effect
upon the public, I share the conviction
expressed by the senater from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden), who is net here today, that if
the bill is defeated there will be a feeling of
dismay among the people of Canada that
the Senate is indifferent te its own efficiency
and integrity. I believe that. I arn certain it
would heighten the general feeling of lack
of respect for the Senate-and it is net tee
high now-and if this sort of thing is continued indefinitely there will be a great
strengthening of the mevement, which at
presenit dees net exist te any real degree, for
abolition of the Senate itself.
The Leader of the Government says there
is ne lack of efflciency as a resuit of there
being only 80 members instead of the 102
that the constitution calls fer. He says that
the committees are working well. The senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell) made a
strong argument that there were insufficient
numbers te man ail the committees. There
is certainly truth in that.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien:
That honourable
senator is seldom here.
Hon. Mr. Euler: You had better take that
up with the senater from Toronto. Some
members serve on five, six and even seven

MAY 25, 1955
committees, and the meetings of these committees frequently conffict. Only this morning our most important committee, the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce,
could not start functioning for about twenty
minutes because of lack of a quorum.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: How many constitute
a quorum?
Hon. Mr. Euler: My friend knows that.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There are 80 senators
here, so I do not know why that committee
could not get a quorum.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Well, it didn't.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I would point out that this
morning the Banking and Commerce Committee was dealing with a private bill while
the Committee on the Narcotic Drug Traffic
was hearing an important witness from
Lexington, Kentucky.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Eighty members might
do a pretty good job, but does anyone believe
that the addition of twenty-two capable
persons would not improve the quality and
efficiency of this body? I say that with all
due respect to those of us who are here.
Hon. Mr. Golding: I wonder if my honourable friend realizes that some members are
named to only one or two committees.
Hon. Mr. Bradette: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Who is to blame for that?
I would say that the Committee of Selection
should be asked to change its ways.
Hon. Mr. Golding: It is onlyThe Hon. the Speaker: I would point out
to honourable senators that they cannot interrupt the speaker to ask a question without
first getting his permission to do so.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I shall leave that point.
I come now to what I believe is the real
reason for the opposition to this bill. It is the
feeling that the bill is embarrassing to the
Prime Minister.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Howard: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I want to make it
perfectly clear that I never intended to leave
that impression.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I say that is the real
reason for the opposition to the bill. My
friend from Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard)
has just admitted it.

take a "crack" at the Prime Minister. That
is a vulgar statement, and I desire to contradict it with all the emphasis at my command. I have every regard for the Prime
Minister and every sympathy for the troubles
that bedevil him at this and all times.
I have already said, and I want to emphasize it, that this bill, instead of embarrassing
him, would ultimately, after the present
vacancies are filled, make embarrassments
impossible, because there could never be any
more great accumulations of vacancies.
I admit, of course, that the purpose which
the Leader advocates, of holding Senate
appointments open for deserving members
from the Commons, would not be served, but
perhaps that would not be an unmixed evil
and would surely be a relief to the Prime
Minister himself.
Some reference has been made to the fact
that parts of the country are now unrepresented in the Senate. There are nine vacancies in the Maritimes representation, and
those provinces certainly would not have come
into Confederation if they had not been
assured of the representation which the constitution assures them. Quebec has seven
vacancies, nearly 30 per cent of the number
to which it is entitled.
Some solemn observations have been made
as to the "sacredness" of the constitution, and
it has been suggested that unholy hands
should not be laid upon it. Well, perhaps I
am not greatly impressed by things that are
gone before, for I do not feel that a thing
should be regarded as sacred just because it
is eighty years old. My reply would be that
as the Sabbath was made for mañ, not man
for the Sabbath, so the constitution was made
for the benefit of the Canadian people and
it should be amended if changing circumstances or certain conditions demand it.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Euler: The Leader of the Government, in closing, summed up his opposition
First, the bill has no legal

enforceable effect.
Supposing I admit that, he thus ignores
entirely the moral effect, which is often of
greater significance amongst honest people
than the letter of the law.
Secondly, he quoted the senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) as still having
some doubt about the constitutional aspect.
Parenthetically, I might say that I am not
quite sure that the senator frorn Vancouver
South presented that doubt with any great
Hon. Mr. Howard: Yes.
forcefulness. But, in any event, against that
Hon. Mr. Euler: The other day I heard an we have the opinions of such lawyers as the
observation, which I am sure was meant for senators from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
my ears, that the bill is intended merely to Roebuck), Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen),

SENATE

Ottawa West (Hon. Mr. Connolly), Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden), and Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Campbell); and it was not denied by the
Leader himself (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) who
also is a lawyer.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Not the honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden), or
at least I did not gather that.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I have enough authority,
anyway. I do not like to overlook anyone,
and I hope I have not done so. I cannot,
of course, include my friend from Calgary
(Hon. Mr. Ross).
Then there was the Leader's statement that
there is no impairment of efficiency because of
the vacancies, but I have dealt with that
already.
Fourthly-and I think this has very little
strength-he suggested that the proposed
amendment is to the wrong section of the
B.N.A. Act: that it should be to section 32
instead of to section 24. Well, I do not care
which section is amended; the effect would be
exactly the same; and I am assured by the
gentlemen who drew up the bill for me that
the amendment is made in the proper form.
Finally, apart from all arguments, legal
and otherwise, the Senate is faced with this
undeniable fact: Section 32 of the constitution
is being violated; the law is now being
broken, and has been broken for years. Yet
some members take the remarkable position
that that is apparently quite ethical because
the law cannot bo enforced, because of the
polite fiction that the King can do no wrong.
Well, they must vote either to condone what
is contrary to the B.N.A. Act, or else to
vindicate the responsibility, the integrity and
the good repute of the Senate throughout
Canada. And who has in fact any greater
responsibility than members of this body to
preserve its responsibility, integrity and good
repute in the minds of the people of this
country?
I believe that if honourable senators will
face the real issue without prejudice, if they
will face the moral issue fairly and squarely,
they will in duty support this bill.
In conclusion, may I say that I have been
in public life for a long time, and I am not
easily shocked; but without in any sense
adopting what might be called a "holier than
thou" attitude. I just cannot help being
genuinely shocked that some members of this
house put themselves before the people of
Canada in supporting the principle, or lack

of principle, that something which is morally
wrong is justified by the fact that no one can
be punished for doing it, because of some
peculiar quirk in the interpretation of the
law. Each member of the Senate is the
keeper of his own conscience, and mine is
genuinely shocked by the thought that this
honourable chamber is setting so bad an
example to the people of this country.

acquainting him that the Honourable Patrick
Kerwin, Chief Justice of Canada, acting as
Deputy of His Excellency the Governor

CANADIAN

FORCES BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. John J. Connolly moved the second
reading of Bill 257, an Act respecting the
Canadian Forces.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
follows the pattern set in the last four years
when single acts were passed to amend
various statutes affecting the defence forces
of Canada. This is in the nature of a statute
law amending bill, and in other years sometimes four and five statutes affecting the
forces were amended by an act of this character. This year two acts only are being
amended: the first thirteen clauses of the bill
amend the National Defence Act, and the
remaining twelve clauses amend the Defence
Services Pension Act.

541

Last year I had the privilege of explaining
Bill 80, an Act respecting the Canadian
Forces, and at that time some objection was
taken to the practice of amending several
acts by one bill. However, in justification of
the continuation of this practice it should be
said that it is easier for people interested in
legislation affecting the forces to go to these
annual law amending statutes to find the
various changes that occur from year to year.
Also, I am informed by officials of the Judge
Advocate General's Branch that these statutes
are not of much wider significance or interest
than for people in the services, so perhaps
there is some justification of the practice,
although I say that by way of explaining it
rather than of justifying it.
I think it might be most helpful if I
explained this bill section by section, because
all the sections are disconnected one from
another, unlike a new piece of legislation in
which one principle is embodied.
Section 2 provides authority for a man to
be reinstated in one of the branches of the
armed services without any break in his
service, if after there has been a break in his
service as a result of a decision by a service
or a civilian court that decision of the lower
court is reversed by a higher court. What
is now proposed is that if a man is dismissed
as a result of a decision of a lower court, the
fact that he is dismissed means that his
service is broken. If later another court
reversed that decision, there is no authority
whatever to enable him to pick up the
service, to dispense with the break in the
service. In other words, he may now pick
up his service where he should have picked
it up after dismissal which resulted from the
decision of the court that apparently was
not warranted. It seems to be a fair amendment to make, and I think it would be
accepted, generally.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask my honourable
friend a question? The bill states that reinstatement may be made as the result of a
decision by an appellate ýcourt "or other
competent authority". What is the other competent authority?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: I wonder if my honourable friend would ask that question in committee, if the bill is referred to a committee.
Frankly, I cannot answer his question. I
would think that normally the court martial
appeal board would be a competent authority,
but it is in the nature of an appellate court.
Certainly, if the original trial took place in
the civil courts, only an appellate court of
higher jurisdiction could pronounce the decision of the lower court to be wrong.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is there not an appeal
from the service court to the Supreme Court
of Canada in some cases?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Yes, there is an appeal
in a great many cases to the Supreme Court
of Canada. However, I am afraid that still
does not supply the answer to the question
of my honourable friend from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar), because in such cases the Supreme Court of Canada would be an appellate
court. My honourable friend from Churchill is
concerned as to who other than an appellate
court could reverse the decision of a lower
court. I am afraid I cannot answer that question, but I think officials of the Judge Advocate General's Branch could do so.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Is there anything in the
army regulations which permits a soldier to
be suspended instead of being dismissed pending the outcome of an appeal of a judgment
against him by a lower court? What happens
if his appeal is successful?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: I suppose that would
be a matter of service discipline. However,
I think the problem my honourable friend
has in mind is cured by the provision that
if a soldier is dismissed from service because
of an erroneous decision of a lower court,
which is later reversed on appeal to a higher
court, he is absolved from the effect of the
original judgment. Heretofore it bas been
provided that upon conviction if he was dismissed from the service he could not be reestablished and have his service dated back
to the time of his dismissal, even if the decision causing his dismissal was reversed by
a higher court. By this amendment, the man
would receive fair treatment if the adverse
decision of a lower court is in due time corrected by a higher court.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The new subsection 4 in
section 2 of the bill contains these words ". . .
transferred from one component to another
May I ask whether "component" is the
proper word as used by the military authorities in the case of transfer from one branch to
another?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: It means, I think, transferred from one establishment to another. The
word "component" is frequently used in the
National Defence Act and is given a specific
meaning in the definition section.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Would not the term
"competent authority" sometimes mean a
commanding officer? The decision of a court
martial is. I think, frequently reviewed by

the higher officers of a unit. In those circumstances "competent authority" might not
mean a court at all, but simply a higher
officer.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: That may well be the
answer to the question asked by my honourable friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar),
and I thank the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) for mentioning it. The reason I hesitated to give
an answer of that character is that, quite
frankly, I am a little shocked that a decision
of a court should be overruled by any body
but another court. However, I think the officials of the Judge Advocate General's Branch
will have a full explanation to off er on that
point.
Section 3 of the bill deals with the case of
a man who is officially discharged and legally
out of the service, and is later arrested for
an offence which he committed within the
service. He of course would be subject to the
military law in so far as the definition of
the offence is concerned, but while he is under
arrest, as provided by this section, he becomes
subject to service discipline from the time of
his arrest until the case is disposed of. That
appears to me to be a fair provision, because
the man would be in service custody at
that time.
Section 4 has this explanation: At the
present time the period within which a charge
may be laid before a service tribunal is
three years. There are times when charges
cannot be laid because of the fact that the
accused is a prisoner of war, is in desertion,
or is serving a sentence other than in a service place of detention. This section provides
that any of those periods of time are not
to count against the period of three years.
Obviously the section will not apply to the
situation where a man is in a place of
service detention, because there is no reason
in the world why the service could not take
him out of service detention and try him
before a service tribunal. But in all these
other cases he is pretty well beyond the
reach of service authorities, so he cannot be
charged.
Section 5 is designed to make the definition
of "insanity" in section 126 of the National
Defence Act accord with the definition in
section 16 of the Criminal Code. There is
a word that is wrong in the Defence Act
section. It should be corrected, and that
is the purpose of that amendment.
The Hon. the Speaker: May I appeal to
honourable senators to refrain from carrying
on audible conversation while an honourable
member is speaking?
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

MAY 26, 1955
The Hon. the Speaker: It is not only
exceedingly poor parliamentary practice but
it is a distinct lack of courtesy to the honourable senator who is speaking and to those
who are interested in hearing what he is
saying. I am sure honourable senators will
co-operate in this matter.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Honourable senators,
section 6 is a little more complicated, perhaps, than the ones I have been dealing
with so far. At the present time under the
National Defence Act a man can be held
in detention for 28 days, and before the
28-day period elapses he can be brought out
of detention and then put back into detention
again for another 28 days, and he cannot complain. This situation is now to be corrected.
Under the amendment he will be able to
petition the Minister after he has been in
detention for 28 days, and the minister is
required to show cause as to why he should
be continued in detention. The minister can
keep him in detention if he so desires for
a period up to 90 days and even longer,
but he must give reasons for so doing.
Section 7 is also a rather significant section. At the present time the Judge Advocate,
who participates in the work of the court
martial, is an adviser only to the court;
he is not a member of the court, he is not
a judge. Now it is proposed by this amendment that he become a judge of the court,
and in fact master of the law; and his position at a court martial will be relatively
the same as that of a judge who sits with
a jury. I may say that according to the
information supplied to me this provision of
law is now in force in the United Kingdom
and in the United States.
Here is something else which I think will
interest honourable senators. It is proposed
that hereafter when a point of law pure and
simple is to be raised at a court martial it
will be heard by the Judge Advocate
General's representative at that court, but
apart from the other members of the court.
In other words the other members of the
court will be in the position of a jury: they
will retire during consideration of the point
of law by the Judge Advocate, and then
will reassemble with him, much as is done
in civil courts in a civil trial.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: How far does that go?
I raise that point because there are many
mixed questions of law and fact. If it is a
question of law and fact does the Judge
Advocate become the sole judge and do the
other members of the court stand aside?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: I would think that the
rules applicable in similar cases in the civil
courts should apply..

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does the bill say that?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: No, it does not say that.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well,Hon. Mr. Connolly: Perhaps I might add
this: the section is a very important one.
I think it is a great improvement on the old
system, but the machinery for carrying it
out is something to which the committee
might give serious consideration when the
representatives of the Judge Advocate
General's Branch come before it.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask the honourable senator a question? I did not quite
catch what he said about referring this bill
to committee, but I assume his purpose is,
if the bill is given second reading, to move
for reference to the appropriate committee?
I am also wondering if my honourable friend
is acquainted with the very thorough and
long discussion that took place in committee
at the time the National Defence Act was
being revised and set forth anew. A great
deal of attention, as I recall it, was then
paid to the very points that my honourable
friend is mentioning now. I do not think he
was a member here at that time, but the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) was very active in dealing with these matters which would assure
to everyone in the forces who came under
this section the right not only to have the
same procedure as in a civil court, but also
the right to appeal to a civil tribunal as well.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: As a matter of fact, I
think that some of the discussion which took
place then resulted in the establishment of
that very necessary addition to the service
legal procedure, namely, the Court Martial
Appeal Board, which has been a most useful,
a most salutary, instrument to assure fairness and justice in dealing with service
offences and offenders.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does the section make
the Judge Advocate the final decider of
questions of law? It says this:
Where a judge advocate has been appointed to
officiate at a court martial, he may, in such
circumstances and subject to such conditions and
procedures as are prescribed in regulations made
by the Governor in Council, determine questions
of law arising before or after the commencement of
the trial.

That would seem to make him the arbiter
of all questions that he determines are questions of law. In the civil courts the judge
determines whether a question is one of
fact or law, and if he determines it is of law
he then proceeds to decide it. Does this provision make the Judge Advocate a judge of
all questions of law, setting aside all other
members of the court?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Yes, I understand that
is the proposal.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is a serious proposal.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Yes, I think it is a
serious proposal. There is of course this
further point to take into account: that now,
with the establishment of the Court Martial
Appeal Board, where the Judge Advocate
goes down the wrong path he becomes subject
to correction by that board. Moreover, it is
proposed to make regulations, and probably
within the scope of those regulations certain
restrictions will be laid down under which
he will act. I would not attempt to anticipate
what is in the mind of the honourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), but I would assume, because this is
in my own mind: he may think it a questionable procedure to lay down such rules by
way of regulations rather than by statute. I
think perhaps that is something the committee
might very well direct its attention to when
this section is being discussed.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The rules they may
possibly lay down are not before us now, and
therefore we must proceed in disregard of
them, assuming that there will be no regulations until we know that there are regulations.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Section 8 permits the
Minister to make a finding which is warranted
by the evidence given before a service
tribunal, to correct what is considered to be
an illegal finding. There is one restriction
upon the power of the Minister in this case,
and that is that under no circumstances, when
he makes a finding warranted by the evidence, can he increase the sentence that was
awarded by the court. For example, if a
man were accused of theft, the ordinary elements of theft that are set out in the Criminal
Code would apply, and if upon review the
Minister found that one of the essential elements of theft was not present, he might
properly come to the conclusion that the
charge of theft was not proved. But if the
accused was obviously in possession of service
equipment or service property, the evidence
might very well warrant a finding that he
should be found guilty of a charge "to the
prejudice of good order and service discipline", or perhaps, a charge of "being in
possession" of such property. In a case like
that, the Minister would be entitled to find
him guilty of the alternate charge, but he
could not increase any sentence imposed.
Section 9 permits the Minister to order a
new trial in cases where proceedings are
irregular. It also permits him to dispense
with a new trial which may have been
ordered by the Court Martial Appeal Board.

There are times when a new trial has been
ordered by the Court Martial Appeal Board
arising out of offences committed abroad by
troops where witnesses were foreign civilians
or servicemen serving abroad, and perhaps
not in the Canadian forces. Sometimes it is
impossible to secure a witness again for a
new trial, even though the Court Martial
Appeal Board has ordered a new trial. This
clause permits the Minister, in such cases,
which are extreme cases, to dispense with the
holding of the new trial, if such a decision
is warranted.
Section 10 deals with suspended sentences.
Long sentences, that is to say sentences of
over thirty days imposed upon a serviceman,
expire at the end of their term, if they are
suspended. Shorter sentences, that is to say
sentences of thirty days or less, may be kept
in suspension in the services for a year. This
povision is particularly applicable to the
Navy, where a man might be convicted
aboard a ship at sea of some service offence
and awarded a punishment of, perhaps, ten
days. Obviously at sea, especially in small
ships, it is not always possible to have him
serve that sentence. It is therefore suspended,
and he might be required to serve it ashore
if his commanding officer or the appropriate
authdrity should decide that should be done.
A short term suspended sentence can be held
over a man's head for a year; the longer
sentences expire at the end of their own
period.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Is there no place aboard a
ship to confine a man for ten or twenty days?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: There may be places
in some of the larger ships where that can
be done, but in some of the smaller shipsminesweepers, corvettes, and some of the
smaller escorts-it would be very difficult
indeed to find a place of detention.
Section 11 simply provides that the chairman of the Court Martial Appeal Board
may delegate his powers and functions.
As honourable senators know, Mr. Justice
Cameron is chairman of the court; he is also
one of the very busy judges of the Exchequer
Court of Canada, and as this is a circuit
court he is away a great deal. There are
other members of the court who live in
Ottawa. Chambers motions and applications
of various kinds could properly be heard by
members other than the chairman, and it is
now proposed that such other members be
permitted to substitute for him.
Section 12 is purely a procedural provision.
It provides that when the Court Martial
Appeal Board orders a new trial it must in
its order set aside the finding of guilty which
was made the first time.

MAY 26, 1955
Section 13 is, perhaps, an interesting clause:
it deals with the exemption of members of
the forces from execution of judgments of
the civil courts. It is now proposed to limit
this exemption to service equipment. In
other words, the civilian goods of servicemen
are now available to execution by their
creditors. Under this section, also, servicemen can now be summoned as witnesses in
civil cases before the civil courts. This provision is contained in comparable United
Kingdom legislation.
Section 14 provides that a civilian who is
abroad with the forces shall be subject to
the civil courts for crimes committed by him
when he is so abroad. This is a rather practical provision, because there are now, I am
informed, some 3,700 dependents of servicemen who are with the forces outside of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Is action not taken abroad
against servicemen for crimes committed by
them abroad?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Yes, indeed, but this
section applies to civilians who are abroad
with the forces. It simply specifies that a
civilian will be subject to trial by the civil
courts, under civil law, for any crimes committed by him or her when abroad.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does section 14 set
aside the jurisdiction of the court abroad
and transfer that jurisdiction to a territorial
division within Canada?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: I understand that as
far as possible the policy is that civilians
abroad with the forces will come under the
jurisdiction of courts in Canada rather than
courts in a foreign country. This policy would
not apply to minor offences such as traffic
violations, and so on.
The Visiting Forces Act which is a
part of the NATO set-up deals more fully
with the subject that the honourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinity has mentioned. My
understanding of section 14 is that when
Canadian civilians abroad with our forces
commit crimes it is preferable to have them
dealt with by Canadian courts under Canadian law.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I point out that
this is a remarkable provision and sets a
precedent of great note. It has been the rule
in Canada since Confederation to assume that
our jurisdiction ends at the three-mile or
seven-mile limit. It was not until the Statute
of Westminster was passed that we thought
our Parliament had any jurisdiction to legislate for offences committed abroad. For that
reason there is a clause in the Criminal Code
providing that in certain cases bigamy is
50437-35

leaving Canada for the purpose of committing
bigamy abroad. It does not say that bigamy
abroad is an offence in Canada. This is the
first time I have seen legislation of this
character wherein we are exercising the
powers that came to us under the Statute
of Westminster to legislate against an offence
committed abroad; so I think it is a
precedent.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: I thank the honourable
gentleman for his observation. I think this
section too will make an interesting subject
for discussion in committee.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Very.
Hon. zar. Bouffard: May I ask the honourable senator a question? This section does
not provide that civilian courts abroad shall
not have jurisdiction over a civilian accompanying Canadian forces abroad, so such a
person may be charged with an offence abroad
or in Canada. In a case of that kind who
will decide which court is to try the accused?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Certainly the offender
could not be tried and punished by both
courts. In view of the discussion we have
had on this section I wonder if we might
leave it for further consideration in committee? Would honourable senators agree to that
procedure? I think the section has been well
pointed up.
I come now to the proposed amendments to
the Defence Services Pensions Act. Section
15 of the bill inserts a new section in the act,
section 31A similar to section 12 (4) of the
Public Service Superannuation Act which the
Senate considered some weeks ago. It provides that a common law wife who has been
living with a serviceman for seven years
before his death becomes eligible, provided
one of the parties is married, to receive his
pension in the same way as a wife. If they
are both unmarried the seven-year period
does not apply and the length of time required to establish the status of the common
law wife and her eligibility for pension is at
the discretion of the Treasury Board.
The section also provides for the case of a
widow who is living apart from ber husband,
who is a service man and a pensioner, under
circumstances in the province where the
domicile is which would disentitle her to
alimony. Because she is living apart from
her husband she is deemed in these circumstances to have predeceased ber husband, thus
allowing the children to acquire pension
rights.
Hon. Mr. Reid: This is going quite a long
way.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Connolly: There are precedents for
this. Before the Easter recess the Senate
dealt with a bill similar in principle to this
one.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Your explanation would lead
us to believe that this section applies to everyone in the military forces, but as I read the
section it applies only to officers. Why does
it apply to officers and not to the average rank
and file? It puts the officer's widow or his
common law wife in a class by herself.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: It is not my understanding that the section is so restricted.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is the way it reads"If, upon the death of an officer or former
officer-".
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Here again I am unable
to give a full explanation. I agree that this
section does amend the provision with reference to officers, and perhaps I should have
anticipated this difficulty. There may be another section applicable to other ranks. However, the questions that have been asked
demonstrate the value of discussing the bill
section by section. The honourable gentleman frorn New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid)
has raised a most valid point.
Hon. Mr. Reid: What is meant by the words,
"been maintained and publicly represented
by that officer as his wife"? A service man
could not very well announce that the woman
he is living with is his common law wife.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: The circumstances
would dictate what discretion would have to
be exercised by the board which administers
this section. There is of course no document
which can establish the position of the common law wife. This must arise from the
circumstances.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I think we are going a long
way.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: That may very well be.
Of course, the second part of the section is
intended to be for the relief of children.
Section 16 provides that service pensioners
who re-enroll in the service after June 30,
1950, can acquire the benefits of the Defence
Services Pension Act. Of itself that does not
mean too much, but formerly only service
pensioners who re-enrolled after March 4,
1954, could acquire the benefits of this act.
The purpose of the amendment is to entitle
people who enlisted for the Korean service,
and who later left the forces, to acquire the
benefits of the act should they re-enroil in
the service.
Section 17 is a simple section, which merely
requires that a witnessed statement as to
the continued existence of a person entitled

to a pension be accepted as evidence of the
person's continued existence, instead of
requiring a statutory declaration. I am informed that both the Treasury Board and the
service people who administer this section of
the act feel that to require a statutory
declaration in cases of this kind entails
expense, and perhaps causes inconvenience
to a great many people.
I come now to section 18. After a man
has served for a certain length of time in
one of the services he becomes eligible for a
pension under the Defence Services Pension
Act. From one year after the date of his
eligibility, he is entitled to join the pension
plan. It is now proposed that that period
be extended indefinitely. In other words, he
shall be eligible to join the pension plan at
any time while he is in the service, subject
to a medical examination and subject to his
making the contribution for past service.
I think I should direct the attention of
honourable senators to a difference between
this section of the Defence Services Pension
Act and section 24 of the Public Service
Superannuation Act. Under section 24 of the
Public Service Superannuation Act it is
spelled out in detail what the contribution
shall be, but under section 18 of the Defence
Services Pension Act that is to be fixed by
order in council. I think that might very
well be a subject of inquiry if the bill goes
to committee.
Section 19 provides that these pension
rights shall apply only to the regular forces
and not to the reserve forces.
Section 20 provides that regardless of the
amount of the pension received by a
pensioner or his dependents, the minimum
recoverable will bo the amount of his contribution. This, of course, is a benefit to the
widow and to the children. The pensioner
will be sure they or his estate will get back
at least everything he paid in.
Section 21 deals with a situation where a
man might become eligible for a pension,
partly under the Public Service Superannuation Act, partly under the defence
forces plan, or partly under the Royal Canadian Mounted Police pension plan. This
section simply says that he can count one
period of service under any plan but once.
Section 22 provides that where a contributor has served in the forces for a period
of less than ten years and a gratuity only is
payable to him, the gratuity can be paid
after approval by the Treasury Board only,
and without reference either to the Service
Pension Board or to the Judge Advocate
General.
The remaining sections 23, 24 and 25 make
amendments to Part V of the Defence Services Pension Act, to bring it in line with

MAY 26, 1955
Parts I to III, which provide for pensions
granted under the pre-war pension plan.
Part V provides for pensions under the new
act, that is, the post-war pension plan. These
three sections make the comparable provisions in the second plan agree with those in
the first.
Honourable senators, I have burdened the
Senate with this tedious explanation. It is
very difficult to explain a bill of this character without dealing with it section by
section. Had I done otherwise the explanation would have been completely unintelligible.
If the bill receives second reading I shall
move that it be referred to the Banking and
Commerce Committee.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I wish to compliment the honourable
gentleman from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Connolly)
upon his excellent explanation of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: At the same time, I
would like to commend it to the grave and
careful attention of honourable senators in
committee, for I have no doubt it will be
referred to a committee. The act is virtually
the Criminal Code for the Canadian forces.
The Canadian forces include the three armed
services, the Navy, the Air Force and the
Army. The act was discussed in this bouse
two or three years ago with very great care,
and a subcommittee was appointed, of which
I was a member, and again it was studied
very carefully. In fact, it was before us for
all of one session, and we so tore it to pieces
that it was decided to rewrite the whole act.
A bill setting out the act in a very different
form was introduced at the next session, and
we carefully studied that bill also in committee and made quite a number of revisions.
Honourable senators, I suggest that if this
bill goes to a committee it should also be
referred to a sub-committee for study so that
all its implications may be known before the
committee reports back to this bouse. For
instance, I observe amendments which give
certain additional powers to some officials,
who no doubt had a great deal to do with
the drawing of these amendments. It is not
unusual for departments to seek further
powers for certain officials, is it? One should
always look at such amendments, not exactly
with suspicion, but with a good deal of care.
I shall be satisfied if the bill receives second
reading, but only on the understanding that
it go to the Banking and Commerce Committee, as the honourable gentleman suggested,
and that the committee give it very careful
study.

The motion was agreed to, and the bill

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
On motion of Hon. Mr. Connolly, the bill

Banking and Commerce.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 3
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 413, an Act for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for
the public service of the financial year ending the 31st March, 1956.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
this is the interim supply bill making provision for one-twelfth of the total sums to be
spent during the current year, together with
one-twelfth of certain additional sums. With
the consent of the house I would move that
the bill be read a second time now.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,.
when the Leader of the Government makes
such a request to this house it is usual to
give an assurance that immediate passage of
the bill will not in any way affect the discussion which may take place on these items
at a later date. I presume we have that
assurance now.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am glad the honourable senator has reminded me that an undertaking is usually given. I have prepared an
undertaking similar to that which I gave at
the end of March when the first interim supply for the current fiscal year was being
considered in this house: The usual undertaking is given that the passage of this bill
will not in any way prejudice the rights and'
privileges of honourable senators to criticize
and discuss any item in the estimates which
might come up from time to time throughout
the remainder of the session. Such rights and
privileges will be respected and will not be
curtailed or restricted in any way as a result
of this measure having been passed.
I now give that undertaking.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The honourable Leader bas
told the house that this bill deals not with
the whole estimates, but with only onetwelfth of them. I would point out to him
that the total amount of the vote referred
to in the schedule to the bill is $3,122,487.50,

SENATE
and it would appear that this amount goes
almost entirely to one department, namely,
Mines and Technical Surveys.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My introductory remarks were perhaps not very clear. What I
meant to say was that the bill votes onetwelfth of the whole estimates, with an
additional one-twelfth of the estimates for
two departments-Mines and Technical Surveys, and Veterans Affairs. As honourable
senators know, the Department of Mines and
Technical Surveys incurs large expenditures
at this time of the year on survey parties
and various special services. As to the
Department of Veterans Affairs, honourable
senators will recall that earlier this year
Parliament amended the War Veterans'
Allowance Act to provide for payment of
increased allowances to veterans qualified
for them. The increase in that respect which
this house has already approved accounts for
the additional one-twelfth now being asked
for.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Do I understand that the
net total of $3,122,487.50 given at the bottom
of the schedule is included in the total figure
of $37,469,850 shown in the second column?
I must say these figures are always confusing to me.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The amounts which
this bill would grant are $257,705,895.34 plus
$3,122,487.50. I assure my honourable friend
from New Westminster that as a fellow Scot
I also find these large sums baffling.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourabe senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
as it is intended that the Royal Assent be
given this afternoon to certain other bills,
may I have the unanimous consent of the
bouse to move that this bill be now read a
third time?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Then I so move.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, before the bill is given third reading I should
like to say that I hope the next supply bill,
which will come to us near the end of June
and will be the final supply bill this sessionHon. Mr. Macdonald: I hope so.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -will reach us further in
advance of the date on which we are expected to consider it than this one did. I was
able to give my consent to three readings

of this bill today because it was very kindly
placed in my hands three or four days ago
and I have had an opportunity to study it.
All members of this house should have at
least four or five days to study a supply
bill before we are asked to consider it. I am
sure I need only remind the Leader of the
Government of our wishes in this respect,
and he will do his utmost to have future
supply bills reach us as early as possible.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I will do my best to
present the next supply bill to the house as
early as possible.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
PRIVATE BILL
CONSOLIDATED PIPE LINES COMPANYSECOND READING

Hon. John J. Connolly (for Hon. Mr.
Hayden) moved the second reading of Bill
C-14, an Act to incorporate Consolidated
Pipe Lines Company.
He said: Honourable senators, I have been
asked by the honourable senator from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) to give a brief explanation
of this bill.
The bill is drawn in the form of similar
pipe lines bills. I have noticed that the other
house usually amends section 5 to provide
that the main trunk line shall be built entirely within Canada. That provision is
not in this bill and perhaps that is a matter
which should be considered in committee.
Apart from that the form of this bill
is simply an enabling bill to permit these
people to go before the Board of Transport
Commissioners to get authority to build a
specific project. That is all that is being
asked. The applicants will be here before
the committee to explain the specific purpose
that they have in mind.
They are all Canadians; they are oil and
gas people, and contractors, who, I am informed, have had considerable experience
with pipe line construction and operation.
At the present time, within the province
of Alberta, they operate an organization
called Consolidated Gathering Systems. They
have built pipe lines, I am informed, to small
communities, between oil fields and gas fields,
and they build feeder lines to main trunk
lines.
I understand further that their project is
by no means an attempt to interfere with or
to be competitive with any of the main transcontinental gas or oil pipe lines. Apparently
there is some requirement, for the proper
operation of the company or of their work,
shall I say, that in certain cases they cross the
boundary line between Alberta and British
Columbia on one side or between Alberta

by a member of that house that they are
going to amend every pipe line bill in this
fashion. It seems to me that the Senate
should have a conference with the Commons
to ascertain whether they want all pipe lines

I think the bills as we have passed them are
preferable. In any event, Parliament cannot
give authority to build in the United States.
If the House of Commons is going to insist

members of the committee did not think that
this proposal should be adopted at the present time: there were suggestions that some
members of the armed forces do not want
to be subject to it; and the proposal was put
forward that if they are to be eligible for
benefits under the act they should make contributions in the same manner as persons in
regular civilian employment. However, as
members of the committee were uncertain
whether this course would be acceptable to
members of the forces, it was decided to
obtain an expression of their views through
inquiries by the Department of National
Defence. I am informed that these proceedings are now under way.
I do not think there are any other features
of this bill to which I need draw attention. I
recommend it to the serious consideration
of the house.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: As inquiries are being
made, would it not be well to retain the
present provision until the reports come in?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: These inquiries may
take some time, and I do not think it would
be fair, in inviting men to join the armed
forces after July 1, to hold out as a possibility
the benefits I have referred to; it would be
better first to determine definitely whether
it is the wish of the service men that this
provision be continued. We propose to eliminate it, but if, upon inquiry, it appears that
the armed forces personnel want it retained,
there would be no difficulty about reintroducing it and making it retroactive.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: With leave, next

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Oh, no. Representations

mind with regard to it. I think the bill

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have no objection.

PRIVATE BILL
DOMINION GENERAL LIFE INSURANCE
COMPANY-SECOND READING
Hon. Salter A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill W-14, an Act to incorporate
Dominion General Life Insurance Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the people
who are promoting this bill incorporated
through Parliament, in 1945, Dominion General Benefit Association, as a fraternal benefit
society, and they carried on the business of
life insurance and personal accident and sickness insurance. Having operated for some
ten years, they are feeling the pains of
growth, and are now applying to Parliament
to be incorporated as a joint stock company,
so that they may carry on the same lines of
business in a larger way.
There is a special clause in the bill which
provides that this joint stock company, when
incorporated, will take over the assets, operations and liabilities of Dominion General
Benefit Association.
The form of the bill, which is usual for
bills of this kind, has been approved by the
Superintendent of Insurance. The capital
with which it is proposed to carry on insurance operations has also been approved by
the Superintendent. I should add that there
have been indications of objection to the
name, Dominion General Life Insurance Company and I am authorized to state that in
committee the sponsors will withdraw any

be objectionable and propose a name entirely

GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES
COMPENSATION BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson moved the
second reading of Bill 188, an Act to amend
the Government Employees Compensation
Act.
She said: Honourable senators, this bill is
an amendment to the Government Employees
Compensation Act which was passed in 1918.
It was introduced because of representations
by employees of the former Canadian Government Railways which is now an integral
part of the Canadian National Railways. After
a number of amendments had been made a
new act was passed, in 1947, which did not
change any of the basic principles.
The act provides for compensation and
medical aid to employees of the Government
of Canada should they become incapacitated
through occupational accidents or disease.
The act, which of course applies only to
persons employed by the Government of
Canada, protects them if an accident or an
illness suffered by any such person is due to
or arises out of his or her duties as an employee. It applies to both temporary and
permanent employees.
This legislation does for employees of the
Government of Canada what provincial workmen's compensation legislation does for employees of private industry. You may be
interested, honourable senators, to know that
as of this date the act covers 205,000 persons,
including slightly more than 20,000 employed
by Crown corporations, boards and commissions and other similar Government agencies.
The sole principle underlying the whole
act is to place employees of the Crown in
a position comparable to that of employees
of private industry in relation to compensation for injury or disease which arises out
of their employment. All the provinces have
such legislation as this, but as provision for
payment of compensation to workers or
to their dependents in case of injury or
death in the course of their employment is
a matter of civil right, under section 92 of
the British North America Act, such legislation is within the jurisdiction of the provinces
and therefore is not applicable to the Crown
in right of Canada nor to employees of the
Crown in right of Canada.
Under provisions of the act of 1947 the
provincial workmen's compensation boards

have, by arrangement, handled as agents for
the federal Government the adjudication of
claims of employees under the federal act,
and it is intended that they shall continue to
do so. The amendments contained in the
present bill are proposed only because it is
believed that the result will be better service
to the employees and an improved administration of the act.
It seems to me, after studying the bill, that
the amendments proposed fall under five main
points:
First, that the compensation shall be at the
rate effective in the province in which the
injured person is normally employed. Under
the present act the rate is that of the province
in which the injury takes place or the occupational disease is contracted.
Second, the bill will include coverage of
persons in government employ who are not
paid by direct salaries or wages.
Third, employees of Canada assigned to
foreign parts will be covered and will be paid
according to the compensation rate in the
province of Ontario.
Fourth, locally-engaged employees in Canadian offices abroad, as in our embassies, will
be recognized, and provision will be made for
payment to them in case of injury or disease.
Fifth, through the bill changes will be made
in the subrogation provisions of the act, which
I shall outline in more detail when I refer to
particular sections.
Probably there are some other provisions
which should be mentioned; and I think that
chief amongst them is a provision that the
minister may permit and encourage accident
prevention measures and may encourage
safety programs amongst the people who are
employed in the Civil Service. Accident prevention, of course, bas been promoted in the
past, but it is hoped that, after the passage
of this bill, a more cohesive effort will be
exerted and that all departments will be
more apt to co-operate.
It may be interesting to mention that last
year-that is, in 1954-55-there were 15,690
claims, by and on behalf of employees of the
Government of Canada, in respect of accidents. Of these, 30 were fatalities. Eleven
employees lost their lives by drowning on
outside work, such as surveys. The number
of accidents in Canada has increased year by
year; and the public has become conscious of
the necessity of an aggressive campaign to
eut down the often unnecessary loss of life
and manpower, as was shown by the National
Conference on Safety, held in Ottawa last
week, which I attended when my other duties
permitted. This provision which authorizes
the minister to encourage a campaign against
accidents seems to be in line with concurrent
thinking.

JUNE 1, 1955
I should like now to discuss some of the
clauses in this bill. Clause 1 amends the
act by changing some definitions. The new
definitions of "compensation" and of "industrial disease" will bring these definitions
more into conformity with the new subsection
which provides that benefits shall be according to the Workmen's Compensation Act of
the province where the workman is ordinarily employed and not necessarily where he
sustained his injury. The new definition of
"employee" includes persons not paid by
direct salary or wage but who are otherwise
employees of Her Majesty. There are not
many such persons rendering service to Her
Majesty without being paid a salary or wage,
but some have been loaned to -the Government of Canada by business and industry.
The definition in this bill provides that where
any members of the staff of a department,
company, corporation, commissions, board or
agency are declared by the Governor in
Council to be subject to the act, the declaration shall be made on the recommendation
of the Minister; that is, the Minister of
Labour. It is expected that requiring the
approval of the Minister in such cases will
make for greater uniformity.
Under clause 2 of the bill, sections 3 to 6
of the act are repealed and new sections
substituted. The proposed new section 3
states who are entitled to compensation, and
provides that the rates of compensation payable to employees under the act shall be
determined in accordance with the law of
the province where the employee is ordinarily
employed, rather than, as at present, under
the law of the province where the accident
occurs or where the industrial disease is
contracted. This amendment is proposed so
that persons required to do official travelling
shall be protected at the compensation rates
of the province where they are normally
employed. For example, public officials
travelling out of Ottawa to provinces other
than Saskatchewan and British Columbia,
would, if suffering an injury during such
official travelling, not receive compensation
at as high a rate as is current in Ontario.
The three provinces I have mentioned each
have a rate of 75 per cent of salary up to
$4,000 a year, which, of course, is broken
down to amounts for the period of disablement. Some other provinces have a much
loWer rate, and therefore if a person from
Ottawa were injured in a province in which
the maximum rate of compensation is lower
than it is in Ontario, he would certainly be
greatly prejudiced under the act as it is at
present. While it is likely that there would
be not more than 100 claims a year of persons
being injured in a province other than the

one in which they are usually employed, the
amendment is regarded as necessary for
equitable treatment.
Honourable senators, this will bring the
application of the legislation more closely in
line with the provincial Workmen's Compensation Acts, which apply generally if a nongovernment employee's usual place of business is in the province and the accident takes
place somewhere outside the province. The
amendment is designed to put government
employees on the same footing as nongovernment employees.
The new section 4 provides that where a
person is usually employed in the Yukon or
the Northwest Territories he shall, for the
purposes of this act, be considered to be
usually employed in the province of Alberta.
This will mean that an injured workman
"usually employed" in the Yukon or Northwest Territories will have his claim to compensation processed through the province of
Alberta, no matter where the accident occurred. I believe the reason for this is that
Alberta is the province with the most direct
access »to the northland, and the chain of
travel to the northland is usually through
Edmonton.
The new section 5 provides that employees
assigned to work outside of Canada-such as
employees of the Departments of External
Affairs, Trade and Commerce, and Citizenship and Immigration-for the purpose of
this act shall be deemed to be usually employed in Ontario. Most people who receive
such appointments receive them in Ottawa
and are sent out from this city. Therefore it
is reasonable that there should be this provision removing any uncertainty as to their
usual place of employment.
The new section 6 brings locally-engaged
employees abroad under the act. In the
countries where Canada has representation
it is customary to employ local personnelclerks, porters, and so on. In the past there
bas been an informal arrangement for looking after such persons if they are injured
in the course of their employment. Now they
will be legally covered.
Clause 3 of the bill repeals subsections (1)
and (2) of section 8 of the act and adds new
subsections (3a) and (3b). At the present
time an employee who is injured by an outside party has a choice of either taking
compensation under the act and surrendering
any claim for damages to the Crown, or
taking legal action himself for an amount
which he feels would adequately compensate
him for his injuries and loss of earnings. If
he sues and collects less than he would have
received for medical care and compensation
under the act, the difference is payable to

SENATE

him. If he gets a judgment greater than the
value of the act, he is that much ahead. In
other words, lie could not lose by suing, in
so far as treatment and compensation are
concerned; but if he decided to sue, the legal
fees he incurred might cut down the larger
amount of his judgment and he might not
be any better off. On the other hand, if he
decided to take the benefits provided under
the act, the Crown was subrogated to his
rights of redress against the third party;
there would be an action in the name of
Her Majesty, and if judgment was given for
an amount greater than the cost of hospital
and medical care and compensation, the
excess would be paid into the consolidated
revenue fund. The proposed change in this
act will permit payment of any such excess
judgment money to the employee, but of
course that must be subject to the Government being relieved up to the amount of the
excess for further treatment or compensation in connection with the same injury.
Clause 4 of the bill provides that the
minister may make regulations.
Clause 5 provides for payment of supplementary expenses in cases where the death
of an employee entitled to compensation
occurs at a place other than the place where
he is usually employed. An additional amount
can be paid if heavy expense is incurred in
such circumstances.
Honourable senators, I believe I have
covered all the important points of this bill.
If it receives second reading I shall propose
that it be referred to the Committee on
Immigration and Labour, as there may be
points which honourable senators may wish
to have clarified by officials of the Department of Labour.
In conclusion, may I say that the principle
of the bill, which is to provide better service
to the employees of Canada, and to improve
administration of the act, is surely one that
we can all approve.
I move second reading of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators, I
do not intend to discuss the bill at all, but
in reply to a remark made by the honourable senator from Fredericton (Hon. Mrs.
Fergusson) that Alberta is the province with
the most direct access to the northland, I
merely wish to say that we in Saskatchewan
feel that with Prince Albert, and the highway to Waskesiu, Lac la Ronge and Ile a la
Crosse, we have the natural facilities to deal
with all territory lying north of the province
of Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I might put in a word
for British Columbia. We have the Alaska
highway.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
may I be permitted to compliment the honourable senator from Fredericton (Hon. Mrs.
Fergusson) upon the clarity with which she
explained this bill? I think ber clear and
reasonable explanation of the bill deserves
warm commendation.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. King: Honourable senators, I
agree with the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) that
this bill was very clearly explained, and I
join him in complimenting the honourable
senator from Fredericton. However, the rules
of the Senate do not permit explanation of a
bill clause by clause. I draw attention to
that fact, because the contrary practice might
become common. On the motion for the
second reading of a bill the explanation
should be confined to the principle of the bill
and the bill should not be explained section
by section. I think I am right, Mr. Speaker?
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I must say that during my membership
in this house it bas been a common practice
to explain bills clause by clause on second
reading, particularly a bill of this type. I
think it would be very difficult to set forth
in acceptable terms the general principle of
a bill such as the one before the house. The
honourable senator from Kootenay East (Hon.
Mr. King) has had a long experience in parliament and I have great confidence in his
opinion. I believe that what he bas just
said is correct. However, in dealing with a
bill of this kind, which bas as its object the
welfare of those whom it is intended to serve,
I think it would be very difficult indeed to
explain the bill other than clause by clause.
The honourable senator from Fredericton
followed a practice which has become quite
common in this house.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senators, I
think the objection of the honourable senator
from Kootenay East might have some application if the bill were a piece of original
legislation, but the present bill seeks to amend
an existing statute. When the motion for
second reading of the original bill was moved,
I am sure the sponsor was very careful to
see that he explained only the principle of
the bill. But I do not see how one could
possibly explain a bill like the one before us
without making some reference to the proposed amendments.
I think the word
"principle" must have different interpretations, depending on the nature of the bill
discussed. I feel that the form of explanation given on this occasion was necessary, so
that I for one might understand how the

completely depleted Lake Ontario, Lake Erie,
Lake St. Clair, Luke Huron and Lake Michigan of the valuable lake trout fishing, and it
is attacking the whitefish and cheaper grades
of fish. To date, Lake Superior has not been
affected to any great extent: so that this bill
is for the purpose of, first of all, creating a
situation which may protect Lake Superior
and rehabilitate conditions in the other lakes.
At one time the value of the lake trout fishing
on Lake Erie alone was $5 million a year.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Are there no lake
trout now?
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Practically none; there
is hardly any commercial fishing on Lake
Erie. For the past few years an attempt has
been made to get the United States and
Canada together on a comprehensive scheme
for combating the lamprey. The project was
objected to by the State of Ohio, which did
not want interference by the federal authorities of the United States or Canada with its
fishing; but now that Ohio has lost practically all its fishing resources it has asked
the United States Government to take a hand;
and through that government's Fish and Wild
Life Service, eight American states bordering
on the lakes have been harnessed together and
have met with the Canadian federal authorities and the Province of Ontario. I should
mention that all the Great Lakes, except
Lake Michigan, are in the province of Ontario,
and that province took care of the fishing on
these lakes until the problem became too
much for them, and they .called upon the
dominion Government to take a hand in the
matter. In September of last year the two
countries got together, Ambassador Heeney
and Stewart Bates being the representatives
of Canada, and Walter Bedell Smith and William Herrington representing the United
States, at Washington, and arranged a convention, practically all the terms of which
are embodied in Bill 279, which we are to
discuss.
The commission which is to administer the
convention is not authorized to spend money,
but is purely a clearing house to co-ordinate
the efforts of the eight states, the Fish and
Wild Life Service, the federal Government of
Canada, and the Ontario Government. The
convention which is set out in the bill has
been passed by the United States Senate and
House of Representatives, as well as by the
Canadian House of Commons, and now only
awaits approval by this house. In the meantime the American fisheries authorities have
not waited to act on this matter. A little later
on I shall deal with what the Canadian
Government is doing.
Honourable senators, I was going to tell
you a little more about the lamprey. Trouble

was first noticed in Lake Ontario about 1922,
although as a result of the opening of the
Welland Canal in 1919 there may have been
lampreys up there before 1922. The lamprey
has peculiar habits. He has a sucker mouth
which he attaches on such fish as salmon and
trout, and by this method he sucks out the
cold blood of its victim. The lamprey is not
interested in human or warm blood, but only
in cold blood and fish juices. I have caught
quite a few salmon with holes in their sides
about the size of a walnut, indicating where
lampreys had attached themselves. Sometimes the lamprey will stay on a fish as long
as three weeks and it nearly always kills its
victim. The salmon I have caught with holes
in their sides had been able to wrench themselves free.
At this point I should like to call the attention of honourable senators to one of the
most exciting and enthralling stories I have
ever read. It appears in the May issue of
Coronet magazine, and relates how a young
Toronto girl, Marilyn Bell, swam across Lake
Ontario from Youngstown, New York, to
Toronto, Ontario. It describes how she had
not been in the water very long when a lamprey attached itself to her stomach, but she
was fortunate in being able to knock it off.
There is no record of humans being hurt by
lampreys, but this experience was a harrowing one for this young girl. I would advise
anyone to read this story, for I have never
read anything quite like it.
Honourable senators, whitefish still exist
in the lakes I have mentioned, but trout
fishing in Lake Erie, Lake Michigan, Lake
St. Clair, and Lake Huron is almost extinct,
and the only way it can be brought back is
by stopping the breeding of this curse, the
lamprey.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Does the lamprey
attack the whitefish?
Hon. Mr. Paterson: It does now, but it goes
after the best fish first. The lamprey has
cleaned out the trout, so now it will start
cleaning out the whitefish. If the lamprey
tries to get over a dam it is able to attach its
peculiar mouth to the straight wall of the
dam and work its way back up. The Government has now devised a scheme of putting
perforated steel tops on its dams so that the
lamprey loses its suction at this point and
falls back.
The idea is not so much to prevent the
lamprey from coming out of the creeks and
rivers where it breeds, as to prevent it from
ever getting into these places. The lamprey
is like the British Columbia salmon; it goes
up creeks and rivers to spawn and die, and
if it is not able to spawn it will die anyway.

nature. It is the purpose of the experts to

that members of this house have never been
asked to make a more vital contribution
toward the protection of our fresh-water fish
than this bill provides. I for one-and I
speak on behalf of our party-heartily support the bill, and I think the Senate of the
United States is to be commended for approving the agreement so quickly. I hope the
convention is approved and confirmed in this
house by as large a majority vote as in the
United States Senate.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, I wish to join with the Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) in congratulating the honourable senator who
explained this bill, and also the Government
which negotiated the agreement.
The honourable senator from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) asked if the sponsor of
the bill had ever seen a lamprey-eel. Well,
I have, on a number of occasions. Lampreyeels will fasten themselves on the side of a
yacht, a rowboat, or any other vessel of that
kind, and one can actually catch them by
means of the first and third fingers held
against the second; they cannot be grabbed
by the hand, for they will squeeze themselves out. By the method I have described
you can dislodge a lamprey-eel and take a
good look at it, and I can assure honourable
senators that it is one of the most disgusting
sights one could imagine-with its mouth
rounded out for sucking purposes, and a little
bit of a bone in the centre with which it
pierces the side of the fish.
Of course, we are all thoroughly in sympathy with this bill, and hope it succeeds.
It has been mentioned that the lamprey,
a creature of the ocean, is able to come from
salt water and adapt itself to fresh-water
conditions; and therefore I would very much
doubt the efficacy of merely blocking it in its
effort to go up the river to spawn. Of course,

it is not for us to give advice to the experts,
but a fish that can adapt itself so ably would
most likely become adapted to new conditions
if it found the rivers blocked. I should think
it would be more effective to allow the lamprey to spawn, and then deal with the spawn
in some way.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There is no reason
why we should not do both.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But we cannot stop
this type of fish from spawning in certain
places and at the same time trap its spawn
in those places.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: As I understand it,
an effort is going to be made to prevent the
spawn from getting out into the lakes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I did not understand
the honourable senator who explained the
bill to say that; I understood that the effort
was to prevent the lamprey from going up

the river to spawn.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: As they lay some 60,000
eggs, the idea is to prevent them from
spawning.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There is no reason
for not trying to destroy the spawn as well as
using some method to prevent the fish from
spawning.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Let us hope that some
effective method will be adopted to rid the
lakes of this pest. The Great Lakes fisheries
were at one time a valuable industry, and
I am sure we would all like to see it re-established. In my younger days there was a
large fishing fleet harboured at Port Credit;
the boats were used not only in fishing, but
in carrying stone for building purposes. But
the whole fleet has disappeared. There is
sufficient quantity of food in the Great Lakes
today to feed large numbers of fish, and I
hope that the fishing industry will be revived
and made to thrive again.
May I make one or two observations with
respect to the bill. Section 5 contains these
words:
All courts, justices of the peace and magistrates
in Canada have the same jurisdiction with respect
to offences under the regulations as they have
under sections 689 to 692 of the Canada Shipping
Act, with respect to offences under that act . . .

Does that not mean that they shall have
such jurisdiction if this bill passes, rather
than that they now have it?
That section continues:
. . . and the provisions of those sections apply
to offences under the regulations in the same
manner and to the same extent as they apply to
offences under the Canada Shipping Act.

Does that not mean that such provisions shall
apply when the bill is passed, rather than
that they do apply now?
Hon. Mr. Paterson: I did not look into that
phase of the bill, and I am unable to answer
the honourable senator's question. I assumed
that such details would be discussed in committee.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is so.
Hon. Stanley S. McKeen: Honourable senators, I should like to commend the mover of
this bill (Hon. Mr. Paterson) for his very
lucid explanation. May I also say that I do
not think we have to concern ourselves with
whether we are to prevent the lamprey from

JUNE 2, 1955
spawning or to destroy them after they
spawn. If my prediction is right, whichever
scheme is adopted will not be a hundred
per cent perfect; no doubt some of this type
of fish will spawn, no matter what is done.
We in British Columbia, where the first
fisheries trade treaty was signed, on the halibut fisheries, have found that it has worked
exceptionally well, and that fishery has been
completely rehabilitated. The point has now
been reached where the fishermen on the west
coast get just the amount of halibut they
require every year.
The next treaty was on the sockeye salmon
fisheries, which are regulated by the international commission, of the Canadian section
of which the honourable senator from New
Westminster (Hon: Mr. Reid) is the present
chairman. Through their efforts the fishery
has been rehabilitated in the Fraser River
to the point where it is again a valuable
industry, and is expected to continue expanding. Rehabilitation has taken place throughout the Fraser River watershed, but there
is still work to be done. When it has been
completed the fishing industry will again be
what it was prior to 1913, when the big
slide on the Fraser River took place.
Attempts are now being made to negotiate
a treaty with the United States with respect
to pink salmon. Heretofore the Americans
have been getting some 80 per cent of the
catch while we were getting only 20 per cent,
although most of the fish were spawning in
British Columbia. The federal government
has asked for a treaty on a 50-50 basis. However, I think this year the ratio of catch as
between the United States and Canada will
swing to the point where we will get perhaps
60 per cent and they will get the remaining
40 per cent. I predict that by next year we
will have a treaty whereby Canada will split
with the United States the pink salmon catch.
In my opinion the type of legislation now
before us builds up good will between the
two countries and increases trade. Therefore,
I am heartily in accord with this measure.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question is on the motion of the Honourable Senator Paterson, seconded by the Honourable Senator Campbell, for the second
reading of Bill 279, an Act to implement a
convention on Great Lakes Fisheries between
Canada and the United States. Is it your
pleasure to adopt the motion?
Hon. Senators: Carried.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Unanimously.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Paterson, the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Natural Resources.
PRIVATE BILL
BAUDETTE AND RAINY RIVER MUNICIPAL
BRIDGE COMPANY-SECOND READING

Hon. Norman McL. Paterson moved the
second reading of Bill 1-15, an Act to incorporate Baudette and Rainy River Municipal
Bridge Company.
He said: Honourable senators, I seem to be
on my feet a good deal today, but as I have
not spoken in the house for some time, perhaps you will bear with me a little longer.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: This is your day.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: This bill, which is for
the construction of a bridge between Baudette
and Rainy River, brings back memories to
my mind. In the year 1905, as a young man,
I was private secretary to the Superintendent
of a new railway known as the Manitoba and
Southeastern, built by Mackenzie and Mann,
and I crossed the railway bridge at this
point. That railway is now a part of the
Canadian National Railways system, and its
line between Winnipeg and Fort William
touches a portion of Minnesota, between
Sprague and Warroad, and comes back to
Ontario. Throughout all the years the people
of that area have been without a bridge for
vehicular traffie; they have had to resort to
the use of boats for crossing the river, the
nearest vehicular bridge being at Fort
Frances, some sixty-five miles away. At long
last the people of the locality have organized
the building of a bridge, and from a reading
of the many clauses in the bill honourable
senators will observe that the probable intention is to sell most of the bonds in the United
States. I am advised that, strangely enough,
in the case of a public endeavour of this kind,
the income from the bonds is tax free in the
United States; consequently, such bonds are
very desirable there. However, that is the
affair of the promoters.
The information I have on the bill is as
follows. This is an application by the residents of the town of Rainy River, in the
province of Ontario, for the incorporation of
a company with power to build an international bridge over the Rainy River in the
province of Ontario. The bridge is to extend
from a point in or near the village of
Baudette in the state of Minnesota, in the
United States of America, to a point in or
near the town of Rainy River. Both municipalities, namely, the village of Baudette

SENATE

and the town of Rainy River, have seen the
need for the construction of this bridge for
some time past, and both are actively promoting its construction. It is anticipated that
the bridge will cost approximately $400,000
and arrangements have already been made
for financing it.
The bridge will be a toll bridge, and the
net toll profits will be used solely for paying
off the cost of financing the project. No
profits of any kind will be paid to the shareholders of the company.
When the financing costs have been paid,
that portion of the bridge which is in Canada
will become the property of Her Majesty in
right of Canada, or some other body to be
designated by Her Majesty.
The passing of this legislation will not, of
course, assure the construction of the bridge,
but will enable the promoters to make all
necessary surveys and to do all necessary
acts to proceed with the bridge. It is the
definite feeling of both municipalities that
there is a very definite need for the bridge
and that it will serve a very useful purpose
among them in providing another link for
traffic between Canada and the United
States, with increased tourist and other benefits to all municipalities in the area served
by the bridge.
Among other things, the bridge will give
continuous dependable service throughout the
year and will avoid any tie-ups in service
from icy conditions.
The great increase of heavy-type transportation by truck is common knowledge and
is becoming more and more an economic
factor of importance to industry. A bridge
accommodating such type of transportation
will add important advantages to our local
industry trading into the great markets of
the Middle West of the United States.
The form of the proposed bill is similar
to the recent act which incorporated St.
Mary's River Bridge Company and was passed
at the present session of Parliament. The
company incorporated by that act has the
object of constructing a bridge between Sault
Ste. Marie, Michigan, and Sault Ste. Marie,
Ontario; and while the expected cost of the
Sault Ste. Marie bridge is expected to be
many times the cost of the bridge over the
Rainy River, the provisions of the draft bill
in this case are largely the same as those of
that act.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I
rise just to say that I fully endorse the bill
that is before us. I do not know why, but
some people in this country have a peculiar
objection to or prejudice against toll roads
and fall bridges, but I may say that in my

opinion a toll bridge is better than no bridge
at all. I know the site of this bridge very
well. Years ago when shipping horses out
West we followed the very road that the
honourable senator has mentioned, between
Rainy River and Baudette, Minnesota, and
I have often spent four to five hours during
freight train delays at that point.
The river is difficult to negotiate at certain
periods of the year, and I may say that we
have similar conditions in Saskatchewan. A
ferry can be used for a part of the year, but
not in the fall when the ice is forming, or in
the spring, when the ice is breaking up.
In Saskatchewan there sometimes are thirty
or forty cars waiting in line to use a ferry.
The advantage of a toll bridge is that the
people who are using the -bridge pay for it.
The bridge can be used throughout the year,
so that time is saved by people wishing to
cross the river. These people are willing
to pay the toll exacted.
I am pleased to endorse the principle of
this bill for the construction of a bridge
between Rainy River and Baudette.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: May I ask the
honourable senator from Thunder Bay (Hon.
Mr. Paterson) if I understood him correctly
to say that the same interests are proposing
to build this bridge as will be building the
bridge at the Soo?
Hon. Mr. Paterson: No; I said it is the
same form of application.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: It is interesting to note
that three of these international bridges-the
one at Sarnia, the one at Mackinac Island,
and the one proposed for Sault Ste. Mariehave been undertaken by a group of people
who have worked with the State of Michigan
road authority. I think the financing was
largely done by American capital, and I presume that the same will be true of this
bridge, chiefiy by means of an issue of taxfree bonds. Over the years a number of
bridges-the one at Cornwall, the Ivy Lea
Bridge near Gananoque, the one at Sarnia,
the one proposed at the Soo, and bridges all
the way along the river passages between the
Great Lakes-have been built or are being
built largely through the enterprise of people
representing American capital and development in this country. This construction will
lead I think to very profitable results to
both countries as far as tourist traffic is
concerned.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask one question?
Section 2 of the bill, which is declaratory,
says:
2. The works and undertaking of the company
are declared to be for the general advantage of
Canada.

JUNE 2, 1955
Of course that phrase is usually used for
the purpose of bringing the undertaking
within the legislative jurisdiction of the
dominion parliament, but in this instance it
is unnecessary to do it in that way because
section 92 (10) of the British North America
Act declares the following classes of works
and undertakings to be within our jurisdiction:
Lines of Steam or other Ships, Railways, Canals,
Telegraphs, and other Works and Undertakings
connecting the Province with any other or others
of the Provinces, or extending beyond the Limits
of the Province.

Now, this bridge is to be built between a
point in Ontario and a point in Minnesota,
U.S.A., and those words "Undertakings . . .
extending beyond the limits of the Province"
would bring this bridge within our jurisdiction anyway; so I wonder what is the idea
behind the declaration that this is a work
for the general advantage of Canada.
Before I sit down may I comment upon
the observation of the honourable senator
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) about
the prejudice, as he called it, of the public
against toll roads and toll bridges. Undoubtedly, a toll bridge is better than no
bridge at all, but the people in general are
certainly opposed to having to pay tolls
every time they use a strip of road or cross
a bridge. It is one of the natural functions
of government to supply roads and communications, and the public requires us to
do so.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I repeat that a toll
is paid only by those who use the bridge.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I point out that
if this bridge is being built by a private
corporation it would almost have to be a toll
bridge.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: As I said, a toll bridge
is better than no bridge at all. But a bridge
that is open to the public, which is paid for
and built by the Government, and made
available for the free use of the public, is
very much better than a toll bridge. That is
why, I think, the public is so set against toll
roads and toll bridges. It is for governments,
whether local, municipal or federal, to provide them.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is it not a fact that the
federal Government also spends money for
the benefit merely of some local community,
though everyone, all over Canada, has to
pay for the work?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That statement may be
accurate in a sense, but the actual fact is
that the Government has been building
bridges and roads from one end of Canada
to the other, and it is not unjust that the
cost should be spread from one end of the
country to the other. It may be much more
unjust to require one community to pay the
entire cost of these works, when the expense
of similar improvements in other communities
is spread over the whole country. So in my
opinion it is fair, whenever bridges are
required, to defray the cost from government
funds, because everybody right across the
country benefits from the bridges of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Would the honourable senator differentiate between a type of
road such as, in the United States, is built
from Chicago to New York, and is called a
super-highway, and a road which goes
through a number of cities, and on which
the speed is limited?

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is true, but not
by all those who benefit from it. That is the
point. The bridge will confer benefits on
others besides those who travel on it. It will
increase land values, for instance, on both
sides of the river, and the landowners will

something unforeseen occurs. I want governments to do these jobs and not leave them
to private individuals, or exact, from a portion
of those benefited, the entire cost.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My recollection is
that the bill relating to St. Mary's Bridge
Company, which was recently before this
house, contained a provision that after a
period of years-twenty, I believe-the bridge
would become public property.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: That is, the Canadian
half.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I point out, with
the permission of the house, that the cases
which have been discussed are not at all
parallel either with the St. Mary's Bridge
bill or this one. International undertakings
require the participation of two countries;
and these bridges that have been developed
along the dividing line of the Great Lakes
and up the river as far as Rainy River are
dependent very much on the enterprise of
American capital; and, as the honourable
senator from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson) has pointed out, there is the fact of an

inducement in the form of tax-free bonds.
This is a condition which we cannot control
in any way. The country will benefit to a
certain extent through the enterprise of these
people, who see an opportunity to build a
bridge and to make it a source of profit.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am voting for the
bill. Will the honourable senator from
Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson) answer
my question with regard to section 2?
Hon. Mr. Paterson: I would prefer to have
the answer given in the Committee on Transport and Communications, to which I intend
to move that the bill be referred.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

The motion was agreed to, and the bill

CUSTOMS BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Salier A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill 410, an Act to amend the
Customs Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the bill
before the house for second reading proposes
a number of changes in the Customs Act, the
principal ones having to do with the question
of value of goods for purposes of calculation
of duty. I had thought of dealing with that
particular subject first. However, the bill is
a short one-it has only nine sections-and
at the risk of someone questioning my
development of the principle of the bill-if
there is a principle in an amending billand referring to sections, I propose, as an
aid to guide honourable senators in following
my remarks, to refer to the sections about
which I propose to say something.
Section 1 of the bill is a rewriting of section
18 of the act. The real change in the section
is this: The act provides that "the following
persons"-who are described in section 18when arriving at a border point in charge of

a vehicle, or on foot or otherwise, shall do
thus and so in the way of reporting to the
customs officer at that border point. In the
interest of good draftsmanship and also to
be sure that there is proper protection of our
revenues, it is proposed that section 18 be
changed to read as follows:
Every person in charge of a vehicle arriving in
Canada, other than a railway carriage, and every
person arriving in Canada on foot or otherwise,
shall . . .

do certain things. The purpose of requiring
every person, without distinction, who arrives
at a border point to report to the nearest
customs officer or the nearest station and to
furnish a list of what he may have that may
be dutiable and to account for the various
things he may have-in a van, for instance,
in the way of animals, trappings, harness,
and things of that kind-is twofold: first, so
that Canada may have a proper record of
what is coming in that may be dutiable; and,
second, in order that officials at customs
border points may perform certain functions
required of them under various statutes. For
instance, I can think offhand of statutes like
the Pest Control Products Act, the Animal
Contagious Diseases Act, and the Immigration
Act. There is an absolute obligation on every
person to report at the nearest border point,
and that is why the section is re-arranged
and redrawn.
I come now to the main and most important
provision in the bill, having to do with value
for duty purposes. May I take a minute or
two to explain the changes made in the bill
in this respect? Before the changes proposed
in this bill are made, we start off with the
general or basic principle of Customs law
that the value of goods coming into Canada
for duty purposes shall not be less than the
value at which like goods are sold in the
home market, that is, in the market from
which these goods are being exported to
Canada at the time of export. That basic
principle seems reasonably simple, but the
conditions that are set out in the present law
provide that value for duty purposes shall be
the fair market value of such or like goods
in the home market at the time of sale and
export when sold in like quantities in the
ordinary course of trade, under comparable
conditions of sale and under fully competitive
conditions.

Well, the second principle laid down in the
present act, in section 35, is if you are not
able to get your value under this basic principle which I have enunciated, then under
subsection 2 of section 35 you have what is
called the principle of the nearest ascertainable equivalent of fair market value, and
that has presented all kinds of problems. As
one who has had something to do with these

JUNE 7, 1955
particular subsections, I know that this subsection 2, dealing with the basis of determining the nearest ascertainable market value
of like goods, has been a real poser and very
unsatisfactory.
The third method was the method of what
we would call, by statute, constructing a price.
In other words, subsection 3 of the present
section 35 provides a basis for arriving at
value for duty. You take the material cost,
the labour cost, overhead, ail those factors,
and then add to that certain items-the
Minister has to exercise a discretion in thisfor administration, selling cost and profit. In
other words, you take actual cost of production of similar goods at the date of shipment
to Canada, which would include all those
direct charges like cost of material, labour
costs, factory overhead, plus additions for
administration, selling costs and profit.
Now, it has been held as a matter of law
that these various methods of arriving at
value for duty purposes are to be dealt with
and are only to come into operation successively; that is, you have to exhaust the conditions of subsection 1-the basic principle of
determining value for duty purposes-before
you can move into subsection 2. Only when
you cannot find the answer in subsection 1
can you avail yourself of the provisions of
subsection 2. In other words, you cannot go
searching through all the subsections to find
one that suits you. You must exhaust yourself in subsection 1 first, and if the answer
to the problem cannot be found in subsection
1 then you drop into subsection 2, and if
you fail to find the answer in subsection 2
you move into subsection 3.
Because of the practical difficulties that
have been presented by the words "the nearest ascertainable equivalent of fair market
value" we have the proposais contained in
the various subsections of new section 35.
You will notice that subsection 1 is just a
general statement that the value for duty
shall be determined in accordance with the
provisions of this section. Subsection 2 is a
restatement of the basic general law of value
for duty purposes that is contained in the
present act. It is the fair market value of
like goods when sold for home consumption
in the ordinary course of trade at the time
of sale and export to this country of the goods
in like quantities and under comparable conditions of sale and under fully competitive
conditions.
In succeeding subsections there is worked
out what I suppose might be called, for want
of a better expression, "working rules" which
are a little more realistic than that expression
"the nearest ascertainable equivalent of fair
market value" that has presented a real

problem in administration. An instance of
the so-called working rules is found in subsection 3 on page 2 of the bill, which provides
that if you have a situation where the goods
are being imported into Canada and you can
find like goods being sold in the home market
at the same time in the ordinary course of
trade and under fully competitive conditions
and in like quantities, but if you cannot find
comparable conditions of sale-that is the
one factor that is missing that takes you out
of the general basic rule for determination of
value for duty purposes-then in those circumstances you go ahead and work with what
you have; that is, you take the situation where
you find the like goods. For instance, if they
are coming in from the United States you
check on sales taking place in the United
States in like quantities to the quantities
involved in the importation, and you also
look to see if the conditions under which they
are sold are fully competitive conditions; and
if that one element of comparable conditions
of sales is missing, this subsection provides
a working rule by which the customs officiais
try if possible to fit themselves into subsection 3. If they cannot, then they have to
move down the line to the next successive
step.
The next successive step is this: If you
find at the time you are exporting the goods
into Canada, say from the United States, that
there are no goods being sold in the exporting
country that you can identify as like goods,
then under subsection 4 you may look for
similar goods. Then if you find all the other
conditions existing, in relation to similar
goods, and you find comparable conditions of
sale under fully competitive conditions in
the ordinary course of trade and in the same
quantities, that is the rule that you apply, and
you try to work out an answer and establish
value under that subsection.
But if you do not meet the conditions, if
the facts will not fit into subsection 4, then
you move along to subsection 5, still dealing
with similar goods, and if the element of comparable conditions of sale is missing you get
along as best you can without that one
element.
Now, those are high sounding words, "comparable conditions of sale", but they only
mean the level at which the transaction is
taking place.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Will the honourable
senator permit a question? In the first line
of subsection 4 the words "like goods" are
used, and later on the words "similar goods"
Can the honourable gentleman
occur.
explain the reason for this different phraseology?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If the honourable senator will read subsection 4 he will see that it
says where "like goods", that is goods that
may be described as like goods to those being
imported, are not sold in the manner described in subsection 2 or 3, the value for
duty purposes shall be the fair market value
of similar goods. So if you cannot find like
goods being the subject-matter of the transaction, say in the United States, at the time
you are bringing like goods into Canada, then
under subsection 4 you have recourse to
similar goods.
Subsection 5 is simply a repetition of subsection 3, only subsection 5 has relation to
similar goods rather than like goods, and here
if the element of comparable conditions of
sale is missing you get along in the best way
you can without it.
May I pause for a moment here? I think
I heard someone say in the course of my
remarks that possibly the goods would have
to travel with a lawyer at all those admission
points. It is not really that bad. Two comments may be made here. One is that having
lawyers along, even in that phase of operation, might be a good thing. People are
getting better educated at all times to the
many uses and good purposes that lawyers
can serve.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

But the framers of the bill went on and
added another, because they have inserted in
subsection 6 that when the value for duty
cannot be determined under any of these
preceding sections because like or similar
goods are not sold for use or consumption in
the country of export, or there is no established market in the country of export for
like or similar goods, the value for duty of
the goods shall be such as the minister determines. The importer, however, does not
arrive at subsection 6 before he has run the
course and exhausted himself without any
beneficial results: it is then that subsection
6 applies. As far as I am concerned, if the
enumeration stopped after subsection 6 I
would think that the purpose of the enactment would be fully accomplished, because
what more could there be than a conferment
on the minister of the right to determine the
value? Naturally, if the matter goes before
the Tariff Board, the values must be supported by appropriate evidence. I do not
assume, and I have no reason to assume,
that when the minister exercises his power
under subsection 6 he exercises it arbitrarily
or unfairly or against the interest of the
importer.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Is the minister
required to fix the value in accordance with
subsection 7?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No. Here, however, I
am expressing a legal opinion, which ordinarily I do not do. But subsection 7 reproduces
in the present bill the old subsection 3, which
establishes the value for duty as the actual
cost of production, and adds certain amounts
for administration, overhead and profit; this
is the enumeration which would apply. If
one takes the steps one at a time, when
subsection 6 is reached and the minister,
because the previous subsections do not fit,
makes the determination of value himself,
it seems to me that that is the end of the
road.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: Secondly, more and more
of the next generation are embarking on
the study and practice of law. So if this
procedure will require the use of lawyers I
am not objecting or suggesting that we should
withdraw the bill, but I do not think it will,
because forms will be furnished which the
importer and the vendor of the goods from
the exporting country will have to fill out.
Certainly those who are engaged in the
business of exporting and importing know
what this language means; they have been
familiar with it for a great many years; and
the changes which are here made are changes

to time about the word "Dominion", we still
retain the word as part of a title in describing certain officials. If the importer does not
exercise that right of appeal within sixty
days it is gone for ever, so far as he is concerned. If he fails on his appeal to the
Dominion customs appraiser he may then
appeal to the deputy minister. This right
must be exercised within thirty days after
a decision has been given by the Dominion
customs appraiser. This section 3 introduces
a new section 43 of the act, which provides
for the counterpart of the rights of appeal
given to the importer. It is a counterpart in
the sense that the Dominion customs
appraiser may at any time within two years
reappraise or redetermine a classification.
The section also provides that the deputy
minister may within two years in any case
redetermine a classification or reappraise a
value for duty purposes. The deputy minister
may also at any time make such redetermination or reappraisal if the importer, on
the entry of the goods, has made any misrepresentation or committed any fraud.
Therefore, with respect to fraud or misrepresentation it is wide open at any time when
the fraud or misrepresentation is discovered
for the deputy minister to take action under
this section.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does that mean that if
a price for import duty has been determined
the department can change its mind at any
time within two years?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It does not mean exactly
that, for there are statutory provisions under
which the department must function. What
we are talking about is the determination of
a tariff classification or of an appraisal value
for duty purposes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The determination has
already been made.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, but it must be
remembered that in the first instance the
importer fills out his forms and presents
them to the customs officer who, in perfectly
good faith, may accept the descriptions on
those forms. However, at some future time
he may discover that the descriptions given
were not such that a proper determination
of classification could be made or that a
proper appraisal of value for duty purposes
could be made. Therefore he may re-open
and redetermine and reappraise.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Would that have a retroactive effect for two years? Could the
authorities go back and collect further duty?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: As a matter of law, yes;
as a matter of practice, in the departmentand some of these procedures have existed

for some time-they do not go back more
than two or three months.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The goods may have
been sold in the meantime. This does not
stipulate that there must have been fraud
or misstatement. The section gives the widest
power to the deputy minister to redetermine
a classification or reappraise a value which
has been previously determined. Perhaps the
importer has been perfectly innocent, and
he may have sold the goods in the meantime,
figuring the cost at the rate determined when
he imported the goods.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I would tell my honourable friend that that is the present law.
This is a re-statement; this is net new law;
and the objection my honourable friend has
made may be answered if he will permit me
to finish what I was explaining. When goods
are presented by an importer at the border
he must set out on his forms the fair market
value in the country of origin, and the price
at which he has purchased the goods. If the
customs officer accepts that information, a
determination is made of the value for duty
purposes. There may also be involved a
determination of the tariff classification. It
may develop later that the information given
was not correct, and this may become known
lcng after the goods have been disposed of.
Such a situation may arise in two different
ways. The wrong information may be given
quite innocently, or with an intent to misrepresent in the hope of getting away with
something. In such a situation the deputy
minister, and in a limited way the Dominion
customs appraiser, is given the right at any
time within two years after the entry of the
goods to go back and in a proper case make
a redetermination of classification or a reappraisal of value.
I was going on to say that while the law
provides that the departmental officials may
go back for two years, unless they find a
case where somebody has been trying to
be smart and put something over the department they only go back a few months or, at
the latest to the point at which the customs
official raised the question of the value or of
the classification.
Hon. Mr. Baird: I am afraid my honourable
friend does not know everything concerning
customs.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I do not pretend to. I am
trying to appraise or, shall I say, reappraise,
with the limited facilities available in the
bill before me, the interjection of my honourable friend from St. John's (Hon. Mr. Baird),
who I feel is a good friend. I yielded to him
so that he might ask a question.

JUNE 7, 1955
Hon. Mr. Vien: Does my honourable friend
claim that the words "within two years of
the date of entry" apply to the whole of
subsection 4 or only to paragraph (d)? If
these words are meant to apply to paragraphs
(a), (b), (c) and (d), they should be separated.
As the legislation is now drawn, I think the
words "within two years of date of entry"
would apply only to paragraph (d).
Hon. Mr. Hayden: My honourable friend
is correct, but he must remember that subsection 4 is an enumeration of the various
powers of the deputy minister. Under subsection 4 (a) the deputy minister may act
in respect of an appeal taken by an importer
from the decision of a Dominion customs
appraiser.
Hon. Mr. Vien: During what period?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The appeal must be
taken within thirty days and may be disposed
of at any time after that. There is no time
limit on this. Paragraph (b) deals with
special cases of misrepresentation or fraud,
and time is unlimited. Paragraph (c) deals
with the case of an importer who felt himself
aggrieved, ran the gamut of all the legal
proceedings open to him, and finally ended
up in the Supreme Court of Canada with a
decision in his favour. The deputy minister
is given power to make whatever redetermination or reappraisal is necessary to give
effect to the decision. Paragraph (d) specifies
that the deputy minister may redetermine the
tariff classification or reappraise the value for
duty of any goods "in any other case where
be deems it advisable". The best way I can
describe it is that the deputy minister may
be self-starting-he does not need anyone to
prod him into action under subsection (d).
Section 4 is a beneficial section, providing
for right of appeal to the Tariff Board by a
person who deems himself aggrieved in any
case where the question at issue has to do
with drawback of customs duties, the question of the rate, etc.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Can my honourable friend
provide information as to why paragraph (d)
should be necessary, when section 43 gives
a blanket authorization to the deputy minister to redetermine tax classification? Under
(d) the deputy minister is given power to
do that in any other case where be deems it
advisable, within two years of the date of
entry of the goods. The goods may have
been sold two or three times within that
period. Section (d) does not apply to fraud
or misrepresentation, it applies "in any other
case"-other than fraud or misrepresentation.
Why should a deputy minister have the power

"in any other case" to review the classification within two years after the goods have
passed entry?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: My friend will appreciate that the enumerations (a), (b) and (c)
of subsection 4 deal with particular situations.
Paragraph (d), as I stated before, enables
the deputy minister to be self-starting in
relation to any inquiry where be feels that
there has not been a proper determination of
classification or a proper appraisal of value
for duty purposes-not because of fraud or
misrepresentation, but for any other reason.
Hon. Mr. Vien: But can the honourable
gentleman state any specific reason for giving
to the deputy minister such a broad power
to review a reclassification two years after
the entry has been passed, when the goods
have been sold and everybody acted in good
faith?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: All I can say is that I
did not determine the policy in relation to
this, but I can see some justification for it.
In any event, the time limit is considerably
shorter than the time limits for retroactive
inquiry under other taxing statutes in Canada.
Situations could arise occasionally by reason
of erroneous classifications of various items
and the errors which might go undetected for
some time. It is possible that a number of
shipments might be erroneously described
over a period of time, and suddenly some
person, for some reason or another, becomes
alert, checks a particular importation, and
upon looking back to see what was done as
to previous shipments finds misrepresentation-which might have been quite innocent
-so the deputy minister is given that power
to go back for a period within two years.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does my friend know it
to be a fact that in the United States they
make use of that particular power to go back
and reclassify and revalue, even though the
goods may have gone into consumption? For
instance, raw material which has gone into
the States may have been absorbed into a
manufacturer's product, and the American
manufacturer has to pay a higher duty, with
a resulting disturbance in the course of trade.
Is this perhaps by way of retaliation?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I should have thought
that my friend, whom I regard highly, could
answer that question, because I think some
of this law was being administered by the
Department of National Revenue many years
ago.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That does not answer my
question.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I suggest that the
real justification for this clause is not its

SENATE
actual wording but rather the common-sense
of the officials who administer the affairs of
the customs division of the Department of
National Revenue. They are highly trained
and very sensible people. If it were not for
that fact I would strongly object to this
section.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: And of course, adding to
what my friend has said, I might point out
that a person adversely affected has all the
rights and processes of appeal open to him.
If he has been done an injustice, and can
demonstrate it, the facilities are at his
disposal.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: They are pretty costly,
though.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Anyway, I have explained
section 4.
Section 5 is just a consequential section on
the enactment of a new section 35.
Section 6 deals with section 104 of the act.
Section 104 deals with special situations,
where goods are imported into Canada and by
reason of some special use to which they are
being put, by the person who brings them
in, are free of duty or are subject to a reduced
rate of duty. If the person who brought the
goods in, instead of using them for the special
purpose turned around and sold them to somebody else, then of course the benefit of the
tariff item disappeared, but by some strange
quirk the penalty heretofore bas been on the
person who bought the goods. That did not
appear to me to have any logic or sense. The
importer who brought them in and sold them
should be liable as well. Subsection 2 of
section 104, proposed by section 6 of the bill,
has for its purpose the making of the importer
liable for any additional duty if be uses the
goods for a purpose for which they were not
intended. By way of illustration, some kind
of mechanical equipment which is not manufactured in Canada might be imported into
Canada for use in a college, and if it went to
a college for the particular use for which it
was intended, it would enter free of duty;
but if the person bringing them in, instead
of devoting them to his own use turned around
and sold them at a profit because of the fact
that they were free of duty, he has violated
the provisions of the act. All that this new
subsection 2 does, is to make the importer
and the person who bought the goods jointly
and severally liable for the payment of additional duties.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why is the person who
bought the goods included?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is the present law.
I am not attempting to justify it; I am dealing
only with the amendments.

Hon. Mr. Howard: Was subsection 4 in the
old act?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Subsection 4 provides
the penalty to be meted out to anyone who
fails to comply with subsection 2 or subsection 3.
Section 7 of the bill is a consequential section: it arises because of the amendments
which have been made to section 43 in connection with appeals. It is a rather backhanded way of describing the right to a
refund. It states that:
. . . no refund of a payment or overpayment of
duty or taxes, arising otherwise than by reason
of an erroneous tariff classification or an erroneous
appraisal of value, shall be made unless an application therefor is made within two years of the date
of payment or overpayment.

What that really means is that if you are
applying for a refund on account of an
erroneous tariff classification or an erroneous
appraisal of value, your application must be
made within two years of the payment of
the duty. If the refund arises out of a clerical mistake, such as an addition of amounts,
the customs officials will correct it at any
time, but otherwise applications for refund
must be made within two years.
Section 8 is a beneficial section which has
to do with the provision to repeal parts of
section 166. Certainly the lawyers at some
stage or other have had something to do
with it. It deals with smuggling. If goods
are being smuggled-a car, for exampleand the culprit is caught and the car seized,
some person who claims to have a lien on it
may want a declaration of his interest. There
is machinery in the act for him to get this
declaration, but under the present law the
time limit for making his application is thirty
days. It has been found that in many cases
the lien holder did not know what had
happened until the first following payment
went into default. All that this section does
is to give the holder of an interest the right
to make an application within sixty days
instead of thirty, as at present.
Section 9 provides a penalty for failure to
report at a border point. If any person, on
arrival at a border point in Canada in a car
or on foot, does not report to the customs
authority there, the goods he is transporting
shall be forfeited and may be seized and dealt
with accordingly.
Those are the various sections of the bill,
and I hope that I have not been too lengthy
in my explanation.
Hon. Mr. Ross: Do any of the proposed
amendments to this act conflict in any way
with the provisions of GATT the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade?

JUNE 7, 1955
Hon. Mr. Hayden: None of these provisions
does.
Hon. Mr. Ross: Not in any way?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I would like to revert,
honourable senators, to a question under
section 6, where the importer as well as the
purchaser is now made liable for additional
duties on goods which have been diverted to
purposes other than for which they were
imported. I see that the two parties are now
made jointly and severally liable. That means,
I fancy, that you can collect from either of
them and that the person you collect from
has no claim over against the other.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I do not think that
follows.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is the meaning
I take out of the words "severally liable". It
does seem to me, however, that there should
be some determination of who is primarily
liable, and to my mind it is the importer who
imports under certain conditions and then
changes the conditions and sells the goods.
But in doing so he may sell them to a perfectly innocent party.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: This section deals not
only with goods of that nature but also with
goods which a person imports for a specific
purpose and uses for some other purpose.
He would then be both importer and user. My
honourable friend is talking about the meaning of the words jointly and severally. This
relates to the liability as between the customs
authorities on the one hand and the importer
and the purchaser of the goods on the other
hand. If a person purchases goods innocently
from an importer and the importer knows
that the goods are subject to that restriction
and that law, then I do not agree with my
friend-as a matter of fact I disagree very
heartily-that in those ,circumstances the purchaser would not have a remedy against the
vendor of the goods to him.
Hon. Mr. Horner: What would happen in
the case where the importer had disappeared-had left the country entirely? The
Customs division would then have to take
their full satisfaction from the man who purchased the article, because he would have the
article to be seized and the original importer
would not be available at all.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Well, that is the penalty
when you deal with those situations.
Hon. Mr. Horner: But he may be completely innocent.
50437-37

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think this section
should be taken up in committee because I
do not see any provision for a claim over by
the purchaser, if the -collection is made from
him, as against the importer, when they are
both severally liable.
Honourable senators, there is one comment
I would like to make. It is not in the way
of a question. My honourable friend opened
up his very clear and capable explanation
of this bill by rather apologizing for his
intention to take it up section by section.
There was some discussion, and there has
been discussion in the house in the past as
to what our rules are with respect to dealing
with the principle of a bill, on the motion
for second reading, and as to whether you
can go into it section by section. I took the
trouble to read the rule on this point, and
I think it would be salutary to quote it-not
that honourable senators do not know it-so
as to have the matter rather more vividly
in mind.
Rule 64 states, under the heading "Principle discussed at second reading":
64. The principle of
at its second reading.

a bill is usually debated

That is all it says. It does not state that
the principle of a bill cannot be debated on
any other occasion, nor that only the principle of the bill may be debated on second
reading; it merely asserts the fact that the
principle of the bill is usually debated at
second reading. That is to say, it places the
time for the discussion of the principle of
the bill at the second reading. There is
nothing, to my mind, either in practice or in
law or in these words, to show that you
cannot take up the details of a bill on second
reading. You do not even need to discuss
the principle unless you like to do so, but
it is usually done. I think it was worth while
and salutary to read that rule.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Does not my honourable
friend think that in a bill of this nature there
is a different principle in each section of the
bill and therefore, when the sponsor of the
bill explains it, he must necessarily set out
what is involved in every section? It would
be out of order to discuss details of each
section, but the principle involved in every
section can properly be discussed. In dealing
with the bill before us there are a number of
questions that would arise in the minds of
honourable senators with respect to almost
every section, involving the principle and the
reason for the section. I would appreciate
it if, when this bill goes to committee, the
officers of the department could attend to
explain those reasons that my honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Hayden) could not be

SENATE
expected to give tonight. I am sure that
we are all grateful to the honourable
gentleman for the very able way in which he
has presented the bill; but it would be unreasonable to ask him to go into all the
details and all the reasons why each section
of the bill has been suggested by officers of
the department. I am anxious to listen to
these officials when the bill goes to committee.
I entirely concur in the observation of the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck), that the officers of the
department are men of the highest possible
character. They have a very wide and long
experience, and they have demonstrated in
the administration of the Customs Act a very
high sense of duty. But it may be that on
some future occasion the country will be
served by officials not equipped with the
same experience and good judgment; and
when this chamber is passing legislation it
should guard against assenting to the
grant of blanket powers to administrative
officers. It is a fundamental principle
of Magna Carta and of the Bill of Rights
that Parliament alone should impose on the
people burdens by way of taxation. Customs
duties are a burden of this nature; and when
we consent ta a blanket authorization we are
simply delegating to departmental administrators the power which by Magna Carta and
the Bill of Rights is vested in Parliament. No
matter how much confidence we may have
in the present administrators of this act,
Parliament should retain to itself the right ta
determine in a specific way what burdens
shall be imposed on the people of Canada. I
repeat, with the utmost respect for the present departmental officers, whose experience
and sense of duty I recognize, that there is
at stake the principle of the retention by
Parliament of the power to impose charges
on the people, and that those powers should
not be delegated without specific instructions.
I will not say more at this time, but I
reserve the right, when the committee stage
is reached, to put forward questions which
suggest themselves to my mind.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, I
rise to say a word or two about the remarks
made by the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). I was
not in the chamber when a question arose
with regard to the reading of sections of the
bill, but I am greatly interested in having the
matter clarified. One of the first things I
noticed when I came to this chamber from
the House of Commons was that sections of
bills are read or referred to here on the
motion for second reading. I readily recognize
that there is a reason for this practice, and

I trust that it will continue. It is natural
that in the House of Commons sections of a
bill are not referred ta until the house itself
moves into the committee stage, when they
are dealt with clause by clause. But in the
Senate they are examined by one of our committees, and not in this chamber. I repeat:
I trust that in future we shall continue the
practice of discussing clauses of bills on the
motion for second reading.
Hon. Mr. Vien: It is difficult to see how
the principle of a bill can be studied unless
an examination is made of how each section
reflects the application of that principle. One
cannot discuss in detail the provisions of each
clause, but one may properly question whether
the principle expressed in any particular
section or sections is acceptable or not.
Hon. John T. Haig: I do not intend to
speak on the subject-matter of the bill, but
on this matter of the rules I wish to say a
few words. I can speak from an experience
of twenty years in this house: and not many
honourable senators who are now members
entered the chamber prior to 1935. I came to
this place under conditions which made me
alive to the subject of the rules, because for
sixteen years I sat in a legislature where, as
a member of the Opposition, it was my duty
to deal with and discuss rules of procedure.
When I came to the Senate I learned that,
upon the introduction of a bill which involved
some new principle of legislation, the representative of the Government spoke, on second
reading, on the principle of the bill and outlined briefly the general provisions by which
it was sought to effect its purpose. That, I
repeat, was the procedure when the subjectmatter of the legislation was new. But when,
as in the case of the measure before us, there
is already legislation in existence which it is
sought to amend, the purpose of the proposed
legislation is discussed, but not the principle.
In the Legislature of Manitoba it was the
practice to resolve the house into Committee
of the Whole and discuss the details after
second reading. That system bas seldom been
followed here. Perhaps on three occasions
since I came to this house the Senate has
gone into Committee of the Whole, and then,
probably, because our members were "rowing" about something which it did not seem
possible to settle outside the chamber.
I believe that the principle generally
adopted in the past has worked very satisfactorily. As far as my memory goes-and it
covers the leadership of the late Senator
Dandurand, the honourable senator from
Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King), the honourable the Speaker (Hon. Mr. Robertson), and
the present Government Leader (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald)-the leader has never refused

JUNE 7, 1955
any reasonable demand that a bill be sent to
committee for discussion. To a large extent
our work is done in committee, where we
can hear explanations from the appropriate
officials. The reason for this practice is clear.
I put the question on occasion to Senator
Dandurand and also to Senator Meighen, and
both of them gave me the same answer. They
said: "We are not experts in all problems
which come before the Senate. In the House
of Commons a bill is usually introduced by a
member of the Government, generally the
one whose department it affects, so that he
is an expert on the questions involved. Our
procedure here is to send an important bill
to committee and call on members of the
Government or permanent officials to give us
the expert advice we need". That is the
reason for our procedure, and 1, personally,
approve of it. I hope that in future parliaments it will never be the practice merely
to move second reading and briefly discuss a
principle. To make the contents of a measure
thoroughly understood by the bouse it should
be examined in detail in committee; and this,
as I have said, has been our practice for
many years.

scandalized about the delegation of power
which is given in the section to which he
has referred this evening.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators,
with all due deference to the splendid explanation of the details of this bill by the
honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden), and the other comments that have
been made, I submit there has been no discussion at all of the principle underlying this
bill. I think that after honourable senators
have had the benefit of any information that
may be elicited in committee, they will have
a better opportunity to discuss the principle
of this bill when it comes before the Senate
for third reading. I am not going to take
time now to make the point clear that I
should like to make, that in this instance the
rule requiring explanation of the principle
of a bill has been more honoured in the
breach than the observance. I give my honourable friend from Toronto full credit for
having been frank enough to say at the
outset of his remarks that he was going to
refer to the sections of the bill rather than
to deal with the principle; but when the
bill comes before us for third reading we may

INTERNAL ECONOMY
SIXTH REPORT OF COMMITTEE CONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the sixth report of the Standing Committee
on Internal Economy and Contingent Accounts.

Hon. Arthur Marcotte: Honourable senators, I was going to oppose the adoption of
this report, but fortunately for me the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) and the honourable Leader
on this side (Hon. Mr. Haig) were kind
enough to allow me at least a couple of days
to read the law on the matter, and I am now
satisfied.
In 1934 I opposed the Honourable Mr.
Cahan, then Secretary of State, on the adoption of the present law. However, it is the
law, and I cannot do a thing about it. Dura
lex sed lex. So I bow to it. In doing what
I have done, I have accomplished my duty
as I saw it, and I take my defeat well, I hope.
The Hon. the Speaker: I draw the attention
of honourable senators to the fact that there
is no motion before the house.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I move, seconded by
the honourable senator from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Godbout), that the report be now
concurred in.

The motion was agreed to, and the report
was concurred in.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

NEW WESTMINSTER HARBOUR
COMMISSIONERS LOAN BILL

Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Natural Resources,
presented the report of the committee on
Bill 279.

Hon. Thomas Reid moved the second
reading of Bill 187, an Act respecting the
New Westminster Harbour Commissioners.

SECOND READING

JUNE 8, 1955
He said: Honourable senators, before explaining this bill may I first say a few words
about the city of New Westminster and its
port.
New Westminster, which now has a population of 30,000, was the first city in British
Columbia. It was for a time the capital of
the province, before Victoria was chosen to
be the seat of government. At one time it had
a mint of its own, and it minted some ten
coins which are now quite valuable as
souvenirs.
New Westminster was the only city which
some years ago saw fit to spend money on the
development of its waterfront; for this purpose it raised some $500,000 by by-law. The
Harbour Board was formed in 1913, and it is
worthy of note that the first indebtedness
against the board's operation was for the cost
of an elevator; further, it is the only harbour
board in Canada which has year by year paid
its interest charges. The board consists of three
commissioners, two appointed by the federal
Government and one by the City of New
Westminster.
The commissioners applied to the federal
Government for a loan of $200,000 for the
building of a causeway, some 2,000 feet in
length, to Annacis Island. The loan has already been made, the money has been spent
and the causeway built; and the purpose of
this bill is to obtain parliamentary authorization for the loan in the regular way.
Annacis Island, consisting of some 1,100
acres in all, has been taken over by the Duke
of Westminster's Estate, in London, which has
started to develop the whole of it into one of
the finest industrial projects in the entire
province. The estate must have in its management some far-seeing men, because although the island at flood time was under
water, development has now reached the stage
where some two or three hundred acres have
been raised eight feet, three miles of concrete
road have been laid, a large administration
building and a bank have been erected, and
industries from Great Britain are being developed. Up to the present time the estate
has spent about $4 million and bas undertaken
to spend a further $15 million within the next
fifteen years. I have been informed by the
heads of the estate that, taking the long view
of development, they expect in the next 50
years to expend $100 million in the development of this industrial site, which is just a
mile or so from the city itself. Every convenience is being installed on the island.
The causeway conecting it with the mainland
will give access to the island by railway and
motor vehicle and, of course, for pedestrians
too. It is expected that the industries on the
island will give employment to upwards of
7,000 people within a period of seven years.

It was with those facts before them that
the Government agreed to lend to the Harbour Board the sum of $200,000 to build the
causeway to the island, and this amount will
be paid back by way of rentals from water
lots. As I mentioned earlier, the Board has
regularly met its interest payments year by
year. I think the only exception was for a
period of three years during the war when
shipping to the port entirely ceased, because
the Pacifie had been blocked out.
Honourable senators, this is perhaps all I
need say at the moment. If the bill were to
go to a committee I do not know that much
more information could be given there, in
view of the fact that the money has been
spent on the causeway.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third

was read the third time, and passed.

NATIONAL PARKS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. B. Baird moved the second reading
of Bill 261, an Act to amend the National
Parks Act and to establish a National Park
in the Province of Newfoundland.
He said: I am sure honourable senators
will agree that the most important proposal
put forward in this bill is for the establishment of a National Park in Newfoundland.
This subject has been discussed in the other
house on a number of occasions since Newfoundland entered Confederation and I believe
that the proposal has been supported by
members from all parts of Canada. The
provincial Government, that is the Government of Newfoundland, has expressed its
desire to have a park established, and discussions have been continuing for several
years. A suitable general area on the east
coast of Newfoundland has been agreed upon.
The bill provides for the establishment of
the park on proclamation by the Governor
in Council as soon as the boundaries have
been set out in the area turned over to the
federal Government free of all encumbrances.
It is also proposed to amend the National
Parks Act by withdrawing a parcel of land
from the Waterton Lakes Park. This land
will become the property of the Blood Band
of Indians. In exchange, the Band will
transfer to National Park ownership certain
land within the park that is now owned by
the Band. The reason for this exchange goes
back to the time of the construction of the
Chief
Mountain
International
Highway
through the park, some twenty years ago.
There is an Indian reserve belonging to
the Blood Band of Indians located within the

JUNE 9, 1955
boundaries of the park. When the Chief
Mountain Highway was built it was constructed across the reserve, and at the time
no arrangements were made to compensate
the Blood Band for the land taken. Negotiations have continued at intervals over the
years, and it has only been within the past
year that it is possible to reach an agreement.
It is now proposed to give the Blood Indians
an area of about 753 acres between the north
boundary of the park and the north boundary
of the reserve in exchange for the right of
way of the highway and for a small area
within the reserve on which a park warden
station is located. While the total area to
be added to the park is only about 45 acres,
compared to the detachment of about 753
acres, it is considered that this is a reasonable
exchange. The Indians should receive compensation for the land taken for the right of
way, as the lands being turned over to them
are of little value to the park, and after the
exchange the Indians would obtain direct
access to their reserve from the north without
crossing the park lands, where service patrol
work within the park would be simplified.
The Council of the Band has agreed to the
proposed arrangement.
It has also been necessary to obtain the
approval of the Province of Alberta, as, under
the Alberta Natural Resources Act, any lands
no longer required for park purposes revert
to the province. The land to be detached
from the park under the proposed amendment
would have to be given back to the federal
Government by the province before it could
be added to the Indian reserve. The province
has agreed to do this.
The bill also provides for clarification of
certain provisions in the National Parks Act
concerned with the use of park waters either
in the parks or at locations adjacent to them.
The present wording of the National Parks
Act provides that the Governor in Council
may make regulations permitting the use in
the parks of water for domestic and for
railway water supply purposes. It also provides for agreements with municipalities or
water districts or other persons on land
adjacent to the parks for the supply of water
for domestic purposes. It has been somewhat
doubtful whether the use of the word
"domestic" in each case precludes the use of
water in connection with the operation of a
business, as, for example, a tourist camp
development.
As it is considered that the use of water
should not be restricted to this degree, the bill
provides for the use of water within a park
by any establishment licensed to do business
within the park. It also provides for the
removal of any limitations on the purposes
for which water can be used by municipalities
and water districts under the agreements now
50437-38

provided for in the act. The bill provides as
well for the extension of the use of water to
other persons on lands adjacent to a park for
purposes of tourist accommodation as well as
for the domestic purposes now permitted.
A further proposed amendment to the
National Parks Act deals with the question
of hospital services within the parks. At the
present time Banff Park alone is concerned.
The existing hospital serving Banff Townsite
is operated by the Sisters of Ste. Martha. The
Sisters have indicated that they cannot continue to operate the hospital much longer
unless its operation is brought under the
provincial hospitalization scheme, which is
generally known as the "Dollar-a-Day" plan.
Under this plan local residents of a hospital
district pay only one dollar a day for each
day they are in hospital, provided they accept
standard ward accommodation. If they use
more expensive hospital accommodation they
pay the one dollar plus the difference in cost
between the standard and the more expensive space. The difference between the cost
of standard ward accommodation and the one
dollar paid by the patient is met in equal
shares by the provincial Government and the
local municipality concerned. As there is no
established municipality in Banff, it would
be necessary to collect the municipal share by
some form of local taxation.
There is some question whether the present
term of the National Parks Act would permit
the department to enter into an agreement
with any hospital board or other authority
that might be set up as required by the
provincial legislation. There is also no provision in the present act whereby we could
charge the cost of collecting the tax against
the taxes received. The bill now before the
house would provide these authorities.
One further amendment contained in the
bill provides for the withdrawal of Broder
Island from St. Lawrence Islands National
Park. This island will be completely flooded
through the construction of the St. Lawrence
Seaway, and statutory provision must be
made for its withdrawal if seaway construction is to proceed.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
would the sponsor of this bill let us know
whether the location of the new park in
Newfoundland has been decided upon, in
what part of the province it will be located,
its extent, and its boundaries? I think this
information would be very helpful to us. I
believe we are all in favour of the park
being established, and at as early a date as
possible, but also we would like to have full
information with reference to it, particularly
as to its size and location. That is one reason
why I should like this bill to go to committee.
Honourable senators, some years ago a
large piece of land contiguous to Montreal

SENATE
Lake was taken from Prince Albert National
Park in Saskatchewan and given back to the
province. I strenuously opposed that move,
and I have always felt it was made so that
certain timber operators could acquire the
right to go into the area to cut timber. I am
now, as I have been in the past, opposed to
the reduction in size of any of our national
parks. Some of them are none too big to
start with. I am sure that honourable senators who have visited Waterton Lakes
National Park have found it to be none too
big, and I should like a lot more information
about the parcel of land which it is now
proposed to withdraw from this park and
give back to the province of Alberta.
I do not wish to make any comments about
the other proposed amendments to the
National Parks Act, to provide for furnishing
utilities to residents, levying taxes for
hospitals, and so on. I am satisfied that these
amendments are necessary. The town of
Banff is a fairly large centre and it is only
natural that the business people there should
pay for certain benefits that they operate
under.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I wonder if my
honourable friend from St. John's (Hon. Mr.
Baird) would also be good enough to give
the house some information about the accessibility of the proposed national park in
Newfoundland to tourist traffic.
Hon. Mr. Baird: In reply to the remarks
of the honourable senator from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) may I say that, for the
benefit of all Canadians, we should like to
make a national park out of the whole of
Newfoundland. However, we are going to
compromise and place the park in the Bonavista Bay district, whose beauty is known to
everybody familiar with Newfoundland. When
I look around this city, with all its lovely
flowers and trees, I like to think also of the
beauty of our Newfoundland hills, valleys
and fishing villages. I feel our greatest difficulty is going to be in limiting the size of
the park. We have not quite decided how
far its boundaries will extend, but both the
provincial and federal authorities are satisfied that a park should be established.
As to accessibility, may I say to the honourable senator from King's (Hon. Mr. McDonald)
that all Newfoundland is accessible, and probably the Bonavista Bay district is a little
more so than most parts. It lies close to
Gander airport, and bas its own seaport and
railway facilities. In fact, it is situated just
about at the hub of the universe.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
after the comment by the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) that
we are all in favour of a national park in

Newfoundland, I hesitate in any way to disapprove of its establishment. As has been
said, the whole island is a park, and I am
just wondering whether the national park will
prove as beneficial to its own people as do
the national parks in the other provinces.
For instance, it is considered a "must" for
everyone in Saskatchewan to visit the national park in the northern part of the province. The climate is quite different from that
of the southern plains, where you may be
buried in dustHon. Mr. Aselline: Not this year.
Hon. Mr. Horner: No, but as a rule. The
park has an abundance of trees and fresh
water and is most appealing to the inhabitants of the prairies. Similarly, the people of
Alberta, which has a large area of treeless
prairie land, are attracted in large numbers
to Banff National Park. Now, as I understand
it, the climate in any one part of Newfoundland does not vary greatly from that in any
other part of the island, and I am wondering
to what extent Newfoundlanders themselves
will be attracted to their national park. I
do not know what the park will cost, but I
hope that it will not be too much.
I have no objection to the proposed withdrawal of 753 acres of land from the Waterton Lakes National Park. As the sponsor of
the bill has said, it is of no particular value
to the park.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That sort of thing is
always said.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The area of land withdrawn from the Prince Albert National Park
some years ago covered some seven townships. I, too, was opposed to that action,
believing that the area should have been
retained as grazing land for wild game. However, the parcel of land that is being witbdrawn from the Waterton Lakes National
Park will eventually be transferred to Canada for the use of the Blood Indians. In
exchange for this land the Blood Band of
Indians is giving up title to land used for
the park highway and an area required for
a warden's station.
Honourable senators, before being asked
to approve this bill I think we should be
given some information as to the cost of establishing a national park in Newfoundland.
Hon. Vincent Dupuis: Honourable senators,
I should like to make a few comments on
this bill. When Newfoundland came into
Confederation it marked the fulfilment of a
hope that I had long cherished, that Canada
would extend her eastern territory through
union with the island. From any point of
view, it seems to me, it was a splendid move

JUNE 9, 1955
on the part of our fellow citizens of Newfoundland to decide to become a part of the
Canadian nation. It is natural for the older
sister provinces to spoil the youngest, and
even if it were in that spirit-and I deny itthat Newfoundland is being granted a national park by this bill, I still would be very
pleased to support the bill. I completely disagree with a view expressed by my honourable friend from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner). This park is going to be established
in a new province whose future is very
promising, although some may doubt it, and
the park will be of great service to the
people of the province as well as a strong
attraction for tourists. I can speak freely
about a measure to establish a national park
in Newfoundland, for we in Quebec have not
been spoiled with national parks-having, I
think, only two small ones.
My honourable friend from Blaine Lake
mentioned Prince Albert National Park, in
Saskatchewan, which I had the great pleasure
of visiting in 1933. It is a beautiful park. I
saw there a lake almost the size of a seaLake Waskesiu-on whose shore the late
Prime Minister Mackenzie King had a summer residence, in which I enjoyed the experience of eating the best duck that I have
ever tasted. I was told at the time that
wild ducks were pests to the farmers in that
part of the country, because when they landed
on a crop of wheat or oats they devoured
it all within an hour.
Hon. Mr. Horner: No wonder they were
fat.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: They don't eat oats,
they eat wheat.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: I do not know the name
given to these ducks, but I thought they were
delicious.
Honourable senators, I am very pleased to
have said a word on behalf of a national
park for our youngest sister province, Newfoundland, and I hope the Senate will approve
the bill.
Hon. Mr. Ross: May I ask if the sponsor
of the bill proposes to refer the bill to a
committee?

Hon. Mr. Baird: Certainly. However, I am
terribly sorry that the education of the
Deputy Leader of the Opposition has been
so sadly neglected with respect to the great
province of Newfoundland.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I know more about
Newfoundland than my honourable friend
thinks I do.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Baird, the bill was
referred to the Standing Committee on
Natural Resources.
MEAT INSPECTION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. Adelard Godbout moved the second
reading of Bill 352, an Act respecting the inspection of meat and meat products entering
into international and interprovincial trade.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
not very complicated; it simply embodies the
regulations on classification and inspection of
meat and meat products that are already contained in a statute originally enacted in 1907.
The general regulations embodied in that
statute, the Meat and Canned Foods Act, have
to do with not only the classification and
inspection of meat and meat products, but
also the grading and inspection of canned
foods, including fish, fruits and vegetables.
The three phases of the act, having to do with
meat inspection, canned fish and canned fruits
and vegetables, have no administrative association, but are absolutely independent from an
administrative point of view. The Department of Fisheries administers the inspection
of fish, and the inspection of fruit and vegetables is done by the Department of Agriculture.
The officials of the respective departments
feel that it is much easier for them to control
the inspection of products which are under
their surveillance. In 1949 Parliament passed
the Fish Inspection Act, to take inspection of
fish products out of the general law. It is
now the wish of the Government to separate
meat and meat products from fruit and vegetable products for sanitary inspection purposes. This, I think, would permit easier
supervision and inspection by officials of the
department.
This bill embodies the substance of the
meat inspection law as it has existed since
1907, with one slight difference. Provision is
made by clause 4 of the bill for the Governor
in Council to make regulations providing for
the registration of establishments and the
payment by them of inspection and licence

SENATE
fees. I am told that this is not for the purpose
of gaining revenue, but to enable officials to
better control the establishments handling
meat and meat products.
The bill, in any event, should go to a committee because there is a printing error to be
corrected. I can assure the house that when
it is in committee an official of the department will be on hand to answer any questions
asked. Therefore, if the bill receives second
reading, I will move that it be referred to
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Have we no committee on
agriculture? Perhaps it should go to the
Committee on Natural Resources.
Hon. Mr. Godbout: I have no strong feelings
as to which committee the bill should go, but
I would point out that when meat and meat
products have reached the inspection stage
they have left the classification of agriculture
and are in the classification of commerce.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: But the Minister of
Agriculture is the one who will carry out the
provisions of this legislation.
Hon. Mr. Godbout: This measure has to do
only with meat and meat products which
move from one province to another or are
exported from Canada to another country;
therefore, it is not a matter of concern to
farmers but to business and commerce.
Hon. Mr. Horner: But it is very important
to note that the products being deait with
are produced by the farmer.
Hon. Mr. Godbout: They are produced by
him but when they have reached the inspection stage they have passed out of his hands.
However, I have no objection to the bill being
referred to the Committee on Natural
Resources.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask my honourable
friend if it is intended that when this bill
becomes law similar provisions contained in
the Meat and Canned Foods Act will be
immediately cancelled? If that is not done
immediately there will be confusion as to
which act should prevail.
Hon. Mr. Godbout: In answer to my friend
I may say that upon passage of this bill
similar clauses in the general law will be
revoked.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators,
before this bill receives second reading, I
have a few remarks to make. After reading
in the House of Commons Hansardthe debate
that took place on the bill in that house, I
believe there is considerable misunderstanding
about it. As I understand it, this bill has to

do with many questions, including the grading of hogs. We all remember that several
years ago we were told we had to raise a
better type of hog in order to secure the
British market.
Hon. Mr. Godbout: Will my honourable
friend permit me to interrupt him? I am of
course glad to hear what he has to say, but
I should point out that the question he is
raising will come into consideration when we
discuss Bill 411, which is an act to establish
national standards for agricultural products,
and to do other things. The bill before us
deals only with the sanitary condition of
meat and meat products entering into interprovincial and international trade.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Perhaps my remarks
should be reserved for the debate on Bill 411.
I have no objection to this bill going to
committee.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: May I ask the honourable senator to point out the section of the
bill that provides for payment of licence
fees? He cited section 4, but my reading of
it indicates that it has nothing to do with
licensing.
Hon. Mr. Godbout: Pardon me, but I was
mistaken when I said section 4. I meant
section 5, which reads:
The Governor in Council may make regulations
(a) providing for the registration of establishments and prescribing fees for registration;
(b) respecting the operation of establishments;
(c) providing for the inspection of establishments, animals and meat products and prescribing
fees therefor; . . .

Hon. Mr. Isnor: Does that mean that the
federal Government will fix a licence fee to
be charged on meat shipped from one province
to another?
Hon. Mr. Godbout: No. The fee is to be
paid for the licensing of an establishment
which, after inspection, is recognized as a
suitable and proper place for the preparation
of meat for shipment from one province to
another and for export to an outside country.
In other words, the fee will be imposed for
inspection of the premises and of the quality
of the meat to be exported, but not on the
quantity of meat being exported.
Some Hon. Senators: Question!
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

regulate international and interprovincial
trade in agricultural products.
The bills were read the first time.

SENATE
She said: Honourable senators, the title of
this bill, I think, is self-explanatory. According to the definition given in the bill:
"Agricultural product" means livestock (including fur-bearing animals raised in captivity), eggs,
poultry, milk, vegetables, fruit, honey and maple
syrup, and products thereof.

This bill replaces a number of existing
statutes under which inspection is now carried
on. The principal acts are: Canada Dairy
Products Act; Fruit, Vegetables and Honey
Act; Livestock and Livestock Products Act;
Maple Products Industry Act, and Meat and
Canned Foods Act.
The purpose of the bill is to provide in one
statute for the establishment of standards
and grading for all the agricultural products
covered by the foregoing acts. The new act
will come into force by order of the Governor
in Council. Regulations will be made under
the new act; the corresponding regulations
under the present acts will be revoked.
This bill empowers the Governor in Council
to make regulations establishing grades with
appropriate names for any class of agricultural products, and to prescribe terms and
conditions as to the manner in which agricultural products may be graded and
inspected. This is, as we know, for the
regulation of interprovincial and export trade.
No person shall sell or offer for sale any
agricultural product under a grade name, or
even under a designation closely resembling
it. Under the bill the Governor in Council
may make regulations re importation into
Canada or exportation out of Canada, or conveyance from one province to another; and
he may prohibit carriage to destinations outside the province of agricultural products for
which grades are established unless they
meet the requirements of this measure. Also,
the Governor in Council may make regulations for the licensing of dealers in any agricultural product and for the issue, cancellation and suspension of licences.
Inspectors, graders and other persons necessary for the administration and enforcement
of this measure will be appointed or employed
under the provisions of the Civil Service Act.
The bill will give inspectors power to enter
any premises where they have reason to believe that goods of the type to which the bill
applies are offered for sale.
This measure, of course, will not interfere
with agricultural products which are sold in
the province, unless any dealer falsely claims
that some article has been inspected and
bears the Government-approved stamp.
There are many provisions for administration, also penalties attached to infringement
of any of these stipulations. There are so
many clauses that honourable senators, I am

sure, will wish to be better informed as to
the contents of the bill, and if it receives
second reading I will move that it be sent
to the Banking and Commerce Committee.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Would the honourable
senator kindly point out what is new in this
bill, which replaces five existing acts?
Hon. Mrs. Wilson: There is not anything
new. The bill is a consolidation. I do not
know whether the penalties are more severe:
I think we shall have to inquire about that
from the officials if the bill goes to committee.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I wish to congratulate the honourable member from Rockcliffe (Hon. Mrs. Wilson) upon
her clear explanation of this bill. I do not
propose to deal with the amendments, except
to discuss certain standards and grading of
livestock, a subject on which I think I am
qualified to speak. I know that our first
legislation dealing with the grading of hogs
was rather severe. At that time it was felt
that our bacon was not suitable to the British
market, and that we did not have the right
type of hog to compete with the Danish hog.
However, I was told by pork handlers in the
Old Country that our hogs were all right,
but that our method of curing the meat was
not good. They said it did not compare
favourably with the Danish method.
Only this summer I had occasion to visit
a former neighbour of mine, a Dane, who is
now a very successful Jersey cattle rancher
in Alberta. He and his wife had recently
flown to Denmark for a family reunion. Sixteen of the surviving nineteen members of
his family were able to attend the gathering,
five of them flying over from the United
States. I think he said one brother was ill
in New Zealand and was unable to attend.
Anyway, he told me that conditions are
wonderful now in Denmark and that if it
were not for his family he would return to
his old homeland to live. I asked him if
Danish hog producers were able to sell all
their bacon, saying that I understood they
were bound by certain restrictions, and he
replied that they are selling to England all
the hogs they could raise. That was just last
summer, when Canadian hog producers were
making scarcely any sales to that country.
There was an interesting discussion on this
bill in the House of Commons. The Minister
of Agriculture referred to a certain livestock
butcher in an Alberta town who had helped
him out on a former occasion. Well, I would
just like to say there are no longer any butchers, in the true sense of the word. The
so-called butchers merely sell the meat now.
The packers have been anxious to see this

JUNE 14, 1955
condition brought about. It has resulted in
higher freight costs, which have to be borne
by the public, for sometimes a return journey
of as long as 400 miles is necessary in order
that cattle may be shipped away to be
slaughtered.
I remember an international company buying out a local butcher in Blaine Lake who
had a good cement abattoir. They put in a
regular city market, bought beef for about
three cents and sold it for twenty-five, if I
remember correctly. First of all, I thought
they were trying to do something for the
community, but one day the head man came
in and I had quite a disagreement with him.
He said to me, "Oh, you don't understand."
To which I replied, "Well, I understood the
cattle and hog business well enough to make
a living long before I heard of you or your
company, and I will start a real butcher shop
in town and just see how long you last." So
I got in touch with a man by the name of
Hill, got him started up in business and provided him with real beef to sell. In a very
short time the fancy company closed up,
because they could not compete with the man
who did his own killing and cut the meat
right at the block.
At one time I did my own killing, and I
had a crew of men under me. There was no
going to the butcher's shop, or the baker's
shop either, in those days, but in spite of
that our family lived well. Four or five hogs
would be killed in the fall, and the pork
hung up for the winter. Then in the summer,
before the deer-hunting season, year-old
lambs and sheep had to be killed every so
often for fresh meat. When I was young I
tried to dodge helping my father to kill pigs,
and when there was a sheep or lamb to be
killed I would scheme to be somewhere else,
but my father would wait for me to make
sure that I helped him. One day I was in
tears, for he insisted on my helping him and
I could not get out of it. He scolded me and
said: "What will become of you if you grow
up and raise a family? Will you have to
depend on somebody else to do the killing
so that you can have meat?" So I gave in.
Some years later, wheri I was living in the
West he visited me, and it happened that a
neighbour needed some killing done and I
was asked to help. I took my father along
with me and I said, "Are you satisfied now
that I don't have to depend on somebody
else to do the killing?"
Honourable senators, there is a lot of nonsense discussed about this whole question of
grading agricultural products. The original
intention of grading was to assist the producer but, as a matter of fact, all through
the years, as I have maintained, it has helped

the packer to make large profits. I stated
that years ago in an agricultural committee
of the Senate. The late Senator Burns was
present, and be said, "Well, I don't care."
To which I replied, "I didn't expect you
would, but that is what I think just the
same." Under the system of grading, one
price is charged if a pig is one pound underweight, and another price if the pig is. one
have

pound overweight.
objected to too much fat on red brand beef,
and the farmer has been accused of not
feeding his livestock properly. Well, we as
farmers and feeders have heard that story
often. As a matter of fact, all that excess
fat is wasted today.
Honourable senators, when the Canada
Dairy Products Act was under discussion in
the House of Commons a year ago the member for Kamloops, which is a great ranching
country, said that there is no better beef
than that which comes from a healthy cow.
The member was a lawyer, so I assume be
must have got his information from men who
dealt with livestock. He talked a great deal
in the Commons at that time about the discrimination against cow beef, and he knew
what he was talking about. If the meat is
old and the fat bas not been on it a long
time, nothing could have a finer flavour. I
do not know if it was because of his discussion of the question, but ever since then
cow beef has been brought to the attention
of the public. Cattle used to be fed so that
the animals were broad in the back and were
just loaded with fat, but now there is more
lean meat, and that is what people want
today.
I may be censured for saying so, but I
stili believe that the great hope of this
country is the farm, and the farm family. I
think that the present system of grading
needs looking into, and that the judgment
of the farmer and the feeder should be
respected.
When I first went to the West the Mennonites were settling there from the Old
Country and from Nebraska, and it was
wonderful to see the men and women raise
their own cattle and hogs and kill them for
pork and beef. They made blood sausage
from the pork, and did everything themselves; they took the bone out of the pork,
made the lard, and the spare-ribs taken from
the pork were boiled in the boilers of lard.
Somehow, those ribs would keep all winter,
and they tasted like the choicest goose. Those
people pickled the pigs' feet, and made sure
that nothing was wasted.
If this bill goes to a committee, I would
like to see an amendment made with regard
to the grading of hogs. We have a very fine

SENATE

class of hogs in this country, and I think
that the strict rule of grading has gone on
long enough and that an unnecessary restriction is being placed on the producer, with
the packers often getting all the advantage.
I want to mention also the grading of
lambs. The practice is to grade a year-old
sheep down to about half the price of a lamb,
although as a matter of fact it is difficult to
distinguish between the meat. Also, the meat
from a buck lamb is given a lower grading
that that of a ewe lamb, although here again
there is very little difference in the taste of
the meat.
Honourable senators may not be fully
aware of the practice with respect to the
grading of hogs. Boar hogs, for instance, are
sometimes graded down as low as five cents
a pound, although as a matter of fact, taking
the whole carcass, the meat is as good as or
perhaps a little better than other pork. I
recall seeing boar hogs killed at the depot
for use in the Abitibi Lumber Company
camps, and it was said to be the best pork
the men ever ate. In my view there is a lot
of nonsense in the matter of the grading of
meat, and, it has served to discourage some
producers. What may happen is this: A
farmer may raise a hog, and for some reason
or other-it may be that the roads are bad
and he cannot get to market-the hog gets
over weight. That very fact will considerably
reduce the amount of money fie receives for
the animal. At the Royal Winter Fair in
Toronto I saw a man from Saskatchewan
chasing a pig around the alleyways in the
pig pens early one morning. He looked tired
and so did the pig. I asked him what he
was doing, and he told me that the pig
was some eight pounds overweight and he
had been chasing it all night in order to
get its weight down. I told him that I thought
that he would lose eight pounds too. It
seems to me ridiculous that so much attention should be paid to the weight of hogs
in determining the value of the meat.
I once drove a sleigh load of pigs to town,
and, failing to get a satisfactory price because
they were overweight, I turned around and
took them home again, and slaughtered them
myself. Although I did not have a licence
for doing so, I peddled the meat around town
and made myself a few extra dollars for my
day's work. However, all farmers may not
be as handy a butcher as I am. As a matter
of fact, the butcher's work has been pretty
well taken out of the farmer's hands; nowadays even the farmer's bacon comes to him
sliced wafer thin and packaged.
In closing, honourable senators, may I say
that I should like to hear some further discussion on this bill, and perhaps when it goes

to committee the provisions covering
grading of hogs can be amended.

the

Hon. Mr. Golding: Would the honourable
senator tell us what the minimum and maximum weights are for a Grade A hog?
Hon. Mr. Horner: I am not at all sure of
my figures, but I think the low and high are
something like 125 pounds and 175 pounds,
dressed weight.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: I think it is more like
145 and 175 pounds.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Possibly so. Anyway,
my argument is that when a farmer is raising
a large bunch of pigs it is not at all easy for
him to govern their weight to the exact
pound; furthermore, in my opinion the meat
from a 200-pound hog is just as good as, or
perhaps better than, that from a 175 pounder.
On motion of Hon. Mr. McLean, the debate
was adjourned.

such forfeiture is directed by the Court."
2. Page 4, line 38: strike out the figure "5" and

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall these amendments be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I suggest that a
few words of explanation of these rather
important amendments would be useful to
those who were not present at the sitting
of the committee.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The chief amendment
which was made has to do with this situation.
Under the provisions of the bill certain requirements in the way of standards of meat
products, etc., must be observed. Then there
is a section under which every person who
violates any provision of section 8 or of
any regulation made under that section is
guilty of an offence and liable to a penalty.
It may be that in the course of commission
of such an offence a truck or some other
object or article might be used in transporting meat products. The bill that came to us
in committee provided that when a person
was convicted of a violation in such a case
there would be automatic forfeiture of the
truck, object or article.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: May I ask the honourable senator whether under the Customs Act
there is not automatic forfeiture of trucks or
automobiles which are used in the commission
of the offence of smuggling?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: May I just finish my
explanation? In committee it was felt that,
since we have taken out of the offence
under this bill any question of intent or
knowledge, some person at some place along
the line should have the opportunity to exercise a discretion in the penalty to be meted
out so that substantial justice would be done.
We felt the proper person to determine
whether or not a forfeiture should occur
would be the magistrate or judge trying the
particular case.
In reply to the question interjected by the
honourable senator from Rigaud (Hon. Mr.
Dupuis), may I say it is quite true that

there are provisions for forfeiture under the
Customs Act. However, so far as third persons are concerned there are relieving provisions whereby an accused may apply for a
declaration of interest, but a person who
smuggled and used a car as part of the
smuggling operation certainly could not come
into court and say that he used the car
innocently; whereas under the provisions of
the bill it could beHon. Mr. Roebuck: Is not intent necessary
before there is a forfeiture?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I was answering the
question in another way and saying that the
offence of smuggling must of necessity involve
knowledge. If I bring goods into the country
by automobile without the benefit of customs,
I have knowledge of doing so. On the other
hand, under the bill before us a trucking
agency might be called on to deliver some
meat products from one province to another,
and the law requires that the meat products
must bear certain markings and certificates
indicating that the products have satisfied
the provisions of the act. The trucker who
accepts these products and transports them
interprovincially might innocently fail to
notice the lack of certificates. As a matter
of fact, he might not even know that such
certificates are required. Nevertheless, in the
interest of public health it is important that

these certificates be provided, and if they are
not and the trucker transports in those circumstances he is guilty of offence, but not in
the way a smuggler would be guilty under
the Customs Act when he uses a car or other
method of transportation for bringing goods
into Canada, for the smuggler knows what he
is doing. We felt that the difference between
the two kinds of cases should be recognized.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: There is no difference.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I would not be as dogmatic as my honourable friend. I never like to
make pronouncements from on high. I would
prefer to have the legislation allow for a
difference and to place discretionary powers
in the hands of the magistrate or judge who
is hearing the evidence and considering the
conduct of the person charged.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Very good.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: May I remind honourable senators that there is no motion before
the house and that consideration of the report
has been put off until tomorrow, at which
time the report may be debated.

SENATE
CANADA AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS
STANDARDS BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mrs.
Wilson for the second reading of Bill 411, an
Act to establish national standards for agricultural products and to regulate international
and interprovincial trade in agricultural
products.
Hon. A. Neil McLean: Honourable senators,
with reference to Bill 411, I am in favour of
the principle of this bill, and I have the highest confidence in the officials of the Department of Agriculture. I feel that an excellent
job for agriculture is being done by the Minister, Deputy Minister and their capable staff.
However, we must realize we are not only
putting laws on the books for the present, but
for future years as well, and any legislation
of this kind is deserving of our careful
attention.
The British North America Act endeavoured
to make trade between the provinces as free
as possible and we should endeavour to keep
it that way. A great many food products
are sold under brand names both at home and
abroad. Buyers in foreign countries and in
the Canadian market know well hundreds of
branded Canadian products; for instance,
Maple Leaf bacon, Swift's premium hams,
Aylmer brands, Heinz brands, Pippin brand
potatoes, Bird's Eye frozen foods, and many
others. The owners of these brands have
spent millions of dollars in building up these
high-standard brands throughout the markets
of the world over a long period of years, and
they are proud of the reputation for quality
that they have established through laboratory
research and in other ways. Now if anything
happened to usurp these brands by grade
markings, I feel sure it would not be understood in foreign countries, as a great many
important foreign buyers are interested simply
in brands, not grades.
After being in the export market for onethird of a century, I know how sensitive
foreign buyers are to change. When they have
been buying a brand for years and know it,
that is what they want, without any frills.
Exporters receive wonderful help from our
Canadian Trade Commissioners sent out to
different parts of the free world by the
Department of Trade and Commerce. I think
Canada has the best trade representatives
abroad of any country of the globe. They
make a careful study of foreign markets, and
the knowledge they gain as to what kind of
goods there is a market for in the respective
countries where they are stationed and how
the goods should be put up to meet competition is invaluable to Canadian exporters.

Having taken for granted that the goods being
exported are of good quality and high nutritious food value, as sold in the domestic market, we then must remember that the buyer
in the foreign country is spending his own
money and has the right to say how he wants
the goods put up; and if his desires are not
met the orders are liable to go to competitors
in other countries, and there are plenty of
them looking for business. A good many
importers in countries not as rich as Canada
is and having not many dollars to spend, want
the best in straight food value they can get.
That is the first consideration. They are not
interested in fancy wrappers or trimmings
that may possibly enhance the outside looks
but on the other hand raises the price and
adds nothing whatever to the food value of
the contents. Many of us here remember
when we bought the major portion of our
foodstuffs in old-fashioned sacks or barrels,
brown paper bags and brown wrapping paper.
Now we have cellophane and fancy boxes and
other wrappings, which we are quite willing
to pay extra for, although we know the
modern wrapping does not add to the food
value of the contents.
Now I can easily see the reason why an
analyst would seize goods or hold up shipment, for such a person as a representative of
the Food and Drug Division would be a
trained scientist, and as such would make
an examination as to quality and food value.
In ordinary circumstances goods certainly
should not be shipped anywhere, for human
consumption, if they are poor quality and low
food value. In this connection, most of the
leading food processors of Canada have their
own laboratories, and their chemists and
biologists are given full authority to establish
absolute control over all foods being processed in order to see that the high
quality of their respective brands is always
maintained.
On the other hand, an inspector would have
to be a Solomon, it seems to me, to be always
able to make prompt and wise decisions at
certain times when such decisions are needed.
At our coast ports there are many receiving
warehouses where goods are stored in advance
of departing ships which may call and leave
on short notice. We will say, for instance,
that there are branded goods stored in one
of these warehouses, and these goods may be
just what the buyer ordered, as the importer
knows full well what competition he has to
meet, but the goods may be held up by an
inspector on technicalities such as markings,
boxing, etc., which have nothing to do with
the food value. In the meantime the ship
sails or the letter of credit runs out. Well

JUNE 15. 1955
the exporter simply loses the business and
may have to take his goods back home after
a great deal of expense.
The bill states that agricultural products
and other things may be detained 90 days or
more. I am wondering what "other things"
include? Would those words mean trucks, a
span of horses, wagons or other vehicles, or
what do they mean? Ninety days, or such
longer period as may be prescribed, is a long
time to hold goods up from shipment,
especially when the food value of the goods
is by far the major factor in question. The
bill says that when a person has been convicted of a violation of the act-even on a
technicality-then in addition to the penalty
that is imposed the agricultural products and
other things are forfeited to the Crown,
whether or not such forfeiture is directed by
the court conviction. Why take the mattert
out of the courts in this way? The penalties
are heavy, being as high as a $2,000 fine or a
year's imprisonment, or both, besides forfeiture of the goods and the penalties apply
to an employer even if any of his help broke
the prescribed regulations, and the employee
does not have to be identified as such.
We all know that it is often difficult to get
responsible help in connection with primary
industries, and also that a considerable number of immigrants are coming into the country
to work on farms, in packing plants, etc., and
it takes them some time to get used to our
ways and methods. We can only hope that
great discretion will be used in the enforcement of this part of the act. I can see no
reason, for instance, for seizure and forfeiture of goods unless it is on account of
poor quality. Then again, the markings on
the package will be used as prima facie
evidence. There is quite a tendency in the
Maritimes, I know, to use second-hand boxes
over again in the domestic trade. This is
done for the sake of economy, and old markings may have been carelessly left on a
package, as they are sometimes hard to get
off. This is another instance where discretion
will have to be used by officials.
To sum up: To grade goods nationally and
internationally needs a great deal of careful
thought, for so many important factors are
involved, especially where brands are concerned. At this time Canada needs all the
export trade possible, for our international
trade balance is in the debit column, and we
must see that nothing is done to unnecessarily
interfere with selling our goods abroad and
keeping our interprovincial trade at the highest level possible. And for this purpose our
foreign and interprovincial trade must be
free of unnecessary restrictions.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. John T. Haig: May I ask the honourable leader of the Government whether it is
intended that this bill should go to committee?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The honourable
senator from Rockcliffe (Hon. Mrs. Wilson),
who moved second reading of the bill, suggested that it should be referred to committee.
The honourable lady is absent at the moment.
If the bill receives second reading before she
returns to the house, I will move for reference
to committee.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Thank you.
Honourable senators, I have only a few
words to say about the bill at this time. Quite
naturally, we are all interested in this legislation, for the reason that Canadian producers
are finding it more and more difficult to get
into foreign markets. Members of parliament who have travelled abroad during the
past six months all come back with the same
story of the increasing difficulty of trading in
foreign markets.
I recall about a year ago being at one of
your parties, Mr. Speaker, which I always
enjoy very much, and there meeting an ambassador from one of the smaller European
countries. He .asked me what part of Canada
I came from, and when I mentioned Manitoba, he immediately said "Oh yes, Manitoba
wheat." He then went on to tell me that
his country had always bought wheat from
Western Canada until about a year ago when
it purchased a carload from Russia. But
because they had found a lot of little stones
in the shipment, he said they were going to
purchase Canadian wheat again. That to me
was a compliment on the high standard of
quality that we have maintained.
I agree with what has been said by the
honourable senator from Southern New
Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean), but I would
remind him that as members of this bouse we
all want to pass only legislation that will
assure us that when our goods go abroad they
are up to the standard represented by us.
That is the only way we can maintain the
confidence of buyers of our products.
Let me illustrate my point. Lawyers are
often the butt of good-humoured criticism in
this house and elsewhere, but they are the
very people whose advice is sought by anyone in trouble. The reputation of a lawyer
is built up through the years in part by his
ability and his strategy in handling important
matters, but above all other things, by his
integrity, which is worth more than rubies to
him. Once he has lost the public confidence,
he bas lost everything. The same principle
can, I think, be applied to Canada as a producer for foreign markets: our goods must be
as we represent them if we are to maintain
buyer confidence. Our Government is now

SENATE
trying to sell goods, and it is having difficulties. I am not now indulging in any form of
criticism at all. My point is that we are
having difficulties so great that we may be
faced with the choice of not selling goods or
reducing the price. Some of my friends will
not like that statement as to what we may
have to do; but whatever we do do, let us
never reduce the quality of the wheat that
we sell.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Because we are through if
we do that. I say the same thing with regard
to our manufactured products. This bill, as
well as one that was reported back from
committee this afternoon, deals with the
standards of our goods on the world market,
and both bills should have our full support.
The only criticism that I am making of this
bill is that it does not leave a magistrate or
judge any discretion as to whether things
seized from persons who have been convicted
of a violation of the bill should be forfeited
or not. I am sure that when we are considering this bill in committee we will amend
it in this respect as we did the Meat Inspection
Bill.
I am always glad to see the Government
bring in legislation of this character, because
our country is one of the foremost trading
nations of the world. We were in third place
among the trading nations of the world, but
now we are in fourth place. Really, we are a
small nation to occupy such an important
position. Our country depends greatly on
foreign trade. Our mineral products do not
require such important standards of grading,
but grading of manufactured goods and agricultural products is most important on the
world market. And as I said before, we
Canadians are dependent on world markets
and we must keep our standards high if we
propose to continue in such an eminent position as we now occupy.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, I
have just one point, and I am raising it in
the hope that the Department of Agriculture
and the Minister will make note of it and
take the matter up. While in the southern
States last year I learned that they were
there selling a grade of bacon called "Canadian Bacon", which was not a product of
Canada. Now, I do not think there is any
way in which we in Canada can protect
those words, but I feel that the poor grade
of bacon that was being sold under our name
certainly was not doing this country any good
at all. I do not know that anything can be
done about it, but I think that our officials
should draw this to the attention of the officials or the Government of the United States.

Whilst we have no right to tell them what
name to put on their product, it is hardly
playing the game of trade in a fair way to
use the word "Canadian" on a grade of bacon
produced in the United States and much
inferior to anything produced in Canada.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I would like to say a word or two with
respect to the principle that one finds in
section 5 of this bill, which says:
5. (1) The Governor in Council may make regulations for prohibiting
(a) importation into Canada

Now, it is a very serious thing to prohibit the
importation of goods into this country; and
when one sees a section by which officials
are taking into their hands the power to
stop international trade one very naturally
looks upon the section with, not exactly suspicion but with circumspection, shall I say.
The section continues:
(b) exportation out of Canada, or
(c) sending or conveyance from one province to
another, of an agricultural product of any class
unless it complies with prescribed requirements,
has been prepared in accordance with prescribed
conditions and is packed and marked in prescribed
manner.

It is perfectly all right to make regulations saying that goods shall not be exported
from Canada or imported into Canada unless
prepared in accordance with prescribed conditions. It may be that the conditions will be
designed for reasons of health or something
of that kind. The paragraph uses the words,
"is packed and marked in prescribed manner". That may serve a very useful purpose,
because fraudulent or incorrect marking will
do the kind of damage to which the previous
speaker referred.
The clause uses even stronger words, when
it says: " . . . unless it complies with pre-

scribed requirements . . ." for the prescribed
requirements may be with regard to anything.
In other words, under this bill, Parliament is
surrendering into the hands of the officials
of the department, with the consent of the
Governor in Council, the power to prohibit

trade both ways

across the

international

border for any reason which they desire to

state and can get by the council.
I suggest to the members of this house
that that is something which Parliament
should never surrender. We have kept a
fairly close control over tariffs. No tariff can
be erected by Order in Council. Because of
the necessity of protecting our trade and the
intercommunication between ourselves and
other countries a tariff is imposed only when
Paliament says so. But here, the broadest
powers are handed over to the executive to

JUNE 15, 1955
prescribe trading either way, with scarcely
any limitation on what the conditions shall
be.
Subsections 2 and 3 of section 5 read as
follows:
(2) The Governor in Council may make regulations for prohibiting the carriage to a destination
outside the province in which it was received of
an agricultural product of a class for which grades
have been established under part I or of a class
for which requirements have been prescribed under
this section unless
(a) prescribed evidence that the product meets
the requirements of this act and the regulations has
been obtained and produced as prescribed, and
(b) the product is identified in prescribed manner
as an agricultural product that meets the requirements of this act and the regulations.
(3) No person shall
(a) import into Canada,
(b) export from Canada,
(c) send or convey from one province to
another, or
(d) carry or receive for carriage an agricultural
product contrary to a regulation made under this
section.

Hon. Mr. Horner: I will go further than you
in that direction.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am glad to hear that:
the honourable senator will have to go quite
a distance. I have objected many times to
the extent of the powers we entrust to the
officials of the Customs Department, but that
those powers have been handed over is no
reason why, in this case, unlimited powers
should be conceded to the executive. We
should carefully prescribe the powers that
we propose to hand over.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

under the administration provided for by the
act, and with the approval of the Transport
Board.
In due course the bill went to the House
of Commons. But, as the poet Burns has
said, "The best-laid schemes o' mice an' men,
gang aft a-gley", which means-and I explain
this for the benefit of the Irish and English,
who unfortunately do not understand the
Scottish vernacular-that sometimes one's
plans go wrong. When the bill was under
consideration in the Commons, strong objections were taken in certain quarters to the
endowment of a Manitoba-incorporated company with the power to cross a provincial
boundary line. As a result of the discussions.
and the desire of the promoters to get authority to proceed into Saskatchewan, a compromise was reached. What is practically a
new bill was drafted; and it was acceptable
to the committee of the Commons that considered it, and satisfactory to the promoters.
It really amounted to a new incorporation.
The bill was reported back to the Commons;
and our innocent little measure, Bill U-12,
amended in this rather formidable fashion,
now comes back to us for concurrence in
those amendments. The promoters are the
same promoters; the capital structure is the
same capital structure; the company's operations will still be subject to the general Pipe
Lines Act and will be carried on, as provided
in the original bill, under the authority of
the Board of Transport Commissioners.
Personally, I doubt if it was necessary to
proceed by what is in effect a new incorporation. A year ago or more we passed what was
known as the Niagara Gas Transmission
Limited Bill, which was on all fours with
Bill U-12 as we passed it recently. We were
advised by the Law Clerk of the Senate that
it was quite within the competence of Parliament to pass the bill. However, as I stated
a moment ago, exception was taken to that
form in the House of Commons, and what
amounts to really a new incorporation took
its place and appears now as amendments
to the bill. I have just moved concurrence in
these amendments and I trust that the
Senate will accept them.
Hon. Mr. Ross: The General Pipe Lines
Act provides that the route of every Canadian pipe line is to be approved by the Board
of Transport Commissioners. As I understand the amendments to this bill, the TransPrairie pipe line must not go into the United
States, but must be kept entirely within
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That is not correct. The
honourable senator is thinking of another
bill altogether. At no time did this bill propose that the pipe line should go through

any part of the United States. It merely provided that the pipe line may cross the international boundary between Manitoba and
Saskatchewan and pick up some oil in Saskatchewan. There was another bill before
the Senate which proposed to have a pipe
line originate in Manitoba and go into the
United States, and I am sure that is the bill
which my honourable friend has in mind.
Hon. Mr. Reid: When were these amendments submitted to the other house?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: One day last week.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: June 7.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Thank you.
The motion was agreed to, and the amendments were concurred in.
CANADIAN FORCES BILL
REFERRED BACK TO COMMITTEE

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the report of the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce on Bill 257, an Act
respecting the Canadian Forces.
Hon. Salier A. Hayden: Honourable senators, I move that this report be adopted.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I move, seconded by the honourable senator
from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine):
That the report be not now adopted, but that it
be referred back to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce, with instructions to the
said committee to amend the said bill as follows:
"Page 6, line 11: Delete the words 'either' and
'or of herself' from the said lne."

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I am bound to point out that under Rule
24(g) of the Rules of the Senate one day's
notice must be given for an instruction to a

committee. Has the honourable senator
unanimous consent of the house to proceed
now with his motion or must he give one
day's notice? I would point out that this is
not a matter of resolving the question but
merely of giving the honourable senator
unanimous consent to proceed.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by the
Honourable Senator Haig, seconded by the
Honourable Senator Aseltine:
That the report be not now adopted, but that it
be referred back to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce, with instructions to the
said committee to amend the said bill as follows:
"Page 6, line Il: Delete the words 'either' and
'or of herself' from the said line."

Is it your pleasure to adopt the amendment?

Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, if I
had my way in committee sections 15 and 23
of the bill would have been struck out, but
I ran into some difficulties. I have therefore

JUNE 15, 1955
moved an amendment which to my mind is
a straight challenge to one of the main issues
in the bill.
Section 15 of the bill would amend the
Defence Services Pension Act by adding the
after section 31
following immediately
thereof:
"31A. (1) For the purposes of this Act, a woman
who
(a) establishes to the satisfaction of the Treasury
Board that she had, for a period of not less than
seven years immediately prior to the death of
an officer or former officer with whom she had
been residing and whom by law she was
prohibited from marrying by reason of a
previous marriage either of that officer or of
herself to another person, been maintained and
publicly represented by that officer as his
wife, . . .
shall, if the Treasury Board so directs, be deemed
to be the widow of that officer and to have become
married to him at such time as she commenced
being so represented as his wife, and for the
purposes of this Act a woman to whom this subsection would apply, but for her marriage to an
officer or former officer after such time as she
commenced being so represented as the wife of
that officer, shall, if the Treasury Board so directs,
be deemed to have become married to that officer
at the time when, in fact, she commenced being
so represented."

As I understand this section, it means that
a woman may go and live with an officer who
is already married, and if he acknowledges
her as his wife and they live together for
seven years, upon his death it will be within
the power of the Treasury Board to grant her
a pension under the Defence Services Pension
Act. In other words, the woman may have
lived in adultery for over seven years, and
as a reward the Parliament of Canada proposes to give her a pension.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is just terrible.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think so. Somebody
might ask me why I have mentioned adultery.
Well, according to Chapter 20 of the Book of
Exodus in the King James version of the
Bible, one of the Ten Commandments is:
Thou shalt not commit adultery.

There is a straight prohibition against
adultery in the Bible.
If my amendment is adopted, the first part
of section 31a(l) of the act will read as
follows:
For the purposes of this Act, a woman who (a)
establishes to the satisfaction of the Treasury Board
that she had, for a period of not less than seven
years immediately prior to the death of an officer
or former officer with whom she had been residing
and whom by law she was prohibited from marrying by reason of a previous marriage of that
officer to another person, been maintained and
publicly represented by that officer as his wife . . .

Under that wording she could not recover
if her legal husband is still living. That is
all it means, and no more.

Honourable senators, I do not think sections 15 and 23 of this bill should have been
passed by the House of Commons, because
I do not believe the people of our country
want that kind of legislation.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear-they don't.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would not like to appear
before an audience of ordinary men and
women of this country and hear them say,
"You stood up in the Parliament of Canada
as a senator, representing the people of
Canada, and voted for a bill to permit a
woman to receive a pension for the rest of
her life, when she had lived in adultery for
seven years with an officer".
I did not serve in the war, but my boy
served, and he came back with a D.F.C., so
he knows what it is all about. I once asked
him what he thought of this kind of law, and
he replied, "Dad, don't be crazy-that was not
what we f ought for. At night when I used
to start my plane down the runway and
take off for Germany with six hundred
machines alongside of me, what did I think
of? I thought to myself 'Mother and Dad are
safe-let her go!' " Of course he thought that
way, because he was brought up that way,
and I want all the boys and girls of this
country to be reared that way, too. It cuts
me to the heart to think that anyone could
stand up and support legislation such as
sections 15 and 23 of this bill. If an officer
has given service to his country I would be
the first to give him a pension, but I will
not degrade the womanhood of this country
by saying that a woman who has lived in
adultery with an officer for seven years can
receive
a pension
with parliamentary
approval.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Do I understand my
honourable friend to say that his amendment
to the section would take out only the reference to women who were previously married?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. I admit that I would
like to take out a lot more, but the trouble
is that if I move an amendment covering
all the things I want, somebody will get up
and say, "On that one point, we don't agree
with you, Haig, and we are going to vote
against your motion."
To avoid that, I
put it at the minimum.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: But if I read the
section correctly it refers to the previous
marriage of the officer. Now you would
amend itHon. Mr. Haig: The officer could not get
a pension; he would be dead, anyway.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: But your amendment
would make the section refer only to a

SENATE
woman who was prohibited from marrying by
reason of a previous marriage of the officer.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am trying to kill the vote
for the woman who outlives the officer.
I would like to have sections 15 and 23
of the bill struck out. I do not want any
man, by making a slight amendment, to say
that I am wrong. The whole issue that I
take in this debate is that I am against a
woman of that class getting a pension under
the law. As I said before, I do not believe
that the men and women of this country want
that kind of legislation. I cannot understand
why the same point was not raised in the
House of Commons. Only the other day I expressed my views to one of the most distinguished members of that house, and he said,
"You are absolutely right." I have had several letters from people on the subject, including one from a widow whose husband was
in the First World War and died from sickness contracted overseas. She was left to
bring up her three children. In her letter she
said, "Thank God, we have in this country
someone who knows the difference between
right and wrong." I have another letter from
a registered nurse in another province, saying much the same thing. I am persuaded
that that is the reaction of parents who have
the responsibilities of bringing up boys and
girls of their own. I do not believe they want
this kind of legislation passed and trumpeted
before the people of this country.
For the life of me, I cannot understand how
this bill ever got through the House of
Commons without a bitter fight being put up
against it. I may not be the best man in this
bouse to speak against it, and I do not pretend that I am, but I want people who succeed me to be able to say: "Well, Haig stood
up in the Senate and fought for what he
thought was right. It was not for money, or
trade, or economics, but it was to protect the
sacred rights of men and women, especially
women, in this country." That is the reputation I want to win. I ask honourable senators, both men and women, to vote for my
amendment. The Government will not die
if you vote for the amendment, but will
still live, and the public will know that the
Parliament of Canada refuses to pass this
kind of legislation.
Hon. Felix P. Quinn: Honourable members,
like the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig), I cannot help expressing my amazement that this bill should have reached its
present stage without more serious opposition in the other bouse and here. My belief
is that sections 15 and 23 of the bill flout the
laws of Almighty God. Our lawmakers are
attempting to match their wisdom with the

wisdom of God who gave us the Ten Commandments, which all Christians are obliged
to obey. Christ said, "If thou wilt enter into
life, keep the commandments." Yet, we have
placed before the Canadian Parliament a bill
which declares that we may flout one of
those commandments. One section of the
bill provides that a man and a woman who
have lived in adultery for seven years can be
declared by some officer of the law to be
man and wife.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: That is the way I read it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Paragraph (b) of the new
section 31a(1) says just that.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: For the purposes of this
bill, such persons can be declared to be man
and wife, and the woman, if she is the surviving partner to such adulterous living, can
be rewarded for her adultery by being
granted a pension for the remainder of her
natural life. That is the way I read the
bill, and in my opinion it asks us to flout the
laws of God.
I could quote a number of passages from
the Bible to support my position, but perhaps
it would suffice to refer to what St. Paul
said in the eleventh chapter of his Epistle
to the Romans:
Oh, the depths of the riches of the wisdom and
of the knowledge of God!

I repeat, in this legislation our lawmakers
are matching their wisdom with that of God.
I cannot condone sin, and so I cannot vote
for such legislation.
My friend the Chairman of the Divorce
Committee (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and his colleagues on that committee have placed before
us at this session more than four hundred
reports, in which the committee, by its recommendations, condemns the adultery of one
party to the union. In contrast to that legislation, we are here being asked to condone
adultery. Surely, we must be consistent, and
vote against such a measure.
I admire you men and women for your
allegiance to the party of your choice. But
your allegiance to a party need not go so far
as to require you to vote for such a bill as
this.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Party has nothing to do
with it.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: I am glad to hear my
honourable friend make that remark, and I
thank him for it. We must consider first our
allegiance to God, and secondly our allegiance
to our party. I hope, honourable senators,
that your conscience will not permit you to
support such an iniquitous bill.

give all the various examples. Unfortunately,
I was not in attendance to hear all of the
discussion that took place in the committee.
One reason that was advanced in support of
this provision was the fact that in 1952 a
similar section was put into the Public Service Superannuation Act. Apparently there
was no objection; perhaps at that time honourable senators and members of the other
house did not realize its full implication. I
understand that such a provision is also in the
War Veterans Allowance Act, and covered
also by the regulations under the Pension Act.
So what is proposed here is to bring the
Defence Services Pension Act into conformity with the other acts.
Having said that-and I say it on my own
responsibility-I must also say that if those
other pieces of legislation were wrong that is
no justification or reason for us now to adopt
this measure, using them as a precedent. My
thought at the moment is that if this bill
should be referred back to committee, we
should not limit our inquiry only to the officials in the Department of Defence, because
probably their answer-although I do not want
to prejudge them-may be "We are just making this measure conform with other pension
legislation now on the statute books of this
country". I think we might well examine
officials in other departments who administer
similar legislation. However, I would not
take it upon myself, as a newcomer to this
chamber, to move an amendment to the
amendment proposed by the honourable
Leader of the Opposition, but perhaps some
of the views that I have expressed will commend themselves to some of the more experienced senators.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators, I
am very much disturbed by sections 15 and
23 of this bill. I did not oppose the sections
in the committee, for two reasons. In the
first place, I was unaware that they went
so far as I now find they do, upon a more
careful reading of them. In the second place,
I wanted if possible to protect those soldiers
who were married and divorced in the Old
Country but legally were still married here
on account of the fact that the English
divorce was not legal in this country. I
thought that perhaps the subsection (1)(a) of
this new section 31A would give relief in
a case of that kind. I knew at the time that
the War Veterans Allowance Act contained
a provision similar to this. In a discussion
with one of the commissioners of the War
Veterans Allowance Board on the subject, I
got this explanation: it sometimes happens
that a poor, worn-out, old veteran who is
unable to look after himself, is abandoned by

his wife, and another woman comes along,
lives with him for seven years and takes
care of him, the commissioners feel that
when he passes out of the picture she should
be taken care of. However, upon careful consideration of these two sections I must say
that I am opposed to them entirely. I would
even like to see them struck out. I do not
think the amendment proposed by the honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig) goes nearly far enough.
Just let me state briefly what the new
section 3 1 A subsection (1) (a), does. Let us
say an officer, or a former officer, has a wife.
He picks up with another woman, or she
with him-a woman who also is marriedand the two live together. Now, by the enactment of this section we would say that that
is a perfectly legal situation, and that when
lie dies she may be allowed to claim a
pension.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Is that what my honourable friend suggests the section means?
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: Yes, it goes that far. The
officer and the common-law wife may both
be married, and she may still get the pension.
Hon. Mr. Horner: What becomes of the
legal wife, may I ask?
Hon. Mr. Quinn: She is out.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: The new section 31A(l)(b)
reads:
For the purposes of this act, a woman who (b)
establishes to the satisfaction of the Treasury
Board that she had, for a number of years immediately prior to the death of an officer or former
officer with whom she had been residing, been
maintained and publicly represented by that officer
as his wife, and that at the time of the death of
that officer neither she nor the officer was married
to any other person,

gets a pension.
Then, lo and behold, towards the end of
subsection (1)(b) I find these words:
. . . for the purposes of this act, a woman to
whom this subsection would apply, but for her
marriage to an officer or former officer after such
time as she commenced being so represented as
the wife of that officer, shall, if the Treasury Board
so directs, be deemed to have become married to
that officer at the time when, in fact, she commenced being so represented.

In other words, under this bill we would be
marrying these people without a licence.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Without priest or parson.
Hon. Mr. Aselfine: Without any ceremony
whatsoever. And we say it is legal.
I have no objection to subsection (2) of the
new section 31A, except that it is not necessary because provincially we have the same
kind of law which goes so far as to say that
if a man dies when his wife is living separate

JUNE 15, 1955
and apart from him, under circumstances
which would not entitle her to alimony, she
gets no part of his estate. Exactly the same
principle is embodied in subsection (2). But
although I have no objection to subsection
(2), I do say this, that if we pass these sections 15 and 23 we shall be subsidizing
adultery, or, at least, placing a premium on
it. A short time ago we adopted a law
to give relief to the gold mining industry;
if we pass this measure we shall be giving
relief to the gold-diggers. I am not in favour
of it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Did the honourable
senator say he is opposed to adultery under
subsection 1(a) but not under subsection 1(b)?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I am opposed to it, and
the honourable senator knows I am.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I thought the honourable senator said a moment ago he did not
object to adultery under subsection (1)(b).
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Under subsection (2), I
said.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That would be the sort
of thing which would disentitle a married
woman to alimony.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Under subsection (2)
the woman is deemed to be dead. Well, let us
strike it all out.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The honourable senator has changed his mind.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Subsection (2) authorizes
the Treasury Board to declare the woman to
be dead.
Hon. Mr. Horner: His legal wife.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes, his legal wife is
declared to be dead.
The Hon. the Speaker: The honourable
senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
has the floor; and other honourable senators
should not interject except to ask questions.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My question is, are
there grades of adultery?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I do not think so. But
any honourable senator who has sat on the
Divorce Committee knows perfectly well that
there is enough adultery in this country without subsidizing it, and if we pass this
measure that is exactly what we shall be
doing. And I repeat that if we are not subsidizing it we shall, by passing this measure,
at least be encouraging it, making it legal,
and placing a premium on it. So if I had my
way I would strike out entirely sections 15
and 23. The two sections are the same,
except that section 23 uses the words "contributor or former contributor" instead of
"officer or former officer". If the amendment

of the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) to send the bill back for one
purpose is carried, I do not see anything in
the world to prevent the committee from
reconsidering the whole question and, if necessary, striking out sections 15 and 23
altogether.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, may I say that according to the Rules,
I do not think the honourable gentleman is
correct on that point. Generally speaking the
position is this: if, after a committee has
already reported a bill and it has been
regularly considered, it is desired to reverse
a decision previously arrived at, the authority
of the Senate to do so must be obtained. In
this particular case, if the amendment of the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) is adopted, the committee will be
authorized to amend the bill in accordance
with his amendment, and not otherwise. If it
is desired that it should be reconsidered in
other respects, the Senate should empower
the committee to do so. At least, that is my
opinion.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: If I am wrong in that
respect I suggest that some honourable senator should make an amendment to have the
whole bill referred back to the committee.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I feel that honourable
members of the Senate would not like to be
in the position of appearing to commend
adultery in any form. Therefore, if I am in
order, I will move that the bill be referred
back to the committee for the purpose of
reviewing it-that is, for further consideration.
The Hon. the Speaker: I gather from the
remarks of the honourable senator that he
moves, in amendment to the amendment of
the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig), that the report be referred
back to the committee for further consideration of the bill and with power to amend
the bill in any respect.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: If they so desire. I so
move, seconded by the honourable senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Bishop).
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by the
Honourable Senator Kinley, seconded by the
Honourable Senator Bishop, as an amendment to the amendment:
That the report be referred back to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce for
further consideration of the bill and with power
to amend it in any respect.

Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable senators, since I moved the adoption of the report
I think it is proper that at some stage I
should make an explanation.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: The honourable senator is
not closing the debate?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No; I am speaking to the
amendment of the honourable senator from
Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley). I
think I should attempt to present to the
members of the Senate exactly what this
legislation means, not in the sense of seizing
on one or two words, or attempting to declaim from a platform and using expressions
that are more or less in the nature of catch
phrases, because words or sentences put
together cannot mean anything more than
the facts will let them mean.
First of all, the honourable senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) suggested
that this bill marks a new departure in legislation in this house. But whether previous
legislation be right or wrong, a great deal
of it, expressed in exactly the same form, is
embodied in other statutes which, I am sure,
were passed when the honourable senator
was a member either of this house or of the
other place. There is, for example, the Public
Service Superannuation Act. If my honourable friend looks at section 12, subsections
(4) and (5) of chapter 47 of the Statutes of
Canada, 1952-53, he will find that my statement is correct. Or he may look at the
Pension Act, section 36, subsection (4),
chapter 207 of the Revised Statutes of
Canada, 1952.
Hon. Mr. Reid: In exactly the same words?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: In exactly the sane
words. My honourable friend will find it
embodied in section 30 (11) (b) of the War
Veterans Allowance Act, and he will find a
similar provision in section 117 of the Dependents' Allowance Regulations which were enforced during the last war.
The main purpose of incorporating these
amendments in this bill is to bring the provisions of the Defence Services Pension Act
into line with other pension acts. The reason
behind the amendments has been explained
in this way. During the last war many
Canadian soldiers married in England, and
when some of them returned to this country
to take up residence their wives refused to
accompany them. When according to English
divorce laws the required time had elapsed
in order to establish desertion, the wives instituted proceedings in England and obtained
divorces. Some of the husbands then assumed they were free to remarry in Canada.
However, desertion does not constitute a
ground for divorce in Canada, which in
these cases would be the domicile of the
husband and the country in which the divorces
should have been sought, and consequently
these men were legally prohibited here from
marrying a second time.

There is also the situation where a husband
abandons his wife, goes to a foreign jurisdiction and obtains a divorce on grounds which
are not recognized in Canada. At a later
date his wife may become identified with
an officer or contributor under a pension
plan. Let us assume that she lives with
that person for seven years, during which
time they do not marry.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Would not the passage
of the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Bill
to amend our divorce laws have cleared up
the mess you have just referred to?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: My honourable friend
could answer that question himself. He
knows it would, and that is why I am surprised at his inconsistency.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not think it would.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The Senate defeated that
bill this year.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Before being interrupted
I was relating these circumstances: A woman
who has been deserted by her husband may
live with an officer or contributor for seven
years, being maintained by him and publicly
represented by him to be his wife. As a
matter of fact, they may have gone through a
form of marriage, but there is an impediment
to their legal marriage in Canada because
the divorce obtained by the woman's husband
in a foreign jurisdiction does not entitle ber
to remarry in this country.
It was such cases that the department had
in mind-perhaps there were only a dozen
at most-when it proposed these amendments
to bring the Defence Services Pension Act
into line with the other acts to which I have
referred.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: May I ask the honourable
gentleman a question? Do we understand
that the amended legislation will apply only
to people in the circumstances he has just
spoken of?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: As I shall not be charged
with the administration of the act I cannot
really say, but I have given the reasons for
the introduction of these amendments. They
do not give legality to or put a premium on
adultery in the sense that just because a
woman lives as a common law wife of an
officer for seven years she will be entitled
to a pension upon his death. The bill merely
provides that if the Treasury Board finds these
conditions existing it may deem a woman to
be a widow so-called of an officer. If the
officer has a legal widow who is living apart
from him in circumstances under which she
would have been entitled to alimony during
his lifetime, she is regarded as the legal
widow and this particular subsection cannot

JUNE 15, 1955
come into operation at all. If the legal widow
of the officer disqualified herself during his
lifetime-that is, by committing adulteryso that she could not have claimed alimony,
then for the purposes of the act she is not
deemed to be his widow. She is deemed to
have predeceased him, and that puts a legal
end to any right she may have had. When
the Treasury Board considers the circumstances in relation to the woman who had
been living with the officer, it may feel satisfied to award her a pension. However, there
is no law that could compel the board to
make such an award, and there is no right of
action that the woman could assert in any
court to claim that pension. The Treasury
Board must be satisfied that the circumstances
merit the granting of a pension.
There might be cases of bare faced abandonment or desertion by wives who leave
their legal husbands and take up common-law
residence with officers or contributors under
a pension plan. It might be said that this
is the sort of thing we do not want Parliament to sanction. But do you think it is the
type of case in which the Treasury Board
would award a pension? I do not think any
person could honestly answer that question
by saying that in those circumstances the
-Treasury Board would take a course of
action having the effect of putting a premium
on the commission of adultery. I cannot
believe that the board, in its application of
the law, would do that.
In looking for the meaning underlying the
provisions of this bill it is essential to keep
a sense of proportion. The amendment simply
applies to the one situation where a woman
and an officer, or a contributor, are living
together, and the woman happens to have a
living husband. The amendment does not
deal with the case of an unmarried woman
and a married officer who have lived together
under the specified conditions for seven years
or longer. In those circumstances, my friend's
amendment would still permit the Treasury
Board, in a proper case, to award a pension
to the widow. Nor does the amendment deal
with the case of a married woman and a
married officer who have both left their
legal spouses and joined forces, where it
might well be argued that the impediment is
that the officer is married and could not
marry again in any event, and therefore we
do not look at the status of the wife.
It seems to me that we must get down to
some basis of reality when dealing with situations of that kind. If 100 per cent morality
cannot be applied, one must try to do the best
that can be done in a practical way, regardless
of what is thought of the conduct of the individuals involved. It must be faced as a fact
that these situations do occur and have to be

dealt with. For example, when Canadian
soldiers served in England during the war,
and married in that country, they could not
foresee that their wives might refuse to rejoin
them in Canada when the war ceased. In such
circumstances, let us suppose that a Canadian
soldier divorced on the ground of desertion,
married again, and subsequently died, and his
second spouse, believing she was his lawful
wife had raised a family. Is she to be turned
out into the cold and refused a pension? In
the meantime, the wife who had secured the
divorce in England might very well have remarried. When those factors are matched up,
where in equity and morality should the pension fall? It certainly could not be argued
that the pension should go to the wife in
England who had taken divorce proceedings,
but who so far as Canadian law is concerned
is still the Canadian soldier's wife.
The thing that disturbs me in this debate
is the fact that we are asked to read only one
implication into this legislation that would be
bad, and it is the one implication that I cannot
believe is feasible, because I believe the personnel of the Treasury Board are too intelligent for that, and that their principles of
morality are just as high as those of any
senator or member of the House of Commons.
I believe that when the Treasury Board is
called upon to administer the provisions of
this bill, they will do so in favour of a woman
who becomse the wife of an officer in the circircumstances I have related, only if they
feel that their action accords with all the laws
of decency and morality. To attempt to argue
against these provisions on the basis of the
one implication I have mentioned is an unfair
way of approach.
Whether this bill goes back to committee for
reconsideration or not is of no concern to me.
I was the chairman of the committee which
dealt with it, and honourable senators who
were present had the same opportunity of
hearing and weighing the evidence as I had.
When the members of the committee voted in
favour of the provisions which are now before
the house for consideration, one member of
the committee, at least, did not vote against
the provisions, yet he has spoken against them
in this debate. Of course, that is his privilege.
However, in my view, there is no point in
getting excited about this matter. These are
situations which confront the department. The
provisions of the bill are not retroactive; they
are designed to deal with situations as they
occur from now on. If we could become
100 per cent moral-and I wish we could, but
it seems to be difficult-we could repeal the
provisions which are objected to. The alternative course would be to have the provisions
taken out, because I do not think it possible to
be equitable by recognizing certain grades

of morality and making various classifications
of adultery. I think the circumstances which
prompted the department to seek this power
in administering the Defence Pensions Act
were humane principles which, to the extent
that I have indicated, justify themselves on
any moral ground. That is why I speak as I
do on this motion before the house.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable
senators, the honourable senator from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) has explained his point
of view very briefly by saying that this proposed legislation is for special cases. I know
of one special case, a very bad one. An
officer who was married just three days
before leaving for overseas in 1942, came
back in 1945 and left his wife and is now
living with another woman; and since he
was an army veteran he asked the department
to transfer his pension to his common-law
wife. His real wife has been obliged to go
out and work ever since. I have no suspicions
as regards the members of the Treasury
Board, but the board is obliged to act on a
report given by some officer or committee.
If the amendment is passed, the whole pension
will go to the common-law wife in the event
of the officer's death, and his legal wife, who
is living an absolutely honest life, will be in
a very bad position. We are often obliged to
give assistance by way of food and money to
a good woman who has found herself in these
unfortunate circumstances.
For those reasons I will vote for the
amendment to the amendment.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I will
be brief in my closing remarks.
I always enjoy what the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) has to say,
and his remarks in this instance were no
exception to his general high standard. In
his analysis he cleverly came to the most
difficult case last, having stated all the
plausible cases first. But let me ask, how
many times does the Treasury Board itself
examine these cases? A committee is
appointed to do it for them.
In my earlier years of practice I frequently
had persons with matrimonial troubles come
to me for advice. For instance, a woman
would come to me and say, "I am living with
Mr. Brown, but I am not married to him; his
wife has been in a mental hospital for twenty
years. We are getting older, and he would
like to leave his estate to me when he dies."
My immediate suggestion to a woman in such
circumstances would be to get the man in
question to draw a will. The Treasury Board
in its consideration of such a case might consider that some action on the woman's part
entitled ber to a pension. But my point is,
and I put it strongly, that it would not matter

if the Prime Minister himself was chairman
of the Treasury Board, we should not give
them the power to do something that is in
itself fundamentally wrong. That is all there
is to it: it is wrong for a married man to live
in adultery with another woman. It is not a
question of who should examine the facts of
the case; it is a question of right and wrong.
If this bill were passed in its present form
and only one case came before the board for
consideration under this section, the legislation would be just as wrong as if a thousand
cases came for consideration and pensions
were granted in each case.
However, this type of legislation has to do
with people in certain walks of life, namely
soldiers. Such problems have come about by
reason of the fact that men leave the country
to go to war, leaving behind them wives and
children. I know many young men in my
own city who were married just before going
overseas, and absence from the country for
a long period of time is apt to result in
difficulties. Be that as it may, let us not by
any act of ours pass legislation which would
condone the conduct of a woman who had
been living in adultery with an officer, by
giving her a pension.
In closing may I say to my honourable
friend from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) that if the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) had any grounds
for chiding him, he had much wider grounds
for chiding me. After all, I am a lawyer and
am expected to know what is involved in
legislation that passes through this house. I
must have been in the house when certain
bills to which the honourable senator from
Toronto referred were passed, but unfortunately their significance escaped my
attention.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: It happened even in
this session.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But the provisions of this
bill struck me forcibly the first time I read
them.
If this bill goes back to the committee we
will give this section the serious consideration
it deserves. I think it would be to the credit
of the Senate of Canada to reduce to a
minimum the pension rights of a woman who
has been living in adultery. There may be
cases where some special consideration is
justified, but I cannot think of any. I will not
oppose the amendment to the amendment
when it comes to a vote.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I think the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) has explained the
purpose of this bill very clearly. In his
discussion of the details he has shown how
unfair it would be if certain women were

However, the feeling of the bouse seems to
be that the question should be given further
consideration. While some honourable senators may not yet have formed a definite
opinion on this section, I feel that the
majority would like to hear further from the
officials of the departmient and consider
certain points raised by the honourable
leader opposite before coming to a final
decision. Care should be taken to see that
no one gets benefits to which they are not
entitled, and that none are deprived of
benefits to which they are entitled.
As far as I am concerned, I have no
objection to the bill going back to the committee for further consideration.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, may I review the events of this debate

ATTENDANCE

AT NATO

MEETINGS

ABROAD

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, with genuine regret I wish to announce
to the house that, owing to a combination of
circumstances, it will not be possible for me
to attend sittings of the house during the
balance of the session after Tuesday next.
Some honourable senators will know that, as
a result of the initiative of the Canadian
NATO Parliamentary Association, a meeting
of NATO parliamentarians will take place in
the middle of July, in Paris. One of the
purposes will be to consider the formation of
a NATO Inter-Parliamentary Association. The
response to our invitations has exceeded our
fondest hopes, and it is expected that over
150 NATO parliamentarians will attend.
While the NATO Secretariat have been most
co-operative re technical details, the main
responsibility will fall on the Steering Committee itself, of which our association did me
the honour of appointing me the Canadian
représentative.
Some members of the Steering Committee
will meet in London early in the week of
July 3, and I feel it is desirable that I should
be present. Until recently I had hoped to
change a long standing reservation for June
22 to a week later, but the extraordinary
circumstances attendant on the stevedoring
strike, in the United Kingdom, leave me little
alternative to keeping my reservation of June
22. May I ask from honourable senators
their indulgence, and understanding, in the
circumstances; and may I, in anticipation,
thank whoever may be called on by the house
to preside in my absence, and to express the
hope that all honourable senators will enjoy
the recess following the prorogation of
Parliament.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE-AMENDMENTS
CONCURRED IN

Hon. Salter A. Hayden, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, presented the report of the committee
on Bill 411.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, to whom was referred the Bill (411)
intituled: "An Act to establish national standards
for agricultural products and to regulate international and interprovincial trade in agricultural
products", have in obedience to the order of
reference of June 15, 1955, examined the said bill
and now beg leave to report the same with the
following amendments:
1. Page 3, line 14: strike out the word "requirements"
and
substitute
therefor
the
word
"standards";
2. Page 3, line 21: strike out the word "requirements"
and

the
word
"standards";
3. Page 6, lines 12 and 13: strike out the words
"whether or not the forfeiture is directed by the

such forfeiture is directed by the Court".

The Hon.

Ihe

Speaker: Honourable senators,

when shall this report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: With leave of the house,
I move that the report be concurred in now.
The amendments are similar to those that
the committee made to Bill 352, which amendments came before the Senate yesterday and
stand for consideration today. One amendment simply deals with the question of forfeiture of a vehicle or other thing used in
connection with some product or article where
there has been a violation of the act. As the
bill came to us it provided that in the event
of a conviction for a violation of the act the
vehicle or other thing used in the commission'
of the offence was .forfeited, whether, or not
the magistrate or judge directed forfeiture.
We have amended that provision so as to give
the magistrate or judge discretionary powers.
He can weigh the circumstances of each case
and decide whether a forfeiture should be
ordered.
Another change follows on a point raised
in the Senate yesterday by the :honourable
gentleman from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck), having to do with section 5 of the
bill. It was not clear how- broad were the
powers which the 'bill gave to
,the Governor
in Council to make regulations prohibiting

SENATE
the import or export of or interprovincial
trade in articles or goods covered by the act.
The limiting words, which would form the
escape clause, were to the effect that goods
would not be subject to such prohibition if
they complied with prescribed requirements,
had been prepared in accordance with prescribed conditions and packed in the prescribed manner. There was no other place
else in the bill where the word "requirements"
occurred. In committee we concluded that
what was meant was that articles which complied with the standards or the grades provided for earlier in the act would escape from
the prohibition provision.
Part of the provisions of the Canada Dairy
Products Act have been included in Bill 411,
and that act referred to "standards" rather
than "requirements". "Prescribed requirements", with unlimited power vested in the
Governor in Council to make regulations, are
unusual. That is why the committee substituted the word "standards" for "requirements" in two places in section 5, which
deals with the power of the Governor in
Council to regulate international and interprovincial trade in agricultural products. The
committee felt that by so doing it had met
the point which the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity properly raised yesterday.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Honourable senators,
although I am a member of the Banking and
Commerce Committee, the meetings this
morning of other committees of which I am
a member prevented me from attending the
Banking and Commerce Committee meeting.
May I ask the chairman of the committee
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) if this bill has brought
in any new features that are not now in the
act with respect to interprovincial trade in
dairy and agricultural products.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I think I can safely say
that the bill does not introduce any new
features.
The motion was agreed to, and the amendments were concurred in.
THIRD READINGS

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: With leave of the Senate,
I move the third reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill,
as amended, was read the third time, and
passed.

NATIONAL PARKS BILL
IEPORT

OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Natural Resources,
presented the report of the committee on
Bill 261, an Act to amend the National Parks
Act and to establish a national park in the
province of Newfoundland.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant as follows:
The Standing Comrnmittee on Natural Resources,
to wnorn was referred the Bill (261) intituled:
"An Act to amend the National Parks Act and to
establish a National Park in the Province of Newfoundland", have in obedience to the order of
reference of June 9, 1955, examined the said bill
and now beg leave to report the same without
any amendment.

The report was adopted.
THIRD

READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: With leave of the
Senate, I move the third reading now.
Hon. W. M. Asel±ine: Honourable senators,
before this bill is given third reading I
should like to say a few words by way of
supplement to the brief remarks I made
on the debate for second reading of the bill,
when I complained about the proposal to
reduce the area of the Waterton Lakes
National Park.
I should like to repeat that, generally
speaking, I am opposed to the reduction in
size of any of the national parks of Canada.
I consider these parks to be one of Canada's
great national resources, and I believe that
in years to come they will be playgrounds
for a far greater number of people than
we have in Canada today. I was opposed to
the cutting down of the size of the Prince
Albert National Park in Saskatchewan and
I still feel that such a move was a mistake.
I also opposed the reduction of the area of
the Banff National Park and the turning of
it into a hydro project. And I thought I was
right when I spoke a few days ago against
the reduction by some seven hundred acres
of the Waterton Lakes National Park. However, in the light of additional information
which has since come to me, I find that I
was wrong for once at least.
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: Twice.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Or three times.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I went to the trouble
of interviewing the member in the House of
Commons representing that district and
learned that he, with a representative of the
department concerned, had gone over the

JUNE 16, 1955
whole area last summer and made a thorough
study of it. I learned also that the removal
of the seven hundred acres, which is just
a little more than a square mile, was more
of an advantage than a disadvantage to the
park. A representative of the department
produced a map of the area which showed the
road now being constructed. Upon looking
over the whole matter carefully one could
not but conclude that the removal of the
seven hundred acres would not materially
affect the park, which still has several hundred square miles of area in it. To that
extent, honourable senators, I should like to
amend my remarks of the other day, and
express my approval of that portion of the
bill having to do with the Waterton Lakes
National Park.
May I add that when this bill was in
committee we saw maps and had a full
explanation as to the park about to be
established in the province of Newfoundland.
The site will be donated by the province, and
it remains only for the federal Government
to authorize the establishment of a park.
It will be contiguous to both air and rail
travel facilities, but later on a highway will
have to be constructed to it.
With those few words of explanation,
honourable senators, I am quite in favour of
the bill being given third reading.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
I endorse almost everything our colleague
from the remoter parts of Saskatchewan has
just said.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Rosetown.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: But I do desire to take
slight exception to something bordering on
the nature of criticism of the reduction in
area of Saskatchewan's national park north
of Prince Albert, and of some change made
in the Banff National Park. Of course, if
my honourable friend thinks a mistake was
made he is entitled to say so. Those changes
were effected when I happened to be the
minister of the department responsible for
administration of the parks. I can assure
the house, if there should be any concern at
all about the matter, that the area taken out
of the Prince Albert National Park was an
area of muskeg that had been a continuing
hazard to the administration in its fire protection work, and it was just as well to let
that area go back to the province, which
looked after the adjoining area.
So far as Banff National Park was concerned, we were faced with a real problem.
There was a lovely little lake there, which,
if my memory is right, was called Lake
Minnewanka. The proposal was to build a
dam, raise the level of this lake and hold
back its waters so that there would be a more

gradual and steadier flow into the Bow River
for power development. That would never
have been done had it not been for the war
needs. War industries had been established
in the Calgary area and it was absolutely
essential that a continuing source of power
be available for them, and after weighing
the matter very fully we decided to make
that exception in the case of Banff National
Park. The dam was built, the level of the
lake was raised, a storage reservoir was
created, and an even flow of water was
maintained into the Bow River and on down
to Calgary to service power plants.
I quite agree with what the honourable
senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
said about the small area taken out of the
Waterton Lakes Park. And on general principles I agree with everything he said about
the importance of maintaining our national
parks untouched, as far as possible, in the
condition in which nature has left them.
We have so much land in this country that
we can afford to set aside in various provinces
a few hundred square miles and create
national parks that will be things of beauty
and joy.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: For ever.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes. They are great playgrounds, and will continue to be a source
of recreation to the Canadian people long
after all of us have passed from this earthly
scene.
Hon. Calvert C. Pratt: Honourable senators,
may I say just a word on this bill? I was
unable to be present on the occasion of the
second reading, so I am very glad to have
this opportunity to support the move for the
establishment of a national park in Newfoundland. I may say first that it is one of
the many things still outstanding which the
Newfoundland people have been expecting,
arising out of union with Canada. I do not say
that it is one of the most important things
by any means, but it will unquestionably be
of considerable value to the province,
especially with relation to the development
of tourist traffic. Also a national park gives
an uplift to many people, being a wide open
space of which everyone can feel he is part
owner, a place where everyone can visit and
get the satisfaction that comes from beautiful
surroundings. It is gratifying to know that
a start is being made on the establishment
of a national park in Newfoundland.
Just one word concerning the location of
this park. The honourable senator who explained the bill on second reading (Hon. Mr.
Baird) mentioned that the park will be in the
Bonavista Bay area, which is fairly accessible
to the Avalon Peninsula, the most closely

SENATE

populated section of Newfoundland. That
will be in the vicinity of the Trans-Canada
highway, and it is near to the Gander airport.
Incidentally, very few people, even those who
frequently cross the ocean back and forth,
have any idea of the tremendous role played
by that airport in world travel. I feel the
establishment of a national park within easy
reach of Gander airport will have a good
effect on the development of our tourist
trade. Newfoundland has the natural attractions for a large tourist trade, but up to the
present time we have not had much opportunity of using them. The coastal area in
question is very beautiful and the rivers and
arms of the sea will provide unexcelled sporting opportunities.
There may be a question in the minds of
some as to whether the wood lands and water
power potential in the vicinity can be safeguarded for commercial development. I believe that any difficulty in that connection
could be overcome by not having the park
too compact but spread out in directions most
suitable to serve both purposes. I know the
proposed location and I can assure honourable
senators that it is very picturesque.
I feel that the whole scheme calls for
prompt and joint action on the part of the
provincial Government and the federal Government to have this legislation implemented.
The motion was agreed to, the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
THE ESTIMATES
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON FINANCE

Hon. T. A. Crerar, Chairman of the Standing
Committee on Finance, presented the committee's report on the Estimates laid before
Parliament for the fiscal year ending March
31, 1956.
He said: Honourable senators, on March 16
last there was a reference by this house to
the Standing Committee on Finance to make
inquiries respecting the Estimates that had
been tabled earlier in Parliament. I present
now the committee's final report, to which is
attached a number of exhibits and schedules.
The report covers almost seven pages, and
with the consent of the house I would move
that instead of having it read by the Clerk
Assistant it be printed as an appendix to the
Debates of the Senate and the Minutes of the
Proceedings of the house for this day, together with the exhibits, but excluding the
schedule, Exhibit No. 3, which is a rather
large document. That schedule is, in effect,
a summary of Government expenditures by
departments that appeared in the Blue Book
of Estimates. I would suggest that copies of
the report and all other exhibits be printed

for distribution and that the summary Exhibit
No. 3, be inserted in a little pocket at the
back of the report, as was done in the Book
of Estimates.
I submit this report as the final report of
the Finance Committee for the present
session.
The Hon. the Speaker: Does the house agree
to the suggestion of the honourable senator
with regard to printing?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

The Hon. the Speaker: Does the honourable
senator propose that the report be considered
in the house in the near future?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes: next Wednesday.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Put it on the Order
Paper, at least, for next Wednesday.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Crerar it was
ordered:

That the report of the Standing Committee
on Finance, together with the exhibits
attached thereto, less Exhibit No. 3, be printed
as an appendix to the Debates of the Senate

AUTHORITY TO PRINT ADDITIONAL COPIES
OF COMMITTEE PROCEEDINGS

Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators, with
leave of the Senate I move:
That authority be granted for the printing of
1,000 additional copies in English and 200 additional
copies in French of the Report of the Standing
Committee on Finance on the expenditures proposed by the Estinates laid before Parliament for
the fiscal year ending March 31, 1956.

The motion was agreed to.
DIVORCE PETITIONS
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Divorce, presented

the committee's reports Nos. 425 and 426,
dealing with petitions for divorce, and moved
that the said reports be taken into consideration at the next sitting.
The motion was agreed to, on division.
ADJOURNMENT

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I move that when this house adjourns today
it stand adjourned until Tuesday, June 21,
at 8 o'clock in the evening.
It is rather difficult at this time to determine when we should meet. We are getting
near the end of the session, and if we thought

that the House of Commons was likely to
finish its work next week we would have
to sit tomorrow and, probably, on Monday.
But in fact I have no more information than
any other honourable senator as to when
the House of Commons will finish its work.
It may be necessary for us to sit on Friday

I appreciate the excellent attendance of honourable senators during this session. I know
that all of us are anxious to get away, but
I would appreciate it, and I know that the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) shares my wishes in this matter, if
as many honourable senators as possible
would so arrange their affairs that they can
remain here until prorogation.

have been. Most accidents these days occur
on the highways; and I think we were all
very pleased when we learned of the meeting
at Ottawa of the National Safety Conference,
the first conference of its kind in this country.
I think we were also very pleased to know
that the chairman of the conference was the
Honourable Brooke Claxton, who served his
country so well over many years in several
portfolios in the federal Government. It is
reassuring that a man who has given up
active service in Parliament should still be
interested enough in the public affairs of
this country to head this important conference. I am sure that in his new sphere he
will continue to give splendid service to
Canada.
I should like to quote Mr. Claxton's opening words at that conference:
Everyone recognizes the necessity, the absolute
necessity and the urgent necessity for doing everything we can to stop the loss of life, the crippling
injuries, the pain and suffering, and the cost in
time and money caused by motor vehicle accidents.

estimate their frequency. Actually they comprise
only between 1 per cent and 2 per cent of all
highway accidents.

Mr. Claxton, in speaking before the conference, further stated:
People think a lot of accidents are due to railway trains at level crossings. But the figures
show that only one one-hundredth of 1 per cent
of deaths by automobile are due to railways.

Notwithstanding the fact that the percentage of deaths and accidents at railway crossings is comparatively small, it is still a serious problem and one in which we are all
concerned. The Government took such a serious view of it that an order in council was
passed directing the Board of Transport Commissioners to make an inquiry into this
question.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: May I interrupt the honourable leader to ask him a question? Does the
report of the Board of Transport Commissioners deal with railway accidents or automobile accidents?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It deals with accidents at railway crossings. Probably I should
read the last part of the order in council:
The Board shall
(a) conduct a survey and report on the methods
considered by the board to be practicable under
all pertinent circunstances of eliminating the
hazards and improving the publie convenience
and the protection and safety of the public
at such crossings;
(b) review and report on the adequacy of The
Railway Grade Crossing Fund to provide for
the construction of works for the protection,
safety and convenience of the publie in respect
of railway-highway crossings; and
(c) niake such recommendations as the board
may deem advisable in the premises.

So the inquiry was concerned only with
accidents at railway crossings. The board
made eight recommendations, which appear
on page 72 of the report, and with leave of
the house I will place them on Hansard:
1. Until Parliament enacts otherwise there should
be an appropriation of $5,000,000, instead of the
present $1,000,000, to the Fund each year from
April 1, 1954, with a proviso that where on April 1
in any such year there is an uncommitted balance
of more than $2,000,000 in the Fund the appropriation for that year should be such sum as with the
uncommitted balance will amount to $7,000,000.
2. The contribution presently provided for, of 40
per cent of the cost of the actual construction
work for the protection, safety and convenience of
the public, with a maximum of $150,000, in respect
of any one crossing at rail level, should be
increased to 60 per cent and $300,000 respectively.
3. The Fund should be made available to aid
reconstruction and improvement of grade separations in existence at crossings when the amendment comes into force and which because of their
location, design or size are inadequate for the
highway traffic using them, the contribution in
any one case not to exceed 30 per cent of the
cost of reconstruction and improvement nor exceed
$150,000.
4. Contributions should be permitted towards the
annual cost of maintenance and operation of

automatic signals installed at crossings after the
amendment comes into force, the contribution in
respect of any one crossing not to exceed for any
year the actual cost for that year nor exceed
$200.
5. The provision in subsection (1) of section 265,
which prevents a contribution from the Fund in
respect of crossings at rail level constructed after
April 1, 1909, unless there is the agreement referred
to in the subsection between the railway company
and a municipal or other corporation or person,
should be eliminated, but there should be a provision that the board shall not apply any money
out of the Fund towards the cost of work in
respect of a crossing unless the crossing has been
in existence for at least three years prior to the
making of the board's order to apply the money.
6. The board should be expressly empowered to
make contributions where it sees fit towards the
cost of highway projects which involve the construction of a grade separation and the closing of
an existing crossing or the diversion from the
existing crossing of nearly all the highway traffic
using it.
7. Section 263 of the Railway Act, which places
on the railway company, unless and except as
otherwise provided by an agreement approved
by the board, all cost of protection, safety and
convenience of the public in respect of any crossing
of the highway where the railway is constructed
after May, 1909, should be repealed.
8. That the Railway Act be amended to give
effect to the foregoing recommendations.

May I come now to the act itself.

The

purpose of the act is to increase the amount
which the Government will pay into the Railway Grade Crossing Fund from $1 million
to $5 million a year. An important new
provision is that payment out of the Fund
can be made not only in connection with
existing crossings at rail level, but also
toward improvement of the grade separations
that will be in existence at crossings when
this act comes into force. The act as it now
stands provides for payments toward rail
crossings at rail level, but there is no provision for payments in connection with grade
separations. Further, the act provides that
only 40 per cent of the cost shall be paid out
of the Fund toward work done at existing
crossings at rail level, up to an amount of
$150,000. Under the bill 60 per cent of the
cost may be contributed up to a total sum
of $300,000.

The bill further provides that 30 per cent
of the cost of reconstruction and improvement of a grade separation can be paid from
the Fund, up to a total of $150,000. Honourable
senators may ask why 30 per cent is applicable to grade separations and 60 per cent to
rail level crossings. The increase in danger at
railway crossings is not the fault of the railways; it is caused by the increase of traffic
on roads that pass over railway crossings. In
the case of a grade separation, traffic goes
under the crossing or above it, and there is
no danger as far as the railway is concerned.
The difficulty is that an accident might be

JUNE 16, 1955
caused through a bottleneck on the highway
or by too many vehicles passing over a narrow bridge. For that reason, it was feit that
30 per cent would be a sufficient contribution
towards grade separations.
Hon. Mr. Marner: Thirty per cent by the
railway?
Hlon. Mr. Macdonald: No. Thirty per cent
of the cost is paid out of the Railway Grade
Crossing Fund. The balance of the money
is payable by the municipality and the railway. The Board of Transport Commissioners
has flot the power to require a provincial
government to make a payment, but if a
municipality feels that an improvement
should be made at a rail level crossing or
at a grade separation, it can make its own
arrangement with the province to share the
cost.
I believe those are the main features of
this bill.
May I add that ail the recommendations
which were made by the Board of Transport
Commissioners are embodied in the provisions of this bill, with one exception, namely,
the maintenance of warning equipment at
The payment into the
railway crossings.
Fund is $5 million a year, and the Government f elt that instead of using any of that
money to pay for maintenance of upkeep of
equipment at the crossings it would be better
to use ail the money for improving the
crossings; in other words, to prevent accidents
at crossings which are not adequately protected. The Government feels that the municipality or the province or the railways should
look after the equipment once it has been
installed.
I have already said that $5 million is paid
into the Fund each year. If for any reason
the $5 million is not used in any one year
and there is a surplus, that surplus remains
in the fund, but if the surplus is more than
$2 million any amount over the $2 million
is deducted from the $5 million. That means
that the Fund will neyer have more than $7
million in it at any time. It will be seen
that as the payment is made annually, unless
the whohe $5 million is used, there will
always be some money in the Fund.
I strongly recommend that honourable
senators give favourable consideration to this
bll. The municipalities have been asking
for the improvement of crossings for many
years. If the bill becomes law, I think many
lives will be protected and saved by its
provisions.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, I
think we ail agree with the honourable
Leader that it is highly desirable to increase
the annual appropriation to the Railway
50437-40

Grade Crossing Fund to $5 million. However, the bill goes beyond that, for I notice
that section 263 of the act is to be deleted.
That section reads as follows:
In any case where a railway is constructed after
the l9th day of May, 1909. the company shail, at
ils own cost and expense. unless and except as
otherwise provided by agreement, approved by
the Board, between the company and a municipal
or other corporation or person. provide, subject to
the order of the board, ail protection. safety and
convenience for the public in respect of any crossing of a highway by the railway.
The new section 262, which is to take the
place of the deleted section 263, provides that
the cost of eliminating railway crossings may
be apportioned by the board, of course making
use of the $5 million assistance, as explained
by the honourable leader this afternoon.
Han. Mr. Macdonald: That is an improvement, is it not?
Hon. Mr. Reid: But I have not heard an
explanation as to why the railway company
seemingly is being let out of its share of the
cost. However, I did not rise particularhy to
draw attention to that clause, but I merely
mention it in passing.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The new section 262
provides that:
Notwithstanding anything in this act or any other
act, the board may order what portion, if anY.
of the cost is to, be borne respectively by the cornpany, mumicipality or other corporation...
That refers to the railway company.
Hon. Mr. Reid: But under the present section 263 the railway had a greater responsibility than it will have when that section
has been deleted.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald. I would point out to
my honourable friend that under the present
law no payments need be made by the community if the railway line was constructed subsequently to 1909. But this bll provides that
no matter when a railway was constructed,
the costs of protecting its crossings will come
within the provisions of the act.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I should like to mention
the general situation. One has only to travel
about this great country of ours to realize
the impossible task o! eliminating every railway crossing. And if we are going to protect

report 1 read-and I have not yet seen the
one f rom which the honourable Leader quoted
-contained the astounding statement that
in 30 to 35 per cent of motor car-train collisions at crossings the motor car had struck
not the front but the tail end of the train.
Han. Mr. Aseltine: They sometimes run
into the side of the train too.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Reid: I do not know how we are
ever going to protect careless drivers against
railway crossing accidents in a country that
has two transcontinental railways with perhaps 3,000 miles of track each. If the municipalities are going to do anything worth while
by way of protecting crossings they must
receive greater financial assistance. Certainly
no rural municipality that I know of could
afford to eliminate a crossing, which means
either building a subway under the tracks
or constructing an overhead crossing and
removing any buildings that happen to be
in the way of either operation.
The city of Ottawa is a good example of
how traffic can be tied up with railway crossings. Certainly the removal of all level crossings by the construction of subways, as has
been done on Bank Street, would greatly improve traffic conditions in this city. While
I use conditions in Ottawa as an illustration,
I would not like to hazard a guess as to
how much it would cost to eliminate its level
crossings. Certainly for forty years my own
municipality has not been able to afford to
eliminate a railway crossing. It is for that
reason that I am wondering if greater help
could not be given to the municipalities by
the federal Government. In most cases the
federal Government has put up some 40 per
cent of the construction cost out of the fund,
and the remaining 60 per cent was apportioned between the municipality and the
provincial Government. Any additional assistance the federal Government could give,
would of course be of great help to the
municipality.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Under this bill the
federal government proposes to put up 60
per cent of the cost.
Hon. Mr. Reid: If that is so, I want to
commend the Government for bringing in the
bill. I am sure we all support the honourable
Leader of the Government in what he has
said as to the need for eliminating accidents
at railway crossings.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable Leader of the Government if he can
give us some figures as to the number of
people killed or injured in crossing accidents?
So far he bas given only comparative figures
as to different classes of highway accidents.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am sorry, but I do
not seem to have that precise information.
However, I have some general details which
may in part answer the question of my honourable friend. There are approximately
33,000 level crossings in Canada, of which
8,595 are in Ontario. The Dominion Bureau
of Statistics reveals that at the end of 1952

there were 2,492 urban and 6,103 rural highway crossings on railways in Ontario. Of the
urban crossings, 8,955 had some form of protection; and of the rural, 890 were protected
crossings. Thus 65 per cent of urban and 84
per cent of rural crossings were unprotected.
I do not have the figures as to the actual
number of people killed in crossing accidents,
but the annual report of the Board of
Transport Commissioners for 1953 contains this
information: During the daylight hours automobiles running into the side of trains caused
59 accidents, with 22 killed and 68 injured,
and during night hours there were 98 accidents with 19 killed and 175 injured, making
a total of 157 accidents, 41 killed and 243
injured.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I
should like to make a few remarks about
railway crossing accidents. I am sure a close
look at the circumstances of most of such
accidents would reveal that they occurred not
at obscure crossings or where trains approached from around a bend, but on level
crossings where the visibility was good. Drivers have been known to even run into the
gates when they were down and in full view.
The number of accidents in Canada from
all causes is most regrettable, especially in
view of the fact they needlessly take the
lives of many young people. The cure, I
think, might be found in a more strict examination of persons applying for a driver's
licence. The behaviour of a great many people
would strongly suggest that they should never
be granted a licence to drive on the highways today.
I was astounded to read an account of a
recent accident on a four-lane highway
where one would think there was little chance
of an accident occurring. However, even on
a beautiful stretch of road it sometimes happens that a car will cross a boulevard and
get involved with a line of traffic going the
other way. I know of an accident that
occurred in Saskatchewan involving three
doctors, only one of whom survived, and
it happened on the straightest stretch of
road in the province. The cause of most
accidents is an excessive rate of speed.
The expenditure of money to remove railway crossings may help, but I believe something else will have to be done to curb
accidents.
The honourable member from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) said that
many municipalities would not be able to
undertake the great expense of protecting
crossings, especially crossings over which a
train passes only once daily or less frequently. In a good many cases it is sufficient to warn people to exercise caution

JUNE 16, 1955
in approaching a railway track, or perhaps
to require motorists to stop at all railway
crossings. But something else will have to
be done too. While the amount of money set
aside under this legislation is quite large,
it will nevertheless not be sufficient to build
underpasses or overhead crossings everywhere in Canada. I feel that if people are
not educated to exercise reasonable care
there will continue to be many who will drive
into the side of trains.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: A moment ago the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) asked me if I had any
statisties on the number of people killed and
injured in level-crossing accidents. I have
since had an opportunity of glancing through
the report on the railway crossing problem
in Canada, which was prepared by the Board
of Transport Commissioners, to which report
I referred a few moments ago, and I find on

50437-401

page 16 a tablè setting- forth the nuhber, of
accidents and persons killed and injured from
the years 1908 -to 1952. With the consent of
the house this table could be printed in
Hansard.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: What are the figures
for 1952?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The figures for 1952
are- not quite complete. -They show only
that there were 463 accidents in that year.
The figures for 1951 show. a total of 490
accidents; that in the urban districts, 67
persons were killed and 213 injured; and in
the rural areas, 124 killed and 309 injured.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Have I the consent
of the house to put this table on Hansard?
I am sure it would be of interest to honourable senators.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

Hon. Mr. Isnor: Honourable senators, I rise
just to ask a question and at the same time
to compliment the Leader of the Government
on placing the purpose and objects of this
bill before us in such a clear manner. Anyone who has been driving on the highways
for a number of years will, I am sure, appreciate the value of this legislation.

I am at a loss to understand why although
there is a contribution of 60 per cent from
the Fund in the case of work done on a
crossing at rail level, the contribution is only
30 per cent in the case of improvement or
reconstruction of an existing grade separation. With the increased traffic and increased
speed and other dangers and hazards of

JUNE 16, 1955
today, and particularly when so much stress
is being laid on civil defence plans, I should
have thought that wherever there is a real
hazard and need for protection a maximum
contribution would be made, regardless of
the nature of the work. No doubt the Leader
intends to move that this bill be referred
to a committee. If so, I think it would be
well to inquire in committee why there is a
lower contribution toward the cost of work
on existing grade crossings than at rail level.
I am sure we all feel that this increase
in the appropriation from $1 million to $5
million is a step in the right direction. For
the sake of greater safety I sincerely trust
that there will not be $2.5 million or $3·5
million of an unspent balance in the fund,
but that the whole $5 million will be used
every year. Would you care to comment, Mr.
Leader?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have nothing to
add to what I said previously. The board
decided, after giving this matter most careful consideration, that a payment of 30 per
cent in connection with existing grade separations would be equitable. The railways
have been running over many of these grade
separations for years, the bridge or the
underpass is already there, and the increase
in danger, if any, is not caused by the railways; it is merely a result of increased
traffic over or under the railway, as the case
may be.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There has been an
increase in traffic on railways as well as on
the highways.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes; but the railway
can run just as well whether the old bridge
remains or a new bridge is built.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: But the object of the legislation is to overcome a hazard, is it not?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not say it is a
hazard. Reconstruction of an existing grade
separation might have the effect of enabling
highway traffic to move faster. There is not
much hazard in cars going over a bridge,
whether one or two at a time, but there
might be traffic jams, and if the bridge were
widened it would allow the traffic to move
faster along the highway.
Hon. Mr. Horner: But the railway is not
interfering with that traffic?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No, the railway is
not interfering at all. That is the reasoning
which the Board of Transport Commissioners
followed, I am sure, and I can see the reasonableness of their recommendation. The Government concurs in the proposal for 30 per
cent in this instance.

The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Now.
Some Hon. Senators: Next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Some honourable
senators suggest now, but I would suggest
not earlier than the next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Surely the bill is going to
be referred to a committee?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If the honourable
senator feels that the bill should be referred
to a committee, I have no objection.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: If I were to speak again
on this bill I know that I would be out of
order, but I feel it should go to committee
where a full discussion can be had on it.
For instance, I could cite the case of a subway
being built which is a real danger to the community, and all because of a mistake the
railway made a number of years ago.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have no objection
to referring the bill to committee.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Certainly, it should be
sent to committee.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I move that the bill
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, before
this bill is referred to the committee may I
question what end can be attained by doing
so. This legislation is based on the report of
a Government board which was directed to
make a report on the subject. It made its
report, and the Government by this legislation has adopted its recommendations. Surely
nothing we can do in committee will change
those recommendations. If we did, it would
be the first time I ever saw it happen.
I think the Government has done a very
wise thing bringing in this bill to increase
the annual appropriation. If I had spoken
on the bill I would have said that. I do not
want to in effect criticize the Government by
going to committee with this bill. As far as
I can see we can make no change in it at all
in committee. I think we ought to send bills
to committee only when there is a reasonable
hope that they can be improved by our action.
However, I have no objection, even if only
one member wants it referred.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: There can be no harm in
referring it to a committee.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig:

No; but the Government

may say, "What in the world is the use of
having a commission to investigate a matter
and report on it if the Senate refuses to
accept the report and argues about it in committee?" The report will not be changed: I
doubt if legally we have the power to change
it. I am not opposed to having the bill go
to committee, but to my mind it is just a
waste of time.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald, the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications.
PRAIRIE FARM REHABILITATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon.

F. W.

Gershaw moved

the second

reading of Bill 5, an Act to amend the Prairie
Farm Rehabilitation Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the Prairie
Farm Rehabilitation Act has been very helpful indeed, and the present amendment is
designed to facilitate its operation. If honourable members will bear with me for a few
minutes I will try to explain how the act
works and in what way the amendments
will improve it.
At the turn of the century the ranching
industry prospered very greatly in the area
where the act now operates. At that time
ranchers would lease for one cent an acrelater increased to two cents-as much as
100,000 acres of land; and horses and cattle
thrived on the nutritious native prairie
grass-grass which was cured by the autumn
sun and the wind, and provided feed during
the winter when the Chinooks melted the
snow; grass which for many centuries had
supported vast herds of buffalo. In the early
years of this century the dominion Government encouraged the incoming of settlers.
They divided up these large leases into
homesteads and pre-emptions, and people
from Eastern Canada, from Europe and, in
particular, from the northern States crowded
in to take advantage of this cheap land. Very
good crops were grown in 1915 and 1916;
but for many years there was drought; and
there was massive wind erosion and drifting
of the fertile soil. About this time of
year, because of the high winds, the crops
shrivelled up and failed to mature, bringing poverty and despair to the settlers.
In one year alone $80 million was dispersed
in relief by way of seed and fodder; in other
years, also, considerable relief was given;
and of this money very small amounts were
ever returned to the treasury.
As long ago as 1857, Captain Palliser, on
behalf of the British Government, made an
investigation of that short-grass country and

marked out a triangular area which he
decided was unfit for agriculture. In 1935,
when the late Viscount Bennett was Prime
Minister of this country, he recalled the fact
of the Palliser report; and knowing conditions as he did, realized the seriousness of
the situation and succeeded in having passed
the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act. The
next Government, in 1937, greatly enlarged
the scope of this measure, with the object
of helping the people who were settled in
the area and had met with such great disasters. There were three objects in view.
One was to put in effect better cultural. practices; another was to make better use of the
land; a third, and perhaps the most important, was water conservation. As regards the
first objective, the system adopted included
more summer-fallowing, the re-grassing of
certain areas, and the planting of trees. As
regards land utilization, a great deal of the
poorer land was taken out of cereal production altogether. Of that submarginal land,
one and three-quarter million acres was used
for pasture purposes; in sixty different localities areas were fenced in where cattle could
be fed during the summer months. Last year
there were on these pastures 105,000 cattle,
belonging to about 10,000 farmers who lived
nearby. All this work was done in the province of Saskatchewan; the province of Alberta
has never taken advantage of the provisions
of the dominion law relating to pasturage.
The chief activity of all was in connection
with water conservation. In the spring the
snow melts; ten or twelve inches of snow
will produce an inch of water; and fifty
thousand dug-outs have been constructed to
catch that spring run-off and to provide the
farmer with a pool of water for stockwatering, for his garden, and for general
use. The Government, of course, does the
engineering work free and provides amounts
ranging from $125 to $350 per dugout for
putting in reservoirs for stock-watering purposes. It also has directed its attention to
larger systems. In the West there are hills,
such as the Cypress Hills and Wood Mountain, in the Souris and Qu'Appelle valleys,
whose streams come down from the higher
land; and to utilize this supply the Government, bearing the entire capital cost, has
established 195 community projects, whereby
a large dam is built to store water to be used
during the summer for communities in the
locality.
Yet another activity is concerned with large
irrigation schemes such as the St. Mary-Milk
River scheme, where a large dam has been
built to hold the mountain streams which
descend the eastern slopes of the Rockies.
This particular dam is 186 feet high and a

JUNE 16, 1955
quarter of a mile at the base. It will contain
and hold enough water to irrigate 465,000
acres. Another undertaking, the Bow River
development, which is to supply water to
land at a cost of $20 to $25 an acre, is
nearing completion, and will irrigate about
240,000 acres. Larger schemes, connected with
the Red Deer and the South Saskatchewan
rivers, are being investigated. These will
provide, in addition to irrigation, electrical
energy, and one of them at least will supply
water to some of the cities. Up to the present
time about a million and a half acres have
been irrigated, and it is estimated that these
works can be expanded to irrigate at least
three million acres.
Already there have been marked improvements in living conditions. Prior to irrigation
a peddler, starting from some town which
was supplied with water, would go around
the country selling vegetables, small fruits,
margarine, and even milk to the farmers.
The introduction of irrigation methods enabled the farmers to grow fruits and vegetables and to raise poultry and dairy products.
Milk became available, and as a result the
farmer's children became healthier and
happier. The farms were no longer remote
homesteads and the farmers were able to
enjoy community life. With the production of
fruits and vegetables, canning factories, two
sugar beet factories, and several processing
plants were built in the area. However,
there is still a lot of land that can be irrigated.
The amendment in section 1 of the bill is
very simple and it is intended to do away with
delays. It simply means that the minister
can authorize a project that will cost up to
$15,000 instead of $10,000.
The second and only other section of the
bill, section 2, repeals sections 10 and Il of the
act. Section 10 of the act is being repealed
as it is no longer required. Formerly if a
minister wanted to buy a piece of land worth,
say, $10, he could not do so without referring
the matter to the Governor in Council. However, P.C. 4253, passed in 1952, allows any
minister, on the advice of his department, to
buy land up to the value of $15,000 without
referring the purchase to the Governor in
Council. Section 11(1) of the act deals with
the purchase or rent of machinery and equipment. Formerly a minister could not acquire
more than $5,000 worth of equipment without
the approval of the Governor in Council, but
the passing of the Financial Administration
Act in 1951 gave a department authority to
purchase machinery or equipment up to a
value of $15,000 without referring the purchase to the Governor in Council. Section
11(2) of the act deals with the disposal of

surpluses. Under the present arrangement
the Crown Assets Disposal Corporation has
the sole right to dispose of these surplus
products.
Honourable senators, in brief, the object of
this bill is to repeal sections 10 and 11, in
order to tidy up the act; and to change the
word "ten" to "fifteen" in section 9(2), so as
to permit a minister to proceed with projects
costing up to $15,000 without getting approval
of the Governor in Coundil.
I should be glad to answer any questions,
and if the bill is given second reading it could
be referred to committee.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Could the honourable senator inform the house who bears the cost of
these dugouts? Does the farmer or province
contribute anything or does the federal government bear the whole cost?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: The farmer does the
work and the federal government will give
him $125 for every dugout and $150 for every
dam. In the case of a larger dam which
irrigates a garden, the federal Government
will pay the farmer up to $350. Then you
have community schemes where water is
harnessed from the hills. There are 195 of
these schemes and the P.F.R.A. meets their
whole capital cost. As to bigger schemes like
the St. Mary's Milk River and the Bow River,
the dominion pays for the cost of the reservoirs and the connecting canals. Then the
provincial Government distributes the water
to the farmers. The St. Mary's project cost
the federal Government somewhere around
$12 million for the Spring Coulee dam and the
connecting canals. Another $12 million was
paid by the province in connection with building the laterals and for distributing the water,
but the province is entitled to recover whatever it can from the farmers. It will probably
recover the full amount as a result of water
rentals, and so on. The dominion's contribution is not recoverable.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Then in most instances the
federal Government pays the whole cost of
dugouts?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Not necessarily. If the
farmer estimates his time it would .probably
cost more than $125. He would be out the
difference. The Government only pays him
$125 for a small dugout.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I do not criticize the legislation but when one considers that Alberta is
almost the richest province in Canada and can
clear off its provincial debt, I wonder why it
should not be called upon to contribute to the
cost of these schemes.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Some of these schemes
are to be found in the "pool" province of

SENATE

Saskatchewan. I would like to ask the sponsor
of the bill if he knows whether any irrigation
bas been done as a result of the Sunnynook
dam that was built three or four years ago?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: I am sorry, I do not
know.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I saw that dam being
built. It is situated on the Westberry Creek
south of Hanna at Sunnynook and cost considerable money to build. When it was completed I saw some men demonstrating a new
sprinkler method of irrigation. They were
using a bunch of aluminum pipes. Evidently
the farmers have not taken advantage of the
system yet, but my son who lives near there
may use it this year. I know that the dam
created a lake eighteen miles long. It blocked
a roadway and caused many farmers to drive
greater distances to the grain elevator.
The honourable gentleman from Medicine
Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) referred to canning
factories at Brooks, Alberta. It is amazing
that the rather small acreage of fertile soil
there will supply all the needs of the canning
factories in the area. The same is true of
the sugar beet industry. If the farmers were
assured of a market they could grow sufficient
sugar beets there to supply the whole of
Canada. Just one irrigation scheme has made
that possible. However, a great deal of the
land around the Bassano dam is still used
for grazing of horses. If settlers came in by
the thousands, possibly the dam could be
used to very great advantage. There is lots
of land, and the soil is first class. A great
variety of vegetables could be grown if that
water were used. The last time I visited that
district I was told that this was one of the
finest places for fishing in the whole of
Alberta. I do not know if the Government
stocked the lake with fish or not, but I
noticed about a hundred cars parked there;
everybody seemed to be catching fish, which
weighed from eight to ten pounds. There
must be sufficient food to enable the fish to
grow to that size, yet they were evidently
hungry enough to take the bait.
For a number of years the seasons have
been more favourable for dry farming, but
no doubt the good years will come back
again, and through irrigation the farmers
will be able to grow alfalfa once more. The
irrigation method of providing crops with
water is all right for beets, peas and other
products which go to the canning factories,
but as a wheat growing proposition it is
pretty well out. I venture to say that 95
per cent of the farmers would not pay for
the cost of irrigation in an endeavour to raise

wheat. Many years ago I visited a farmer
in the wheat belt, and I said to him, "Why
don't you get some irrigated land?"
He
replied: "Well, I have a failure every other
year or so, but sometimes I am able to grow
sixty bushels to the acre, without any irrigation, and I figure that the cost of levelling
the land and the cost of the water would be
too high. I think I am making more money
than the men who are attempting to grow
wheat on irrigated land."
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable
member who explained the bill how much the
dominion Government bas paid out to date
for these policies in the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: The Government bas
expended $100 million in the four western
provinces, including British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Can the honourable member state how much the Government bas
spent in each of the provinces of Manitoba,
Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia and
Ontario?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: I am sorry, I cannot
give those figures now but I will try to obtain
them for my honourable friend.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Next sitting.

JUNE 16, 1955
APPENDIX
REPORT OF STANDING COMMITTEE ON FINANCE
(Presented by Hon. Mr. Crerar.

See p. 614)

THURSDAY, June 16, 1955.

The Standing Committee on Finance, to
whom were referred the Estimates laid before
Parliament for the fiscal year ending March
31, 1956, reports as follows:
On Wednesday, March 16 last, the Senate
passed the following reference to the Senate
Finance Committee:
That the Standing Committee on Finance be
authorized to examine the expenditures proposed
by the Estimates laid before Parliament for the
fiscal year ending March 31, 1956, in advance of
the bills based on the said Estimates reaching
the Senate: That the said committee be empowered
to send for records of revenues from taxation
collected by the federal, provincial and municipal
governments in Canada and the incidence of this
taxation in its effect upon different income groups,
and records of expenditures by such governments,
showing sources of income and expenditures of
same under appropriate headings, together with
estimates of gross national production, net national
income and movement of the cost-of-living index,
and their relation to such total expenditures, for
the year 1939 and for the latest year for which
such information is available, and such other
matters as may be pertinent to the examination of
the Estimates, and to report upon the same.
That the said committee be empowered to send
for persons, papers and records.

In reports of previous years your committee has sought to show the effect of inflation
upon public finance at all levels of government. That factor is still at work and is
reflected directly in unprecedented estimates
of the country's gross national wealth and
income. In this report, however, we simply
point out some high spots in connection with
the federal Government Estimates, which reflect continued increases in public spending.
We draw attention particularly to significant
increases in the numbers of civil servants
with special reference to the Department of
National Defence, and to high costs connected
with the construction of new buildings and
the reconstruction of old ones. Our examination of witnesses was confined altogether to
officials from the Treasury Board, the Civil
Service Commission, the National Defence
Department and the Department of Public
Works. Your committee has not been able to
have as many meetings, or give as much
detailed attention to the entire list of estimates as in previous years, owing to the
delayed reference to the committee in the
earlier part of the session; and to the preoccupation of many of our members with
other committee work.

CIVIL

SERVICE

INCREASES

Your committee did assemble data from
official sources showing the steady increase in
Civil Service personnel over recent years
(Exhibit 1). It will be noted from this data
that the paid servants of the Government
have increased in number more than fifteen
thousand in the last two years, mainly in the
Defence Department. The total in the Service
is now over 174,000.
In 1939 the cost of the Service in salaries
and wages was well under $80 million. For
the present fiscal year the total of Civil
Service salaries and wages exceeds $554 million. This latter, it may be added, is about
$40 million in excess of the previous year.
The introduction of the five-day week over a
large area of the Service has been responsible
to a considerable extent for this increase
which, of course, in the final analysis, has to
be paid by taxpayers throughout the land.
Evidence supplied by the Department of
Public Works showed that as the result of
the recent adoption of the five-day week, costs
of servicing public buildings in Ottawa alone
had been increased by $243,000.
Included in this exhibit also is a list of
Crown corporations, 23 in number. Many of
these Crown corporations pay their own way
and a few have substantial surpluses from
year to year in their operations. It should be
clearly kept in mind, however, that since
these are Crown corporations the Government must make good the deficits when any
of them fail to make ends meet. An illustration of this was the Canadian National Railways in 1954. It will be noted also that in
round figures the total employees in Crown
corporations at the end of 1954 numbered
138 thousand. If we combine these with the
Civil Service figures, excluding revenue postmasters who receive their remunerations
mostly from commissions, the total number of
persons directly and indirectly associated with
Government activities at February 28, 1955,
was over 312 thousand.
Included also is a summary of expenditures
for the current fiscal year compared with the
previous year, under the heading of "Standard Objects of Expenditures in Special Categories" (Exhibit 2). This shows the total

SENATE
expenditures by all departments for these
various purposes. Associated with this is
a statement of the amount each department
of Government contributed to these expenditures (Exhibit 3). This statement (found in
the pocket at the back of this report) provides the details of the summary just mentioned. This document was presented to
Parliament by the Minister of Finance along
with his annual estimates at the beginning
of this session. Your committee suggests
that all members of Parliament as well as
others interested in Public Affairs would find
a study of it useful.
COSTS OF PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION
The figures relating to the costs of certain
public buildings (Exhibit 4) in Ottawa, are
cited as an example of the increasing expenditures connected with Government Buildings everywhere.
The officials from the
Public Works Department, in their evidence,
pointed out that plans and estimates for all
such construction are now subject to the
close examination and approval of committees
of departmental officials, as well as by the
members of Treasury Board. The Public
Works Department is now trying to bring all
Federal public building under its supervision,
as provided by the Public Works Act. During
the war years and the immediate post-war
period, much building expansion was initiated
and undertaken directly by other departments;
and we think that the present trend to restore
all such activities to the control of the Public
Works Department should bring greater
efficiency and greater economy.
GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT
We mention here a statement showing the
gross national product and national income
for the years 1939 and 1945 to 1954 inclusive
(Exhibit 5).
Your committee emphasizes
the importance of this exhibit. The gross
national product is the total of gross earnings
of all the Canadian people in all their varied
activities. This is the index to the economic
health of the nation. If this gross product
expands steadily year after year, a broader
basis for taxation results. It thus follows
that a given rate of taxation will produce
increasing revenue as the national product
increases; and conversely if expenditures are
held down taxes can be reduced. However,
if for any reason the gross product fails to
increase, or declines, less revenue is produced
from taxes and, with the same given expenditures, deficits are the consequence. This
happened in 1954 when gross product declined, as against 1953, well over $400 million,
accounted for mainly by a large measure of
crop failure in the Prairie Provinces, and

a higher ratio of unemployment due to curtailment of markets. It is clear now that the
competition between the larger countries of
the world for markets is becoming more intense and this competition may well force
downwards the prices we receive for our
exports. Any serious decline in prices, and
more important, any loss of markets due to
causes beyond our control would be bound to
react adversely on the total of our gross
National Product. This feature of our economy
cannot carry too heavy emphasis.
It may be added here that the difference
between the gross national product and the
net national income is accounted for very
largely by charges against gross income of
such things as depreciation and obsolescence.
REVENUES

AND

EXPENDITURES

Exhibit 6 is a summary of net general
combined revenues and expenditures of all
Governments in Canada for the years 1939,
1945 and 1950 to 1955 inclusive. The amounts
for 1954 and 1955 are estimated but can
be considered to be approximately correct.
In previous reports this data was further
analyzed, giving the main sources from which
revenues were derived by all Governments
and the main purposes for which money was
expended. We regret that this cannot be
included in the present report. The Bureau
of Statistics, which in the past has supplied
this information, has been for some time
engaged in the preparation of similar data
for the coming Federal-Provincial Conference
in October next, and this naturally had first
priority.
Your committee would emphasize the importance of this data on revenues and
expenditures by all Governments, which
means municipal Governnents, provincial
Governments and the federal Government.
For example, in 1950, the revenue of all
Governments combined was roughly $4 billion, 300 million, and their expenditures $4
billion, 100 million. In 1954 the total collected
in revenue was almost $5 billion, 950 million
and the expenditures were $6 billion, 370
million. For 1955 (estimated) the corresponding figures are, revenue $6 billion 158 million,
and expenditures $6 billion, 695 million.
There is an indication here of a tendency
to increasing expenditures beyond the needs
of the normal increase in population. This
means what is generally known as "deficit
financing".
It becomes epidemic and increasingly affects all public financing-municipal and provincial as well as federal. What
happens if this tendency continues and
through possible inability to find markets for
our products at profitable prices our economy
slows down? Your committee feels that this

of where the responsibility for governing lies,

item is, of course, the outlay associated with
the defence services. It is not possible to
forecast how these defence expenditures may
proceed, but it appears to be a safe assumption that they will continue without much
change for several years. Our responsibility

Equally, when Governments have to borrow
to meet deficits, the danger signals are definitely flying. Surely it is possible for Governments to economize both in small things
and large things, and thereby set a good
example to individuals in the nation everywhere.
Above all, it is important to keep alive
in the minds of all the people of the nation
an understanding of what freedom means.

People may clamour for security-many are
doing that today-but it should never be forgotten that if personal freedom is sacrificed
for personal security provided by Governments, the individual can have no guarantee
that in the end he will have either freedom or
security.
All of which is respectfully submitted.

DIVORCE STATISTICS
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable sena-

tors, I am sure all members of the house, and
particularly those who are members of the
Standing Committee on Divorce, will be

pleased that I am able to report that all
petitions for divorce ready to be heard at this
session have been dealt with. The committee
has completed its work so far as the hearing
of divorce petitions and evidence is concerned,
so I am in a position tonight to present the
committee's 427th and final report for this
session. I propose to read it and to make
some comments as I go along, and I shall
certainly make some further comments when
I have read the report.
For the present session 473 petitions for bills
of divorce were presented to the Senate and dealt
with by the Standing Committee on Divorce, as
follows:
407
Petitions heard and recommended ....
7
Petitions heard and rejected ..........
11
Petitions withdrawn ...................
48
Petitions not proceeded with .........
Total

...............................

473

May I point out that the 48 petitions were
not proceeded with because the litigants were
not prepared to go on, and not by any wish
of the committee.
Of the petitions recommended during the present
session of Parliament, 124 were by husbands and
283 were by wives.

Perhaps the lady senators may have some
comments to make on that inequality of
division as between husbands and wives-no
doubt to the disparagement of the husbands.
Hon. Mrs. Fallis: The figures speak for
themselves.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The report continues:
Of the petitions recommended during the present
session of Parliament, one was from a petitioner
domiciled in the province of Newfoundland, and

406 were from petitioners domiciled in the prov-

ince of Quebec.
The petitioner domiciled in the province of Newfoundland was a wife.
Of the 406 petitioners domiciled in the province
of Quebec, 124 were husbands and 282 were wives.
The committee met on 52 days and held a total
of 190 meetings, of which 138 were meetings of

tioned in four sections.

Or, more properly, four subcommittees.
On 23 days the committee functioned in three
sections. On 10 days the committee functioned in
two sections. On 9 days the committee functioned
in one section.

On the nine days when the committee functioned in only one section the case in hand
was continued from day to day. One case
in particular occupied the committee for four
consecutive days. The reason why the com-

mittee functioned as four subcommittees for

JUNE 21, 1955
only ten days was that there were not sufficient cases completed and ready for hearing
to occupy the four subcommittees for a
longer time. A great deal of work is done
by the Committees Branch of the Senate in
an effort to have counsel prepare their cases
for hearing as soon as possible. Had many
of the cases been prepared with greater
promptitude the committee's work would
have been completed long before this date.

in Canada during the years 1950 to 1954, both

Honourable senators will note from those
figures that in 1954 the increase over 1950
for all Canada was about 425. The figures
for Ontario are perhaps of interest to the
house: in 1954 there was an increase over
1950 of only slightly more than 100 in
the number of divorces granted by the
Ontario courts. British Columbia seems to be
doing very well in the matter of numbersin 1950 there were 1,377 divorces granted in
that province, and in 1954, 1,471.
I thought it interesting to observe the
distinction between husbands and wives, as
petitioners, over the last few years. The
same trend, you will observe, applies to all
Canada as to the two provinces from which
divorce petitions are made to Parliament.
The following statement shows a comparison
between the number of divorces granted to busbands and wives respectively in the years mentioned.

Now I would like to make one or two,
comments on matters that are not mentioned
in the report. First, I would like to call
attention to the very excellent attendance of
most of the senators who are members of
this committee. I think that credit shoul4
be given where credit is due. The one who
stands highest on the attendance list, and to
whom I think perhaps the Harbour Commissioner's hat should be awarded, is Senator
Golding.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: He attended on 51 days
of the 52 days on which the committee sat,
and on the one day he was absent I rather
suspect that he lost his vote. I suspect so
because he abandoned his duties to the
Divorce Committee in order to perform his
duty as a voter in the province of Ontario.
I think Senator Golding should be given a
very high award for complete attendance.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Give him an Oscar.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The second member
who deserves high commendation is Senator
Barbour, who attended on 47 days.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I can pass over myself,
because I was present on only 40 days.
I can hardly emphasize too strongly the
wonderful service that has beén given to the
committee by both the medical men who are
members, Senator Howden and Senator
Gershaw.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The value of their
advice has simply been beyond calculation.
Senator Howden attended on 39 days.
As a lawyer I suppose I should not bow to
the other lawyers who are members of the
committee, but I do wish to point out that
Senator Ross has performed a great service.
He attended on 35 days, and was chairman of
a subcommittee, I think, on practically every
one of those days.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I would also like to say,
if you will permit me, how much I have
valued the services of the two lady senators
on this committee.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In my judgment the
sense of responsibility exhibited by Senator
Hodges and Senator Fergusson toward their
duties on this committee was magnificent.
If their attendance record is not quite as high
as somebody else's, it is because they have
also been serving on other important committees. Senator Hodges attended on 33 days;
Senator Fergusson, on 32 days.
Senator Hawkins served 29 days; Senator
Farquhar, 26 days. And Senator Gershaw,
who was away for a period but who when he
vas here was a constant attendant, served
26 days.
As to the other members of the committee,
who served less than 25 days, I do not think
I, need mention the exact figures on their
attendance.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But I must make special
reference to Senator Aseltine. In a sense he
is regarded as an honorary member of the
Divorce Committee, because for a long period
of years he was a very active member and for
no less than ten years served as the committee's .chairman. I have not thought it appro-priate to ask him to give very constant service
as a member of the committee, but he has
substituted for the chairman of the general

committee on a number of occasions, and always when he has been asked to do so.
Senator Haig and Senator Macdonald are,
of course, ex officio members of the committee
in their respective capacities as Leader of
the Government and Leader of the Opposition;
and may I say that I have greatly valued
the attendance of each of them, when their
other duties have permitted them to be present.
Particularly were we all pleased at the recent
attendance of the Leader of the Government,
when a general discussion took place in which
be was complimentary-I think, not undulyto the members of the committee.
I have a further statement which, instead
of reading in full, I would ask consent to
place on Hansard.
The following information has been obtained by
reviewing 364 cases heard by the committee at
the present session of Parliament:
The average duration of the actual marriage,
that is from the date of marriage to the date of
separation, was 8-2 years.
In 35 cases the marriage lasted 1 year; in 24
cases the marriage lasted 2 years; in 36 cases
the marriage lasted 3 years; in 34 cases the
marriage lasted 4 years; in 25 cases the marriage
laster 5 years; in 23 cases the marriage lasted 6
years; in 23 cases the marriage lasted 7 years; in
17 cases the marriage lasted 8 years; in 19 cases
the marriage lasted 9 years; in 18 cases the marriage lasted 10 years; in 17 cases the marriage
lasted 11 years; in 14 cases the marriage lasted
12 years; in 10 cases the marriage lasted 13 years;
in 7 cases the marriage lasted 14 years; in 9 cases
the marriage lasted 15 years; in 7 cases the
marriage lasted 16 years; in 6 cases the marriage

the marriage lasted 27 years; in 2 cases the marriage lasted 29 years; in 1 case the marriage lasted
33 years; in 1 case the marriage lasted 36.
The shortest period of marriage was 12 days. The
longest period of marriage was 36 years. Of the
364 cases reviewed, 192 had children and 172 had
none.

I may say that the reason that not all the
cases were reviewed was that the review was
not commenced until after the Divorce Com-

mittee had been sitting some little time. I
thought it would be helpful to the house to
know the average duration of the actual
marriage. I had supposed that most of the
divorces were of rather newly married
couples, but the figures do not bear out that
assumption. The brevity of the shortest
period of marriage, namely twelve days,
requires some explanation. On the twelfth
day after the wedding the husband confided
to his wife that he had a common-law wife
and a very considerable family, so that his
legal wife was not his only financial obligation; and she left him at once. As to the final

JUNE 21, 1955
statement-that of the 364 cases reviewed,
192 had children and 172 had none-it may
be interesting, at least to moralists, to know
that 50 per cent of the families in which there
were applications for divorce had no children;
and it has seemed to me that that fact was,
in some cases, the reason for the application.
One more matter of comment, if honourable
senators will permit me. I wish to say, and
I say it quite honestly, and I mean the words
I use, that no body charged with a responsibility such as ours was ever served better,
more faithfully, more thoughtfully and more
industriously by its staff than this Committee
on Divorce has been. It has a considerable
staff, headed by Mr. Harvey Armstrong, Chief
Clerk of Committees, whose knowledge,
attention and ability are thoroughly appreciated by the members of our committee.
The Assistant Chief Clerk of Committees,
Mr. John Hinds, has served as clerk of No. 4
subcommittee; but his more important duty
has been, in each case, to check the papers,
payment of fees, advertising of notices, service
of process and all that sort of thing, and to
make sure that all the particulars and requirements of the Rules have been complied with.
In the ordinary courts those duties are left
to the judge: he bas to check the advertising
and the proofs are made before him. Not so
in this committee. That work is done by the
staff, who certify to our committees that the
Rules have been complied with; and the duty
is an important one. Mr. James D. MacDonald,
clerk of the general committee, and also clerk
of No. 1 subcommittee, has kept the minutes
of the committee and performed many funetions, including the statistical work whose
results I have just presented. He has been
a most valuable assistant, at the hearings, in
preparing for the hearings, and afterwards.
Mr. Gerard Lemire, clerk of No. 2 committee,
and Mr. Fred Fortier, clerk of No. 3 committee, have performed their tasks most
acceptably. I might also mention Mr. Walter
Mathews and Mr. Ralph Ells, court criers,
who, by the way, perform a good many other
services besides announcing cases and calling
witnesses. Perhaps I may also be permitted
to mention Mrs. Bertha Anderson, who as
stenographer has worked industriously very
many hours on the multifarious types of documents required in these proceedings. I would
like also to say something about the Debates
and Reporting Branch. The work of the
reporters is so smoothly done that one hardly
notices their presence' at the hearings, but
it is arduous, it requires the closest of attention and a great deal of skill and industry.
The staff, under Mr. Lake, the Chief of the
branch, has performed its services this session
with 100 per cent competence. I will mention

one other official-our highly learned, exceedingly efficient, wise and helpful legal counsel,
Mr. John F. MacNeill, Q.C. This year the
committee-or more correctly, the chairman
of the committee-has referred a good many
legal problems to Mr. MacNeill. It is a very
good practice: there is no doubt about the
legality of asking our legal counsel for a
written opinion. He has responded on all
occasions with capable, readable, wise and
useful memoranda. The Senate is fortunate
in having a legal counsel of the capacity of
Mr. MacNeill. I should also like to mention
his very likable and efficient secretary, Mrs.
Jean Sutherland.
Honourable senators, that is my report for
the moment. I thank you for your patience in
listening to all the details.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I feel I should not let this occasion pass
without extending on behalf of all senators
our appreciation to the chairman and the
members of his committee for the faithful
services they have rendered to Parliament
during the past session.
The divorce statistics give us some idea
of the time required to dispose of these cases.
This session 473 petitions were filed, 407
of which were granted and 7 were refused.
This means that the committee heard and
made decisions on a total of 414 cases. The
fact that the committee sat for 52 days gives
the house some idea of how much time its
members devoted to this work. It is a committee to which none of us seeks appointment;
we do not compete with one another in order
to serve. But it is very gratifying to know
there are so many who are willing to give
of their time and ability to this committee,
whose function is essential under our present
constitution.
It was my privilege to attend the final meeting of the Divorce Committee this session.
Having attended other meetings during this
and previous years and having some knowledge of the way divorces are handled in
our courts. I can say that the committee considers applications just as carefully and
thoroughly as does any court in the land.
I am very happy to know that the Senate
has men and women who are competent to
do this work and who do it so sacrificingly,
without consideration of the time and effort
involved. I take this opportunity to thank
the chairman and the members of the committee for the services which they have
rendered to the Senate, to Parliament and to
our country.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

that before the next session we have got to
work out some system whereby we will have
continuous sittings of the divorce committee
from about the opening of the session to
Easter, and from when we resume after the
Easter recess until prorogation in order that
the committee may function throughout that

should be asked to make provision for additional compensation for the senators who stay
in Ottawa over the week-ends to do the work
of the Divorce Committee. In my case my

Honourable senators, I should like to deal
with a matter raised tonight by the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) in his report. He referred to divorce
procedure in British Columbia. I would point
out that that province has shortened the time
after which a decree nisi for divorce can be
made final to one month.

JUNE 21, 1955
members will not desist from criticizing the
work of the Divorce Committee in the Senate,
they should come forward and do the work
themselves, if they think they can do it
better. The members of this house serve on
the committee from necessity and with a feeling of responsibility toward the people of
Quebec and Newfoundland. We feel that
people who are unhappy in the marriage state
and need to be separated have a right to
consideration, and for the people of those
provinces we have provided a committee to
hear their petitions and give them relief. If
we refused that service those people would
be unable to get relief.
To repeat, honourable senators, I suggest
that at the opening of the next session the
Leader of the Government in the Senate-in
whose ability to arrange the interview I have
every confidence-together with the Chairman
of the Divorce Committee, and probably
someone from the opposition-I am willing to
go myself-should confer with the Prime Minister to see if something can be arranged
along the lines I have suggested. I do not
think it is fair that honourable senators, both
men and women, should work from ten
o'clock in the morning until one o'clock, and
perhaps from 2.30 to five o'clock in the afternoon, while the rest of the members do
nothing. The house sits for about three days
a week for short periods of time, largely in
order that the divorce committee can continue in session. I make the suggestion in
good faith, and with ten years' experience
as a member of the divorce committee.
I feel very strongly that the constant irritation caused by remarks such as were heard
over the radio the other night, and from jibes
by members of the House of Commons, are
not deserved by this house, and particularly
the members of our Divorce Committee. The
sooner such critics realize that the Senate is
doing a public service as part of its obligation
under the terrns of Confederation, the better
for Canada. I would say that this one case
ought to be answered. I also say that next
session a conference should be held to see if
some arrangement can be made whereby
honourable senators who are not serving on
the divorce committee may sit in committee
if there is work to do, and if there is no work
to do the house should adjourn for two or
three weeks. That is not a new idea. I was
here when that was customary, and the Senate
was not abused any more then than it is now.
I recall that the late Senator Dandurand,
when he was leader in this house, used to say:
"Honourable senators, there is nothing more
on the Order Paper, and therefore I move
we adjourn for two weeks. By that time,
I hope the other house will have some legislation ready for us to deal with."

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am sure the Chairman of the Divorce Committee would not
object to more members on his committee.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, indeed.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am sure he would
welcome them.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But certain members will
not serve. If you care to take a count of
how many are willing to serve, you will be
surprised.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Of members who are
sitting around week-ends?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Some of those who are in
Ottawa at week-ends will not serve, either.
Hon. Mr. Reid: This is all foolish talk
about honourable senators doing nothing at
week-ends. We do not all sit around idle
during that time.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But the point is that the
house sits three short days a week, so that
the Divorce Committee -can be kept going.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Oh, no, no. Every
day this house has been in session so far
we have had legislation or some other matter
to discuss.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Will the honourable leader
not agree with me that this house sits for
about two and a half hours a day?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think my work day
is closer to twelve and a half hours a day.
The house may sit for two and a half hours
in the afternoons, but committees also sit in
the mornings for two and a half hours. I
do not think members of this house have
much idle time on their hands if they are
attending to their duties.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My honourable friend cannot say that to me. If he will look at the
record he will find that my record is better
than his in attendance on committees.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I agree. I was not
making a reference to my honourable friend.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.

may ask him a question, with his permission,

honourable senator can follow him. He can
be interrupted by a question, but only with
his permission. The order and procedure of
this house must be observed. Will the
Honourable Leader of the Opposition please
continue?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I will
conclude by saying that although my suggestion may not be acceptable to the house, it
is my view, and I wanted to express it on
this occasion so that there will be lots of
time to consider the matter. I am not asking
the Leader of the Government or the members of this house to make any rash decision;
it will be perhaps six months before the next
session commences.

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Hardy: Mr. Speaker, may I suggest that this debate is getting far afield from
the report presented by the Chairman of the

is the usual affidavit accepted in ail courts as
sufficient prima facie evidence of service, and
it is neither "sloppy" nor "incompetent" on
the part of the Senate committee to rely upon
it, particularly when it is unchallenged by
any negative suggestion.
In this case challenge was clearly impossible, for the respondent himself has since

admitted that after service be left Canada
for Europe without consulting solicitors, instructing counsel, or notifying the Senate by
letter or otberwise of bis intended departure

This failure to communicate, by any means,
with the Sienate is remarkable for two reasons;
first, because tbe respondent is a lawyer and
must know sometbing of tbe significance of
legal process; and, second, because in the
Notice of Information for Respondent attached
to the petition is a ciearly expressed warning
that if be desires to oppose tbe granting of
tbe divorce prayed for by the petitioner, be

to tbe Clerk of the Senate; failing wbich a

Senate itself is well used ta unjust and un-'
founded criticism, and usually is littie concerned, but I submit tbat this bonourableý
body cannot and sbouid not tolerate the
slandering of witnesses wbo testify under
oath before it or any of its committees. The
Senate Committee on Divorce is most vigilant
to protect fromn abuse tbe witnesses wbo:
corne before it, and ta, me it is a matter of
grave concern ta find a government institution sucb as the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation perrnitting tbe use of its facilities
for sucb purposes.
As a make-weigbt; to bis misstatements of
the Hart case, Mr. Fraser refers ta two
divorce proceedings of hast session. He says:
Last year they (the C.C.F.> managed to block one:
divorce bill in whieh, it turned out, ail the evidence,
against a crippled wif e was fabricated and perjured.

The case referred ta is clearly identified,
as that of Lucien L'Esperance, for it is tbe
only one to wbicb tbe C.C.F. applied blocking i
tactics and in wbicb the respondent wife
migbt be or bas been described as crippled.
In this case tbere bas been no finding by;
any responsible body of eltber perjury ori
fabrication by anyone, nor is there any evidence by anyone as against anyone involved;
of sucb a crime. Tbere were five witnesses:
wbo testified bef are the Senate Committee
in the L'Esperance matter, including the petitioner, wha are tbus libelhed in Mr. Fraser's
written statem ent, and slandered by bimn in,
the national broadcast. The case was referred'
back by the Commons ta its Prîvate Bills
Committee, but tbat was because the C.C.F.'
attackers and others bad reported the bill
before reading tbe evidence, and not because
tbere was evidence of perjury, and wben the
husband witbdrew bis petition, be stated in,
writing tbat bie dîd Sa because of the publicity, which we were told by bis counsel was,
injuring bis business, and because of tbe protestation of bis wif e.
Mr. Fraser says that "nobody in tbat or
any otber case hias been prosecuted for perjury". If Mr. Fraser bas evidence of perjury
in tbat case, bis remedy is a complaint ta
the Crown Attorney naming the persans
accused, and not by way of a nation-w 'ide
smear upon the busband and ail bis witnesses.
Last year I told tbe bouse of a charge of
perjury arising cut of testimony given before
a Senate committee in support of a petitian for
divorce, in wbicb the accused was convicted
and sentenced ta two years li prison.

SENATE
Mr. Fraser refers to "another case, also
blocked by the C.C.F." in which, he says,
"examination showed that three men testified
under oath that they were all standing on a
ladder together, apparently side by side".
The purpose of this recital is to ridicule the
evidence upon which the Senate committee
is supposed to have acted, and it is a downright misstatement of fact. There was other
and additional evidence before the committee,
and the three men did not so testify nor did
any one of them. The evidence given by the
men was that two of them mounted the ladder,
which was big and strong and very wide, and
that it was not until the two came down that
the third man went up.
It is unbecoming to one who misstates evidence so flagrantly to refer to others as
sloppy and incompetent.
It is unnecessary for me to defend the
Senate decision in the Delorme case-that
is the one that has just been referred to-for
as a result of the blocking mentioned, the
Commons Private Bills Committee recalled the
witnesses and reheard the entire evidence,
after which the committee reported the bill,
having reached the same decision as made by
the senators. Nevertheless, the blocking continued; the bill was "talked out" and died on
the Order Paper. It bas been passed again
by the Senate at this session and is now
again before the Commons. If there is virtue
to be found in such blocking, I am sure that
the litigants, who have borne the additional
expense, will not appreciate it.
Hon. William H. Golding: Honourable senators, I would like to add something to what
the Chairman of our Divorce Committee bas
already said and to congratulate him on the
very efficient and effective way in which he
has dealt with a broadcast by Mr. Blair
Fraser in C.B.C. News Roundup last week.
It will not be necessary for me to deal
with statements made by Mr. Fraser in regard
to some of the cases he spoke of in his broadcast, as the honourable Chairman has already
done so very effectively. However, I do feel
that I should say a word or two about the
Hart case, on which Mr. Fraser spent the
major portion of his time in this particular
broadcast.
The Hon. the Speaker: If the honourable
senator will permit me, unless he rises on
a question of privilege his remarks are quite
out of order, I have no desire to interfere, if
it is the wish of the bouse that he continue
with his statement.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The honourable senator was chairman of the subcommittee which
heard the case.

The Hon. the Speaker: If it is the will of
the bouse that he continue, it will be in order
for him to do so.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: As a matter of information, may I ask His Honour the Speaker if
other members of this house are to be permitted to discuss the same subject on a point
of privilege?
The Hon. the Speaker: I am suggesting it
is not in order to do so unless the house,
which is all wise in this matter, gives its
unanimous consent. As the honourable senator has unanimous consent, he may proceed.
Hon. Mr. Golding: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
As I say, I feel that I should add a word or
two about the Hart case, on which Mr. Fraser
spent the major portion of his time in this
particular broadcast.
This case was heard on Friday, January 21
last, by a subcommittee composed of Honourable Mrs. Fergusson, Honourable Mr. Farquhar and myself, as chairman. This was a case
in which I am quite sure none of us who
heard it ever expected to be criticized for
having decided to recommend the divorce, as
the respondent offered no defence at all. I
have no intention of referring to the details
of the evidence of adultery, other than to
say that it was most convincing; but I do
feel that in justice to our subcommittee and
to the petitioner, I should say something
about the evidence she gave under oath when
her case was heard.
As shown by page 9 of the evidence, she
was asked what had caused the break-up
between herself and her husband, and her
answer was as follows:
My husband was very violent, he abused me,
and used to strike me frequently in front of the
children; life with him was impossible.

The same page of the evidence shows she
was asked if her husband has contributed to
the support of the children. Her answer was
very definite:
No, he did not. I have supported the children
throughout the entire marriage period.

The petitioner also stated that she had not

lived with her husband since the spring of
1953. At that time she took action in the
civil court in Montreal for a judicial separation and for the custody of her children.
Judgment was given in her favour at that
time.

The fact that the petitioner had been given
custody of the children was a strong point
in her favour.
The respondent is a lawyer, evidently well
known in Montreal. No doubt he had every
opportunity to submit his side of the case

JUNE 21, 1955
to the civil court in Montreal when the custody action was heard, but it is quite evident
that he was flot; able to make a very favourable impression on those who had the responsibility of dealing with his case.
I have made inquiries from our officiais
and I arn advised that at no time has Mr.
Fraser asked for any information regarding
any of the cases he referred to in this broadcast last week.
It is certainly not for me or any member
of the Senate to advise Mr. Fraser of the
responsibilities he assumes when he uses the
facilities of the C.B.C. or the press to give
our people the news as he sees it from, time
to time. However, I must assume that he
knows the Canadian people do expect to hear
news reports which are as fair and accurate
as possible. Therefore, it may be advisable
for him, to try to get his information from
reliable sources as far as it is possible for him
to do so. I amn sure he will agree with this,
if he places any value on his prestige as a
reporter.
There is only one other point I wish to, refer
to. Evidently the petitioner in the Hart case
re-married after her petition was finally
approved by Parliament. It is alleged that

she has married a professional detective who
has given evidence in many cases before our
divorce court. I amn afraid that in some way
the public has been led to believe that this
gentleman had something to do with getting
the petitioner's case through our court. That,
honourable senators, is not; true, as far as wç
know. This gentleman did not; appear before
us at ail, as the evidence-which is available
for any honourable senator to read-clearly
shows. In any case the petitioner, after her
case had been decided, had a perfect right
to marry any person she wished to, and as
far as I am concerned I hope that if these
people, as it is rumoured, are now married,
they will be happy together.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Haig: Will the honourable senator
explain whether the one and a half million
dollars spent in Manitoba for land protection
and reclamation has to do with the Winnipeg
floods of 1950?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: I assume that this
money, which was expended under the
Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act, was applied
to the repair of damage caused by the floods,
and for the protection of the Assiniboine.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Those were the two items
off expenditure?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Otherwise not much money
was expended in Manitoba. 1 notice a somewhat similar item of nearly $3 million in relation to British Columbia, presumably for
dyking because of the flooding of the Fraser
river.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
TORONTO HARBOUR RAILWAY TRACKS
AGREEMENT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. G. Peter Campbell moved the second
reading of Bill 262, an Act to approve an
agreement between The Toronto Harbour
Commissioners, The Toronto Terminals Railway Company, Canadian National Railway
Company and Canadian Pacific Railway
Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the principle
involved in this bill is simply the approval by
Parliament of an agreement entered into by
the parties designated in the bill. By way of
explanation I might review briefly the history
of the Toronto Harbour Commission and the
purpose of certain changes which have been
or are proposed to be made with respect to
the operation of the railways crossing the
lands of the commission.
In 1911 The Toronto Harbour Commissioners Act was passed. It vested all the
harbour lands in the city of Toronto, including the docks and the facilities for loading
and unloading ships, in The Toronto
Harbour Commissioners, giving them full
power to construct all facilities for the transportation of goods to the harbour property
and the discharge of cargoes from the ships,
to levy dues, and so forth. There are five
commissioners, of whom three are appointed
by the Toronto City Council on recommendation of the Board of Control of that city, one
is appointed by the Governor General in
Council as the dominion representative, and
the fifth is appointed by order in council on
the recommendation of the Board of Trade
of the city of Toronto.

During the development of the harbour
facilities it became necessary to erect service
railway spurs connecting with the main lines
of the Canadian Pacific Railway and the
Canadian National Railway. The Toronto
Harbour Commissioners undertook the erection of these spur lines, and since their construction have paid the cost of maintenance.
In recent years additional burdens have been
put upon The Toronto Harbour Commissioners; and there has been a very substantial
increase in traffic. Now an agreement has
been entered into between the railways and
the Harbour Commissioners providing for the
maintenance of those lines by a company
known as The Toronto Terminal Railway
Company, which is owned jointly by the
Canadian National Railway Company and
the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.
I may say that The Toronto Terminals
Railway Company was incorporated, I believe,
in 1906, about the time that the Union Station
was being constructed. It has held certain
lands which were jointly operated by the
two railways for the benefit of the passengers
travelling to and from the city of Toronto.
Under its act of incorporation the Toronto
Terminals Railway Company has no power
to enter into this agreement, but the Toronto
Harbour Commissioners have full power to
do so. For that reason it becomes necessary
to have an act of Parliament approving the
agreement. Therefore, the bill before us
simply incorporates the agreement as a
schedule to the bill, and it provides that the
agreement is approved and confirmed, and
that the covenants therein contained are
declared to be within the powers of the
parties thereto and binding upon them.
As to the cost of maintaining the railway
spur lines, I may say that no charge was
previously made to the railways. But on
account of the heavy traffic that now passes
over these lines it has been agreed between
the railway companies that a charge of $1.50
per loaded freight car shall be paid by the
railways and placed in a fund to take care
of the rehabilitation and maintenance of the
lines which belong to the Toronto Harbour
Commissioners.
The agreement sets forth in detail other
operating arrangements between the parties,
and these will be fully explained when the
bill goes to committee. There are only one
or two of these arrangements which might
interest the house at this time. One is that
the traffic over the spur lines last year,
totalling about 70,000 cars, on the basis of
$1.50 per loaded freight car, would mean a
revenue of about $105,000. It is estimated
that this will increase to approximately
$120,000. The bookkeeping arrangements between the parties, under this agreenent,

Hon. Mr. Campbell: Yes.
By the time that period of five years had

SENATE

expired, pressure-accumulated pressurehad been brought to bear upon the federal
treasury from other municipalities throughout Canada to have grants provided for them
as well as for the City of Ottawa.
That is why the Municipal Grants Regulations of 1950 came into existence, and also
why they made provision for grants to all
municipalities which qualified for same under
a certain formula prescribed in the regulations. It is interesting to note that under this
formula, which came into effect on January 1,
1950, the grant to the City of Ottawa was
increased to approximately $1 million-actually $962,392.
In 1951 the act known as the Municipal
Grants Act, which superseded the regulations, came into effect. It is that act which
the bill now before us proposes to amend.
I will now deal specifically with this bill.
Under its provisions a municipality will
qualify for payments in lieu of taxes provided the federal property in that municipality exceeds in value 2 per cent of the
combined value of taxable and Federal property, and the Federal property receives the
usual urban services from the municipality.
This is a reduction from the previous minimum requirement of 4 per cent, and is by
far the most important change in the act,
although there are other liberalizing features.
For instance, under the act as it now stands
the grant paid is limited to 75 per cent of
a tax rate applied to the value of the Federal
property exceeding 4 per cent. Under the
provisions of the amending bill, which is now
before us, the payment will be on 100 per
cent of the value of all Federal property in
a municipality which comes within the 2 per
cent formula.
I should perhaps point out that there is a
provision in this bill whereby the federal
Government will pay the full taxes equivalent
on a certain type of property. I refer to
Crown-owned dwellings occupied by employees of the Crown or by members of the armed
forces. In general terms, this can be referred
to as residential property owned by the
Crown. On such property the equivalent of
full taxes is paid.
For the fiscal year ending March 31, 1955,
under the Municipal Grants Program the total
payments made to municipalities were

$3,047,000. It is estimated that under the
provisions of this bill the payments to municipalities for the fiscal year ending March 31,
1956, will amount to a sum somewhere in
the neighbourhood of $7 million.
In conclusion, I should point out that if a
municipality desires to claim the benefits of
the present act and has not done so, it must
make application before the first day of July,
1955. The bill which is now before us provides that the act, as amended, will be
deemed to have come into force as of the
first day of January, 1955.
Honourable senators, the bill was referred
to the House of Commons Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce, was considered
by the Committee of the Whole and eventually received the unanimous consent of the
house. Virtually the only objection raised
in the other house was that the grants were
not large enough. When the Minister of
Finance introduced the bill he said it was
a rather complicated measure. I have tried
to explain some of its more important features, and I would recommend the bill to
the favourable consideration of this house.
If it receives second reading tonight I shall
move that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Reid, the debate
was adjourned.
DIVORCE PETITIONS
REPORTS OF COMMITTEE CONCURRED

IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the reports of the Standing Committee on
Divorce, Nos. 425 and 426, dealing with
petitions for divorce.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck, Chairman of the
Committee, moved that the reports be
concurred in.
He said: Honourable senators, may I point
out that in both instances these petitions were
refused, so that these reports will not be
followed by bills. These two cases are the
last to be reported by the committee, and
therefore these reports conclude the divorce
work in the Senate for this session.

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck moved the second
reading of Bill 328, an Act respecting unemployment insurance.

He said: Honourable Senators, it will be
unnecessary for those who hold that one should
not on second reading discuss a bill clause
by clause to quote the rules on this occasion,
for such a procedure with reference to Bill
328 is a practical impossibility. There are
119 sections in the present Unemployment
Insurance Act, 1940, as amended to date and
many of these sections are long and complicated. In the bill before us there are 122
sections, extending over 45 pages, and while
an effort has been made to simplify the
language, it can still take a lot of reading.
One may well ask why a scheme to assist
persons when temporarily unemployed should
require suèh wealth of language, and the
answer is that this is not in essence a plan
of social service, although it may have that
effect, but rather an insurance scheme by
which vast sums of money are involved and
in which large numbers of persons are
engaged and many more are affected. It is a
complicated world in which we live. Human
relationships are infinitely varied and extraordinarily involved, and an insurance scheme
that has for its basis inconceivably intricate
contractual relations must be precise and
comprehensive. Administering such a scheme
is the life-work of experts. A prominent
Canadian trade union official is on record as
saying that there are not more than a dozen
people in the trade union movement throughout Canada who can honestly say that they
are thoroughly conversant with the act as it
reads or with what it means.
I have dwelt thus upon the complexity of
the subject because I would have you appreciate the problem of explaining it in the short
time at my disposal, and also because I
would like to make a plea for your attention
and for your patience while I try to cover
the very numerous but outstanding features
of the bill-not in detail, but rather in principle, and generally. I have spoken of the
problem which presents itself to one who
undertakes the task of sponsoring a bill of
this nature; and I have thought that an
attempt to be comprehensive, although not
detailed, will be of some value when the bill
reaches the committee stage, since we must
be familiar with it in all its detail in order
to take the responsibility of making it the
law of Canada.
This bill is not an amendment to the present
act; it is a rewriting of the whole act. It is
a rearrangement of the subject-matter and a
rephrasing of its expression. There is scarcely
a section in the act that has not been altered
in some respects in the bill, so that to discuss
it clause by clause is out of the question.
The best I can do is to tell you something
of the act of 1940 and of the alterations in
substance which appear in the bill.

SENATE
The Canadian Unemployment Insurance Act
became law on August 7, 1940; and I pause
here to comment that of the members of the
Special Committee of the Commons and its
officials who at that time studied and passed
upon its provisions, five only have survived
the passage of the years and are still members
of Parliament: Mr. Angus MacInnis, Mr. E. G.
Hansell and Mr. L. P. Picard are still in the
Commons, and my honourable friend Senator
Tom Reid and I are in this house.
Hon. Mr. Euler:

What about me?

Hon. Mr. Marcoite: And do not forget me.
I have claimed all the time that that bill was
passed under false pretences.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: You were a member of
the house, but not of the special committee.
I am speaking of members of a special committee that devised and re-read and revised
the bill before it passed the Commons and
before it became law. The bill received
considerable study at that time.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I think my honourable
friend is overlooking the fact that in 1940
several senators sat in the Commons committee unofficially, and I was one of them.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Unofficially, yes. I
knew from the records that it was not a joint
committee of the two houses. And I am glad
that the honourable gentleman has survived;
I hope he will survive many more years for
useful public service. Anyway, is it not
indicative of the insecurity of parliamentary
life that the five members mentioned, plus the
unofficial member, alone remain of all that
goodly company?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Was not this kind of
legislation passed when the R. B. Bennett
Government was in office?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No. The act that was
passed then was declared ultra vires.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: It was passed just the
same.

recent 180 contributions. In 1950 we introduced supplementary benefits, and in 1953 we
authorized continuation of benefits to those
who became sick while unemployed.
Of
course, they went on unemployment reliefor public insurance, rather.
During these fifteen years of operation we
have accumulated much useful experience
and data, and there have been notable changes
in the conditions under which we operate.
In fact, we have had nearly twenty years of
useful experience in unemployment insurance
legislation, for in 1935 Parliament passed the
Employment and Social Insurance Act-to
which my friend the Deputy Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) has in effect
referred-which was subsequently declared
by the Courts to be ultra vires of the
dominion Parliament, thus requiring an
amendment to the British North America Act
before we again legislated, in 1940.
Since the proposed act will affect many
millions of workers and their employers, it is
desirable that its provisions be expressed in
the simplest of language consistent with precision, and that clauses dealing with the same
subject be brought together. For this purpose, the bill has been subdivided into five
divisions, as follows:

Those who draw benefits under the new act,
which at present is the bill before the house,
will on no occasion lose anything because of
the new measure for the next three years.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Would the honourable senator allow a question?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Does my honourable friend
know why the schedule was not placed in the
back of the bill when the legislation was redrafted?

not of principle. In 1948 we changed the Administration

JUNE 22, 1955
both labour and management is represented
and which is responsible to the Governor in
Council through the Minister of Labour. The
Commission is assisted in its employment
policies by a National Employment Committee, and there is also an independent
Unemployment Insurance Advisory Committee which reports to the Governor in Council
with respect to the adequacy of the fund.
There are some 200 local offices in the larger
communities throughout Canada. Nearly 8,000
employees are engaged in carrying out the
insurance plan and in operating the employment service.
The cost of the administration has grown
throughout the years from $2,343,599.36 in
1942 to $26,096,722.06 in 1954.
The one notable change in administration is
with respect to the term of office of the commissioners, and incidentally the change is
not to my liking. In the present act, the
Chief Commissioner is appointed for tenyear periods and the other commissioners
for terms of five years, and all three retire
at the age of 70, without power of extension
in the Executive. Under the proposed act, the
Chief Commissioner is appointed for ten-year
terms and the other commissioners for periods
not exceeding ten years, and all cease to hold
office at the age of 65 years, and all are
eligible for reappointment for one or more
terms not exceeding one year each. The
chief effect of this change is to subject the
older commissioners to the necessity of
annual reappointment, which is questionable
indeed for a commission which Parliament
expects to be independent. The change is
said to be made in order to bring the provisions of the proposed act in line with the
Public Service Superannuation Act. I do not
think the answer is a sufficient explanation,
but no doubt that will be debated in the
house and later on in committee.
It is interesting to note in this connection that one of the present commissioners,
the representative of Labour, Mr. Robert
Tallon, will be 70 years old on the 21st of
July next, and is carrying on with all his
old-time keenness and vigour.
National Employment Service
The provisions with regard to employment
service are little changed in the proposed
act, although this is a most important feature
of the Unemployment Insurance scheme. Its
function is to bring together employers seeking employees and workers seeking jobs. The
service thus reduces the calls upon the Fund
and incidentally provides opportunities for

testing the availability of claimants for
employment and therefore for unemployment
compensation.
The reputation of the Canadian Employment Service as being the best in the world
is justified in the statistics. In 1950 the
service referred applicants to vacancies to the
number of 1,120,258, and this figure has increased year by year without exception, until
in 1954 it had risen to 1,193,030. The actual
placements are equally notable. In 1950 they
were 797,227, and the annual increase has
been without exception until 1953, when the
numbers placed were 993,406. In 1954 employment demand worsened over the previous
year by approximately 200,000, so that the
placements for that year were 861,588. This
year, by all indications, the figures are increasing at a very substantial rate. The
Commission's figures show that there were at
least 120,000 more persons employed on
June 9, 1955 than there were on that date in
1954.
It is in this connection that the National
Employment Committee has rendered such
notable service. I am speaking here of the
committee which not only advises in many
ways on matters of employment but sells
good will and co-operation in their respective
communities. The committee, as I have said,
is composed of both employers and employees, and one of its functions has been to sell
to employers the desirability of keeping older
men on their staffs and of employing older
men when vacancies occur. In this way it
has been able to convince a large section of
our population that it is a terrible and cruel
waste of manpower to put capable and experienced men, still able and willing to
work, on the shelf of retirement.
Unemployment Insurance Coverage.
The first subheading under division III of
the bill, Unemployment Insurance, is coverage, and in this department the administration is faced with many problems and
difficulties.
The basis of inclusion for insurance purposes in the present act is restricted to those
employees working for an employer under a
contract of service; subject, however, to certain important exceptions. In the main the
exceptions are: employment in agriculture,
fishing, in hospitals not operated for purpose
of gain, and in charitable institutions;
teachers, members of Canadian armed forces,
police, domestic service, and those paid on
a weekly or monthly basis who earn more
than $4,800 per annum. It is interesting to

SENATE

note that in 1941 the ceiling was $2,000, and
the increase to $4,800 is still below the advance that has taken place in monetary
wages since that time. I would emphasize
the fact that the monetary wages, not the
real wages, have more than doubled in that
time.
The provision that only those engaged
under contracts of employment are covered
excludes of course those working on their
own account, independent contractors, professional people such as doctors, dentists,
nurses in private service, lawyers and many
others, including unpaid family workers,
mostly farmers' and fishermen's sons and
daughters.
In 1954 the total Canadian labour force
numbered 5,426,000 people-a substantial
army-on a monthly average for the year.
Of these, 736,000 worked on their own
account, 296,000 were employers, 240,000
were family workers engaged in agriculture
and other primary industries, leaving a
residue of paid workers under contract of
service of 4,154,000 men and women. Of
these 3,244,000 were insured under the Unemployment Insurance Act. No material
change in this coverage is proposed.
Contributions.
As you know, the insurance fund out of
which unemployment benefits are paid ;s
made up of contributions from employers
and employed in equal amounts, and from
the dominion treasury of an amount equal
to one-fifth of the total of employer and
employee contributions. In addition to this
the Government pays the cost of administration. For the fiscal year ending the 31st of
March 1955 the combined employer-employee
contributions amounted to $158,850,309, and
the Government contribution was $31,771,464,
making a grand total, excluding administration costs, of $190,631,773.
Hon. Mr. Horner: For the year?

according to the amount earned in each
week. The new rates of contribution will be
found in the schedule to the act on page 14
of the bill. I will not attempt to read the
schedule, but with the kind permission of
the house it will appear in Hansard.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Would you put the old
schedule also on Hansard?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In due season I will
present the new schedule and the present
one, so that they may be appear in juxtaposition for purposes of comparison. I will
refer to the outstanding changes, of course,
as well. I know of no place where the two
schedules can be found at present in juxtaposition.
The new schedule on page 14 of the bill is
as follows:

It is out of this new schedule that the next
major change arises.
This schedule has been built up over the
years, and on examination it is to be observed
that the rates of contribution as between the
low-paid worker and his high paid fellowworker are seriously out of line. Thus the
person earning less than $9 per week pays
18 cents per week, or on an average 3-21
per cent of his wages. As the rate of wages
increases the percentage falls, so that the
worker earning $34 to $47.99 per week pays
1 17 per cent of his wages and the person
earning $48 and over per week pays on an
average as little as -94 per cent of his wages.
That, of course, is all out of line.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes. That is the amount
collected from the Government, employers
and employees. To this is to be added the

reduction in respect of these workers being
up to .08 cents per week. The reduction
tapers off gradually until the worker earning
$51 per week is reached, who pays an increase of -02 cents per week; and the worker
earning $57 and over pays an increase of -06
cents per week-to be offset, however, by
higher benefits.
Now, I come to the benefits. The precise
way in which to make clear the changes in
the benefits under the proposed act as compared with those under the present provisions is to set forth the schedules, and as I

said earlier to my honourable friend from
Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor), I will
with the consent of the house, place them

I may here observe that the rates for 43-8
per cent of the insured population provide an
increase of $6 per week, or generally speaking, 25 per cent. Under the proposed new
act there are no decreases in benefits for any

person.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask the honourable
senator a question? If I have followed him
correctly, he stated that the percentage rate
of contribution paid by lower salaried employees was greater than that by persons
receiving higher salaries. Am I correct in
that?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That has been so in the

past.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That seems to be unreasonable. In the bill is any approach made
toward uniformity with regard to this feature?

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes. In the bill there
is as complete uniformity as can be devised,
subject to the necessity of not having splitcent payments.

Hon. Mr. Euler: One would imagine that
the lower salaried person should contribute
on a lower percentage basis than the higher
salaried person.

Those who take the trouble to study and
compare the two schedules will observe, in
the first place, that the lowest rate of benefit

-$4.20 weekly to a person without dependant, and $4.80 to a person with a dependanthas been abandoned.

The reason is that with

the general advance in wages over the years,
so few people remain in the class of workers
earning wages of less than $9 per week that
the cost of a separate category is no longer
justified. Those formerly in that class are
included in the lowest class in the new bill,
and their benefit has been increased to $6
and $8, respectively, per week.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: One would think so;
but the proper course is to have them all pay
on the same basis.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I understand that
inequality is corrected in the new bill.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: As I have already
pointed out, in the bill the rates are calculated
with the utmost precision to fall equally, in
percentage of wages, upon all classes from
the lowest to the highest, subject to avoidance
of split-cent payments.

I mentioned this to

illustrate the exactness with which the calculations have been made.

SENATE
I said that there were no decreases in benefits to any person under the proposed act.
Under the original act of 1940 the ratio of
benefits paid to those with dependants was
on a basis of forty times the employees' contribution. The basis has been advanced from
time to time until at present the ratio of
benefits to those with dependants is 45 times
the contribution, and under the proposed act
it will be 50 times the contribution. So it
will be seen that the value to the unemployed
insured has been increased.
Hon. Mr. Horner: That is, the individual's
contribution, without taking the employer's
contribution into account?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is so: fifty times
the average individual contribution. Those
who study the new schedule of benefits will
also observe that three new classes have
been added. The purpose is to take care
of the advance in monetary wages over the
years. Under the present act the top classification included all employees receiving over
$48 per week. Nowadays approximately 65
per cent of all insured workers receive over
that amount, so it has become necessary to
provide three additional classifications.
A compelling reason for the new schedule
of benefits is the fact that over the years the
percentage of benefit to average weekly wages
has been steadily decreasing. This is because
the benefit percentage was lowest in the
higher paid classes, and, with the advance in
monetary wages, more and more workers
have been moving up in classification. In
1940, when the act was passed, the percentage
of benefit to average weekly wage was 50
per cent. By 1954 it had sunk to 44-3 per
cent, and under the proposed act it will be
restored to 50-1 per cent.
With regard to the duration of benefits:
under the present act the minimum number
of contributions which will entitle the worker
to claim for benefit is 180 days of payments,
for which he is entitled to 36 days, or six
weeks, of benefit payments. This duration of
benefit has been found in modern experience
to be inadequate, as it is not sufficient to
carry the immigrant and rookie-worker over
his first period of unemployment. I devised
the term "rookie-worker" to designate the
man who is on his first job, and who is
likely to be the first to be let off and the
last to be re-employed. To meet this situation, the benefit formula has been altered
to provide a minimum duration of benefits of
15 weeks. This is a notable concession to the
low-paid worker.
On the other hand, for the worker with a
greater accumulation of benefits, a reduction
is made from 51 weeks to 36 weeks. It is the
opinion of the experts who have been engaged

on this matter that 36 weeks is sufficient, as
most employees who have accumulated large
amounts are unemployed for very short
periods.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Is that in accordance with
the original recommendation?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No. The original period
was 51 weeks, and I understand that this has
obtained for a number of years. If the bill
is passed unamended there will be a reduction to 36 weeks. However, there is always
something to be said on the other side. I
refer to seasonal benefits.
Offsetting to some extent this reduction to
which I have referred is the improvement
planned in the seasonal benefits. During
the period from the lst of January to the 15th
of April, employment in Canada is at its
seasonal minimum, and in recognition of the
consequent difficulties encountered by many
workers special benefits are provided during
this season. An unemployed worker who
has exhausted his benefit credit may nevertheless claim an additional fifteen weeks of
benefit payments, which is approximately the
entire period. A rookie-worker who has not
made sufficient contributions to entitle him to
regular benefits, provided he has made fifteen
contributions subsequent to the 31st of the
previous March, may draw ten weeks of
benefits. Seasonal benefits were first established by a special amending act in 1950,
when the minimum benefit for a worker who
had exhausted his benefits was six weeks
instead of the present fifteen weeks. In the
other category, the minimum duration of
benefit has been increased from three weeks
to ten weeks. Most of these increases were
incorporated in an act which we passed in
January of this year, and in the bill further
concessions are provided.
By the 31st of March 1955, we had paid
out in seasonal benefits the sum of $54,634,657.
Hon. Mr. Horner: In one year?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No. Since the act was
enacted in 1950 as a result of anticipated
larger unemployment, and up to March 31
this year a total amount of $54,600,000 had
been paid out.
May I now address myself to the fund?
The period of high employment through which
we have passed during the past fifteen years
has been reflected in the growth of the insurance fund. It has increased in amount
each year since 1941-43 until in 1954 it had
reached the sum of $881,274,133. In 1954 we
went behind $40,581,816, which left us with
an amount of $840,692,317. In the fiscal year
ending March 31, 1955, this huge sum earned
interest of $26,378,269.

JUNE 22, 1955
This fund is a substantial cushion against
the possibilities of the future, and it justifies
the concessions now proposed which will increase the payments out by an estimated 10
per cent on a five-year average, or annually

in the order of $25,000,000, based on the

practical purposes they should be included.
If this were done, the total at the end of
February 28, 1955, would be almost 184,000
employees, of whom slightly over 9,000 were
revenue postmasters. That shows a substantial
increase in the numbers in the Civil Service.
The total cost of the service in 1939, just
sixteen years ago, was less than $80 million,
and for the current fiscal year it is $554
million. In that respect it is interesting to
note that the present total number of employees in the two large railway systems of
Canada, including their subsidiary companies
but excluding their respective air lines, is
about 175,000. In other words, the mechanism of government in the federal sphere alone
has more employees than have the two railway corporations put together.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Has the number of railway
employees gone up or down?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I regret that I cannot
give my honourable friend that information.
My inquiry was only as to the number of
employees of both railways at the present
time.
Honourable senators will I am sure be
interested to learn from an examination of
the details given as to the number of employees in each department of government,
that over the past two years some departments show a substantial increase while
others show a slight decline. For instance,
the Auditor General's office, a small branch
of government service, whose work over the
past two years has not diminished but if anything has increased, is employing fewer civil
servants in the current year than it did two
years ago. Also the Comptroller of the Treasury, a very important official, who on March
31, 1953, had on his payroll 4,130 civil servants, showed a slight reduction at February
28, 1955, with 4,107 employees. I would next
draw your attention to the Unemployment
Insurance Commission, which we were discussing under a bill earlier this afternoon.
Its employees have increased over the past
two years by 515. In the Post Office Department we see quite a substantial increase.
Excluding revenue postmasters, over the past
two years, the number of postal employees
has increased from roughly 9,900 to 12,250.
The Department of Transport, an important branch of the government service, has
had in the same period a decrease of about
125 employees. True, it is a rather minor
decrease, but the importance and efficiency
of its functions have not diminished. Another
good example is the Department of Trade and
Commerce, which over the same period bas
maintained its efficiency and service and reduced its number of employees by more than
200. While the reduction may appear small,

if we take the average annual salary of about
$2,500 we see that there has been a decrease
in spending by that department of $500,000
a year on salaries alone.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Does my friend mean
that the number declined by 200 each year?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No; it is a reduction of
200 in the two-year period from March 31,
1953 to February 28, 1955.
It is interesting, honourable senators, to
try to find a reason why some departments
are able to reduce their number of employees
while others have increased theirs. The only
explanation I have to offer from my thinking
about the matter is that in their administration some departments are more efficient than
others. This is on the assumption that their
operations remain fairly stable, which appears
to me a reasonable assumption. In a department employing several thousand people it is
very easy for the administration to get a bit
out of control. I think we must always keep
in mind that the great distinction between a
government department and an ordinary
business is that the business has a manager
who has to meet a payroll at the end of each
week or month, and the government department does not have that demand. The deputy
minister, who in reality is the general manager of a government department, never bas
to worry about whether his department will
earn the money to pay the wages and salaries
when they come due. That in itself has a
serious moral effect. It might be worth while
to carry on an inquiry at some time as to why
some departments quite apparently are more
efficient than others. I think the reason can
only be found in the personnel. The deputy
minister of a department is the man who has
charge of the staff, who guides their work
according to the policies laid down by the
Government and by his minister. If he is
competent, efficient, with a measure of ruthlessness-for that sometimes is necessaryand if he is left alone he will probably produce economies in the department; but if he
is rather easygoing, if he has not had administrative experience or is lacking in some
other necessary qualification, the tendency is
to multiply the servants in that department.
I am bound to say too that I think there is
a rigidity in the whole business of government administration, an inflexibility, that does
not tend to efficiency and economical results.
This is not in the slightest sense meant as
criticism of the Civil Service Commission,
for I believe that on the whole the commission is discharging its duties under the act
efficiently. But, frankly, I think the commission bas too much power over the placing
of servants once they are in a department.
I agree wholly that every one who enters

JUNE 22, 1955
the government service should enter through
the Civil Service door, but once he bas passed
the required examination set by the Civil
Service Commission the control over him
should be left to the responsible official in
the department concerned. If a deputy
minister is fully competent and knows his
work he will resent the fact that he cannot
move some person from one sector of his
department to another sector, if the move
involves an increase in remuneration, without the permission of the Civil Service Commission. I say that if he is a competent man
he will resent that; if he is an incompetent
man he should not be in the job. I do believe
that with the salaries that are being paid to
deputy ministers today-which are pretty
reasonable salaries-it is possible to get
wholly competent and efficient men; and I
feel perfectly certain that if we could analyze
the reason why some departments are more
efficient, apparently, than others we would
find it right in the type of personnel at the
head of the departments.
The report refers to a few other matters,
and I shall touch upon them briefly.
We secured in committee some data on
the cost of public buildings in Ottawa and
the adjacent district, that is, buildings that
house the government departments. The total
amount spent or engaged to be spent in the
last five years in Ottawa is almost $60 million. Again, one hesitates to offer criticism;
but I do think that some of these buildings
are on a scale more lavish than is necessary
to serve the purposes for which they are
intended. As an illustration, I would cite the
new Printing Bureau building in Hull. If
we look at Exhibit 4 appended to the report,
the table dealing with public buildings, we
will find that the total expenditure on this
building in Hull will be $14 million-for a
printing bureau to do the Government's
printing. Now, after all, a printing bureau
is not a museum of art, nor is it a public
library or anything of that kind; it is a place
where machines are installed to do printing
work and where you must have the necessary facilities to carry through the job. I do
think that if for instance we had been able
to build a printing bureau for half of that
$14 million we might have spent the remaining $7 million much more usefully in trying
to clean up slum areas in Ottawa or Hull or
somewhere else.
That emphasizes a point which I have
made before in this bouse. The amount of
money that governments take out of the taxpayers is important, very important; but
even more important is what governments
do with the money. We have perhaps been
infiuenced a good deal by the idea that

Ottawa should be a lovely city. Every Canadian from one end of the country to the other
should take pride in the capital city of his
country, but all I am suggesting now is that
expenditures on government buildings here
should be held in some sort of balanced
proportion.
The next matter that I wish to touch upon
is rentals. The estimated expenditure for
rentals in the present fiscal year shows an
increase of $1-5 million over the rentals
paid out during the last fiscal year. All of
that increase, with the exception of about
$150,000, is due to the requirements of the
Department of National Defence. Now, if I
may revert for a moment to the subject of
employees, I would point out that in the
period from March 31, 1953, to February 28,
1955, the total number of civilian employees
of the Department of National Defence
increased by about 10,000. Here again it is
difficult to criticize, and certainly I do not
wish for a moment to offer any unfair
criticism, but the total civilian force in the
Department of National Defence now numbers over 50,000.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What is the number of
the armed forces?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: When the Deputy Minister of National Defence appeared before our
committee, he stated, as I recall, that there
was one .civilian employee for every two
and one-eighth man in uniform. That may
be necessary-I do not know-but I do think
it is a matter that probably could stand some
inquiry. Is it possible that the Department
of National Defence is enmeshed in a great
deal of red tape in the conduct of its business? If we get down to an analysis of any
of these things, or most of them, the increase
probably comes about because of a tremendous increase in paper work in the departments. Is it possible in the vast mechanism
of government to practice the principle, of
devolution, to give more responsibility to the
man on the spot in the far-distant place,
and hold him responsible for his work, instead
of making him dependent upon some bureau
or department in Ottawa to which he has
to refer everything for approval? It is a
point upon which it is rather difficult to
make any definite pronouncement, but which
is well worth study.
Hon. Mr. Golding: With reference to civil
servants in the Department of National
Defence, can the honourable senator quote
the figures given by Mr. Drury, the Deputy
Minister, as to the saving which has been
made by the use of civilians instead of
service men?

Honourable senators, I move adoption of
the report.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I do not intend to take up any unnecessary
time. I rise to commend the Chairman of
the Finance Committee (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
and the Vice-Chairman (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
for the great service they have rendered not
only to this house, and to the Parliament of
Canada, but also to our whole country. They
worked very hard to get the data together
for the preparation of the committee's report.
A few of the rest of us who served on the
committee worked earnestly to help them in
every way possible, but it is due to those
two men more than anybody else .that this
splendid report was prepared. I urge the
people of Canada to read this report from
cover to cover, for by so doing they will get
a better understanding of the details of the
business of the Canadian Government than in
any other way. The data was gathered
together by the Chairman and the ViceChairman of the committee and put in a form
that be who runs may read. I repeat that
these two honourable senators deserve the

thanks of this house and of the people of
Canada for the fine work they have done.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I join with the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) in expressing appreciation
to the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman of
the Finance Committee for their splendid
work on the committee and for the valuable
information that has been obtained. Unfortunately it was not possible for me to attend
any of the meetings of the committee, because
of other duties which I had to perform.
However, I understand that the committee,
under its Chairman and Vice-Chairman, held
numerous meetings, and that officials from
various departments furnished statisties which
were asked for. It is abundantly clear that
this committee has rendered a very splendid
service not only to this house but to the
country generally.
First, may I refer to the service which the
committee has rendered to this house? As
honourable senators know, the supply bill
always comes to us in the dying hours of the
session, when we do not have an opportunity
to study the Estimates adequately. However,
because of the Finance Committee's study of
the Estimates when we receive the next supply bill-which I hope will not be many days
hence-we shall have some knowledge of
what it contains, and that will help us materially in our consideration of the bill.
I repeat, I join with the Leader of the
Opposition in commending the Chairman and
Vice-Chairman, and all the members of the
finance committee, for their achievement. I
am sure that not only the members of this
house, but the people of Canada generally,
appreciate what they have done.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Norman P. Lamberi: Honourable senators,Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I do not want to usurp
the role of my honourable friend from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) by attempting to
second the adoption of this report.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Why not?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I believe the Honourable the Acting Speaker was good enough to
suggest that you should do so. All I wish to
do is to make an appropriate bow to my
honourable friend the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) who introduced my name
into this discussion, and simply to say that
the work of planning the Finance Committee
fell upon the shoulders of the Chairman. He

668

SENATE

gave considerable thought and time and effort
to its organization, and he deserves the credit
for the results achieved.
I am sure the Chairman would like me to
say that we all owe a great debt of gratitude
to Mr. John Deutsch, the Secretary of the
Treasury Board of the Government of
Canada.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I say that because the
report represents a great deal of statistical
work. The review of evidence is the introductory part of the report, but the real substance
of the report is to be found in the statistical
sheets and tables that are included as
appendices. In that connection, I think it
should be said that the large sheet-the summary of Government expenditures by departments-which accompanies the annual Blue
Book of Estimates each year, was introduced
into that volume largely as the result of the
work done and the suggestions made by the
Senate Finance Committee several years ago.
That summary, which is available to members
of both houses, 'contains all the material
upon which the report of the Finance Committee is based. When we come down to it,
I think the whole problem of making any
headway along the lines that have been so
definitely emphasized by the Chairman rests
with Treasury Board, which is the managerial
branch of the department that deals with
expenditures. I feel sure the Minister of
Finance and his colleagues who compose the
Treasury Board will read this report and note,
with a good deal of gratitude, the emphasis
given to certain items of expenditure. I
believe they are very sincere in trying to
safeguard the economy of our country.
I am hopeful that the report will be read
by members of Parliament and that its contents will be widely distributed through the
agency of the press, so that as many people
as possible throughout the country will get
a better idea of public expenditures by federal as well as provincial and municipal governments.
Let me say again that we all recognize the
debt of gratitude we owe to the Chairman for
the very sincere effort that he has put into
the work èof the Finance Committee, not only
this year but in previous years. Certainlv,
he has given this committee a status that is
a credit to his work and industry.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourable senators, at the risk of detaining the house for
a few minutes longer, I should like to add
my voice to those already heard in an
expression of appreciation to the Chairman of
the committee and those associated with

him in the preparation of his report. I regret
that this year I was unable to take an active
part in that work. The report is a very valuable contribution to the work of Parliament.
The Chairman bas painted a picture this
afternoon which the members of both houses
should always keep before them. Personally,
I am very much indebted to him, for I value
the earnest and conscientious way in which
he looks at the finances of this country.
As the honourable senator was speaking I
wondered to myself what could be done to
improve the efficiency and economy in the
conduct of the public affairs of this nation.
I take his report to mean that we should always be on the lookout for storm signals and
warnings of trouble ahead, and be able to set
our sails accordingly. One of the basic difficulties underlying the management of public
affairs today is that our representatives in the
House of Commons are continually faced with
requests from all parts of the country for
greater expenditures of public money. I take
it from the report that we must help them to
resist such demands. That, honourable senators, is not a very easy task. Personally, I
sympathize with members of the other house,
because I know something of the demands
which come from my section of the country.
Indeed, every senator knows the situatioi
well.
Some years ago I was present at a banquet
in the city of Saint John in honour of the
late Viscount Bennett who was leaving Canada for England after a long term of public
life in this country. His friends in his native
province of New Brunswick tendered him this
banquet, which was attended by many citizens from all over the province, irrespective
of party, to do him honour and to say farewell.
I recall very well his valedictory
speech, which was very much along the same
lines of the speech made by the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) this
afternoon.
Lord Bennett referred to the
extravagant demands made upon men in public life by responsible citizens in every province of Canada-demands which in his judgment the finances of the nation at that time
could not stand. He pleaded with those at
the banquet to adopt a different attitude towards public men, so as to make their path
a little smoother. There was great applause
at that point. But Lord Bennett went on to
say: "It is all very well for you to applaud
my lofty sentiments tonight, but tomorrow if
the City of Saint John wants something from
the federal Government, half the people now
listening to me will join a delegation to go to
Ottawa and demand it."
His words came back to me this afternoon
as I listened to the honourable senator from

JUNE 22, 1955
Churchill. I am prompted to say that in addition to bringing the information contained in
this report before members of Parliament we
must flnd some effective way of getting it
before the people of Canada, particularly the
young men and women, so that they may
know more about the science of politics and
government in this country than they know
at the present time.
In our universities across Canada we are
establishing chairs for almost every subject
except politics.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Acadia University at Wolfville is establishing a public service course.
Hon. Mr. Burchill:-Something may be being
done in one or two universities, but not nearly
enough is being taught about the mechanism
of federal government and the difficulties
public men face.
To make the report really effective, and so
that it may bear the fruit it deserves, we
should find some appropriate means of getting it into the hands of the people all across
Canada who will in the future control the
destiny of this country.
Hon. Gordôn B. Isnor: Honourable senators,
as a member of the Finance Committee I
would like to add my words of praise to
the Chairman (Hon. Mr. Crerar) and the
Vice Chairman (Hon. Mr. Lambert) for the
excellent report tabled in this bouse on
Thursday last. I should also like to ýcommend the steering committee, composed of the
Chairman, the Vice Chairman and three other
members who did a splendid job in placing
matters for consideration before the cornmittee. The Chairman has this year, as in
other years, done a fine piece of work, and
the report will, I feel, be well received by
the public.
But I am wondering whether the information when it reaches the hands of the average person will be in a form that is readily
understandable, and whether he will appreciate what the committee was trying to do.
He may not know whether the reference was
one calling for a general inquiry or for the
purpose of making recommendations which
would be useful to the government in future
years. While my comment is intended in no
way to be critical, I had hoped that the
report would contain certain recommendations which it does not contain. Furthermore,
no official .of the largest department, that of
Defence Production, appeared before the
committee, so we did not have an opportunity
to inquire as to its policy of calling for
tenders and awarding contracts, an operation
on which we might have been able to suggest some saving to the public. That is a
question which the committee may well look

into at some future time. I am hopeful that
the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) will see fit to set up
the Finance Committee again next session
and that its reference will allow a greater
scope for inquiry.
I should like to make particular reference
to one or two items mentioned by the Chairman of the committee. He referred to efficiency, and I think there was a question in
his mind as to whether the various departments were as efficient as they should be.
After studying the evidence adduced before
the committee, I feel that we in Canada are
very fortunate to have such splendid men
at the head of the various departments; and
I think that applies pretty well right down
the line-with, naturally, certain exceptions.
On the whole, I think we can say that we
have in the departments a very fine degree
of efficiency. That was shown by the evidence
placed before us, and I thought, honourable
senators, I should stress that point.
While the Chairman of the committee
touched on the subject of the Printing Bureau
and its estimated cost of $14 million, no one
will dispute that it costs a lot of money to
put up a building of that type today. The
building has many features which are very
necessary from a safety point of view. It
must be fire-proof, and heavy steel and concrete must be used throughout in order to
support the weight of the machinery. I do
not think that a comparison can be made
between that building and, say, living quarters for the defence forces. And, toô, we
find private enterprise putting up buildings
today at costs running into figures like $10
million or $15 million. On the whole, considering the large number of employees
which the Printing Bureau houses, there is
some question in my mind as to whether we
should be too critical of its cost.
Hon. Mr. Horner: There are materials other
than marble that are fire-proof.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I do not know how much
marble is in that building, but I doubt that
there is very much.
Next, I want to say a word or two about
the number of civilians in the Department of
National Defence. I think that was brought
out very well in committee through the questions asked by the honourable senator from
Huron-Perth (Hon. Mr. Golding). There are
certain trades that servicemen cannot be expected to be competent in. For instance, in
the dockyards a large number of civilian
specialists must be employed, and this applies
to both the east and the west coasts. It
certainly would not bring about the efficiency

SENATE
that we all desire if servicemen were carrying out the repairs to ships in dockyards. I
say that because I know from experience
that civilian employees, while perhaps they
do not always give 100 per cent efficient
service, nevertheless are very necessary. I
think the Deputy Minister of National Defence
brought that point out when he was giving
his evidence before our committee, and it
should be borne in mind when comparisons
are made between the number of civilian
employees and the number of servicemen in
the Department of National Defence.
There is one other point that I wish to
raise, honourable senators, and I particularly
would refer this to the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and
to the Chairman of the Finance committee.
I believe we should try next year, to compile
a list of all payments which are being made
to the provinces and set them forth in such
a way that there will be no question as to
what the federal Government is doing by way
of assistance to our provinces. I do not wish
at this hour, honourable senators, to enumerate the various amounts paid out or the
headings under which the payments are made,
but we know that they amount to a very considerable sum. I do not know just what
the provinces would do today if it were not
for these special grants. Perhaps the provinces of Quebec and Ontario, the two industrial provinces, and also British Columbia,
could get along without these grants, but
I am quite sure that the other provinces
would have a very difficult time without them.
These grants can only be made out of
revenues coming in to the federal Government. I think, Mr. Leader, that that could
be included as a broadening of the reference
next year, · o that the committee could make
s
an inquiry along these lines and set forth the
facts in such a way that the people throughout Canada would appreciate just what is being done for them by the federal Government.
Honourable senators, there is one other
item, a note of which I made after reading
this very interesting report and listening to
the Chairman explaining it. I wonder if
we could not in future divide the expenditures into two classes: expenditures that
show no return, and expenditures that bring
back to our economy $1.50, or some such
amount, for every dollar we spend. I think
that is a very important subject for future
consideration and discussion. I feel a great
many of the items of expenditure are worthwhile, in the sense that they result in a direct
return in dollars and cents as it affects the
economy of our nation.

I thought, honourable senators, that notwithstanding the late hour I would like to
add my views, rambling as they have been, to
the splendid remarks that have been made this
afternoon.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators, I
have only one remark to make. As the
honourable senator from Northumberland
(Hon. Mr. Burchill) brought to mind the
warning given by the late Viscount Bennett,
the thought occurred to me, what a vast
change has taken place in regard to our
thinking about money matters in Canada in
the last twenty-five years. The honourable
senator deplored the fact that more of our
universities do not have chairs on political
science. I say that if they were chairs on
statesmanship instead they would be much
better received throughout Canada, for the
Canadian people suspect that there are too
few statesmen and too many politicians.
Hon. Mr. Crerar:

Honourable senators-

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: It is understood that if the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) speaks now he
will close the debate on the motion for concurrence in the report.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators, I
would be ungrateful indeed if I did not
express my appreciation of the very kind
things that have been said about the report
and whatever part I had in carrying it to
the present point. The members, and particularly the honourable senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert), gave the committee
very great assistance.
I would not want to leave any impression
that there is indifference to this matter of
public spending, and I trust my remarks
earlier left no such impression. Latterly the
Treasury Board has instituted certain steps
which will probably have a substantial effect
in curtailing expansion in the Civil Service.
I do think that the expansion that has taken
place in the last few years is pretty extensive, but I believe that the Government is
aware of that fact and that the importance
of it is realized.
Now, there is just one other thing I would
wish to stress. Why do public expenditures
which are already high tend to increase?
The increase occurs not only in the federal
field, but provincially as well. What is the
reason for this? If we go back to the source
we find it is almost inevitably the demand
that comes from communities or organizations
or individuals for Governments to spend more
money for one thing or another. That is of

JUNE 22, 1955
vital importance, because the remedy for this
condition of affairs lies not so much with
those who for the time being are entrusted
with the responsibilities of administration, as
with the people, that they shall be moderate
and reasonable in their demands and requirements. The report attempts to draw attention
to that fact.
The honourable senator from HalifaxDartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) was kind enough
to refer in complimentary terms to the report
and to express the hope that it will be widely
read. To assure that result is not, of course,
within the power of the committee; but I
may say for the information of the house
that, once the report is adopted, copies will
be sent to all the Canadian newspapers, to
every member of the provincial legislatures,
and to the main public libraries. The purpose
of circulating it is that the facts it contains
may become known. I am confident that if
the Canadian people have the facts before
them, they will reach sound conclusions.
Although ministers must do their part, the
problem is not one that can be solved by
them alone. Public opinion must arrive at

some sane and steady outlook in regard to
all these issues if we are to avoid trouble in
future.
The motion was agreed to, and the report
was concurred in.

On the Order:
Resuming the adjourned debate on the motion

a number of honourable senators that this
order would be proceeded with this afternoon,
it is now twenty minutes after five o'clock,

reading without as much as one speech being
made upon it by way of elucidation. The
main thing about it was that everybody over
there seemed to be in favour of boosting
direct grants to the municipalities which are
affected by this bill. If the Opposition had
any suggestions to offer at all it was simply
that the grants provided were not large
enough. It is interesting to note that members
of Parliament generally when they come here
are all asking and fighting for buildings and
airports in their constituencies, and after they
get them they want the Government to pay
for them by way of taxation.
I do not propose to say very much about
the principle of this bill, which is the paying
of grants to municipalities in lieu of taxes
upon federal properties located in those
municipalities. That principle bas been
clearly established by the federal Government
since 1949, when the Municipal Grants Act
was introduced and approved by Parliament.
This bill is merely an amendment of that act,
and its purpose is to increase the amounts
so granted.
I do take this opportunity, however, to
point out certain features of this proposed
legislation which in my opinion have not
been given sufficient attention.
In the first place, the Municipal Grants
Act is an outgrowth of the old Ottawa bills
which, in the years prior to 1945, came before
us every year, and provided for a grant to
the City of Ottawa in lieu of payment of local
taxes upon federal properties located in this
municipality. As was mentioned Tuesday
night by the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), in moving
second reading of the bill:
. . . in 1944 the Prime Minister, the late Right
Honourable william Lyon Mackenzie King, after
some discussion with the Mayor of Ottawa. Mr.
Stanley Lewis, decided that an inquiry should be
made into the relations between the City of
Ottawa and the Government of Canada. Upon the
adoption of a resolution presented by Mr. King
to Parliament, a joint committee of both houses
was set up to inquire into the subject and make
recommendations.

Two honourable senators who are now in
this chamber had the pivilege of sitting on
that committee: one is the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert); the
other is myself. I would pay the honourable senator from Ottawa the compliment
of saying that he did good service on that
committee. As a result of the unanimous
report of that joint committee of some twentythree members representing every section of
Canada, the Government later introduced
legislation which greatly enlarged the outlook
of the people of Canada upon the capital city
of Ottawa and the surrounding municipalities embodied in the Federal District, which

is administered, under the provisions of the
Federal District Commission Act, by the
Federal District Commission. At that time
the federal grant to the City of Ottawa was

increased from $100,000 to $300,000 per year

for a period of five years. By the time that
period had expired, pressure-accumulated
pressure-had been brought to bear upon
the federal treasury from other municipalities throughout Canada to have grants provided for thern as well as for the City of
Ottawa.
That is why the Municipal Grants Act
of 1949 came into existence, and also why
the old annual grants to the City of Ottawa
came to be merged into one total sum provided
for all municipalities which were qualified
to come under a formula prescribed by the
Department of Finance.
I am not going to express an opinion
whether the amounts granted under the
formula of 1949 or those prescribed under
the amended formula in this bill are too
much or too little. I do suggest, however, that
this bill should include appendices listing
the names of the municipalities receiving
grants, with the amounts granted to each
municipality. The fact of the situation as
far as Ottawa is concerned is that in 1949
the annual grant, which for the previous five
years had been $300,000, was increased to
over one million dollars, and now, under
the provisions of this bill, it will amount
to something over two and a half
million dollars. The total grants to all municipalities affected by this bill will, as has
been stated by the minister, amount to a
figure between six and seven million dollars,
of which the City of Ottawa will receive
almost one-half.
That is not all the story regarding the
City of Ottawa by any means. We have here
a Federal District Commission which renders
certain services to this capital city and its
surrounding district. One of these days a
bill will come before us amending the Federal
District Commission Act so as to increase
the amount of the annual grant to the Commission to enable it to meet rising costs of
operation. Incidentally, it has been estimated
that some $50 million bas been expended by
the Federal District Commission since its
inception, all of which has been contributed
by the people of Canada generally.
I am touching only briefiy upon this particular aspect of the bill before us to emphasize the point that the situation which applies
to the City of Ottawa with its intimate and
rather complex relations to the federal Government and surrounding municipalities is
altogether different and distinctive from that
applying to any other municipality in the

JUNE 23, 1955
country. For that reason, I protest strongly
against legislation which tends to obscure the
problems affecting this capital city and Federal District by submerging them in a general
formula applying to a hundred other municipalities of varying size and character. This
is really two bills in one; and I trust that
in the near future the Municipal Grants Act
will be amended further to remove provisions
as to the City of Ottawa from this act and
that its case will be presented once again
in separate and distinct legislation which may
be subject to inquiry and enlightenment each
year.
This suggestion, I submit is in keeping with
the proposal contained in the Speech from the
Throne at the opening of this session, indicating that a Joint Committee of both houses of
Parliament would be set up for the purpose
of inquiring into matters relating to the capital city and the Federal District. Instead of
that undertaking having been fulfilled, we
are now presented with a bill without the
benefit of enlightenment or recommendations
from such an inquiry such as were afforded

in 1944.

I have referred earlier to the committee of
inquiry which reported on this subject in
1944, and to the legislation which followed
its recommendations. It was suggested last
year, I think, by the honourable senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), that a committee similar to that of 1944 should be
appointed again after a period of ten years to
review relations between the Government and
the municipalities. That was not done, but
instead notice of a bill to amend the Municipal
Grants Act appeared on the Order Paper of
the other house at the beginning of last session. It remained there all year and appeared
again on the Order Paper at the beginning of
this session. Altogether, since it was drafted,
this bill has been awaiting the attention of
Parliament for over a year and a half. So
at least we can say that this is not a case of
"hasty" legislation. But one must say that
it is a case of "ill conceived" and "ill considered" legislation.
The legislation applying to the City of
Ottawa and its surrounding Federal District,
which followed the inquiry by a Parliamentary committee in 1944, was the result of the
deliberations and the recommendations of
members of both Houses of Parliament. As
I mentioned before, two senators-the Honourable senator from Ottawa and myselfserved on that committee. This bill, and the
act which it proposes to amend, are the result
of the investigations of departmental officials
whose recommendations are expressed solely
in a mathematical formula upon which very
little light or explanation has been shed.
50437-43J

My real criticism of this bill is that it
needs analysis and enlightenment, especially
regarding section 4. Not a word was said by
the honourable Leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)
about this section. According to my interpretation it means that, for taxation purposes,
the East and West Blocks of the Parliament
Buildings are being taken out of the jurisdiction of the federal Government and placed
in the jurisdiction of the Corporation of the
City of Ottawa. I think this is a most serious
matter, and I wonder how many members
have noticed that this is being done. I have
always understood and I still maintain that
the Parliament Buildings are comprised of the
West Block, the Centre Block and the East
Block. Not a word of explanation has been
given as to what is being done, and not one
inquiry has been made.
I cannot understand why, before this legislation was drafted and submitted to Parlia-ment, the whole subject-matter of this bill
could not have been submitted to a parliamentary committee for examination and
recommendation, as was done in 1944.
I shall conclude what I have to say about
this bill with a renewed appeal on behalf of
the great national enterprise of identifying
this capital city and its surrounding district
as something outstanding in our national life.
It is not merely just one of some one hundred
municipalities to come within the scope of this
bill. For over fifty years the people of Canada have been told about the great possibilities of this capital city and district; and
millions of dollars on their behalf have been
expended and pledged in the fulfilment of
their desire to realize that glorious objective.
The Greber Plan, enshrined in a plaster of
paris model which bas been exhibited over
the length and breadth of Canada, stands in
mute testimony of great dreams and visions
of a Canadian capital centre worthy of the
national aspirations of Canadians. Is this all
to be submerged in a statutory provision
which can only be reflected in the future by
a total figure in the annual estimates showing
the amount of total grants to a favoured list
of municipalities throughout Canada? If for
no other reason than to give some reality to
the principle of "no taxation without representation", closer examination and consideration should be given to the project of a
national capital centre. It is unthinkable that
two and a half to three million dollars per
year should be granted to any municipality
in behalf of the Canadian taxpayer without
some federal control being exercised over the
spending of it.
Honourable senators, bear in mind it is
estimated that in this icity there are some
40,000 civil servants whose payroll runs to

SENATE
something like $10 million a month, which
sum is provided by the people of all ten
provinces. All Canada contributes. Now it
is proposed to grant $21 million to Ottawa,
even though the Treasurer and Mayor of
Ottawa have intimated that they are going
to resign. Are we just going to hand this
over to the city? I am not going to speak
about the dog fights among the civic officials
here except to say that perhaps one good
has come out of it all. I think I speak on
behalf of the average taxpayer of this city
when I say that the time is now ripe for
this city to be taken over and made a
federal district.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I venture to say that if it
were put to a vote of the people-the
ordinary citizen and taxpayer-hands would
go up every time in favour of that great
plan.
When the late Prime Minister, the Right
Honourable Mackenzie King, presented his
resolution to Parliament in 1944, asking for
a joint committee to consider this subject, he
pictured something of what the future held in
store for Canada and its Capital City and
District. I cannot do better than quote his
actual words on that occasion:
I should like to take advantage of this moment
to say just a word in regard to the future of
Ottawa. I have spoken on this subject a number
of times, and some years ago I made the suggestion,
which others have also made, that some day the
capital of Canada might become a federal district
to be administered by a commission, in a manner
similar to the capital at Washington. I am not
putting this forward as anything which should be
done immediately. It is a matter which will require
a great deal of consideration. But I feel that just
now, if there is to be any immediate consideration
of the planning of greater Ottawa as a city or as
a capital, that planning ought to have in mind all
possibilities of the development of this capital. I
have often hoped that if the capital were to become
a federal district, that district would extend far
enough to include a very large area on the other
side of the river as well as the Ottawa area. I
would ilke to see-I may not live to see it but I
hope others may-the day when the Ottawa River,
instead of flowing along the north border of the
capital, will be flowing through the heart of the
city, the greater Ottawa that is to be, and that
we shall have a capital city which will extend
as far into the province on the other side of the
Ottawa River as it may extend in the province
on this side. I do not think that is a vision of
the future needs or of future greatness by any
means too broad or too large. We have seen in
recent years how rapidly this city has grown. We
may well expect to sec a capital city of Canada
of dimensions beyond anything we are likely to
contemplate at this time.
I have one other thought in mind to which I
should like to give expression, and it is this. The
sacrifices of the men and women of Canada who
served in the last war have been memorialized by
a national war memorial in the heart of this
city. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to
create another memorial which could pay due
tribute to the service and sacrifice of those men

and women of Canada who will have served in the
What finer memorial
present world conflict.
could there be than a capital city which would
serve as a model of community planning for all
the other cities of Canada and which would be
symbolic of the world-wide effort of Canada in
the present war, and the significant place we hope
our country will occupy in the world of the
future-a national capital which would be not only
the pride of Canadians but also an object lesson
The

national war memorial of the last war is in the
heart of Ottawa. Might not the national memorial
of the present war find noble expression, carefully planned, in a federal district as the site of
the Canadian capital, through the heart of which
would flow the Ottawa River?

Eleven years have passed since those words
were uttered, and opinion in this community,
as well as feeling throughout the entire country bas grown strongly in favour of the project which the late Prime Minister so eloquently expressed. Unfortunately, the bill
before the house has failed to recognize that
fact.
I sincerely trust that the Government and
the Parliament of Canada have not lost
the vision of making Ottawa a great capital
city. And finally, as a very important step,
I suggest that the present Prime Minister
interview the Honourable Mr. Frost, Premier
of Ontario, and the Honourable Mr. Duplessis,
Premier of Quebec, with a view to coming
to an agreement in regard to allowing Ottawa
and Hull, should it be so decided upon, to
become part of the Federal District of Ottawa,
similar to that of Washington, D.C., and one
that every province in Canada may well feel
proud of.

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, if the honourable Leader speaks

reading of this bill.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, if
I remember correctly, I also sat on the joint
committee of both bouses which has been
referred to. Does the honourable senator
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) suggest that people living in the federal district
which be proposes would be deprived of a
vote in elections?
Hon. Mr. Reid: If the federal district were
well managed, I do not think they would
care. The citizens of Washington do not vote.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I know the people do
not vote in the District of Columbia. However, this is a somewhat different proposition.

JUNE 23, 1955
Washington was planned many years ago. I
doubt if the plan suggested by my honourable friend would be workable at the present
time.
I do not wish to enter into this argument
at all, but I think that it is possible to be
carried away with these immense schemes of
spending money on tearing down buildings
and widening streets for programs of development. I do not agree with enterprises of that
kind at the present time. I think every part
of the country should receive consideration,
and not one particular district only.
Honourable senators, I do not wish to argue
further about the matter.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable senators, first of all, I should like to express my
very hearty appreciation of the speech delivered by the honourable senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid). He referred to
me as one of the members of the Joint Committee on Federal-Municipal Relations, which
sat in the summer of 1944. I have in my
hand a copy of the unanimous report that
was presented by that committee. The
late Senator Copp, who was one of the joint
chairmen of the committee, the other having
been the member for Battleford, from the
House of Commons, Mr. Gregory. Senator
DuTremblay, the late Senator Leger, the late
Senator G. V. White, Senator Stevenson and
myself were the other members of the committee from this house.
The honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid)-who was then a
member of the House of Commons-was a
most active and interested member of that
house on the committee. The significance of
his remarks today Is that over these past
eleven years little headway has been made
in accomplishing the objectives set forth in
the committee's report and so eloquently commended in the remarks of the late Prime Minister on the introduction of the resolution in
the Commons, as quoted by my honourable
friend.
It is a serious reflection on those concerned
that more material headway has not been
made toward the realization of the great work
envisaged at that time. Those objectives had
their origin fifty years ago, and in accordance
with the development of the national consciousness of Canada they have been emphasized from time to time.
Reference has been made to the sums of
money that have been expended on acquiring property around the capital city, and on
maintenance of parks, driveways and boulevards, as well as on policing and other activities throughout the city. The people of
Canada have all contributed toward the cost

of acquiring and maintaining this property.
I have no hesitation in emphasizing what my
honourable friend has said, that the people
of Canada are not getting the run for their
money that they deserve in the development
of the capital and the federal district areas
surrounding it. Public opinion in this community today is overwhelmingly in favour of
greater progress being made towards the
realization of these objectives.
To emphasize the remarks made by my
honourable friend from New Westminster I
should like to read a short paragraph from
the report made in 1944, which confirms and
supports the eloquent words expressed by
the Prime Minister of that time. The report
reads:
It is not the purpose of this committee to make
definite recommendations to the Government regarding the future character of a federal district
to embrace this park area and the municipalities
on either side of the Ottawa River including the
city of Ottawa. We are of the opinion, however,
that this long-term project should be committed
by the Government to a special commission of
experts for investigation and report, involving as it
would the possession of expert professional
knowledge and the need for extended travel to
study the plans and workings of federal capital
districts in other countries. From the observations made by this committee during its investigations, it is clear that with the growth of Canada
and the corresponding expansion of its governmental activities, the administrative problems
arising between the City of Ottawa and the federal
Government will become more complex and more
difficult of settlement than they are now. As an
indication of that prospect we would merely stress
the inevitable difficulty that will arise in connection with the present reckless system of sewage
disposal into the Ottawa River, with both banks
of which within the most directly affected area,
are the property of the Dominion of Canada.
While the project of a federal district of the
proportions indicated must wait not only for well
matured and well founded plans, but also for the
widespread support of a crystallized popular
opinion throughout Canada, the development of
Ottawa as a national capital is proceeding apace,
and must not be held up, pending a settlement of
the larger question.

I have read those two paragraphs to emphasize the fact that what my friend has said
was clearly considered at that time, in the
hope that some headway and progress would
be made toward the betterment of this area
in the years that followed. One reason why
satisfactory progress and headway have not
been made has, I think, been due fundamentally to the incompatibility of a smallgauge municipal system of government resting
in the heart of an area which is largely representative of the people of Canada. I make
that statement, honourable senators, without
any disrespect whatsoever to those who may
be in positions of importance in relation to
the municipal government of this city. Indeed,
I have very high respect for the versatile
abilities and resourcefulness of the present

SENATE
Mayor of Ottawa, even though she has recently threatened to resign her position. But
I say that the situation as between the municipality and the Federal District can be
likened to the tail of a very large dog trying
to influence the locomotion of that animal.
I maintain that the large majority of the
residents in this city and district, as well as
the people throughout the whole of Canada,
are very much in favour of some appreciable
headway being made towards the realization
of the plans undertaken years ago; and they
have every right to expect more rapid progress than bas been made in the past ten
years.
In 1944, when the joint committee's report
was submitted and unanimously concurred
in, the Government of that day, under the
leadership of the late Mackenzie King,
brought in new legislation amending the
Federal District Commission Act so as to
make the Federal District Commission representative of every province in Canada. Prior
to that time it had been a purely local commission; but after that, representatives from
every province in Canada assembled periodically in Ottawa at meetings of the commission
to consider matters relating to the capital
city and Federal District. Mr. Greber had
been brought to Canada in 1939, but he was
brought back after the war with a view to
preparing a plan which might readily be
carried out over a term of years. As has
been said, that plan was enshrined in a
plaster of paris model and sent over the
length and breadth of this country two or
three years ago in order that everybody might
have an opportunity of seeing what was
contemplated in connection with the development of this project.
In concluding my remarks I would again
emphasize what has been said by the honourable senator from New Westminster; and
I should also like to read the two concluding
sentences of the report of 1944:

Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I think that the point
raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition can be easily explained, but before
attempting to answer his question I would
suggest that this bill be referred to the
appropriate committee before which officials
can appear and be questioned about matters
related to this legislation. I recognize that
there is not time now to go into details of
the proposed federal district set-up, involving
the elimination of the present municipal form
of government and other matters. But the
answer to the question asked by my honourable friend concerns the two provinces on
either side of the Ottawa River. The Governments of Ontario and Quebec control municipal affairs in their respective provinces.
There is no suggestion, and there never
has been, that school facilities should not
remain as they are today, embodied in the
affairs of the community, just as they are
in the District of Columbia, where schools
are maintained under school boards as part
of the federal district organization. Naturally,
the needs of the people living in the district
must be met.
But the main point, honourable senators,
is to give value in return for the money
expended by the taxpayers over the past
years, by seeing that something along the
proposed lines is set up, corresponding with
the ambitions and aspirations of the Canadian people. It has to be thought of in those
terms and not in any petty, narrow terms
of ward politics. It seems to me that it is
a matter of getting ahead with the job. A
definite position was taken on this matter
more than eleven years ago, but today the
whole thing is submerged in a bill giving
grants to municipalities-largely as the result,
may I say, of political pressure. I say that
advisedly, because before 1949, when the
Municipal Grants Bill was first introduced,
there was no suggestion whatsoever from any
other municipality in Canada that it should
share in the grants that were being given by
The federal Government and the City of Ottawa

in lieu of taxes and that becomes a matter
of policy. As the honourable senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) has said,
that policy was adopted in 1949 under this
act, which now is being amended to increase
these grants. Well, my objection to the whole
thing is that it bas not been subjected to
proper examination or investigation. A committee should have been set up to look into
these matters and give fair perspective to all
that is involved in this bill with regard to
the capital city and its relation to these other
problems.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The honourable senator
bas not answered my question. I asked who
pays the cost of the schools and other
municipal services under a federal district
set-up.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Under the present
system, educationHon. Mr. Haig: I know what the present
system is, but what is it going to be under
your plan?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The people living in
the federal district would pay for these
services. People would still be inhabiting
this area-there are 210,000 here today.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: Would the cost not be
paid by the whole country in the form of
taxes?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: No, not entirely by the
whole country.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Why not?
Hon. Mr. Lambert Well, referring back to
the District of Columbia, there the people
have their institutions, and taxation is levied
in that district to maintain services such as
police and fire protection, schools, and so on.
But that is a matter of detail. I thought my
honourable friend was referring to the complication that might arise as the result of
these matters being under different governments. That is a problem that will of course
have to be dealt with and worked out fully.
And, if I may say so, I do not know how the
people of this country could be given any
finer concrete example of co-operation in the
interests of unity in Canada as between the
provinces and the Dominion, than through the
establishment in this centre of a federal district, including the capital city and the
surrounding areas. It would give substance to
the idea of national unity and be a symbol
which I think would influence in a very real
way the broader interests of Canada in every
respect.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I did not intend to take part in this debate;

in fact I did not know it was going to come
up in this way. But if I wanted to congratulate the Government, this bill provides
an occasion for doing so. The speech by my
honourable friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) prompts me to think that this
proposed increased aid to municipalities is
perhaps a good thing. It really looks as if
the federal Government is trying to save
some money for the people of Canada which,
according to the chairman of our Finance
Committee (Hon. Mr. Crerar), is a very laudable ambition. But I am not in favour of
bringing this area into a federal district,
because to do so would increase the cost of
municipal services to three times what it is
today.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Nonsense!
Hon. Mr. Haig: You say nonsense, but that
has always been the experience.
Hon. Mr. Lambert On what basis do you
say that? Is it just a guess?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I will answer you. As I
said, that has always been the experience.
It matters not what party or government is
in power, you will find wherever you go,
that when the public service takes over
detailed administration, the costs go up. The
Government may be able to handle defence
and other things of a national character, but
when it comes to detailed administration
it should be left to the people themselves;
they will do it efficiently, because they are
the ones who pay the taxes. When the control
is exercised by the Government, it is not
the Government, but the taxpayers generally,
who have to pay. I do not think that this
state of things makes for unity.
For twenty years I have viewed the
approaches to these buildings, and have seen
tourists from the United States arrive here
by the carload. The honourable senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) is not around
here in the evenings or during week-ends to
see these people, but let me tell him what is
the first thing they do when they come here.
The other day I asked some tourists who had
just arrived from Florida, what they were
interested in looking at. The answer they
gave, in effect, was, "Well, we want to go
to the grounds of the Parliament buildings
and have our girls photographed beside the
policeman with the red uniform." I said, "Do
you know what that building is over there?"
No, they said, they didn't. So then I asked,
"Do you know what this nearby building is?"
Well, they thought it was the Parliament
building. But they could not identify one
block from the other; they did not even know

except that some of them wanted to be photographed with "the redcoats"-one or other
of the two or three men stationed in front
of the buildings.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I ask my honourable friend if they explained to him how
they happened to get here?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Let me finish my speech,
and then ask me questions. If my honourable
friends wants to interrupt me, I will allow
him to do so; but in this house it is not good
manners to interrupt. I remained silent until
he finished what he had to say.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Do not talk about manners to me. If anybody has less of them than
the honourable Leader of the OppositionHon. Mr. Haig: I did not ask you questions
until you were ready to sit down. As a matter of fair play, please treat me in the same
way.
Why should the people of my province,
or of any other, be required to pay taxes
when residents of some particular area are
relieved of this particular obligation?
Hon. Mr. Reid: They are not.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Those who live in the
capital district do not pay taxes on the same
scale. Let the Government announce a
definite policy, and we shall know what to
do; we can either reject or endorse it.
Another point: look at the way the traffic
runs. If I want to go by car from this building to the nearby Chateau Laurier, what
must I do? I must go south to Slater street,
two or three streets below the hotel, then I
must cross a bridge over the canal and proceed easterly for a few blocks, then turn
north to Rideau street, then make another
turn and proceed westerly as many blocks
as I went in the opposite direction, and at
last I reach the hotel. It means that I travel
five times the distance I want to go. No
wonder one hears the Plaza called "Confusion Square". I know nothing like it anywhere else on earth. I have visited about a
hundred of the world's cities, and in no place
have I found it more difficult to get from
one spot to the other than here in Ottawa,
from the Parliament Buildings to the chief
hotel. The other day, when I arrived at the
Union Station, I wanted to walk straight
across the road, but I was told that it was
against the rules; I must take a circular
route around the street and back again. That
is the kind of thing one may expect to find,
and does find, in a controlled city.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Those matters are
under the city administration.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I admit that, but the
federal Government bas some control too.

If, in my city of Winnipeg, there was no
more gravel on the sidewalks after a snowfall than one finds here, the people would
shoot the mayor. If snow fell tonight in
Winnipeg, tomorrow morning outfits would
be busy distributing gravel and sand. When
I ask what delays action after a snowfall on
the ground between here and the hotel, I am
told that it is the responsibility of the
Federal District; and about twenty-four
hours afterwards one finds that gravel is
being sprinkled on the road.
I object to the formation of a federal
district unless the proposal is agreed to by
the nation's representatives from coast to
coast. It is for them to decide the matter;
I do not believe that the decision should
rest with us alone.
I realize that what I am saying will not
be welcomed in some quarters. I shall be
lambasted tomorrow in the Ottawa papers;
they will assert that I am unfriendly to
Ottawa. That is not so, but I am in favour
of giving a fair deal to Canada as a whole.
In Winnipeg the City provides police and
fire protection for all the dominion buildings. For that service we do not receive a
cent.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Your city is not within
the formula prescribed by this bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, the formula is not
satisfactory. I want the same conditions in
regard to taxation of federal buildings to
apply in Ottawa, in Halifax, in Vancouver,
and every other Canadian city. Why, for
instance, should Winnipeg be taxed to provide fire, police and other protection for
dominion government property if some other
city is relieved of that obligation? The
requirements of the formula are such that
our city cannot possibly qualify under it.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: There are not enough
federal buildings in Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I admit that we support
largely Conservative and CCF candidates.
Maybe that has something to do with it. I
will not go so far as to say that it bas, for
at this time the Government is providing us
with a Post Office building at a cost of $9
million. That is a pretty fair contribution
to Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. Horner: And you do not need it,
at that!
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think we do need it.
The building will be very useful, and we are
providing the necessary services. I repeat
that if a concession is given to one city it
should be given to all cities.
I am now willing to answer any question
which the honourable senator from Ottawa
may wish to ask.

JUNE 23, 1955
Hon. Mrs. Wilson: Honourable senators, I
was pleased that the honourable senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) referred to the
pollution of the Ottawa River. To my mind
it is simply disgraceful that not only the
citizens of Ottawa, but people on both sides
of the river, do not have the benefits of that
beautiful stream. The water is unfit for
drinking, and it cannot be used for swimming.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators,The Hon. the Acting Speaker: If the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) speaks now, he will close the
debate on the second reading of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I do not propose at this time to enter into the
discussion of whether the capital city should
be included in a federal district. There is no
provision for the establishment of a federal
district in this bill, but it has been a very
interesting discussion and I am sure the
Government will take note of everything that
has been said.
Those who have spoken have inadvertently
neglected to refer to the beauty of our capital
city, and I am fearful that as a result of this
debate the people of Canada may get the
impression that our capital city is not one
of which we can all be proud. Many Canadians have not yet visited Ottawa, and any of
them who read this debate might feel it is
not worth while to come here. I know that
honourable senators did not mean to give this
impression, for Ottawa is indeed a beautiful
city. I doubt whether any place in the world
was more attractive than Ottawa during the
Tulip Festival this spring, when thousands
upon thousands of tulips decorated our driveway system. Have any of us ever seen a
more lovely display? What city in the world
has a finer driveway system? What a magnificent sight greets the visitor to Parliament
Hill-the broad green lawns, the colourful
flower beds, the pleasant walks, and the
majestic Parliament Buildings themselves.
The natural beauty of Ottawa is enhanced by
numerous splendid structures, of which the
Veterans Memorial Building on Wellington
Street is the most recently completed one;
and the new buildings for the National
Library, the National Gallery, and the
National Museum will add to the grandeur of
our capital. I mention these things to emphasize that Ottawa is a really beautiful city
and a capital of which all Canadians can
truly be proud.
The honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) said that the Parliament Buildings are being excluded from
federal property.
50437-44

Hon. Mr. Reid: Just the East and West
Blocks.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: This follows the basis
on which grants in lieu of taxes are made in
the United Kingdom. Full taxes are paid
there on nearly all Crown properties, although
for some classes loss of taxes is paid, which
presumably amounts to less than full taxes.
Payments had been made on a few Crown
properties for centuries, but the main system
of grants was set up in 1874. The Treasury
Valuer was given the final say about the
assessment of Crown properties and the local
authorties had no appeal from his decision.
The Houses of Parliament in London were
originally excluded from the British system
of grants in lieu of taxes. They were, however, added in 1896, at which time it was
stated:
My Lords regard this as a case In which some
contribution may be allowed, but the rules for
the assessment of private property are not applicable, and they therefore sanction the payment of
a moderate contribution to be fixed with due
regard to the peculiar character of the property.

I have referred to the exclusion of federal properties in Canada. The rules for the
assessment of taxable properties and most
federal properties are not applicable to the
Parliament Buildings nor to the land which
is used along with these buildings.
The
buildings are large and costly in relation to
the number of persons occupying them, and
the grant which would result from applying
standard assessment procedure, even after
eliminating values of ornamental and nonfunctional features, is out of proportion to
the grant paid on other office buildings in
Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That does not apply to
land values.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It applies to buildings.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Only.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes. The land value
would be comparable to other land values in
the immediate vicinity.
A grant based on standard assessment procedure is also out of proportion to the cost
of providing municipal services. The lands
appurtenant to the Parliament Buildings are
in the nature of park lands and might be
excluded on that ground from the grant base.
The honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) has suggested that this bill
should be referred to committee. I suppose
the appropriate one would be the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce, and
if the bill is given second reading I shall be
pleased to accede to the suggestion that has
been made.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Before the question is put
would the honourable Leader place on record
the grants paid to various municipalities?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have not that information available now.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The honourable senator can
get that information in committee.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, it is information
which can be obtained when the bill is in
committee.
Hon. Mr. Horner: At that time I should
like to get information as to expenditures by
the Federal District Commission.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is another question which can be considered in committee,
although it is really beyond the provisions
of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I suppose the committee
will not hold a public hearing, and therefore
no record will be made of the proceedings.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I shall endeavour to
obtain the information and have it put on
record when the bill is before this house
for third reading.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Thank you.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald, the
bill was referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
CANADIAN

NATIONAL RAILWAYS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. T. A. Crerar moved the second reading
of Bill 351, an act respecting Canadian
National Railways.
He said: Honourable senators, the principle
of this bill rests upon a secure foundation.
The system known as the Canadian National
Railways is the result of the bringing together of various individual railways over
a period of many years. Each of those, of
course, was governed or affected by statutes
of the Canadian Parliament at some time or
another.
The purpose of this bill is simply to consolidate into one statute various legislative
acts that affect the operation of the Canadian
National Railways as we know the system
today. That is the simple, elementary principle of the bill, and I suggest to the house
that it rests upon a secure foundation. The
consolidation would be a convenience for all
who have to do with the administration of
the Canadian National Railways, as well as
for members of Parliament.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Why was it not done
when the statutes were revised a year or so
before, instead of leaving it until now?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Well, that is a question
which might be answered if the bill goes to
committee. I am simply stating that the
purpose of the bill is to consolidate into one
statute various enactments relating to Canadian National Railways.
A few other points need mention. Some
new provisions are referred to in the explanatory notes to the bill. First, the bill includes
authority to operate a telecommunication
system. At present various subsidiaries controlled by Canadian National Railways have
telecommunication systems, but not of a complete, co-ordinated character. The new provision would enable Canadian National Railways to effect a change of that kind.
The second new provision authorizes officers and employees of Canadian National
Railways to act as directors of partially
owned companies. That is simply a matter
of convenience, and it undoubtedly would
expedite the work of administration.
Again, the bill authorizes the railway to
construct short lines without reference to
Parliament. The legislation sets a limit of
six miles. Such construction must be approved
by the Minister of Transport and the Governor in Council. If, for instance, there was a
need to run a spur line into a factory established on the outskirts of some manufacturing
centre, this bill would enable the railway,
with the approval of the Governor in Council, to build such a spur line without having
to come to Parliament for authority to do so.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Can the railways not
proceed without authorization now?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No, I understand that
they cannot.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am surprised.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: There is also a provision
in the bill for extinguishing charters of constituent corporations that have no longer
any reason for existence. That is a provision
to which, I think, no exception can be taken.
There are also provisions in the bill
authorizing the company to operate motor
vehicles. This provision has aroused some
criticism from various parts of the country,
as it did in the House of Commons when the
bill was discussed there. I think there is
some misapprehension about the powers
given under this section. According to existing legislation motor vehicles come under the
laws of the provinces in which they operate,
and that is also true of motor transport traffic
across interprovincial boundaries. That is
the result of legislation passed by Parliament

JUNE
last session. The provincial authorities, therefore, will not be affected by developments
which may result from this legislation, so far
as motor transport vehicles are concerned.
Many changes have taken place in railway
transportation, and it may be found that on
certain branch lines the railway can operate
motor vehicle transport at a profit, instead of
operating trains at a loss. If the house will
permit me, I can give an apt illustration of
the great change which has taken place.
Fifty years ago a certain railway line in
Manitoba, covering a distance of 225 miles,
ran a train each way every day with five or
six passenger coaches. Last year the railway sought and received permission from
the Board of Transport Commissioners to
cease to operate trains on that line. The
service is now given by motor transport and
buses operated by private companies, and
the railway has discontinued a line that it
had been operating for some time at a
substantial loss.
Honourable senators, if this bill receives
second reading I shall suggest that it be
referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
this bill has received some criticism. The
federal Government went to the expense of
securing a decision from the Supreme Court
of Canada granting it complete control over
interprovincial trucking trafic. I was very
pleased with that decision, and hoped the
Government would introduce legislation that
would be uniform and fair to all concerned,
so as to permit trucking wherever it would
be more economical than railroad services.
But, no, the Government, for some reason
I fail to understand, passed it over and
brought in legislation giving the control back
to the provinces, thereby refusing to take
the responsibility of dealing with one of
the most pressing problems with which this
country is faced, and which at some time
must be resolved.
There is a large and important area which
in so far as the national economy is concerned, is dependent on railways. In the carriage of much of our export products, for
example, no method of trucking can successfully compete with the railways. Therefore
we are vitally interested in securing for them
their just due, and lines that are already
built and satisfactorily located should be
maintained and continue to render service.
I cannot understand why the federal Government stood by when there was talk of
further freight rate increases, and did not
make use of the power to control interprovincial truck traffic. True, the railway line which
50437-44J

was abandoned in Manitoba was, I understand, within the province and a matter in
which the provincial government had authority. But I stress my concern and disappointment over the lack of action by the federal
Government when it had received the Supreme Court decision which expressly gave it
the authority to control interprovincial truck
traffic. In its failure to take action, I say the
Government shirked its responsibility. As time
goes on we will more and more realize the
vital need for action by the federal Government to control interprovincial trucking.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
in view of the possibility that when this bill
is considered in committee no record will be
kept of the proceedings, I have a few words
to say about the measure.
I have been watching with interest this
provision whereby the railways can now go
into the trucking business, which is a departure from its former activities. I would like
some assurance from the railways that what
was said by the honourable senator who explained the bill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) is really
what is meant.
Let me illustrate my point. The railway at
one time carried all the freight from Vancouver to a point some 500 miles into the interior
of British Columbia. The time came when a
carrying
trucking company commenced
freight to the same point at a much lower
rate than that charged by the railway. Consequently, the trucks got the traffic and the
railway did not. After some three or four
years the railway reduced its rates below
those charged by the trucking company.
Naturally, there was strong protest by the
truck operators; but I pointed out to them
that they had little ground for protest, because in the first instance they had taken the
business from the railway by undercutting
its rates. Now, as the railway is losing
money on that particular haul, there is talk
of it putting in a trucking system.
I should like some assurance from the
railway officials that whatever trucking they
undertake will be an ancillary operation to
the rails and will not be operated in competition with the regular trucking companies.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Crerar, the bill was
referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.

SENATE
CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
REFUNDING BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. G. Pervical Burchill moved the second
reading of Bill 450, an Act respecting Canadian National Railways and to provide for the
refunding of matured, maturing and callable
financial obligations.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
simple bill, the purpose of which is to give
authority to the Canadian National Railways to refund securities which mature or
will become callable between the years 1956
and 1962. Similar legislation was passed
in 1935, 1938, 1944, 1947 and 1951. This bill
is patterned on the bill passed in 1951.
The amount which will mature or become
callable in the period mentioned is $200 million. The procedure, as honourable senators
know, is that the Canadian National Railways, make temporary borrowings from the
Government and issue securities theref or
at such times as the official of the Bank of
Canada and of the railway feel is most
propitious.
I think the bill needs no further
explanation.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Burchill, the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications.
NATIONAL RAILWAYS
CANADIAN
FINANCING AND GUARANTEE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. G. Percival Burchill moved the second
reading of Bill 451, an Act to authorize the
provision of moneys to meet certain capital
expenditures of the Canadian National Railways System during the calendar year 1955,
and to authorize the guarantee by Her Majesty
of certain securities to be issued by the Canadian National Railway Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to provide for financing by the
Canadian National Railway Company in order
to secure moneys needed for capital expenditures. A similar bill was passed in 1952,
and this one is patterned on it.
The total expenditures, which include additions and betterments, branch line construcequipment, amount to
tion and new
$163,508,334, less amounts available from
depreciation reserves, working capital and
retirement of equipment totalling $47,509,334,
leaving a balance to be found of $115,999,000.
That amount represents, first, authorization

to incur capital expenditures of $75,999,000
in the year 1955; and, secondly, it represents
authority to discharge obligations incurred
under this act which become due and payable
after January 1, 1956; and to make capital
expenditures prior to July 1, 1956, in the
amount of $40 million.
In addition, the act authorizes the railway
company to enter into contracts for new
equipment and for general additions and
betterments in the amount of $45,681,498,
to make contracts for but payment for which
will likely not be made within the next year
or two.
Now, those things are what the bill does
as far as financing is concerned. It also
provides for the appointment of the auditors
of the company for the year 1955. Honourable senators will recall that in previous years
a separate bill was introduced for this
purpose.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Who are the auditors?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: George A. Touche
and Co.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Why was the practice
changed, and the appointment of auditors
included in a bill of this nature rather than
in a separate bill as was done in former
years?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: As this bill deals entirely with financing, it was felt that it was
proper to include the appointment of the
auditors in this bill.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Well, it took a long time
to come to that.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is progress.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Slow, though.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I would like to ask the
honourable senator from Northumberland
(Hon. Mr. Burchill) what betterments and
new equipment are covered by this bill.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: In reply to my honourable friend I would say that detailed information on that matter was given before the
Railways and Shipping Committee of the
other house by officials of the railway. The
budget was approved by that committee, and
it includes the amounts which I have just
enumerated. I do not feel competent to discuss these items in detail or to answer the
question fully. The information will be given
by officials of the company when the bill
is before a committee of this house.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Is anything included in
this bill for the Conrad Hilton Hotel system?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I am not in a position
to answer that question.

JUNE 23, 1955
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
we have had in the past several bills similar
to this one. In fact, I would say that this
bill is practically identical with other bills
that we have had in the past.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: In 1952.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The thing that I have
always wondered about in connection with
these bills is this: the Canadian National
Railways management comes before the Government and asks for certain things, and the
Government agrees to write off certain
amounts. Last session a bill for this purpose
was passed by the House of Commons and
subsequently came to our house, and after a
long examination of the railway officials who
appeared before our committee we agreed to
write off a very large indebtedness. I remember distinctly asking Mr. Gordon, the President, this question: Will this be the end of
the write-offs? He replied that as the country
is now in a prosperous condition he could see
no necessity for further write-off on account
of deficits. However, I am not going into
detail on that now. I do not know what has
happened this year to bring about a deficitonly the railway people can answer that
question.
Honourable senators, when voting money
for the Canadian National Railways in these
bills I have never been quite sure what has
become of the money through the years. I
am not questioning whether it is honestly
expended. I know George A. Touche & Company, the company's auditors. They are a
well-known English firm which does a large
auditing business in all the large cities of
Canada. They have been auditing the railway's books throughout the years, and they
have an A-1 reputation. I have no qualms
on that score. But what I am thinking about
is whether the provisions for depreciation
have been carried through the books so as
to show the true situation. What I want to
know is if there is any capital loss in these
accounts from time to time that does not show
in the current loss, and I want to hear the
auditors' answer to that question when they
appear before our committee.
Honourable senators, I think this bill should
be considered by the Banking and Commerce
Committee. True, other railway bills have
been referred to the Committee on Transport
and Communications, but they were straight
railroad bills. This being a finance bill, I
think it should be referred to the Banking
and Commerce Committee. I would like the
management of the company to be able to
answer the question that I have just posed.
I want to know if all the provisions for
depreciation have been properly taken into

the accounts throughout the years or if these
have just been allowed to disappear. If we
are to keep putting in new capital we have
to know what becomes of it. At the present
time there is nothing to show what happens
to the old capital, and that is why I would
like to get an answer to my question.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I have no answer to
that, but I should like to put on the record
the statement that this bill is not one covering
debt financing. It is concerned with new
financing.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I know that.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: There is something else
that I would like to put on the record. For
the purpose of additions and betterments,
excluding equipment, $44,758,334 is required;
for branch line construction, $12,160,000; for
new equipment, $60,897,000; for acquisition of
securities, $5,693,000; for capital expenditures
January 1, 1956 to June 30, 1956, incurred
prior to January 1, 1956, $40 million. That
adds up to $163,508,334.
From that figure we have to deduct the
amounts my honourable friend is talking
about; amount available from depreciation
reserves, $12,394,000; retirement of equipment, which is another way of describing
depreciation reserves-and this, I may say, is
a set-up of their books that I just do not
understand-$20,115,334; and working capital
available for capital expenditures, $15 million.
These items total $47,509,334 which, as I say,
is deductible from the required amount of
$163,508,334, leaving a balance of $115,999,000,
which is the net amount required for capital
expenditures.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I be permitted to ask
the honourable gentleman another question?
I do not quite understand the full import of
the figures that he just read, but I will illustrate what I mean by the write-offs. This
year the Canadian National Railways sold
four hotels: one at Brandon, Manitoba, one
at Minaki, Ontario, one at Pictou, Nova Scotia,
and one at Port Arthur, Ontario. Those
hotels stood on the books at roughly
$3,250,000. That was the original cost. They
were sold for about $950,000, and it was said
that the difference was the write-off. Now,
what I want to know is whether that writeoff has been charged during the years as an
expense or not, because as far as I can see
there is no way to trace it as a loss.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: It was set up as a reserve
to take care of that particular item.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But what became of the
reserve when this sale took place? I think it
was lost.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Burchill: That amount would
naturally go into the working capital.

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL

Hon. Mr. Haig: Still, I think the reserve
was lost. In cases where equipment, engines
or buildings are sold, what happens to the
reserve? The original cost was $3,250,000.
How was the write-off taken care of when
new equipment was put in its place? Did it
disappear?

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Roebuck for the second reading of Bill 328,
an Act respecting unemployment insurance.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It disappears when it
becomes cash, and so does the reserve. The
money thus received becomes cash and goes
into the account.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I want to be sure of that.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators,
I was pleased to heair that the sponsor of this
bill intends to move that it be referred to the
Committee on Transport and Communications.
I say so because of the continuity of the
various Canadian National Railyways bills,
and in order that the committee may be informed of not only the operational methods
but the finances of the Canadian National
Railways.
May I also say a word about the railway
equipment? It will be recalled that on various
occasions I have criticized the Canadian
National Railways for the poor type of rolling
stock which was running from Halifax to
Montreal. Today we are very proud indeed
of the equipment, as represented by the
Ocean Limited, which runs between Halifax
and Montreal, and not only are we pleased
with this crack Atlantic train, but we are
well satisfied with the equipment on trains
running to Sydney, on the Scotian as well
as the Maritime Express. All three trains
have new, and, in the case of the Ocean
Limited, exceptionally fine equipment. The
honourable senator from King's (Hon. Mr.
McDonald), who frequently travels between
Halifax and Montreal, will, I am sure, agree
with me when I say that we are very fortunate to have rolling stock of this high
quality. To the management of the Canadian
National Railways I express appreciation for
what they have done, and the hope that they
will continue their efforts to furnish the
Maritime Express with the same kind of
equipment which is provided on the Ocean
Limited.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Burchill, the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications.

SECOND READING

Hon. Muriel McG. Fergusson: Honourable
senators, I should like first to congratulate
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) upon the very clear and
comprehensive explanation of this bill which
he gave yesterday. We realize that it could
not have been done so well unless it had been
preceded by a great deal of intensive work.
Even in the short time that I have had the
privilege of sitting in this chamber I have
come to realize that we can always expect
very clear explanations, and excellent and
accurate information, from the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity.
Hon. Senators: Hear. hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: This general revision
-the first since the Unemployment Insurance
Act was passed in 1940, has done a great deal
to clarify the legislation. The re-arrangement of the various sections in their proper
sequence will make the law more readily
understood by employees and employers and
should simplify the administration. The Department of Labour is to be congratulated on
the clear, well-drafted and easily understood
legislation which has been presented in this
bill. However, there is one provision to which
I object, and which many women had hoped
would be dropped from the act at this time
of its revision.
The section to which I refer is 67 1(c) (iv),
which provides that the commission with the
approval of the Governor in Council, may
make regulations imposing additional conditions and terms with regard to contributions
and benefits in relation to persons who are
married women.
The honourable senator from TorontoTrinity mentioned that the act had been
amended five times since it was passed, and
he referred to the changes which had been
brought about by some of the aýmendments.
He did not mention that among the amendments passed in 1950 was the provision that
special regulations may be made regarding
married women. Under the authority of this
amendment, later in the same year, section
5(a) of the regulations was passed. It provides that women, during the two years
immediately following marriage, and before
receiving benefits, must fulfil requirements
additional to those required of any other
employees. Generally, under this regulation,

JUNE 23, 1955
a married woman, no matter how many benefits she may have acquired through her contributions, will be disqualified from receiving
unemployment insurance benefit for the period
of two years following her marriage if she
was unemployed at the date of marriage, or
unless she has worked for sixty days following her first separation from work after her
marriage.
Honourable senators, this last clause is
considered by many as positively iniquitous,
and the committee of the other house which
studied the bill recommended that the commission study it with a view to eliminating it.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask what section is
being referred to?
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: It is regulation 5(a),
and section 67(1)(c)(iv) of the act.
Honourable senators, this legislation is
rank discrimination. If, as was stated by the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity,
this is an insurance scheme, it should be
carried on as a business and business practices should be followed.
Is there any insurance company in Canada
or elsewhere that would dare to accept
premiums from a woman client, and when
she becomes eligible for payment refuse to
pay on the ground that she has been married? No woman client would buy such
insurance and no insurance company would
consider offering it. However, unfortunately
in the case of the unemployment insurance,
the woman has no choice but to pay the
premiums, as unemployment insurance is
compulsory.
Ever since the passing of these regulations, in 1950, women and women's organizations throughout Canada have protested
against this legislation on the ground that it
is discriminatory legislation aimed against
one class of employees, namely married
women. From knowledge gained through
contacts with women's organizations, I believe that many representations have been
made to the Department of Labour asking
for the elimination of this regulation, and
since my appointment to this honourable
house many representations have been made
to me on this point. I feel, in fairness to
women, married or single-for some of those
now single may eventually be in the other
classification-that these protests should be
brought to the attention of this house.
According to the Dominion Bureau of
Statistics the number of insured persons in
the labour force as of April 1, 1954, was
3,317,000, and the number of women in the
insured labour force was 849,152, which is
about one quarter of the total insured labour

force. The number of single women in that
force was 561,289, and the number of married
women was 287,863.
In a statement prepared by the commission and presented and read before the
committee of the other house which was
considering this bill, it was stated that the
commission does not consider that the regulation discriminates against married women
as a class. This may be the opinion of the
commission, but it is not the opinion held by
a great number of women. The very fact
that there is legislation which does disqualify married women, who but for their
marriage are eligible for benefits, is discrimination, and no opinions on the matter,
whether held by the commission or anyone
else, can alter that fact.
The prepared statement to which I have
referred sets out individual cases of abuses
of the act by married women, and I know
that sometimes these do occur. I am of the
opinion, because of what I have learned,
that these abuses still occur, and that therefore the passing of this discriminatory legislation in 1950, which works hardship on
many married women who are bona ßide
applicants, apparently did not have the
desired effect and is not the proper way to
put a stop to such abuses. If it had done so
I might be willing to agree that in this case
the end justifies the means, even though I
disapprove of the means. In any event, I
think quoting such examples is not fair, for
I am sure that the files of the commission
contain many cases that show abuse of the
act by others than married women.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Although other
classes have abused the act they are not
picked out for special discriminatory legislation. I have heard many stories of male
applicants who have abused the regulations.
Honourable senators, I believe that another
approach would do much more to eliminate
abuse of the act both by male and female

act based on a comparatively new social
concept, a combination of insurance and

made clear enough to the public generally
that unemployment insurance should be regarded in the same light as fire or automobile
insurance, which gives protection in time of
need, and that the protection is what one
pays for. If one is fortunate enough not to
need the protection, in those cases one certainly does not expect a return of premiums
paid.
Abuses of the Unemployment Insurance Act
are perpetrated by unthinking persons who
do not understand the legislation and they
are tolerated by an uninformed public. It is
my belief that our Canadian people, male
and female are basically honest, and if they
understand the principle of this act they will
not try to evade the regulations or take
unfair advantage which would tend to deplete
the fund to the disadvantage of those properly
entitled to protection, and, perhaps to their
own disadvantage at a later date; nor would
an informed public tolerate such abuses.
My belief is strengthened when I recall
the experiences of the Wartime Prices and
Trade Board during World War II. At that
time much more was spent by the Government on educating the public regarding regulations and the need for them than was spent
on enforcement of the regulations. This education was carried on through intensive explanatory work, and, when it was understood,
the people co-operated and enforcement was
comparatively simple. Those who did not
co-operate were generally considered unpatriotic, and public sentiment against them prevented infractions of the regulations.
Similar intensive and aggressive educational
work regarding unemployment insurance
through the Department of Labour, labour
unions, men's and women's organizations,
schools and employers, would bring about a
better understanding of the basic principles
of unemployment insurance.
Such understanding would build up a new public attitude
under which those who scheme to evade the
regulations would not be considered as smart,
but as chisellers and as unsocial. I think this
would accomplish a great deal more than discriminatory legislation against certain classes,
such as that against married women.
In view of the large number of employed
women in the labour force who contribute
to unemployment insurance-which, I would
remind honourable senators, in April 1954 was
about one-quarter of the force insured-it is
surely only reasonable to expect that there
should be a woman on the Unemployment

Insurance Commission and on the Advisory
Committee. The honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity mentioned these, and he also
referred to the National Employment Committee. I am glad to say that a woman is
already serving on that committee, and that
there are women on the Regional and Local
Advisory Committees, which were set up
under section 99 of the present act and will be
under section 21 of the bill. Appointments to
the commission and the advisory committee
were recommended by the committee of the
other house which studied this bill, and I
earnestly request that the committee of this
house which studies this bill will make
similar recommendations.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Acting Speaker: If the
honourable senator speaks now, he will close
the debate.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I have very little to
add to the long and tedious speech I made
yesterday.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Not tedious.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, I thought it was
pretty long. I thank the honourable senator
from Fredericton (Hon. Mrs. Fergusson) for
ber kind references to my remarks, and I
wish to compliment her on the excellent
speech she has just delivered. I am sure she
bas a good deal of knowledge of the subjectmatter and of the act. She spoke about
discrimination against women, who make up
one-quarter of the working force insured
under the act. I think I speak for all male
members of this house when I say that there
is no intention on our part, at all events, to
discriminate unjustly against women. It is
possible to discriminate justly as well as
unjustly-to discriminate in favour of women
as well as against them.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Would that be justly
or unjustly?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think it would be
very just to discriminate in their favour.
The honourable senator from Fredericton
has, I think, admitted that there is need for
care in the handling of this act and with
respect to the large sums of money paid out
on behalf of both men and women. I agree
with ber that both men and women are
basically honest. I remember a sign put up,
in a broker's office, I think, which read,
"All men are honest, but keep your hand on
your pocket." One does not need to consider everybody a cheat and a liar because

JUNE 23, 1955
one takes due precautions to protect one's
property and rights and interests.
In this particular instance, the only reason
I know for special references to women is
the experience of the commission in dealing
with women who enter into the holy bonds
of matrimony and then apply to the commission for the unholy purpose of getting
money to which they are not entitled. Women
have been known to get married and at the
same time make claims upon the Unemployment Insurance fund on the ground of unemployment-and certainly marriage is not
unemployment. I understand that a great
deal of that deception bas been practised, and
it may have resulted in the necessity for
special regulations. The regulations that have
been in existence up to the present time are
now being extensively revised, and a lot of
work is being spent on that task. Recommendations similar to those made by the honourable senator from Federicton this afternoon,
as well as those made by the Industrial Relations Committee of the House of Commons
after studying the bill, will be seriously considered by the commissioners, and I expect
those recommendations will be given effect
to in the new regulations.
If this bill receives second reading, I shall
move that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Immigration and Labour; and
I can assure the house that the members of
the commission and officials will attend the
meetings of the committee and may be questioned on points about the regulations now
in existence, as well as those that it is proposed to put into existence after this bill
has been passed. I am inclined to think
that after the commissioners and officials
have been heard, honourable senators will be
fully satisfied that the discrimination against
married women in the bill is not an unjust
discrimination and that no injustice is
intended against women as such.

I should like to concur in the suggestion
of my honourable friend that there be a
woman member of the commission. However,
this house has not the appointment of the
commissioners.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Could we not make
that recommendation?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There are now three
very capable commissioners on the board,
whose span of life shows no signs of terminating. It is unlikely that there will be a
new appointment for some time. But I hope
that those in authority will remember the
suggestion made by the honourable senator
from Fredericton, and that when appointments are being made consideration will be
given to the right of the women of Canada,
who comprise one quarter of the labour force,
to be represented on the commission.
I have nothing further to say, honourable
senators, except to thank you for the patience
with which you listened to my explanation
of the bill yesterday afternoon.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Did I understand the
honourable senator to say yesterday that one
of the commissioners is now approaching
seventy years of age?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, but seventy is not
old these days.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Not as far as senators are
concerned.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I also mentioned that
that particular member of the commission
was carrying on with all his old-time vigour
and keenness.
The motion was agreed to and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

JUNE 2
at Vancouver on April 18, 19 and 20, with
hearings in camera on the 21st and 22nd.
Public hearings were held at Toronto on May
20 and at Montreal on May 27.
These were the first occasions on which any
committee of the Senate of Canada had ever
held meetings in centres other than Ottawa.
Invitations to make representations to the
committee were extended to Attorneys General and Ministers of Health of all provinces
and with the exception of the province of
British Columbia, all indicated they had no
representations to make.
Similar invitations were sent to the Mayors
of the cities of Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg,
Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver and Victoria.
Replies in the negative were received from
Winnipeg, Calgary and Victoria.
The committee held seventeen meetings all
of which, with the exception of two, were
open to the public. The two closed meetings
were devoted entirely to hearing the representations of narcotic drug addicts, at the
R.C.M.P. Barracks in Vancouver, and at
Oakalla Prison Farm in Burnaby, British
Columbia. Twenty-one addicts and relatives
or friends of addicts were heard at the
R.C.M.P. Barracks, and at Oakalla Prison
Farm Warden Christie convened a meeting of
some 150 addicts in the chapel of the prison.
During the latter meeting addicts made representations to the whole committee.
Portions of several committee meetings
were closed to the public and were devoted
exclusively to matters of procedure and the
preparation of the committee report.
A request was made to have the sessions
held in Vancouver televised. It was deemed
advisable, however, not to grant such request.
Evidence was adduced from government
sources, including federal, provincial, and
municipal authorities; from organizations and
individuals; a list and classification of the
witnesses is set out in Schedule 1 to this
report. Representations in the form of briefs,
submissions and letters were received from
a number of individuals and organizations.
Ail of these representations were carefully
considered and analyzed.
Valuable assistance was rendered to the
committee by the Mayors and municipal
administrations of the cities of Vancouver,
Toronto, and Montreal and by the Honourable R. W. Bonner, Q.C., Attorney-General of
British Columbia. Special mention should
be made of valuable assistance rendered by
Mr. John A. Hinds, Assistant Chief Clerk of
Committees, and Mr. Robert E. Curran, Q.C.,
Counsel for the Department of National
Health and Welfare.

Definition of Drug Addiction
For the purposes of the inquiry the committee decided to adopt the definition of drug
addiction approved by World Health Organization of the United Nations. It is as follows:
Drug addiction is a state of periodie or chronic
intoxication, detrimental to the individual and to
society, produced by the repeated consumption of
a drug (natural or synthetic).
Its characteristics
include:
1. An overpowering desire or need (compulsion)
to continue taking the drug and to obtain it by any

means;

2. A tendency to increase the dose;
3. A physical (psychological) and sometimes a
physical dependence on the effects of the drug.

Legislation
The Canadian legislation dealing with narcotic drugs is contained in the Opium and
Narcotic Drug Act, R.S.C. 1952, C. 201, as
amended by R.S.C. 1952, C. 325, S. 73, 1953-54,
C. 38, and the regulations thereunder, (as
made and established by Order in Couneil
P.C. 1954-1212, effective September 15, 1954).
The purpose of the legislation is, firstly, to
make narcotic drugs available for medical
and scientific purposes through trade and professional channels, and secondly the enforcement side.
the
arrangement
By
administrative
R.C.M.P. are responsible for the enforcement
on the criminal side of the legislation, and
the Department of National Health and
Welfare, Division of Narcotic Control, is concerned with the importation and legal distribution of drugs in Canada. The officers of
the Department of National Health and Welfare work closely with the R.C.M.P.
The committee desires to express its appreciation to the Honourable Paul Martin, Minister of National Health and Welfare, for his
assistance in outlining to the committee the
narcotic drug problem in Canada and for the
co-operation given by him and by the officers of his department.
The committee was favourably impressed
with the efficiency of the administration of
the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act by the
Division of Narcotic Control of the Department of National Health and Welfare, headed
by Mr. K. C. Hossick.
The committee would also like to pay tribute to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
for the efficient manner in which they assist
in the enforcement of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act and for their co-operation
and assistance to the committee.
International Control
Canada has played an important role in
international control and is a signatory to all
international conventions designed to limit

SENATE
to medical and scientific uses narcotic substances. The conventions, agreements and protocols under which Canada participates in
international control are listed in the evidence. Canadian legislation conforms in all
respects with the requirements of the conventions and our international commitments,
and from the evidence the committee concurs
with the statement of the Minister of National Health and Welfare that the Canadian legislation is as realistic and effective as
the legislation of any country. Canada, as a
member of the United Nations, has, in keeping
with other countries, members of the United
Nations organization, agreed to make the legal
importations of heroin illegal. The prohibition
of heroin came into effect in Canada January
1, 1955.

Vancouver, and as high as $20 in Edmonton,
the profits are truly enormous.
The profit motive needs no further comment. It is significant therefore that much of
the evidence heard by the Committee urged
the elimination of the profit motive in the
sale of drugs.
Suggestions from witnesses for the accomplishment of this objective ranged from that of
the legal supply of free drugs to the total
segregation of all criminal addicts and the
provision of the death penalty for important
traffickers.

Extent of Addiction
Addicts in Canada have been classified as
medical, professional and criminal. The latter has been defined in Canada as one who
purchases his supply of drugs in the illicit

regards as problems. The drugs so listed
come either from natural sources or synthetic.
The natural drugs come from opium, coca
leaf or cannabis sativa commonly called hemp
or marihuana. Opium produces morphine,
heroin and codeine the principal drugs in use.
Coca leaf produces cocaine and hemp produces cannabis sativa. Of all these drugs
heroin is the one that is the most commonly
employed for addiction in Canada.
Marihuana is not a drug commonly used for
addiction in Canada, but it is used in the
United States and also in the United Kingdom by addicts.
No problem exists in Canada at present in
regard to this particular drug. A few isolated
seizures have been made but these have been
from visitors to this country or in one or
two instances from Canadians who have
developed the addiction while being in other
countries.
The question of barbiturates was discussed.
They are not narcotic drugs. They are
covered in so far as use is concerned under
the Food and Drugs Act.
The committee is of the opinion that the
present strict control of these drugs should be
continued and that a careful watch be kept
of any unwarranted increase in their use, in
order to prevent the abuse of such
barbiturates.

Bay Company, a large department store chain,
which operates six stores in Western Canada,
advised the committee that they have no way
of knowing the exact amount of their losses
due to actual shoplifting, but they did report
that stock shortages in Vancouver due to
clerical errors, internal theft, as well as shoplifting, are not any higher than the average
pertaining in their six stores.
Treatment Proposals
Suggestions for treatment ranged all the
way from the legal supply of drugs to the
total segregation of all criminal addicts. The
committee considered proposals to alleviate
the drug problem that was submitted to it.
These proposals included such matters as (a)
the removal and segregation of all convicted
addicts to an institution, far removed from
any area of general population, preferably on
an island, for long periods of time, coupled
with some system of parole, where rehabilitation was indicated; (b) establishment of a
treatment centre far removed from cities,
with provision for compulsory confinement
or isolation and control of an addict over a
number of years, such an institution should
emphasize mental care, complete rehabilitation and training for useful occupation; (c)
provision for withdrawal treatment in general
hospitals, establishment of a rehabilitation
residence for men, foster home care for
women; (d) narcotic clinics; (e) the British
system; (f) community action; (g) education;
(h) group therapy, such as is carried on by
Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous.
The committee in making special reference
to certain of these proposals also commends
for careful study the evidence of those witnesses who spoke on the question of the
treatment of drug addicts.

Enforcement
The R.C.M.P. maintains drug squads at
those centres where attention is indicated,
reinforced as necessary by men from general
duty and other specialist details. Most major
municipal police forces maintain special Narcotic Drug Squads which work closely with
the R.C.M.P. The R.C.M.P. concentrates particularly on the investigation of traffickers.

of Penitentiaries.
One of the difficulties encountered in the
establishment of Narcotics Anonymous was
the difficulty in finding a sufficient number of
addicts who were abstinent from the use of

The committee desires to encourage those
engaged in this work and to express the hope
that their efforts will meet with success.
Community Action
Any successful program for the prevention
and treatment of drug addiction will require
concerted community social action to remove
from our cities those areas in which drugs
are available, to provide adequate opportunity
for youth and the emotional social atmosphere
which follows general rehabilitation efforts on
behalf of treated drug addicts. There is an
urgent need for communities to make concerted all-out efforts to eradicate conditions
that breed drug addiction.
By the same token such groups as P.T.A.,
church groups, welfare councils, schools, hospitals, police, recreational bodies and employers and the public generally, will need
to use their joint and several skills to readjust the lives of former addicts in order to
again fit them into an ordered society. The
importance of this is emphasized in the
recommendations that are made in this report
for a treatment program.

The committee took special notice of the

of narcotic drug addiction.
PART 2
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Objectives
A solution of the narcotic drug problem
involves the elimination of drug addiction,
the suppression of the drug traffic and the
prevention of an increase in the drug addict
population.
Involved in these objectives is, of course,
the protection of society at large against the
evils of narcotic drugs.

Size of Problem
As previously stated, the total known drug
addict population in Canada is 3,212, of
whom 2,364 are criminal addicts. Of the
2,364 approximately one-half are located in
the city of Vancouver. The city of Montreal
which is the largest city in Canada, has, a
total criminal addict population of under 200
and the city of Toronto an addict population
of under 400 with, according to the evidence,
a large number of these being inactive or in
other words as not having recently come to
the attention of the enforcement authorities.
Pattern of Drug Addiction
The committee heard evidence from many
expert and qualified witnesses concerning the
kind of people who make up the criminal
addict population of Canada, something of
their background and, in addition, the committee saw a large number of these people.
Their sordid pattern of development shows
a considerable degree of similarity.
There is frequently evidence of broken
homes, poor environment, lack of parental
control and discipline, and the absence of
religious training. This background leads to
social deviation, juvenile delinquency, crime
and eventually to drug addiction through
association with other drug addicts.
The evidence of medical authorities was
to the effect that drug addiction is not a
disease in itself. It is a symptom or manifestation of character weaknesses or personality
defects in the individual. The addict is
usually an emotionally insecure and unstable
person who derives support from narcotic
drugs.
The committee was gravely concerned to
learn that relatively few cases could be
authenticated where drug addicts, while out
of custody, had been successful is abstaining
from the use of drugs for any lengthy period
of time.
The complications and difficulties in the
successful treatment of drug addiction, having regard to the pattern of development of
the addict and his almost invariable criminal
tendencies, cannot be too heavily stressed.
Jurisdictional Responsibilities
The committee desires to emphasize that
the solution of the problem of addiction,
which of itself is of great complexity, is
further complicated by the division of federal
and provincial constitutional responsibilities.
In viewing the problem, it is necessary to
distinguish the measures which the federal
government can properly undertake by its
legislation and the measures which constitutionally are of provincial concern.
The suppression of the illicit distribution
and use of drugs is within the responsibility

896

SENATE

of the federal Government. This, amongst
other things, is the aim and purpose of the
Opium and Narcotic Drug Act which provides
for the legal distribution and use of drugs
and the protection of society against the evils
of the drug traffie and drug addiction.
The treatment of illness is a matter which
comes within the responsibility of provincial
authorities as, for example, mental illness
and tuberculosis. Drug addiction is considered
by medical and social authorities to be a form
of illness and the treatment of it as such
is likewise within the jurisdictional responsibility of the provinces and of the communities therein.
A number of the provinces have recognized
this responsibility in terms of special legislation for the treatment of drug addiction. The
Provinces of Manitoba and Nova Scotia, as
far back as the middle twenties, enacted
special legislation entitled "The Narcotic
Drug Addicts Act". The Province of Ontario
bas included in its Mental Hospitals Act and
the Province of New Brunswick in its Provincial Hospital Act, provision for the committal
and treatment of drug addicts. The Province
of British Columbia, however, where the
incidence of drug addiction is the highest, bas
no legislation in this regard and it was stated
to the committee that under the general hospital insurance plan in that province drug
addiction was not a condition for which
hospital treatment was authorized.
None of the provinces in Canada, however,
have provided special institutional treatment
facilities for drug addiction as such.
Situation in Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto
The addict population in the city of Vancouver was estimated to be from 1,100 to
1,500 and of this number slightly in excess
of 300 are currently in jail or penitentiary.
The remaining addicts at large in the city,
according to the evidence, must purchase drugs
once or more daily and in order to obtain the
funds to do so engage in petty crime, such as
shoplifting, thievery and, in the case of female
addicts, in prostitution. These addicts have no
gainful employment and support their addiction by vice and petty crime. They must,
therefore, violate daily not only the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act in their illegal purchase and possession of drugs, but also the
Criminal Code of Canada.
The committee could not help but be disturbed by this large concentration of drug
addicts and the apparent freedom with which
they are able to congregate in the heart of

the city of Vancouver.
These people are
known to engage in crime, including prostitution, and are without gainful employment of
any kind. The committee is not able to understand why the provisions of the Criminal
Code dealing with vagrancy, prostitution and
living off the avails of prostitution cannot be
more effectively invoked to uproot and break
up this concentration.
The committee, in emphasizing this aspect
of the situation, points out that the enforcement of the Criminal Code in the city of Vancouver is not a responsibility of the R.C.M.P.,
but is wholly a responsibility of the city
police authorities.
The R.C.M.P. are concerned with the enforcement of the Opium and Narcotic Drug
Act and in this connection concentrate essentially on the apprehension and conviction of
drug traffickers.
The drug addict population, as already
pointed out, are primarily criminal, engaged
in crime daily apart from the violations of
the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. These
people are, therefore, an enforcement responsibility of the city and the municipal authorities and a solution of the problem which
they present requires much more than the
enforcement of the Opium and Narcotic Drug
Act. It requires vigorous police and community action if this evil social condition is to
be successfully removed.
In contrast to the situation in the city of
Vancouver, the committee was impressed with
the comparable drug situation in the cities of
Montreal and Toronto. In both of these cities
the authorities now report a drug situation
of relatively small proportions and one which
is apparently under fairly good control.
The committee is of the opinion that more
vigorous effective enforcement of all pertinent
law holds the answer to much of the problem
in the city of Vancouver.
Treatment of Addiction a Provincial
Responsibility
After a most careful and exhaustive examination of the evidence and of all the factors
involved in treatment, the committee is
strongly of the opinion that the recognition of
drug addiction as a treatment responsibility,
with the provision of facilities therefor by
provincial authorities, is long overdue.
The committee in pointing out the responsibility of provincial authorities for treatment,
does not minimize the difficulties that are
presented nor the fact that a great number
of drug addicts offer little or no promise for

JUNE 23, 1955
successful treatment. These difficulties would
not in the opinion of the committee justify
the continued failure to provide treatment
procedures and facilities.
The drug problem in Canada is essentially
confined to the three provinces of Quebec,
Ontario and British Columbia, of which the
Province of British Columbia has the largest
concentration of drug addicts and, therefore,
the greatest problem. As was pointed out,
there is no legislation nor are there facilities
in that province for the treatment of drug
addiction.
The Minister of National Health and Welfare in his statement to the committee pointed
out that he had gone on record with all of
the provinces of Canada in drawing attention
to the distinction between federal and provincial responsibilities in the matter of the
drug problem. He pointed out that the federal
Government had offered to assist in any way
that it could, within the limits of its authority
and responsibility, in helping to find a solution to the problem of drug addiction.
As evidence of interest in the problem, Mr.
Martin stated to the committee that under
date of December 3, 1954, he had offered to
consider the availability to the Province of
British Columbia of the federal Quarantine
Station at William Head on Vancouver Island
for use by the province as a treatment centre.
He also indicated to the provincial authorities in making such offer that the federal
government would be prepared under the
National Health Program to see whether or
not financial assistance might be given to
the renovation of such premises to make
them more suitable for use as a treatment
centre. No evidence was given to the committee as to whether the offer was acceptable to the province.
The committee makes specific reference to
this proposal, because it is apparent that
treatment of drug addiction, insofar as the
treatment of a drug addict can be effective,
depends upon the acceptance by provincial
authorities, and particularly the Province of
British Columbia, of responsibility for treatment with the provision of whatever facilities
and legislative measures are required in that
connection.
The evidence of many witnesses recommended the compulsory segregation and isolation of all addicts for long periods of time
for the purpose of treatment and possible
rehabilitation.
By using its constitutional powers, any
province could pass the necessary legislation
providing for the committal on a compulsory

or voluntary basis, of drug addicts to an
appropriate treatment institution in the same
manner as is being done now for those in
need of treatment for a mental condition.
In considering the various suggestions for
treatment, it will be appreciated that the
majority of addicts not only have known
criminal records, but have, as well, character
disorders, or personality disturbances which
will require institutional treatment. Evidence
about proposed treatment indicated that such
treatment should include humane, supported
withdrawal, medical treatment, post-discharge
control, including
long-term
probation,
coupled with the right of immediate return
to the institution in the event of relapse.
It was also submitted that if treatment
cannot be provided for all addicts, an effort
should be made to treat at least the young
ones, or those whose prognosis is good. It
appears necessary to segregate young addicts
from older addicts.
In commenting upon the responsibility of
provincial authorities for the treatment of
drug addiction, the committee again stresses
the need for community and public support of
an addict who has undergone treatment and
who desires to re-establish himself in society.
It is apparent to the Committee that institutional treatment can do only so much for
an addicted person.
The committee draws attention to the evidence of a number of witnesses who strongly
advocated the need for follow-up and supervisory facilities for addicts who had undergone treatment, to prevent a return to drugs
or to former bad associates or habits.
To make treatment a practical possibility
for those addicts who may offer some promise,
the committee would hope that provincial
agencies, community agencies, voluntary
agencies and the public generally, would do
everything possible to assist in the acceptance
into society of addicts who had been treated,
including an opportunity of useful and gainful
employment.
The committee, therefore, strongly recommends the provision of suitable treatment
facilities for drug addicts, and recommends
for careful study by provincial authorities
the evidence of those witnesses who discussed
treatment, and particularly that of Dr. Harris
Isbell who is possibly one of the world's
foremost authorities on the subject.
Federal Responsibility
As has been pointed out, the responsibility
of the federal government by its legislation is
limited to the legal distribution of narcotie
drugs for medical and scientific purposes and

SENATE
traffic and to prevent the spread of the contagion of addiction. It is felt by the committee that vigorous enforcement, more
severe penalties and a realistic recognition
by judicial and other authorities of the extent and nature of the evil will do much to
reduce the incidence of drug addiction in
Canada.
The committee notes with interest the evidence of Commissioner Harry J. Anslinger,
Commissioner of Narcotics in the United
States, before a Special Committee of the
United States Senate wherein he pointed out
that in areas where low sentences were imposed, the drug problem substantially increased and in areas where there was strict
enforcement with heavy sentences the drug
problem showed a commensurate decrease.
The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act provides
penalties of up to fourteen years imprisonment for trafficking and for possession of
drugs for the purpose of trafficking. The act,
properly, does not draw a legal distinction
between the addict-trafficker and the nonaddict-trafficker. The elimination of trafficking in drugs is the goal of enforcement and the
attainment of this goal is not assisted by
artificial distinctions between motives for
trafficking.
The committee heard considerable evidence
regarding the heavy profits of the drug trafficker and various suggestions were advanced
as to how this profit could be taken out of
the traffic.
It is the considered opinion of the committee that the most effective way of taking
the profit out of the drug traffic is by making
all trafficking, in terms of penalties, a most
hazardous and costly undertaking to the
trafficker.
The non-addict-trafficker, who is sometimes referred to as the "higher up" must depend upon a large number of agents or distributors to peddle the drugs which he imports but with which he seldom comes into
contact. The imposition of heavy compulsory
minimum sentences for trafficking is suggested as a deterrent to these hireling pedlers or pushers of the "higher up". If the
higher up is not able to find a ready supply of
assistants to distribute drugs to the addict
population the availability of drugs to addicts
may be reduced to a possible minimum.
The committee considers that the penalties

for trafficking regardless of purpose, motive
As already pointed out, the responsibility or amount irrespective of whether the
of the federal government is essentially con- trafficker is or is not an addict, should be
cerned with the enforcement of the Opium made more severe, with a compulsory lengthy
and Narcotic Drug Act to eliminate the drug minimum sentence and an increased minimum

the suppression of the illicit use and distribution of those drugs. These measures are
necessary for the protection of society.
The committee points out that it is not
within the constitutional authority of the
federal government to assume responsibility
for treatment of drug addicts nor to enact the
kind of legislation necessary in that connection. This legislation would need to include
the compulsory treatment of addiction, the
legal supervision and control over the individual during treatment and the right of
control of an individual following treatment
to prevent his return to the use of drugs,
former associations or habits. These are considered to be matters beyond the competence
of the federal government.
According to the evidence of Dr. L. P.
Gendreau, Deputy Commissioner of Penitentiaries, there are at the present time 369 criminal addicts in federal penitentiaries. These
include both male and female criminal
addicts.
It is pointed out that the kind of people
who are sentenced to penitentiaries, for the
most part, have a long and sordid record
of crime behind them. These people are
criminals from whom society is entitled to
be protected. Their violations of the law
coupled with their criminal backgrounds are
such as to require their imprisonment for
lengthy periods of time. It follows, therefore,
that any possibility for treatment of addicts
who are sentenced to penitentiaries will offer
considerably less hope than would be the
case of the early offender or the addict
beginner. The best hope of successful treatment of a number of people who eventually
come to the attention of the penitentiary
authorities would seem to lie in early rehabilitative and corrective measures.
The committee appreciates the difficult
problem presented by the kind of criminal
addicts who are sentenced to penitentiaries.
The committee, however, suggests that the
penitentiary authorities might give further
consideration to the particular problems presented by criminal addicts in terms of possible segregation, treatment including specialized training and rehabilitation and other
measures necessary in view of the special
problems which addiction superimposes.

JUNE 23, 1955
for a second or subsequent offence and possibly a maximum of life imprisonment.
In advocating the increase of penalties the
committee intends that this should serve as a
clear warning to all who are addicted that if
they engage in the distribution of drugs in
any quantity for any purpose and regardless
of their motives, they can expect to be dealt
with as traffickers and given heavy penalties.
It is the considered view of the committee
that this will act as an effective deterrent to a
large number of drug addicts who might be
tempted to assist in distribution and with
their elimination as distributors the problem
of the "higher up" in getting rid of his drugs
is made more difficult.
The committee in urging severe penalties
for all traffickers does not of course minimize
the necessity to continue intensive enforcement in an effort to eradicate the "higher up"
from this evil market.
The committee recognizes that illicit drugs
are in the first instance imported into Canada
These traffickerby trafficker-importers.
importers, however, seldom if ever physically
carry into Canada the drugs for which they
are responsible. This transportation is almost
invariably d'one by agents or hirelings for a
financial reward or perhaps for a share in the
drugs. The committee strongly recommends
the establishment of a special offence with a
penalty of the utmost severity for the illicit
importation of drugs into Canada. The committee in making this suggestion feels that a
severe penalty may act as an effective deterrent to -an individual in smuggling drugs into
Canada for the profit of a "higher up".
Evidence was given to the committee of the
skill and efficiency by which traffickers and
distributors endeavour to avoid detection and
conviction.
The trafficker-importer as mentioned, seldom bas physical possession of the drugs for
which he is responsible and he is rarely addicted to their use.
The trafficker-distributors again are seldom
addicted and they too, endeavour to avoid
physical contact with the drugs that they distribute. The difficulty, therefore, of appreor the
hending the trafficker-importer
trafficker-distributor in possession of drugs is
apparent. The efforts of the enforcement
authorities as pointed out by the Commissioner, R.C.M. Police, in apprehending and
convicting since 1949, 36 major traffickers
who received penalties ranging from two to
twenty-eight years' imprisonment is, in the
opinion of the committee, worthy of commendation.

The apprehension and conviction of the
street peddler is one of difficulty. Enforcement has taught the peddler to be wary of
strangers. He uses every device to plant
drugs in convenient caches and thus in completing a transaction, avoids the risk of
selling to an undercover agent. The committee therefore suggests that special attention
be given by the authorities to the possibility
of the facilitation of proof of trafficking at all
levels, having regard to the skill and cunning
displayed by traffickers and distributors, illustrations of which were given by the enforcement authorities.
It is considered by the committee that the
evil of trafficking to be eliminated requires
the most effective sanctions that can be
devised and the provision of such facilities
in the matter of proof of trafficking as are
necessary to combat the traffic.
The committee heard evidence from one of
Canada's most experienced prosecutors under
the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, with
respect to the difficulty in getting proper evidence to lay before the court in cases of
traffic conspiracy. He cited sections 15 and
18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act which
facilitate proof in charges under that Act
but stated that these were not available to
the Crown in prosecutions of conspiracy to
commit an indictable offense under the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act. The committee recommends a study of the act with a view to
amending legislation to overcome
the
difficulty.
At this point it might be stated that in
order to strengthen the hands of enforcement
agencies, in addition to changes in the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act, amendments are indicated, to the Juvenile Delinquents Act and
the Criminal Code of Canada.
The committee recommends consideration
of amendments to section 33 (1) of the
Juvenile Delinquents Act which would make
association of an addict with a juvenile,
prima facie evidence of contributing to delinquency. It must be borne in mind that
the drug addict carries a communicable condition and merely by associating with a nonaddicted juvenile is conducting himself in a
manner likely to make such child a juvenile
delinquent.
Since trafficking has become a mobile industry courts should withdraw driving
privileges for long periods of time from all
those convicted of offences under section
4 (3) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act.
To give them authority so to do would require an amendment to section 225 (1) of the

SENATE
Canadian Criminal Code adding the offences
set forth in section 4 (3) of the Opium and
Narcotic Drug Act.
In advocating more severe and increased
penalties for trafficking with a compulsory
minimum, the committee does not do so in
criticism of the length of sentences that have
ordinarily been meted out to traffickers. The
committee does so having regard to the
elimination of street distributors and the discouragement of addicts to engage in the
trafficking or transporting of drugs. There
will thus be a clear and unequivocal warning
to all addicts of the consequences which they
can expect if they choose for any reason to
become involved in the distribution of drugs.
Heavy penalties and intensified enforcement
against street drug peddlers are therefore
strongly urged, and in this way the committee believes that the heavy profit motive
will most effectively be taken out of the drug
trafficking.

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 508, an Act to amend the

senators, when shall this bill be read the

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 4
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 509, an Act for granting
to Her Majesty certain sums of money for
the public service of the financial year ending
the 31st March, 1956.
The bill was read the first time.

On the second reading of an interim supply
bill it is customary to give an undertaking
that passage of the bill will not preclude discussion of the estimates later, and at this
time I give the usual undertaking-the same
undertaking that I gave on the second reading
of the previous interim supply bill.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I received a copy of this interim supply bill
four or five days ago; and as the honourable
Leader of the Government has just said, it
covers only one-twelfth of the estimates, to
provide for the month of July.
I understand the House of Commons had
hoped, and certainly we had hoped, that we
would not have to vote interim supply at
this time; but we have no alternative, for it
is clear that the session will continue into
July.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall this bill be read the
third time?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: With the consent of
the bouse, I move the third reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

of $2,500 the salaries ai judges o! tlie Supreme
Court ai Canada, tlie Excliequer Court of
Canada, tlie Superiar and County Courts of
tlie provinces and tlie Territorial Court af tlie
Yukon Territory, as well as that ai tlie new
judge wlio will be appointed to tlie Territorial
Court af tlie Nortliwest Territories. I believe
I liave covered in that statement all tlie
judges wlio will be affected by this bill.
Tlie bill also provides for an increase in
tlie number ai judges in British Columbia
by twa; that is, by one eacli for tlie Court of
Appeal and the Supreme Court, Trial Division. If the bill is passed the Court of Appeal
will consist af tlie Chie! Justice and six
Justices af Appeal; and thie Trial Division
will consist ai tlie Chie! Justice ai tlie
Supreme Court and nine judges.
At present, tlie judge ai tlie Territorial
Court ai tlie Yukon Territory is ex oicf o
judge ai the Territorial Court of the Northiwest Territaries. Under tlie bil a new judge
will be appointed for the Nortliwest Territaries, and the present judge will perform
lis duties in tlie Yukon Territory anly.
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: May I ask the
lionourable leader wliere the new judge will
reside?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I understand that lie
will reside at Fort Smitli, altliougli that is
nat stated in the bill.
The bill permits increases in tlie travelling
aliawances ta judges while away from their
homes on judicial duties. The act at present
provides that a judge may receive by way af
living expenses while away fram home the
sum ai $12 a day, if the place is a city, and
$8 if the place is not a city. By section 4
ai the bill the allawance may lie increased
in special circumstances prescribed by the
Treasury Board, from $12 ta $15 in a place
that is a city, and from $8 ta $12 in a place
that is not a city.
As lionourable senatars well appreciate, it
is difficult ta find a liatel room in some cities
today for less tlian, say, $9, and in centres
smaller than cities at less than $8 a day.
Section 5 ai the bill lias ta do with annuities
ta judges upon retirement. Under the present
act a judge when lie is appainted can elect
liow lie will take lis pensian-namely, twathîrds ai lis salary-aiter having served at
least ten years and liaving reached the age
ai seventy-five years. He can elect ta have
one-third ai lis pension payable ta lis wif e,
in whicli event lie upon retirement wauld get
two-thirds ai lis pension. If the judge predeceased his wif e slie, liaving become his
widow, would continue ta get one-third ai
lis pension ; but if hie outlived lier, lie would
continue ta receive lis two-thirds ai the
pension.

By section 5 of this bill a judge would not
make an election witli respect ta his pension.
Upon retirement lie would receive two-thirds
of his salary by way af pension, and sliould
he predecease his wiie she, as his widow,
would receive one-third of his two-thirds,
namely, two-ninths of his salary.
Hon. Mr. Burchili: Daes she receive twoninths in addition ta the one-third?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No. The point is that
should the wife die first the judge would
continue ta get the full pension.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Would the lionourable
leader tell us how long it lias been since
the judges have liad an increase in salary?
Han. Mr. Macdonald: I regret that I do not
have the date of the last increase before me;
however, I know it was some years ago. As
honourable senators know, the question of
increasing judges' salaries lias been before
the Governrnent for sorne time, and after

and I recammend it ta the favourable consideration of this liouse.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I
regret that I arn unable to support this bill
ta provide increased salaries for judges. In
the first place, it is scarcely more than four
years since their salaries were increased.
Further, I arn wondering if the Government
leader lias his facts clear on the matter of
expense allowances ta judges. It seems ta
me that quite recently we passed legislation
by which the allowance in cities was increased irom $12 ta $25 a day.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My only autliority for
saying what I did is the provision contained
in section 4 of the bill now before us, which
contains the f ollowing two new paragraphs

place is a city, tweive dollars, or

Hon. Mr. Horner: I can quite understand,
honourable senators, tliat a bill o! tliis kind
rnay perhaps be a littie embarrassing ta
members of tlie legal profession, and I
wonder wliether tliey would be competent
ta take an unbiased vote on such a measure.
It is my feeling that this billlias been
presented at a rnast inopportune time; certainly the matter could quite easily liave
been put over until the next session. Part af
the economic picture in Canada today is flot
at ahl clear. According ta figures from thie

JUNE 127, les$
Dominion Bureau af Statlstlcs, the Incorne
of the farrners this year has declied 7 per
cent, and I only wlsh I had sorne assurance
that their incomes would flot drap even more
ini the year ahead. Further, it is becoming
more apparent that industrlalists and manufacturers are finding competition ini world
markets increaslngly difficult to meet. I
should like to refer ta a textile centre where
a son of mine is employed today. The management of that industry was faclng serious
difficulties and eventually called i its employees and placed before thern this proposition: either they could accept a 30 cent an
hour drop in pay or the plant would have to
shut down and they would be laid off. The
employees, belng anxious ta hold on to their
Jobs and maintain the homes they had
bought In that centre, had little alternative
but to accept the drop i pay.
We have heard a good deal of comment
about the difficulties facing the rubber footwear industry. There seems littie hope that
it will be able ta continue long ta pay
present wages and at the same time compete
with products caming into aur market from
other cauntries.
It is for such reasons as these, honourable
senators, that I say this bill Is presented to
Parliament at an inoppartune time. To my
way of thinking it has a dangerous and an
unsettllng effect on an economy In which we
are atternpting ta hold the Uine against
inflation. We hear a goad many complaints
every time labour makes a break and secures
a wage boost. Here is an opportunlty for
the Senate ta exercise Its sober second
thought and permit this measure ta stand
over until next year.
I may say that I know something about
judicial appointments. In my experience I
have found that appointment ta the Bench
is very highly desired by lawyers. It is,
indeed, a great honour. However, we are ta
infer from the remarks af the Minister af
Justice during the debate on this bill i the
other house that it is difficult ta attract ta
the Bench competent men well learned i
the law, because af the large incomes which
gaad lawyers can earn as corporation counsel.
Now, honourabie senatars, we ail know very
well that there are a few fartunate individuals,
who, maybe thraugh special circumstances
and ability, are paid big sums as counsel for
large corporations, but that is not true ai the
average lawyer. I know af quite a number
af lawyers whose incarne frorn their law
practice is but a smail part of their total
income. And when a Iawyer becames a
judge there is nathlng to prevent hirn from
continuing ta awn real estate and coilect
rents, or ta receive incame from sound investments. We hear and are told mhat ta be
50437-45J

appointed a judge a lawyer must have been
successiul. Well, if he has been successful
he has acquired some wealth and has made
some i.nvestments, from which, as I say, he
can continue ta draw the incarne.
Then, honourable senators, there is another
point in cannectian with this whole question
ai the appointment ai judges. When I flrst
went west, the western provinces had no
universities, and the members ai the legal
profession practising i the West ail came
from eastern universities. But such is flot
the situation taday, nar has it been for many
years. Today there are universities in every
one ai the western provinces and they are
turning out a large crop ai lawyers every
year. As a matter ai fact, there are a great
many able lawyers, capable ai making
flrst-class judges, wha I am sorry ta say are
nat earning very large incomes.
Then there is this tô be cansidered. A
judge on retirement receives a pension af
$10,000 a year, ta which he cantributes
nothing. If he should die, his widaw is
entitled ta a pension ai $3,500, again without
any contribution whatever. Compare this
with the treatment ai school teachers. It
surely is ai very great importance ta the
welf are ai this country that aur schaol
teachers be paid a just and sufficient salary.
Naw out ai the salary they do receive, their
pension contributions are deducted. If that
money were taken and invested wisely they
would be payig entirely for their pensions.
I say this ta cantrast their position with mhat
ai judges, wha do not cantribute ta their
pensions at ail.
Further, in nearly every one ai the provinces we read ai caunty court judges today
being pald a certain amount. However, that
amaunt is not their entire salary. In saine
ai the provinces, I understand, judges are
allowed $2,500 extra; in Saskatchewan, for
instance they get $1,500 for probate and surrogate court work, aver and above their
caunty court salary.
I feel quite keenly, hanourable senatars,
that there is nat the slightest reason for the
increase prapased in the bill, and I have not
been convinced mhat mhere is mhe slightest
necessity ta raise these salaries in order ta
secure good and campetent men. As a matter
ai fact, the thought struck me a short while
ago that passibly we would have ta consider
raising the salaries ai aur policemen, men i
important posts on mhe police force.
A ramher unusual argument was advanced
in the House ai Commons by the now Independent member for Moose Jaw-Lake Centre,
mhat judges have ta give Up friendshlps and
personal associations. That certaily has not
been sa, according ta my observation. I wMf
admit that a judge should not have resort

SENATE
to certain places, but for the life of me I do
not think he is barred from social life in
any way. I think that was rather a strained
argument.
Honourable senators, I think everyone
should consider this matter quite seriously,
in view of existing conditions. A great number of our people, and certainly our farm
people, are facing a lower income than they
formerly enjoyed. Others too are in this
position, I fear. Considering the extra money
that judges often are enabled to make, and
the non-contributory feature of their pension, I think that this chamber should take
a serious second look at this piece of legislation. In all sincerity, I feel that in doing
so we would be rendering a service to, shall
I say the general welfare of our people, and
to labour and labour organizations. And may
I say here that I certainly believe that if
any increase like this is granted we are
going to have more and greater demands
by labour unions.
Honourable senators, let me say again that
I feel that this bill should not be passed at
this time. Perhaps in another year it might
be wise to pass such a measure, but I do
believe it would be very unwise to do so
at present. There is no evidence of any
shortage of good candidates for the Bench.
I am sure that every senator who knows the
circumstances in the district where he lives
is aware that there is a surplus of able
lawyers who would be delighted to accept
appointments as judges. So I submit that
there is no necessity at all for this salary
increase, and in fact it may do great injury.
When the motion is made for third reading I may go so far as to move that the bill
be not now read the third time. However, I
will consider that later.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators, I am afraid the honourable senator
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) might
not think me competent to discuss this bill,
inasmuch as I am a member of the legal
profession, but I may assure him that I have
no intention or no ambition to go on to the
BenchHon. Mr. Horner: No, but you plead before
judges.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: -and so far as I
personally am concerned, the provisions of
this bill will never affect me in any way.
I must say that I disagree with the honourable senator. I think this is a reasonable bill.
It is always difficult to assess what the
public ought to pay judges for the exceedingly important work which they perform;
but, generally speaking, I do not think that
it can be said that in this country our judges
are overpaid; in fact, I think rather the

contrary is the case, and that in past years
we have not paid our judges as much as we
should have. If one takes Great Britain as
an example: away back, I think a hundred
and fifty years ago, the High Court judges
received salaries of £5,000 a year; and honourable senators will easily realize what
that salary must have meant in the early
days of the last century, when prices were
perhaps one-tenth of what they are today,
and there was no such thing as income tax.
It seems to me that under the conditions
existing today there should not be any objection to increasing the salaries of judges
subject to federal jurisdiction by what might
be termed an overall figure of $2,500 each.
That addition is, I suggest, justified by the
increase in the cost of living which has
taken place over the last few years; and on
that basis it is probably right to do what
this bill seeks to do, and to make a blanket
increase of the same amount for each judge,
whether he be a judge of a County Court or
a Supreme Court, solely on the basis that it
costs that judge more to live today than it
did four or five years ago. Even with this
increase, in my opinion-and here again I
must disagree with the honourable senator
from Blaine Lake-the remuneration which
will be paid to our judges will certainly
be no more than sufficient to attract to the
Bench the type of men whom it is necessary
to obtain if the high quality and the great
traditions of our Bench are to be maintained.
I notice that in my own province, Quebec,
the judges of the Superior Court other than
the Chief Justice are to receive salaries of
$16,900. If I remember rightly, when I was
called to the Bar-I fear, over forty years
ago-the salaries of the judges of our Superior
Court were $9,000 a year.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Six thousand.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: As I recall, it was
more than that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, the salary was $6,000
a year for judges of the superior courts of
Quebec, of Ontario, Manitoba and all the
other provinces.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If the statement of my
honourable friend is correct, that the salary
was formerly $6,000, today $16,900 is not
much more than the equivalent of what was
paid forty years ago. My honourable friend
might be right; if he is, perhaps I should
say that I think the salaries of the judiciary
in those days were insufficient. But I do
not think that today a salary of $16,900 for
a superior court judge is more than adequate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The $6,000 then paid
was not subject to any income tax.

JUNE 27. 1955
the honourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinlty (Hon. Mr. Hoebuck) would know
more about it than I do, but 1 think the minimumn salary of any federal judge in the
United States under the new legisiation will
be of the order of $25,000.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I notice there are sixtythree judges and junior judges of county and
district courts in Ontario. Are there any
county court judges in Quebec?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The number of
Superior Court judges in Quebec is a great
deai larger than the number of High Court
judges in Ontario, but there are no county
and district court judges in Quebec.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
the honourable gentleman from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) thinks it is illogical
that the salaries of judges are to be increased
in keeping with the increase in the cost of
living and that there is flot to be a proportionate increase in the pensions provided for
them when they retire and for their widows.
Well, if the Government should see fit to
increase the pensions of retired judges or
their widows I would corne out vigorously
on behaif of the great band of civil servants
who years ago were placed on superannuation
and for whom the increased cost of living
has greatly reduced the value of their pensions. In those circumstances I certainly
could not sit quietly by and see the Government award retired judges or their widows
increased pensions just because judges' salaries are being increased. If that were done it
would be a grave injustice to superannuated
civil servants who have been pleading for at
least ten years to have their pensions

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: As my honourable
friend says, of course in those days there was

Hon. Mr. Haig: Pardon me for the interruption, but probably I should correct my
statement. The date I had in mind was 1911:
I know that the amount was $6,000 then.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: My reference was to
1915 or 1916, when I first came to the Bar.
I think it is reasonable to say that the increase in the cost of living justifies an acrossthe-board increase at this time in the salaries
of our judges in the amount of $2,500 a year.
There is only one thing in tis measure
that worries me a littie. Section 8 of the
bill, which deals with pensions, provides no
increase in the pensions of the judges, and
states in effect that for the purpose of calculating the pensions which they will receive
in future their salaries shail be deemed to
be the salaries that they received before they
got tis increase. It seems to me to be mlogical, if an increase to judges now on the
Bench is to be given on the basis of the
increase in the cost of living, that there
should not be a proportionate increase provided for them when they retire, and for
their widows.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Does section 8 appl to
judges who will be appointed after this
proposed amendment has become law?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Oh, yes.
Han. Mr. Turgeon: It applies to them aIl?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I refer my honourable
friend to the explanatory note on section 8,

not for the fact that Canadians are ready
to pay more than the product is worth on the
open market the Canadian textile industry
would not survive. But the great majority
of manufacturers in recent years have been
doing very well indeed, and not a few of
them have become extremely wealthy.
My friend spoke about police. I think he
was in favour of increasing their salaries. I
am glad to be able to say that police salaries
in Ontario have been increasing substantially
in recent years, and I have had the honour
to take part in many arbitrations that have
gone on all over the province-arbitrations
between police associations and police boards.
In almost every instance salaries were raised,
so that today we have the skilled policeman
receiving wages that at least enable him
to live among his neighbours in a self-respecting way. The dividends have been excellent.
My friend suggested that the increase in
judges' salaries should be delayed until conditions have improved. One need only read
the financial reports to see that many indusAccording to the
tries are prospering.
Minister of Finance, Canada will have a larger
national production this year than at any time
in history.
My friend from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) referred to the salaries of Superior
Court judges. But let us consider the sixtyodd judges of the County and District Courts
of the Province of Ontario. Under the provisions of this bill they would be paid
$10,500. I can state from personal knowledge
that a lawyer of good ability who cannot make
$10,500 a year in private practice is unfortunate. I know many young lawyers who
have recently graduated from Osgoode Hall
and are making at least that amount, and
some very much more.
It is not so much a problem of getting men
to accept appointments of this kind. Of
course, as stated by the honourable senator
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid),
people would accept appointments to the
Senate if the sessional indemnities had not
been increased-and, I suppose, even if no
indemnities at all were paid-but no one
having any appreciation of the importance of
this body would suggest for one moment that
public funds should be saved by the abolition of these indemnities. As a matter of
fact, the public would not get service from
the Senate if that were done. Nor would the
public get service from the House of Commons if we reverted to the practice of the
old days when only men of independent

courts in British Columbia, but for eighteen
district court judges in Saskatchewan. Why
is this, when Saskatchewan's population is
only 842,000 whereas British Columbia's is
1,245,000? I always thought that judges were
appointed on a basis of population.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Our population in British
Columbia has been increasing at a greater
rate than Saskatchewan's, yet we have fewer
judges. This arouses my curiosity.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Some judges in Saskatchewan may be acting as diplomats and may
not be serving on the Bench at all.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I have very little to say on this bill. In
the first instance I should like to compliment
the honourable gentleman from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) upon the stand that he
bas taken tonight. It is very easy to be
generous with public money. It is not a
popular thing, as a rule, to oppose generous
expenditures of public money, and those who
call them into question when it is their right
to do so are performing a public service. However, while I compliment the member from
Blaine Lake it does not mean for a moment
that I agree with him. I like to be economical,
but I think it is more important to be wise
than to be merely penurious, and one frequently gets more for his money by paying
what an article is worth than by bargaining
and chiselling and getting the lowest price
possible.
My honourable friend from Blaine Lake
spoke about farmers. Well, they have been
enjoying a pretty good time in recent years.
I was a farmer myself a long time ago and
I know what conditions were on farms in
Ontario back in the late eighties and early
nineties. Farmers were very poor then, but
conditions have changed and in recent years
many a farmer has been ready to retire on
his earnings.
My honourable friend talked about manufacturers. There are some who have been
having a hard time just of late. Unfortunately, in Canada we have a number of
manufacturing concerns that have no special
advantage because of the country in which
they carry on their operations. A number
of them are doing things that are not indigenous to this land and are living on special
privileges which Parliament accords them.
Hon. Mr. Horner: It might be helpful if
the honourable senator would name these
manufacturers.

JUNE'.7 _1955
paid, but surely that is ngt the test, of what
should be paid. Is not the better test this,
that men who are charged with the responsibility of declaring and administering the law
of the land should at least be endowed with a
standard of living equal ta that of lawyers
who stand reasonably high in their profession? I ar n ot suggesting that the salaries of
judges should equal the incomes of lawyers
who are tops in their profession, for that
neyer was the case. The increase provided
in the bill would bring the salaries of judges
up ta a standard of living approximating only
that of the moderately successful lawyer in
private practice.
The honourable senator who spoke before
me lives in Blaine Lake. I have flot had the
pleasure of visiting Blaine Lake, but I hope
ta do so some day, and I arn sure that when
I do I shall receive a welcame from my
friend. I rather fancy that from personal
experience he is nat in a very gaod position ta
compare the cast of living at Blaine Lake
with that of, say, my city of Toronto. I know
from personal experience that a man in
Toronto engaged in important duties such as
judging between litigants could nat passibly
support hiniseif and is family, an less than
$10,500 a year. I know fram experience what
it costs ta live in aur great cities. And
Toronto is not in any special classification;
Montreal and other large cities, as well as
many sinaller communities, are expensive
places in which ta live, ta keep a wife and
bring up a family in decency. It is not sa
much an increase i the cost of living that
concerns us, but rather the higher standard
of living which men of ability and- success
now enjoy i Canada. Everywhere we find
people spending more freely, enjoying more
luxuries, with larger amounts of money passing through their hands than ever bef are.
It is necessary ta increase the salaries of our
judges sa that they may be able ta mamntain
a favourable position among their fellowmen, in keeping with the gradual, steady and
persistent improvement in the standard of
living. 1 think that reason justifies the proposed increase in salary more than any other
reason.
Just a word or two in conclusion. My friend
frain Blaine Lake questioned the campetence
of lawyers ta speak in matters of this kind.
Well, judges are part of the profession ta
Which I belong. It is possible that I know
mare about the subi ect than saine wha do

beHon. Mr. McDonald: There are lots of
applicants for the position af judge.
Hon. Mr. Roobuck: Don't warry-I arn nat
an applicant.

Hon. Mr. Horner: As a lawyer, you appear
before judges.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I have dane sa until
lately, but I do flot expect ta appear much i
the future. However, I wonder If my friend
realizes the independence with which the Bar
addresses the Bencli? If lie attended aur
courts he would observe how little grovelling
ta the judges there is by those who appear
before them, and how much plain talk there
is, and how honestly the Bar expresses its
opinions, whether the Judges like it or not.
I hold in my hand right now a brief on
behaîf of the public of Canada and I can
assure my friend that I could not be
influenced in the slightest degree against expressing mny opinion if I were opposed ta this
measure. No judge can dictate ta me, or ever
has done. In saying so, I believe I am speaking for the rest of my fellow members af the
Bar as well as for myself.
Honourable senators, I honestly believe
that this bill is in the public interest, and I
shahl vote for it with pleasure.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I did not intend ta take any part in this
discussion, although I realize the nature af
the bill and the importance of the discussion
probably as well as any other member i.n
the bouse. This is a very difficult prablein.
Let me start out by saying that I had been
a practising lawyer long before I was summoned to the Senate, in 1935, and I have
been in practice ever since. In all my years
of practice I have heard af only two lawyers,
and they were froin Ontario, who at saie
turne in the dim past liad voted for the
Conservative party and were later appointed
judges by a Liberal governinent. I think that
is the situation right across Canada. Fundamentally, it is felt that there must be saine
reason why only a lawyer who supports the
Liberal party in season and aut aI season
can be appointed ta the Bench.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No, fia.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Will my friend allow
a question? Will he give us the naines af
the Liberals wlio were appainted ta the
Bench under the previaus Conservative
administration?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Sir John A. Macdonald
appolnted a good many af them.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: None that I have
heard of.
Hon. Mr. Haig: For argument's sake let
us assume that hall the lawyers i the
country are Conservatives, with perhaps a
few C.C.F. and Social Credit supporters
thrown in. Nobody froin that large body af
men ever receives a judgeship under the

SENATE
Liberal government, and the people of Canada feel there must be some reason for that
situation. Because of that feeling, there is
hostilitiy from some quarters to this legislation. Certainly, it is not that any of us have
any quarrel with the judges, and particularly
those of us who are members of the Bar of
any one of the provinces. I say to my friend
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) that
the lawyers in this house appreciate full well
that the independence and freedom of this
country depend more on the conduct of
judges than on any other class in our communities.
Having been a practising lawyer in Winnipeg for more years than I would like to
tell, in the low as well as the high courts,
I say without hesitation that I have never
found a judge hostile towards me because
I was a Conservative and he was at one time
a Liberal. And certainly he could not claim
not to know where I stood politically, because I was always active and everyone
knew my stand. The judges who were once
Liberals treated me as fairly as any lawyer
who happened to be equally strong in his
Liberal persuasions.
I take this opportunity, honourable senators, to say that I think the system of
appointment of judges to the Bench requires
some change and reorganization. It has been
argued that certain lawyers in Ontario have
large incomes and cannot be attracted to
judgeships. That may also be true of
Quebec, which is also a wealthy province.
However, it does not apply to the average
practising solicitor in my province, because
I doubt if there are more than twenty whose
earnings reach $20,000 a year. True there
are lawyers whose income reaches that
figure, but they make it not as practising
solicitors, but as directors and managers of
companies.
I may say to my honourable friend from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) that the
reason, if there is a reason, for that flat increase in salaries is particularly to take in the
judges of the lower courts, and to pay them
a salary commensurate with the work they
are doing. When the lower court was originally set up-and the honourable senators from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) will recall
the details-its jurisdiction was limited to,
I think, $500, but it has now been extended
in most provinces to about $1,000. A great
many more cases now come before that
court, and the present salary range does not
compensate those judges for the volume and
importance of the work they do.
I come next to the question of pension.
I do not agree with what my friend from

Inkerman said, that the change provided by
the bill is to meet the increased living cost.
I am more inclined to agree with the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity, that
the increase is intended to make a judge feel
that in our scheme of things we recognize the
importance of his work and we want to see
that he is properly provided for. Certainly,
the motive which would influence me to
support this legislation would be a proper
recognition of the importance of the work
judges do. I say with all humility that only
a lawyer who must appear before judges from
time to time realizes how important it is that
the judge in each instance be a man of integrity and common sense, who loves freedom
and fair play and who has pride in the
institutions of his country. The lawyer knows
that only such a man can fairly adjudicate
on the differences of the parties concerned.
It is sometimes a little difficult for counsel
to quickly place the merits of a case before
the Bench, but a keen-minded judge can
soon grasp the pertinent points and get a
true perspective of the case in hand.
I do not think that this measure touches on
the labour question. If that were true, I
would not vote for it. I am inclined to follow
the thinking of my friend from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner). We must not fool ourselves; we are today running into severe
world competition in trade. It is all very well
for the Minister of Finance to say that we
are going to make more money this year and
next year. We have only to listen to the
views of men from this chamber who have
recently travelled abroad, all of whom come
back with the same story, that we are facing
stiffer competition from Great Britain, Germany, Japan and many of the northern
European countries.
To illustrate the effect of competition, let
us look at what happened when tenders were
called for the building of an electric power
line from Vancouver to Victoria. A Vancouver company quoted approximately $4
million, while an English company tendered
at $3 million. The reason given for the lower
tender was that the British Company would
pay $1 million less in wages than would the
Canadian company.
Something has been said tonight about
farmers' incomes. Let me emphasize the
fact that this Government bas not let the
farmers make all the profit they should. Under
the wheat agreement made earlier with Great
Britain the Canadian farmers were skinned
-that is the only word to use-out of $600
million to which they were entitled. It is all
very well for the people of this country to
blow their horns and to give themselves credit
for the generosity the Government had shown

JUNE. 27, 1955
to the British people, but the cost of such
generosity should bie borne by the people of
Canada as a whole, flot by just the farmers.
Now, honourable senators, to corne back to
my subject. Pardon me for being off the
subject a littie, Mr. Speaker, but it was
because xny honourable friend from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), mentioned the
f armerHon. Mr. Roebuck: I did flot start it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, but you mentioned it.
Han. Mr. Roebuck: The honourable senator
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) spoke
about it first.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The honourable member
from Blaine Lake mentioned it and you took
hlm up, and ail I have done is follow along.
I propose to vote for the bill, but I hope
that when making future appointments this
Governrnent will switch its tactics and choose
the best men available for the Bench, irrespective of what their politics may be. Speaking for rny own province of Manitoba, I
cannot naine one judge who has been appointed to the Bench in the last twenty years
who was not previously a dyed-in-the-wool
Liberai.
Hon. Mr. Burchifl: May I say something?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Wait until I finish.
In Saskatchewan I think there are some
judges who were Conservatives, but ini Manitoba there is only one Conservative left,' and
he was appointed in 1933 by the Right'
Honourable R. B. Bennett. Judges should be
choseni frorn the Bar as a whole, and their
polltics should flot be a criterion one way or
the other. No one can tell me that politics do
not influence appointments today. The minute a vacancy occurs in our province the
boys at the club ail gather around and speculate as to who will be the new judge. But
nobody would ever put a Conservative name
on the list, for they ail know that he would
flot get the appointment. They put down five
or six Liberals, and the procedure is to strike
thern off one by one until there are three left.
I cali the attention of the honourable senator
fromn New Westminster to this procedure, for
there may be three new appointments to the
Bench In his province very soon. I may say
that one Conservative, the Honourable Mr.
Justice Charles H. Locke, has been appointed
to the Suprerne Court of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Yes, and he la one of the
best judges that we have on that court today.
He was one of the ablest lawyers who ever
practised in the province of British Columnbia;

and, in addition, before he went, on the Bench,
hp was one of the hardest-working Conservatives i that province.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, he was brought up
and trained properly in Manitoba, so that
fitted him for the position. His father was
a judge in Manitoba.
My honourable friend from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) said sornething
about appointments to the Senate. I do not
know what the proportion is in British
Columbia, but the chances of a Manitoban
being appointed to the Senate is only one in
27,000. As a matter of fact, it is harder to
get int the Senate than it is to get on the
Bench. When a person is appointed to this
chamber he comes here with his politics, but
we do not expect a man to be eievated to the
Bench because of bis political acumen or
experience, or for the work that lie has done
for a party. The story is told of an American
and a Canadian who were discussing the
appointment of judges in the respective countries. The Canadian said, 'II do not thlnk
mucli of your system of electing judges". To
which the American repied, "lWeil, I don't
think there is mucli difference, because in
Canada your judges are first elected and then
put on the Bencli".
Honourable senators, I want to say in conclusion that I ar n ot hostile to this bull. I
arn in favour of an increase in salaries for the
reasons I have given, but I thlnk that the
measure should have contained a declaration
by the Minister of Justice, not in the way he
replîed to the Liberal member from Vancouver-Burrard, but rather to this effect:
"In future I will make an absolute choice of
the best quaified men in the province concerned for every appointment to the Bencli.
If he happens to be a Conservative, well and
good, but I want the Liberals in this country
to know that in my judgment I picked the
best rnan available".
It is ail very weli for him to say that is
done today, but it seerna t me that the
appointees are always picked from the sarne
party.
My honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity
<Hon. Mr. Roebuck) remarked that when the
Conservatives were In power they did the
same thlng. I may tell hlmi that Sur John A.
Macdonald did not do that. On one occasion
somebody said ta Sir John, "'You have pretty
good judges", and he said, III always appoint
a gentleman to the Bencli and if lie knows any
law s0 mucli the better". Now, I thlnk on
the Bencli today we have both gentlemen and
good lawyers, and I do flot have any complaint that way at ail. But I thlnk that
lawyers, whether they be Conservatives,

SENATE
Social Crediters, C.C.F.'ers or Liberals, should
all stand on equal terms when an appointment to the Bench is about to be made, and
the man best qualified should have the position. Under that procedure no Senator could
get up and say, "In my province during the
last twenty years nobody but Liberals have
been appointed to the Bench". Otherwise I
do not think the Government is playing the
game and we are not getting the best
Judiciary available to us.
I propose to vote in favour of the bill, but
not because the judges need the money to
meet the increased cost of living. A judge
receiving $14,400 a year or a chief justice
at $16,000 does not need any help on that
score. But, as my honourable friend from
Toronto-Trinity remarked, the judges of the
lower courts who are receiving $8,000 a year
do need it. The province of Manitoba gives
its lower court judges an extra $1,000, and
Saskatchewan an extra $1,500 for Surrogate
Court work. I think the New Brunswick
judges get extra compensation for admiralty
work. But by and large $8,000 is a pretty
small salary under present day conditions,
and in my judgment this bill corrects the
situation. I am sure my honourable friend
from Toronto-Trinity has never looked at
the books of account of the 400-odd lawyers
practising in the province of Manitoba or
he would never have mentioned the income
figures he did. They may receive such incomes in the city of Toronto, but certainly
not in the city of Winnipeg. That is one
reason why the people in the poorer provinces say that Ontario should contribute more
than it does to the upkeep of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I would like to say to
my honourable friend who has just resumed
his seat that the present Chief Justice of New
Brunswick was a former Conservative Premier of that province, and he was appointed
to his present position by a Liberal Government.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Who is he?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: The Honourable Charles
D. Richards.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But he was on the Bench
before he was appointed Chief Justice.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: He was appointed Chief
Justice over Liberal applicants for the position. I want you to give the Government
credit for what it has done.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But he was a trial judge
before he was made Chief Justice?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Yes.

Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators,
the introduction of this bill permits a discussion of the position of the Judiciary in
this country, and it need not be restricted to
a discussion of the proposed increases in
judges' salaries. It does seem to me appropriate on this occasion to say something about
the Supreme Court of Canada, and I do so
particularly because this chamber has had a
distinguished record in the ultirnate establishment of the Supreme Court of Canada as the
highest court of appeal in this country.
The honourable senator from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) made a very remarkable speech in 1949 when he explained the
bill which accomplished that purpose, and
he, of course, was in a great tradition which
consisted also of the Honourable C. H. Cahan,
the Right Honourable Ernest Lapointe, and,
going back even further, the Honourable
Edward Blake, a former Minister of Justice.
Since 1949 the Supreme Court of Canada has
been our court of last resort. I sometimes
wonder whether we as Canadians continue
to think of the high purpose and the great
hopes that were expressed at the time the
status of the court was so established. In
my opinion we have, in the members of that
court, a remarkable group of Canadians
drawn from the country from one coast to the
other. The court compels the respect of not
only the members of the legal profession but
of the people at large. It was constituted and
is still constituted of some very remarkable
jurists. One thing I have regretted at times
is that the lives, the work and the philosophies of these men are not more generally
known to the Canadian people. For example,
there recently died Sir Lyman Duff, one of
the greatest jurists that this country ever

throughout the Commonwealth as well as in
his native land; and I would express the
hope that some day a competent biography
of this great man, revealing something of
the workings of his mind, will be available
to young Canadians who may aspire to the
high position he held and adorned.
As the years go by the Supreme Court of
Canada, as our final court of appeal, will
be faced with decisions involving great
responsibilities and the exercise of high qualities of judgment. I do think that Canadians
should do all in their power to strengthen
and fortify that Bench, as typical of the
judicial institutions of this country, for by
establishing it in a position of great prestige
and influence all the courts and, generally
speaking, the judicial institutions of this
country, will be strenghtened. I know that
the rule stare decisis-the dead hand of precedent-can rest upon a court and in some
degree stifle its activities. Precedent can be

JUSE 2Î'. 1955
a stabilizer, but it can also be a factor whlch,
hinders progress. The Supreme Court of
Canada must look upon the problems which
face it: in the light of the conditions in this
country, and much in the manner-if 1 may
say so-that was expressed as a hope by the
honourable senator froxu Inkerman in 1949
when he explained amendments to the
Supreme Court Act. This does flot mean,
of course, that the Supreme Court of Canada
15 to become untouchable.
In that connection, perhaps honourable
members may be interested in an opinion
which was expressed by Mr. Justice Holmes
in a speech he delivered at the Harvard Law
School Association o! New York in 1913.
Speaking of his own court, he said:

markets, and It seems to me that we have
arrived at a stage when our policy should
be framed to deai with this trend. But I do
not for a moment agree that, because o!
such aspects in our economy, we should deny
to our Canadian judges the increases provided in the bill before us. By raising the
level o! remuneration, the bill would merely
correct a situation which affects practicaUly
aIl the Bench of Canada.
I support the bll, particularly as it is four
years, I understand, since an adjustment
was nmade. I look at it this way. In order
that the Bench may continue ta attract men
of high quality and standing they must be

inarticulate truth.

Hon. Calvert C. Pratt. Hlonourable senators, as a iayman 1 wouid like to say a word
or two on this subi ect. I have been a Canadian a littie over six years; and I can hardly
believe that political influences are operating i connection with the courts of this
country. I find it difficuit to credit such a
statement; at any rate I hope that any influences of this kind wiil not reach as far as
our province. 1 arn sure that so far they have
not affected us. We in Newfoundland have
not; heard any compiaints about the calibre
of our Bench, and it would astonish me to
learn that Canadians generally have any
cause for complaint. My thought has always
been and it is now that the Bench of Canada
ranks high among the world's Judiciary, that
it is beyond the reach of undue influence,
and that it administers justice irreproachably. I1 amn sorry that references to alleged
political appointments were introduced into
this debate. I do not think that a question
which reflects-as it must, in the way !t
was put-on the integrity and standing o!
the Judiciary of Canada should have been
raised on this occasion.
However, I agree with the references of
the honourabie senator from, Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) to the dangers of increasing costs of production. I believe that a
relatively small population such as ours,
largely dependent on exports, and faced at
times with great difficulties in disposing of
its products, is very much exposed to the

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators,.The Han. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, 1 would remind the house that If
the honourable leader speaks now he will
close the debate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There is not a great
deal left for me to say. The honourable
senators !rom Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen),
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), Ottawa
West (Hon. Mr. Connolly), St. John's West
(Hon. Mr. Pratt), and the honourable Leader
Opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) have clearly set
forth why salaries of judges should be increased. While they did not; agree in everything they said, they were in general agreement that the salaries should be increased.
It has occurred to me we cannot put on a
dollar-and-cent-basis the services that judges
render to our country. A judgeship is an
honourable position and men seek to fill it
because of that. It bas been suggested tonight that people could be found who would
be glad to serve in the Senate without remuneration; but no one has suggested that this
should be done. I have no doubt there are
members of the Bar who wouid accept positions on the Bench even if the present salary
were lowered. But we must be fair to our
Judiciary, a number of whose members have
served for years, and by approving this increase I think we are being f air. Actually,
the increase the judges wlll receive under this
legisiation is far out of line with the increases
that have been received by many people in
other walks o! life.
I agre e with what the honourable gentleman 1rom Toronto-Trinity said about thé

SENATE
judges of the County Court of the County of
York. I understand none of them receive
anything in addition to their salary of $8,000.
After paying income tax, a judge with a family must have quite a difficult time getting
along in Toronto while maintaining his position in the community as a judge. He will
not have too easy a task even on a salary of
$10,500.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
pointed out that judges are appointed by
the Minister of Justice, who at present happens to support the Liberal party. My
honourable friend did not suggest-and I
would bring this to the attention of the
honourable gentleman from St. John's West
(Hon. Mr. Pratt)-that any political influence
would be used by an appointee to the Bench,
and he said that he had never been unfairly
treated by any judge just because he happened to be of a different political persuasion.
I think this illustrates that our system of
making judicial appointments must be a
fairly good one. The honourable Leader of
the Opposition referred to the United States
system. He did not suggest we should follow
it, and I would be strongly opposed to filling
judgeships by a system of popular election.
It is interesting to note that the Minister of
Justice, in speaking in the House of Commons the other day, referred to a statement
which he had made some time ago to the
effect that from November 15, 1948, to June
27, 1951, out of sixty-eight appointments there
were only two former defeated federal candidates. That is a pretty good record, and it
certainly does not bear out the statement that
defeated political candidates are appointed
to the Bench. I do not deny that defeated
candidates have been appointed, but I do not
think, for instance, there is one defeated
Liberal candidate serving on the Supreme
Court of Ontario at the present time.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes; Chief Justice
MeRuer.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And Mr. Justice Gibson.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No. He was a member of Parliament but he was never defeated.
I am sure we all agree that Chief Justice
McRuer is a very competent and excellent
judge and that no one could exert political
influence over him.
I mention these things to show that our
system is a fair and good one, and in looking
over the history of our Judiciary I feel the
present system of appointments has proved
to be satisfactory.
During the debate some questions were
asked of me, but I think most of them have

senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) asked why there are more judges in
Saskatchewan than in British Columbia. Well,
I take it that at some time the province of
Saskatchewan requested the appointment of
additional judges. If a province requests
an additional judge the Government usually
makes the appointment. The question of
the distance of travel may be a factor. For
instance, in the province of Saskatchewan
distances are great and that province may
have felt that it needed more judges for
that reason; it was not a matter of comparing
the numbers of judges there with the number
in British Columbia.
The Leader of the Opposition stated correctly the reason why a blanket increase is
provided for, and I think honourable senators
consider that is a fair basis on which to make
the increase.
I could read to the house the salaries paid
to judges in the United Kingdom, but I do
not think I should take time to do so. I
need only say that salaries of judges in that
country are much higher than in Canada.
I think the only question which I have
not answered is with regard to pensions. I
believe it was the honourable senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) who asked
why it is proposed that the pensions be based
on the present salaries, without the increase.
The judges do not contribute to the pension
fund, and although the bill provides for an
increased salary, the Government felt that
the pension basis was fair and did not require
an increase. Therefore, under this bill, although a judge will receive an increase in
salary of $2,500, his pension will be twothirds of his former salary. The purpose of
this bill is to be fair to the judges, and we
feel that by giving them a reasonable pension,
in any event, they are being dealt with
fairly.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask the honourable
leader a question? Has he any knowledge of
the total number of judges in the United
Kingdom as compared with the number in
Canada?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have not that information at hand, and I do not know if I could
get it. However, I can say that the population of the United Kingdom is between 45
and 50 million, and that in Canada it is only
15 million, and, therefore, I think there would
be many more judges in the United Kingdom
than in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Horner: My understanding is that
there are more judges in Canada than in the
United Kingdom.

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, may I say a few words before the
report is adopted? To begin with, I should
like to congratulate the committee on what
they have done. When this bill came to the
house it received rather severe ýcriticism. I
recall making an observation to the effect
that a person who heard some private information over a public broadcasting station
and divulged it to somebody else was within
his rights in doing so; but under this bill
as it was introduced he would be open to
prosecution. I felt that prosecution should be
directed to those persons who allowed such
secrets to be broadcast, rather than to those
who received them. Therefore, I congratulate
the committee upon having eliminated any
reference to broadcast from public stations,
for that is as it should be.
The prohibition is now confined to private
messages which in their very nature are secret
messages. The long distance telephone, for
instance, carries great masses of conversation
through the air, and it is quite within the
realm of possibility that an amateur who bas
a little money to spend could tap those conversations. Under this bill he may do so,
but if he uses the information he thus receives
and is caught he is open to prosecution.
But, honourable senators, I do not think the
committee by its amendment bas gone quite
far enough. The honourable member for
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) has referred
to certain exceptions, such as distress signals
from either the air or the sea, and there
may be some others. But this bill in association with the act which it amends places
in the hands of probably the Governor in
Council the right to make regulations with
respect to exceptions which must be made.
My point is that this is a criminal statute and
is in effect criminal law; therefore, I think
the exceptions should be in the act rather
than regulations. As we all know, regulations
are made behind closed doors and are not
subjected to public discussion in a deliberative
assembly, such as this or the other place,
where there is the clash of thought and the
opportunity for public expression which is
so valuable and essential in our democratic
system.
By this measure we are giving the executive power to decide what under the
criminal law will be prohibited and what
may be allowed. I understand that the
regulations are either in the process of drafting or already have been drafted, and could
quite easily be included in this measure. It
must be noted that if the exceptions are in

the form of regulations we do not have the
ready access to them that we would have
if they were in the act. Certainly no one
can say that the regulations are omitted from
the statute because they are long; goodness
knows, the Criminal Code is long enough. I
can illustrate my point by asking this
question: Who would suggest that we in
one sentence should legislate against sin, and
then allow the executive to define what sin
is? That, in effect, is what we are doing by
this bill. We are leaving to the executive the
right to define what is the law.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: My honourable friend
is perhaps a little unfair in his example. It
would perhaps be more accurate to say that
we are saying that sin is a crime, but we are
allowing the executive to make certain
exceptions to the crime, not to add to it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is practically the
same thing. We are saying in the statute that
a certain thing is a crime, but we are allowing the executive to change the definition.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: To limit it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: To reduce it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And to change it rather
materially in the sense that if I go to the
statute to find what the law is, I am misinformed unless I go also to the regulations
made in private and not published in the
statute. As I have said, very few people will
know anything about the regulations; in
effect, only those in the department concerned will know about them. Why should
the regulations not be in the statute? What is
to be gained by leaving them out? I can tell
you what is to be gained by putting them in:
Everybody will know what is in fact the
criminal law with respect to this particular
offence.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, the question is on the adoption of
the amendment. Is it your pleasure to concur
in the amendment?

I have said, General McNaughton is the head
of the Canadian section of that commission.
I should just like to repeat the definition of
"international river", as "1water flowing from
any place in Canada to any place outside
Canada". Obviously, for geographical reasons,
the only country into which water could flow
from Canada is the United States.
Hou. Mr. Rold: What about waters flowing
from the United States into Canada?
Hon. Mr. Hugesuon: The bill does not apply
to them.
The next terni defined is "international
river improvement":
"International river improvement" means a dam,
obstruction, canal, reservoir or other work the
purpose or effect of which Is
(i) to increase, decrease or alter the natural
flow of an International river, and
(Il) ta Interfere with, alter or affect the actual
or potential use of the International river outside
Canada.

Now, bearing these definitions in mind I
think honourable senators will readily see
why it is desirable, indeed why it is even
essential, for the dominion Government to
be able to exercise some control. These
international river improvements when constructed and in operation may affect rights
downstream in the United States-rights of
individuals, of private corporations, and of
public authorities, such as the Bonneville
Power Administration; and indeed rights of
some of the states of the Union into whose
territory the waters of these rivers flow.
These matters thus become of international
scope, and under the British North America
Act the federal Government is alone competent to act on behalf of Canada. It is true
that for the most part, if not entirely, the
physical ownership of the Canadian sections
of these international rivers concerned is
vested in the provinces through which they
flow. The provinces can deal with the regulation and development of those rivers within
the respective provincial limits, but they are
incompetent to deal with international matters and with the extraterritorial rights
which may be involved. For instance, a
number of most interesting questions are
apt to arise, such as the beneficial result
which will obtain in the United States from
storage of the upper waters of the Columbia
River within Canada, and what consideration
should be payable by those in the United
States who derive such advantages from, the
storage works carried out by and in Canada.
The province of British Columbia, for
example, is totally unable to make any
treaty or agreement of any kind with, let
us say, the States of Oregon or Washington
and therefore it Is necessary for the
50437-40

dominion Government which, as I say, Is
the only authority in this country having
power to deal without outslde states, to
become a .party to any of these contemplated
developments.
That is the basic principle whlch. underlies this bill.
If honourable senators wil examine the
text of the bill they will realize the extent
o! federal control that is proposed. In future
no international river improvement may be
constructed, operated or maintained unless a
licence has been obtained under this act
f rom the Governor in Council. Appropriate
penalties are provided for failure to obtain
such a licence, penalties going even sa far
as to provide for confiscation to the Crown
of any work constructed without a licence.
The Governor in Coundil is authorized
under this bill to make regulations, "for the
purpose of developing and utllizing the
water resources of Canada in the national
interest".
Certain international river improvements
are exempted from the operation of the bull.
The first class of these to which I should
refer is works on boundary waters. As I
have already explained, works on boundary
waters are governed by the Canada-United
States Treaty of 1909. A second class of
works exempted falîs with.in the region of
minor works for irrigation and other similar
purposes wlthin a province. It appears that
on quite a number o! these international
rivers in the provinces of British Columbia
and Saskatchewan, farmers and others have
made little irrigation works or drainage
systems and so on which have no practical
effect upon the flow of the rivers into the
'United States; and the Government of Saskatchewan made representations to the
External Aiffairs Committee o! the other
house, as a result of which the exception was
inserted which will be found in section 7(c):
7. This act does nat appiy in respect of an international river improvement
(c) constructed, operated or maintained salely
for domnestic, sanitary or irrigation purposes or
other similar consumnptive uses.

In the context o! this bill provincial rights
are o! course very important because, as I
said, the provinces own the title to those
parts o! the bed and water powers in the
rivers which flow through the provinces concerned. The bill deals with the provincial
rights in two ways. First, it declares that
Her Majesty in the right of a province is
bound by this act. In other words, a province cannot do anything in contravention o!
this act, should it be passed. Secondly, the
bill provides that international river improvements shail continue to be subject to the laws

SENATE
of the province in which they are situated,
except only to the extent to which such laws
may be repugnant to the act.
I should emphasize, honourable senators,
that this bill does not take away or purport
to take away any property rights of the provinces, nor does it interfere with or purport
to interfere with provincial legislation with
respect to rivers and river improvements,
either legislation now in existence or such
as may be passed in the future, except and
only in so far as such legislation may be
repugnant to this measure. In effect, all that
the bill does is to bring in the dominion
Government as another party whose intervention is essential for the proper development of rivers flowing from Canada to the
United States, in so far as this development
will affect international rights and international obligations.
One thing, I think, is quite obvious. For
the proper development of these rivers in
Canada and in order to mesh in provincial
rights and local requirements in Canada with
international rights and international obligations, the closest co-operation will be required
between the federal authorities and the
provincial authorities concerned. I hopeindeed I will go further and express the confident belief-that that co-operation will occur
as and when the occasion may require. After
all, honourable senators, we are all Canadians, and whether we happen to wear our
federal hat or our provincial hat we are
vitally interested in the proper development
of these great natural resources with which
we have been endowed by a beneficient
Providence.
I have explained the basic principle of this
bill, and how it is proposed to bring that
principle into practical effect. At this stage,
on the second reading of the bill, it is unnecessary and I think it would be improper for
me to say any more. As I have already
pointed out, the bill if enacted, will have
particular application at this time to the
possible diversion of the Columbia River and
its tributaries, in British Columbia. The story
is complicated and fascinating. For details
of it I would refer honourable senators to
the printed evidence given before the House
of Commons Standing Committee on External
Affairs, and particularly, the evidence of
General McNaughton, who is one of the outstanding public servants of this country.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The honourable senator
dealt with rivers which flow out of Canada.
What about rivers which flow into Canada?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: This bill does not purport to deal with rivers which flow into
Canada.

Hon. Mr. Haig: It does not affect them
at all?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No. By its definition
it is confined to international rivers; and
"international river" is defined as "water
flowing from any place in Canada to any
place outside Canada".
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, in
rising to say a few words on this bill, may I
make it clear that it is not my intention to be
critical either of the bill or of any of its
provisions. Like every other British Columbian, since the project first became known,
through General McNaughton, after a supposed agreement by the Province of British
Columbia with certain interests in the state
of Washington to utilize the waters of the
Columbia for power development, particularly
in the United States, I have taken quite a
keen interest in the matter. I, too, have read
all the evidence very carefully. I have gone
one step further, however. On June 3, the
International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission, of which I am the chairman, held a
meeting here with General McNaughton, not
to discuss the power developments of the
river but to explain in general the possible
condition, as we saw it, which faces the
sockeye salmon industry of the Fraser River.
Our commission was greatly concerned
when the proposal was made known to divert
the waters of the Columbia River into the
Fraser during the four low-level periods of
that river, namely, the months of November
to February inclusive. The suggestion put
forward by General McNaughton is, I think,
a fairly logical one. The waters on this side
of the boundary are Canadian; and I realize,
as everyone else does who has studied the
matter, that if advantage is not soon taken of
the water power now available on the Columbia River we may lose it for all time. Hence
a project to put the dam at a place called
Mica Creek, bas been proposed, and I understand that with that and other projects upwards of two million horsepower can be developed. The statement has been made that
some 15 million acre-feet will be held behind
the dam at Mica Creek, and surplus water
will be diverted, during the four months I
have mentioned, from that point through the
construction of a fifteen-mile tunnel. When
the announcement was first made, there were
many who thought that the project of diverting the waters of the Columbia by building a
tunnel fifteen miles long was nothing but a
dream, but the more the matter was discussed,
and the more that was heard from General
McNaughton about it, the more people-and
I among them-were convinced of the feasibility of the scheme. As a matter of fact, the

JUNE ses 1955
amount of hydro-electric power which .is
developed is flot dependent so much on the
quantity of water as on what is known as
the head of water. The statement is made
that probably as much power can be developed from the Columbia River as fromn the St.
Lawrence, and although one is inclined to
view this estimate with scepticism, when one
regards the volume of water and the length
of the Columbia as compared with the mighty
St. Lawrence, it is to be remembered that at
the point of diversion the Columbia River
water is about 4,000 feet above sea level, so
that the velocity of the descending water is
very great.
In the commission's presentation to General
McNaughton we pointed out what we believed
to be great dangers in the scheme, because it
goes further than to propose a diversion of
water, and recommends, for usage near Vancouver, the building of a series of low-level
dams on the Fraser River to utilize the waters
of the Columbia, augmented in the Fraser
River during the low four-month period, but
of course, using the Fraser River when the
waters o! that river are high. In this respect
the proposed project both disturbed and
alarmed us. For the past seventeen years or
engineers and biologists have been studying
the sockeye salinon in the Fraser River, and
with their aid we have accumulated a great
fund o! information. On a number of occasions I have pointed out the difficulties which
are suffered by the salmon as a resuit o!
dams. In other places, particularly in the
state o! Washington, fishways have been constructed where the spawning sockeye salmon
cên be taken up over the dam. In this connection, we learned our lesson from the
Columbia River when it was discovered that
there was no way to bring safely over the
dams the little fingerlings heading to the sea.
I do not mind telling honourable senatorsalthough we do not care to boast about it,
lest a wrong interpretation be placed upon
our remarks-that we have been concerned,
as an organization investigating this matter
scientifically and in a practical way, to ses
if we could devise some electrical appliance
which might divert the lîttle fingerlings before
they reach the dam, and guide them down
some canal. We are not alone in the matter
of this experimientation. Quite a number o!
countries are endeavouring to find the answer,
but the outlook for a successful solution in
the near future is not too bright. In fact,
it may neyer be found. We have been afraid
to say a great deal about our own experiments i case the power development interests
might use the argument "Oh, well, let's go
ahead and build dams; they have now solved

the problem o! bringing fingerlings over
dams". But we have not.
General McNaughton has spoken about
dams o! 200 feet in height. That may flot
seem very high, but experiments in the United
States with a 180 foot dam showed an 8 per
cent niortality of fingerlings going over the
dam and 30 per cent mortality when they go
through the turbines.
It can be readily
realized that construction o! four dams on
the Fraser River, that height or of 200 feet,
might resuit in the eventual extinction o!
sockeye salmon in the Fraser.
1 amrn ot going to be too critical o! companies which want to develop power, but
invariably I have found that they are much
more interested in developing water power
for electrical energy than in protecting fish
for food purposes. I have pointed out to
those interested in the aluminum and other
power industries that, in view of the growing
world population and the increasing shortage
o! protein foods, they had better take another
look at food and not ignore the great sockeye
salmon industry o! British Columbia, which
last year was worth some $22 million. It
may interest honourable senators to know that
in 1913, the year the great disaster struck
Hell's Gate, when millions o! tons o! rock
f ell into the canyon, the sockeye salmon idustry of the Fraser River had reached a
peak production o! 2j million cases. This
meant that some 30 million sockeye salmon
had actually been caught that year and
canned. Hlowever, the disaster took its toil on
the 10 million salmon heading back up
the river to spawn. Incidentally, the sockeye salmon is the only species o! fish that
must reach the spawning beds where they
were born before they themselves can spawn.
If they are frustrated in this attempt they
will die without spawning.
The full impact o! the Hell's Gate disaster
was not known until four years after the
event, which marked the first year o! the
four-year cycle following the disaster when
the salmon returned to their spawning bed.
In 1917 the production had dropped to approximately 425,000 cases.
After a long
series o! inquiries and representations to, the
United States Government an international
treaty was signed. 1 would point out that
although the salmon are born in British
Columbia rivers and lakes they later head
out to sea; and ini the f ourth year, in returning to the Fraser River they first enter United
States waters, where they are caught by
American fishermen. In 1937 a treaty was
signed between Canada and the United States.
I may say that I am the only surviving one
o! the original members o! the International
Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission, and

SENATE
at the present time I have the honour to
be its chairman. At a cost of over $1 million,
shared equally by the Governments of Canada
and the United States, a fishway was built
at Hell's Gate to take the sockeye salmon
through that point of the river. We have
three flshways there now and I think they
are the finest in the world. I say that without fear of successful contradiction. Incidentally, I might explain that there is a
fish ladder and a fishway, the former having
steps. I remember that when I appeared
before a meeting of United States Government
officials some years ago I was told by a
senator: "Don't talk to me about salmon. You
are trying to tell me that fish go up ladders."
He visualized the fish ladder as being straight
up and down.
Last year some two million sockeye salmon
went through these fishways, but we have
found that delays can be dangerous and therefore we are perturbed and anxious about the
proposal to divert the waters of the Columbia River to Fraser and to build four dams
on the Fraser River. It is our understanding,
based on scientific fact, that every obstacle
placed in the way of the fish is to their
detriment, and that with the construction of
four dams they will never be able to reach
their spawning beds. It must be borne in
mind that the sockeye salmon do not eat
after they reach fresh water, and some of
them have to travel as far as 650 miles without food. They use up their own fat as
energy, and they have only so much of it.
Our scientists have warned us that the construction of dams of any height on the Fraser
River may result in wiping out the sockeye
salmon. I would point out, too, that we still
have a long way to go in our rehabilitation
program to reach the 1913 production of 2j
million cases; but we have been hopeful that,
with the solving of the Hell's Gate problem
and the seeding of barren areas in the interior, the supply of sockeye salmon would be
built up to its former greatness.
Hon. Mr. Euler: To what extent has the
construction of fishways helped in the restoration of the sockeye salmon supply in British
Columbia?
Hon. Mr. Reid: There are about five areas
in the interior of British Columbia that produce large runs, and two of them are now
producing at near to their 1913 capacity. It
was estimated by provincial authorities that
2 million sockeye salmon went into the Quesnel area to spawn in days gone past. When
we took over we found in one year only six
went in, and until lately the highest number
found in any one year was 100. However,
owing to the work of our scientists, last year
600,000 sockeye salmon went into that area to

spawn. This shows that we are beginning to
develop the barren areas, and we hope the
development will proceed rapidly. I am very
hopeful that before very long we shall bring
production up to the 1913 level.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Will the honourable
senator permit a question?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Are there not other
salmon rivers upon which fish ladders are
being used very successfully?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Our only experience of
them has been in the state of Washington,
and mostly on the Columbia River, which
used to be a great sockeye salmon river. The
effect of the dams on the Columbia river
wiped out the salmon that went into the
interior of British Columbia, with the result
that the fishery on the Columbia is gradually
going down and down, even though Washington and United States authorities have built
fish ladders for the salmon up over the dams.
The fact that fingerlings are dying on their
way to the sea has brought about a diminution year by year, and we predict and
believe that it will not be long before there
is little or no sockeye salmon industry on
the Columbia River. With that example before us, naturally we are watching every
move that is made to build power dams
on the Fraser River, which we believe would
wipe out the great sockeye salmon industry
on that river.
Someone may ask, "What are you going
to do with the Columbia River at Mica
Creek Dam?" Well, I think we have just as
competent engineers on our commission as
there are on any other commission-I say
that with pardonable pride-and they have
advised us that at Mica Creek Dam the electric power should and could be developed.
General McNaughton spoke about sending
power into the province of Alberta from Mica
Creek Dam, which he says is a distance of
350 miles, and thus raising that province from
what has always been a farming or wheatgrowing province to an industrial province.
One of our engineers said to us, "Why not
develop all the power there and carry it down
into the Fraser valley, which is only 50 miles
farther?" He also reminded us that in
Sweden and other countries of Europe power
is carried longer distances than 350 miles.
That is not against this bill. I am passing on
the suggestion, as coming from our staff, that
investigation be made to see if power could
not be developed at Mica Creek Dam on the
Canadian side and utilized in the Fraser
valley and in Alberta, because there is ample
water to develop all the power required.

JUNE 28, 1955
I felt that on this occasion I could not sit
idly by without warning both governments,
and also the people of British Columbia, that
although it is very nice to talk about power
development after ail, you cannot eat aluminum, and other metals, and a shortage of food
may well become a very serious matter. As
a matter of fact, although British Columbia
has thousands and thousands of acres of undeveloped land-some of which, of course,
will neyer be developed-the province does
flot produce enough meat to supply its people
at the present time, and will always have to
import meat supplies. Experts who have
studied the situation say that in time there
may be a shortage of protein foods on the
North American continent owing to the rapid
growth of population and also because many
areas of agricultural land are becoming
impoverished.
I have one more word to say, and it has
to do with a matter of further worry to us.
After the statement made by General McNaughton earlier in the year became known,
it was said for the record: "Oh, don't worry
about that, this project is neyer going to be
carried out"ý-that is, the delivering of waters
from the Columbia River to the Fraser River.
But as General McNaughton's arguments
developed and as time went on it became
evident that it was not entirely a pipe dream,
or some kind of a proposai put forward just
for the purpose of holding something back or
against the Americans, but that it was becomîng a reality. May I say here that I take
off my hat to General McNaughton; I respect
hlm for his knowledge and for the confidence
he has gained because of his work on the
International Joint Commission. I was, however, a little perturbed when I heard that the
head of the B.C. Electric Company was here
in Ottawa in discussion with General McNaughton, the very day we had ail the discussion with him. I had a quarrel with the
Alcan interests. The Alcan Company at first
did not want the site on the Nechako, but
wanted a site cailed Chilco. I had to get very
rough at that timne, and make a direct challenge to the then Premier of the province to
debate the matter publicly. I ralsed my voice
so loudly that the Alcan Company left Chilco
and developed where they are now. I arn not
uninindful of the fact that the B.C. Electricwhich as weil as Alcan has received some
of British Columbia's heritages in powerdid a very surprlsing thlng two years ago,
when the Social Credit party first carne into
office, and before it got so friendly-and I
say that advisedly-with the power interests
and the big business people. The Social Credit
goverr.ment, inx its first year in office, passed
a bill which requfred that power companies,

before building a dam on any of the rivers,
mnust first consuit with the fisheries department of the provincial government and place
the plans before it. But, honourable senators,
who do you think protested? 1 cannot unclerstand why Alcan, which has received as great
a British heritage in this country as any
company has ever received, would protest
that bill, but it did, and so also did the B.C.
Electric. 1 was suspicious of the B.C. Electric,
because I know that it is out to grab ail the
available power sites it can. I predict that
it will flot be long before an application is
made for a prominent site on the Fraser
River, and if the B.C. Electric succeeds in
getting that it wrnl then control the whole
of the Fraser River, in so far as future power
development is concerned.
I make no apology for bringing these
matters to the attention of honourable senators. As Chairman of our commission I f eel
that I have a duty to perform. I have fought
these greedy power interests ail along. I arn
not against power development, but I think
that power could be developed without
destroying the sockeye salmon on the Fraser
River. I believe that both the dominion and
provincial Governments should look forward
to ali the power that it is possible to develop
for Alberta and British Columbia, and that
the distance is not too great to carry power
from Mica Creek Dam to the Fraser Valley.
If instead they turn the waters of the Columbia River into the Fraser River, and rights
are given to companies to construct dams
for power ini the Fraser valley, my opinion
is that the great salmon industry of the
Fraser River wiIl disappear. Bear in mind,
honourable senators, that once we bring the
Fraser River back to what it was in 1913, at
present day prices the catch of salmon will be
worth $65 million in the market. Let us be
very careful, therefore when making decisions
with regard to the developing and utilizing
of our water resources for power.
Honourable senators, I want to assure the
honourable member who sponsored this bill
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) that I amn heartily in
favour of his assertion that we should utilize
our water resources for Canadians on this
side of the line.
Hon. Sonators: Hear, hear.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Hlonourable senators, I
do not think the honourable senator who has
just spoken is at ail alarmed about the possibility of the waters of the Columbia River
being turned through the mountains to empty
into the Fraser River. In my opinion atomic
power will be in general use in this country

qualify them for the benefit of the bonus.

JUNE
As I have said, honourable senators, the
act has been in operation since 1939. It has
been a great blessing to many deserving
people, but it has resulted in a considerable
amount of bitterness, bickering and heartache. There are three reasons for this. In
the first place, the rainfaîl does flot stop at
the municipal or township limes. It has
happened that one man in an eligible township wouid get a bonus when he had a yield
of ten or even fifteen bushels per acre, when
at the same time a man in an ineligible township or a block of sections that was not
eligible, who had littie or no crop at ail,
received no bonus.
Secondly, if land is owned and cultivated
by a loan company, a postmaster, a professional man, or a merchant, in each case the
levy of one per cent per bushel on ail grain
sold would be paid, yet the owner would not
be eligible for the bonus because farming
was not his chief occupation. Tbirdly, there
are areas where a crop failure neyer occurs,
but the people nevertheless pay the levy
year by year.
Ail of these tbings prove conclusiveiy that
the only fair way of dealing with the problem is on an individual basis, so that every
farmer in Canada who bas paid bis premium
and who suffers crop failure will be eligible
for the bonus.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask the honourable
senator a question? He speaks of the levy
that is paid by various farmers into tis
fund out of which the bonus is paîd. Does
that levy completely cover the amounts
expended?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: No, it does not, but I
will corne to that in just a minute. It bas not
paid baîf of the expenditures.
As I say, the fair way to administer the
benefits would be on an individual basis, s0
that these irregularities I speak of wouid not
occur. But, then, to, put it on an individual
basis would mean crop insurance, a matter
that is definitely ultra vires of the dominion
Government. It is like bail insurance. A
few years ago the dominion Government
considered instituting a program of bail insurance, and when it was found to beultra
vires of the Government each of the three
provinces concerned arranged for it own
coverage.
In the matter of prairie farmn assistance the
Province of Saskatcbewan considered the
whole question of crop insurance, and seems
to have decided against it. The Province of
Manitoba went so far as to set up a commission to investigate such a plan. That
commission came to Ottawa and studied the
records of wbat areas had good crops and

what areas had poor crops, and arranged to
zone the wbole area for the purpose of fixing
premiums. Tbe commission then travelied to
the United States, where there is a crop
insurance program. in force, and studied their
metbods. But up to the present a crop insurance plan bas not been put into operation.
Now, bonourable senators, in late years
crops bave been fairly good and the one per
cent levy bas reacbed or exceeded tbe
amount paid out; but since tbe act was passed,
in 1939, the dominion Government bas received $86 million and bas paid out $177
million.
Manitoba is in a different position from tbe
other provinces, baving paid in $13 million
and received back $8 million. Ail the amounts
are given on page 5057 of the House of
Commons Hansard. Saskatchewan bas paid
in $48 million and bas received $126 million,
and Alberta bas paid in $24 million and received in return $42 million. The Peace
River block in British Columbia bas collected
$364,000, a relatively small amount.
I feel that this measure will be a step forward and will help a great many people wbo
bave worked bard and tbrough no fault of
their own have met with disaster.
Tbe motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Gershaw, the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Natural Resources.
NARCOTIC DRUG TRAFFIC
REPORT OF' COMMITTEE CONSIDEREDDEBATE ADJOURNED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the final report of the Special Committee appointed to inquire into and report upon
the trafffic in Narcotic drugs.
Hon. Thomas Reid, Chairman of the coinmittee, moved that the report be concurred in.
He said: Honourable senators, in rising
to move tbe adoption of this report I believe
it is advisable to touch briefly on some of
the salient points outlined in the report and
later to mention briefiy the work of the
committee itself.
The committee was set up on March 2, and
at Its first meeting I was unanimousiy appointed chairman. I wish at this time to
place on the record my appreciation of the
confidence which tis important committee
placed in me.
When it became known that the committee
intended to hold meetings in the city of
Vancouver, there were misgivings in certain

SENATE
quarters about the committee's action, some
newspapers even referring to it as a joy
ride. This was perhaps understandable, of
course, for it was the first time in our parliamentary history that a committee of
the Senate had ever held sessions outside of
Ottawa. But there were certain good reasons
for the committee's decision to visit Vancouver. To my mind two, at least, were very
important.
First is the fact that 50 per cent of all drug
addicts are located or resident in and around
Vancouver. It was due principally to the
serious conditions which have arisen in that
city, with so large a congregation of drug
addicts, that this special committee was set up.
It is my own opinion had the drug problem
been no greater in Vancouver than in either
Toronto or Montreal, it might not have commanded the attention it did, either by the
Government or by the citizens in and around
the lower mainland of British Columbia.
The second reason was a desire to avoid
unnecessary public expenses. When it became known in Vancouver that a special committee of the Senate had been set up to
investigate the narcotic drug problem, the
mayor of that city forwarded a list of certain
doctors, psychiatrists and others, some fifteen
persons in all, who he believed would be
qualified to give evidence before our committee. These witnesses could perhaps all
have been asked to appear before the committee here in Ottawa, but in view of the
cost of air travel for such an array of witnesses, and as well the fact that only those
witnesses who came to Ottawa would have
been heard, while others would have been
precluded from giving evidence, I think honourable senators will agree that it was a
wise decision to go out to Vancouver where
the greatest problem existed. When one considers how well the report has been received,
the decision to go out to Vancouver has been
amply justified.
As a matter of record, the committee, in
a period of five full days at Vancouver, heard
a total of 32 witnesses, instead of 15; and
besides, it visited Oakalla prison and interviewed 150 addicts, two of whom were females. We also held a full day's session at the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police Barracks in
Vancouver, interviewing certain drug addicts,
as well as relatives of drug addicts. The decision made to hold these latter sessions in
camera, with the press excluded, and not to
allow the committee proceedings to be televised, will, I feel, have the approval of all
honourable senators, and I trust of the public
as well.
As mentioned, the decision to hold sessions in Vancouver and, later, in Montreal

and Toronto, was, I believe, a wise one,
because it enabled the committee to obtain
first-hand information and so to be in a
position to appraise the entire problem more
effectively than it could have done had it
remained in Ottawa.
In all some twenty meetings were held,
thirteen of which were open to the public,
two were in camera, and one consisted of a
tour of the Bureau of Narcotic Control, under
the able administration of Mr. K. C. Hossick,
who is Canada's representative on the United
Nations Narcotic Drug Commission.
Incidentally, may I remark that we in
Canada are prone to rather excessive humility at times, particularly when we compare
our ways of handling things with those of the
United States. In this connection, while in
Washington I was talking with Senator
Daniels, head of the United States Senate
Judiciary Subcommittee on Narcotics. He had
received some information from Mr. Robert
E. Curran, the leading counsel of the Department of National Health and Welfare here,
and he made the frank admission, "Senator
Reid, I think you are further ahead in the
control of illegal traffic in narcotic drugs than
are we in the United States, and I am going
to advise our authorities to visit your country and find out how you are handling affairs
there." Perhaps this is an appropriate time
to place on the record this splendid tribute.
In all, a total of 64 witnesses were heard,
as well as a group of 150 addicts who were
interviewed en masse at Oakalla Prison Farm.
The witnesses included United States, British
and Canadian drug addiction experts, doctors,
psychiatrists, federal, provincial and municipal government officials and enforcement
officers, church and welfare organization representatives, addicts, and so-styled reformed
addicts, as well as many private citizens.
A large volume of mail in the form of
briefs, recommendations and letters of encouragement was also received. Briefs considered to be of general interest were
printed as appendices to the proceedings. I
doubt whether, when the time came to draft
our report, we could have obtained any
witnesses who could have given the committee any further evidence.
The committee's day-to-day proceedings
were printed in 15 parts, and authority has been obtained to print in blue book
form all the evidence and final recommendations. This blue book will remain, I believe,
for many years to come as a book of reference on the traffic in narcotic drugs in
Canada.
A word about the report itself, and also one
or two matters not so far touched on but

JUNE 28, 195
which I believe should be mentloned before
the report is adopted. May I say that I hope
ail honourable senators have read that report?
The chief recommendations are brleffy as
f allaws:
It is suggested that the provincial Government undertake treatment looking ta the
possible cure and rehabilitation of the drug
addicts who, corne under their jurisdiction,
and that the federal authorities in penitentiaries give consideration ta the segregation,
treatment and specialized training, looking ta
possible cure and rehabilitation, of ail crimmnal addicts sent ta penitentiaries.
Many views were expressed ta us, bath
in the press and by witnesses, and one of the
opinions most frequently presented, having
regard ta the great number of drug addicts
on the Pacific coast, was that the climate
may have something ta do with it. I do not
think that any members of the committeecertainly flot myself--were impressed with
the suggestion that the climate is the cause
of the cangregatian af drug addicts at the
coast; and in that regard I think it well ta
point out that the evidence given by Mr.
H. J. Anslinger, of the United States Bureau
of Narcatics, shows that the states of Washington, Oregon and California cantain fewer
drug addicts than, for instance, the cities of
New York and Chicago. As a matter of fact
the incidence of drug addiction In the city
of Seattle, immediately south of Vancouver,
also in Las Angeles and in San Francisco, is
very light. There are only two hundred criminal drug addlcts in the entire state of
Washington.
One ather statement frequently heard
throughout the investigation was, "Take the
profit out o! drugs and there will be na drug
problem."
Yaur committee recognized the importance
and significance of the suggestion and kept it
particularly in mind when making recammendations. After a careful analysis of ail the
évidence submitted, the cammittee recommend heavier minimum sentences for ail who
are caught seiling narcotic drugs, whether
these persans are drug addicts or nan-addicts;
and they are of the opinion that these offenders should be classified as traffickers and
given severe minimum sentences.
In recommending the establishment of a
spécial offence wlth a penalty of the utmast
severity for the illicit importation af narcotic
drugs, the committee feel that a severe penalty may act as an effective deterrent ta those
higher-ups who are engaged in this evîl trade.
A few witnesses-but only a few-advacated narcatic drug clinics where addicts
could ôbtain their supplies af drugs either at

nominal cost or under an arrangement similar
to the British system, and they endeavoured
ta boister Up their suggestion with the bare
statement that Great Britain has practically
no narcotic drug problem. Sa far as I know,
no mention has been made by these witnesses
of the fact that under the British system
narcotic drugs are nat given ta an addict ta
allaw him to continue his addiction as such,
as was advocated in British Columbia, especially by drug addicts themselves, wha naturally are in favaur of being provided with al
the narcotic drugs they require.
Before I pass ta the next point, may I draw
the attention of honourable senators generally, and in particular members of the cammittee, ta some information from Great
Britain which came ta my hand only this
marning. We feit when Mr. Walker, the
British representative, was with us that we
had flot heard ail the story about the handling
of narcatics in Britain. I hold in my hand an
article which appeared in The Sunday
Chronicle, a newspaper published in Manchester, fram which I will read only two
paragraphs:
Drug addicts entltled ta free cdope supplies are
flourlshing in the moat wlcked black market
Britain has ever known.
I have discovered in the nlght haunts of
London's Soho that because af blackmail and
fear af violence heroin supplied on National Health
prescriptions is being sold at £1 a pili.

Evidence received by aur cammittee
showed, I believe, that the same consequences
!ollowed when clinics were set up in the
United States; and !rom these statements
from Great Britain it wauld appear that drug
addicts are getting supplies from doctors and
selling them in illegitimate trade.
Should criticism arise about the tabiing a!
the final report during the present session o!
Parliament, it shauld be borne in mind first
that the committee heard ail the evidence it
was passible ta hear without repetitiaus utterances; secondiy, that the acute situation, in
Vancouver, alone, demands urgent, though
nevertheless careful investigation, looking tawards a prompt and speedy solution.
Just a word or twa regarding the cammittee itseif. I think every member of the
committee right at the start o! the inquiry
reallzed the magnitude. and the seriausness
of the problem we had been instructed ta
investigate. Later, as aur inquiry proceeded,
ail were agreed that a change should be
made in the treatment o! drug addicts and
that simply thrawing them into jail was no
solution of the problem. It was with this
thought in mmnd that the committee recommended humane treatmnent laakîng ta a
possible cure and rehabilitation of the drug

SENATE
addict. It is indeed gratifying therefore to
hear that the Honourable Mr. Bonner,
Attorney General of British Columbia, has
publicly stated he is ready and willing to
accept the committee's recommendation as
to treatment. Personally it is now my hope
and expectation that the federal Government, as soon as possible, will make all the
necessary changes to implement the recommendations made in the report, which we
believe to be their responsibility, including
not only imposing minimum sentences for
all drug traffickers, wherever found, but also
severe minimum sentences up to life for
those caught importing narcotic drugs.
As Chairman of the Special Committee I
would be remiss in my duty if I did not
express appreciation to all honourable senators who took an active part in the deliberations of our inquiry. Particularly am I
pleased-yes, and somewhat proud too, as
Chairman-of the splendid showing the
committee made not only in Vancouver, but
also in Montreal and Toronto. When it is
remembered that the committee sat a total
of 110 hours, and that out of 23 members
the average attendance was eleven members,
it should refute any statement made that all
the Senate does is to sit three days a week
for a short time each day.
It is my sincere hope also that what has
been accomplished by the members of the
Special Committee appointed to investigate
the narcotic drug problem may be an intimation to the Government to give more
inquiries of this nature to the Senate rather
than to set up so many Royal Commissions.
There is, I realize, a place for Royal Commissions, but, generally, speaking, senators
-and especially those who have served the
people in municipal, provincial or federal
governments-have more practical experience in public and national affairs and are
closer to the thinking of the people generally
than are many of the persons appointed to
Royal Commissions. I am not overlooking
the fact there are striking exceptions to this
statement.
Before moving the adoption of the report,
I want to thank again all the members of
the committee for the support they gave me
as their Chairman. It is my opinion that
they all enjoyed the work. I know I did.
Thanks to the keen interest taken by the
members and the co-operation given by
them, all our deliberations were fairly
harmonious.
Finally, on behalf of the committee I
want to thank those of the staff and others
who so ably assisted in all our deliberations.
Special mention should be made of the Clerk

of the Committee, Mr. John A. Hinds, whose
loyalty and services, particularly to myself,
were invaluable. Thanks should also go to
our able Counsel, Mr. A. H. Lieff, Q.C.,
whose indefatigable services rendered were
a great asset particularly to myself as chairman. The experienced and competent services rendered by Mr. Robert Curran, Legal
Adviser of the Department of National
Health and Welfare, should not be overlooked. The submission of his evidence
following a visit to the United States, particularly to Lexington, was an excellent and
worth-while contribution.
Finally, I want to thank Commissioner
C. W. Harvison, Director of Operations and
Criminal Investigations, Royal Canadian
Mounted Police. His untiring interest and
efforts on behalf of the committee while in
Vancouver were deeply appreciated by all
members.
Honourable senators, I move the adoption
of the report.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, as a member of the Narcotics Committee,
may I be allowed to congratulate the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid) upon his excellent report. We are
all proud of having had such a devoted and
clear-sighted chairman.
I wish to extend to the senator not only my
personal thanks, but also those of the addicts
who, tomorrow, will owe their rehabilitation
to the work of our committee as well as to the
co-operation of all parties concerned. Our
whole country is grateful to him. We not
only want to cure, but we wish more especially to prevent, so that Canada may become
stronger, morally, spiritually and physically.
(Text):
On behalf of the members of the Special
Committee on the Traffic in Narcotic Drugs,
I wish to compliment the honourable senator
from New Westminster upon the splendid
work he did as Chairman of our committee.
He has rendered a most useful service to
the people of Canada. The committee's report embodies, among other things, recommendations for the treatment of drug addicts
and for their general welfare. The work done
by the committee will also help to improve
the prosperity of the country, and will be of
benefit morally, spiritually and physically to
all Canadians.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, as
one of those who attended the committee
meetings in Vancouver I should like to say
something about the value to Canada of the
work done by the committee. I would also

JURE 28, 1955
like to refer to an editorial that appeared in
yesterday's edition of the Ottawa Citizen,
which criticized some of our comrnittee's recommendations, includîng the one that the
schools ignore the drug trafic. The editorial
urged that, although rejected by our committee, the idea of clinics where addicts could
get drugs cheaply under supervision and
withîn a rehabilitation programi should be
further investigated, and it suggested that
this would be an effective way to take the
profit out of the drug traffic.
Addicts interviewed by the cornmittee at
Oakalla Prison clairned that if they were
given a certain dosage they could performn
useful work. However, I tbink the present
systern of sending violators to j ails where
they cannot get drugs acts as a deterrent. If
the Government atternpted to set up a dlinic
or permitted doctors to give out dosages at a
nominal fee, where would the whole thing
end? What would deter young people frorn
acquiring the habit? Addicts themnselves told
us they neyer induce another person to take
drugs. On the other hand, we had very
direct evidence that it is chiefiy by association
with addicts that the habit is formed.
In any event, we learned that a number
of addicts are scattered throughout Canada.
For that reason, I feel that it rnight be worth
while for the federal Governrnent to consider
the establishment of an institution similar to
that in Lexington, Kentucky, with a large
acreage in nice surroundings, where livestock
In a great rnany cases,
could be kept.
apparently, husbands and wives both become
addicts. Such couples could live normal lives
and find something useful to do in an institution of the type I have in mind. Investigation
has sbown that many young addicts have
neyer done any useful type of work.
I notice that the committee's report states
that many addicts corne from broken bornes.
I objected when it was added that many
carne from a poor environmient, and no doubt
where the standard of living was very low.
Honourable senators, as I see it, the greater
number corne from homes where there is too
much idleness and where there is no useful
work to be done. I recail that some sixty
years ago a great number of boys frorn the
Barnardo's'Homes and similar institutions in
the Old Country, were taken into private
hornes up and down the Ottawa Valley on
both sides of the river. Some of them became
mayors and mernbers of parliament, wbile
others went to the west and became prornmnent in various communities. A woman who
appeared before our committee got very
beated over the whole subi ect, and said,
«What would you do with a fifteen year old

boy or girl who went astray?" Weil, I suggested the old woodshed and the strap. The
boys of whom I arn speaking, many of whorn
went on the f arm. and into lumber camps
when tbey were about thirteen years of age,
were flot idie for one minute. In spite of the
fact that they received no affection, not one
of themn that I heard of becarne an addict or
got into any trouble at ail. At least, they
were trained to work. I suggest that idieness iis one of the chief causes of drug addiction. The men I saw in Oakalla were
potentially fine looking men who sbould be
filling responsible positions.
So many of these young addicts-and I say
this for the benefit of boys and girls-are
too ready to blame the police for not getting
a break, and say that they are ready to
withdraw frorn the drug habit and work but
that the police notify their employers. They
have many other excuses to off er. In answer
to that, 1 say that, regardless of circumstances in the home or anywhere else, any
boy or girl with the spark within bimself or
herself can overcome the drug habit. It is
almost impossible for any governiment, provincial or federal to belp addicts unless they
themselves are determined to lead a different
type of life. I think of the old song that was
very popular at the turn of the century:
Whether you rise, or whether you f all,
As 1f e you are travelling through;
Whether you gather respect or gather contempt.
Ail will depend upon you.

I amn inclined to think that a person brought
up in poor circumstances bas an advantage
over one who had ail tbe comforts of life,
and that the poor man's son needs a better
personality in order to survive than the rich
man's son does. Perhaps the poor boy has
an easier task in rnaklng a success of life.
Many doctors and others appeared before
our cornmittee. I was interested in Magistrate
Orr, of Vancouver, wbo told us that in bis
experience alcoholismn was tbe cause of more
crime than drugs were. I thougbt that was
a startling staternent to make. He said that it
only takes a month or so to become a drug
addict but about three years to become an
alcoholic. Honourable senators, I tbink that
Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonyrnous
and similar associations are doing a very good
work and that every encouragement should
be given to them.
I do not thlnk there is anytblng further
I need say. It has been an interesting experience and a privilege for me to serve on
the comxnittee, and I arn sure that all who
served did so with a desire to help their
feilow-men. At tines I feel critical of people
who allow themselves to become addicted to

SENATE
drugs but perhaps one should not judge them.
However, I believe that there is hope for any
man or woman who has the spark and willingness to fight the habit. I believe it is
possible for any addict to cure himself, if
he desires to do so and is willing to work.
Of course, a change of environment is absolutely necessary in order that he can be
kept healthy and be given a fair chance to
fight this curse.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Howden, the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

JUDGES BILL
THIRD

READING~

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved the third
readîng of Bill 505, an Act to amend the

Judges Act, and the judicature provisions
of the Yukon Act and the Northwest Territories Act.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I offered somne opposition to this bill when
it was before the house for second reading.
I notice that in addition to increasing the
salaries of judges across the board it authorizes the appointment of judges for the Northwest Territories and the Yukon.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No; the bill amends
the Northwest Territories Act to provide a
judge for the Territorial Court. It also provides for the appointment of two additional
judges for British Columbia.
Hon. Mr. Horner: But one for the Yukon
Territory?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, there is a judge for the
Yukon now.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, there is a judge
for the Yukon now, and he is ex officio a
judge for the Northwest Territories. This
bill provides for a separate judge for the
Northwest Terrîtories.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Possîbly that provision
is needed and a saving of expense may be
effected on accounit of the long travelling
distances, to Aklavik, the Mackenzie District
delta, and other points which I imagine
would be served by the new appointee. So
possibly I would have no objection to that.
For the benefit of honourable senators who
were not present on second reading of this
bill and who perhaps were flot interested
in reading the debate, I want to repeat a
few remarks which I made then. I said that
I thought this was a particularly inopportune time to bring in a bill of this kind,
because I think we must face the fact that
if we are to continue to exist as an exporting
nation the time is coming, and may occur
before this year has ended, when lower wages
will have to be paid. I regret very much
that that may be so. According to the
Bureau of Statistics there has been a decline
in farmi income of seven per cent, and I
feel certain that there will be a further decline. The final payment to the producers
in Western Canada this year was a mere six
cents a bushel. It is because of the great
importance I attach to the feelings of the
ordinary people in the country that 1 think
this measure is unwise at the present time.
I also stated during the debate on second
reading that a bill of this kind might perhaps
be embarrassing to members of the legal profession, and I wondered whether they would
be able to take an unbiased view of such
a measure. On each and every occasion when
there is any discussion on a matter affecting

JUNE 2&, 195
judges every member of Parianient who is
a lawyer seems to feel it is his bounden duty
to corne to the aid of the judges. Now, to
my way of thinking that is not a sign of what
I would cail a robust democracy.
In the debate on second reading the hon
ourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon
Mr. Roebuck) spoke of the need for increased salaries to judges because of the
cost of living at the standard whicli they
are perhaps expected to maintain. In lis
remarks he suggested that living costs in
Blaine Lake were much lower than in
Toronto. May I tell him that we in Western
Canada no longer sleep in the liay nor live
in sod huts, and that the cost of living in
Blaine Lake at a standard which we as
human beings require is higher than in
Toronto.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: What about the cost of
rent in Blaine Lake?
Hon. Mr. Horner: The rent for a house in
Blaine Lake with services comparable to those
supplied in Toronto is higlier than in Toronto.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Then I arn glad I do not
live in Blaine Lake.
Hom. Mr. Horner: And what about the higlier
cost of automobiles in the west? As I say,
we do not sleep in the hay now, and if we
can help it we do not want to go back to tliat
level of living.
My honourable friend also suggested that
the farmers in Western Canada today are
well off. Amazing as it may seem, the fact
ia that some have done qulte well. But if my
friend would take the trouble to look up the
record of unpaid taxes on Prairie farms lie
would get a mucli more accurate picture. We
have just corne tlirougli one year of partial
crop failure, and now we are headed for
another.
I say to lionourable senators that we must
neyer lose siglit of the process tlirough whicli
the Western fanmer must go in lis attempt
to make ends meet. Farming ta that section of
the country is not as it is in Ontario, where
the fanmer lias a continuing revenue from
grazing stock and other sources. For instance,
eacli year haif of our land is not seeded but is
kept in wliat we caîl a "blacked" state, ta an
effort to conserve the moisture that we need
for tlie next year's crop. To do this in a
ralny season may cost the farmer $8 per
acre, and lie receives absolutely no return
from that land. And if it happens that lie
lias a crop failure the year after that in wlidh
the land was "blacked". lie lias lost the use
of it for two years. ln Western Canada we
are going to considerable expense ta building higli schools. As a resuit taxes have
increased to the point where ta xnany areas

tlie rate is now $1 an acre. When one thinks
back to the days when ta tliat great section
of the country the land with ail its fertility
was sold for $1 an acre, one realizes liow very
higli this tax is.
Han. Mr. Roebuck: But wliat is tlie land
wortli today?
Hon. Mr. Horner: I answer my friend by
asking him what will it be worth if we get a
few dry years and the top soul blows away?
Hon. My. ]Roebuck: Certainly tlie land is
wortli more than $1 an acre today.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Some of it is, but if tlie
fertillty blows out of it, it may not be worth
that mucli.
My point is that if a farmer lias to pay a
tax rate of $1 an acre, or perliaps even $2,
lie soon finds himself in tlie position of buying
lis land the second Urne. I would rem.ind
my frîend tliat while Marilyn Bell, a resident
of Ontario, swam across Lake Ontario, it does
not follow that ahl Ontanions can do so. Likewise, while it is true that a few Western
farmers have managed to carry on tlieir
operations so successfully that tliey have
made some profit for themselves and liave
even paid income tax, by and large that is
not the position of Western farmers today.
However, in discussing the measure before
the house, we must flot forget that judges are
human beings and are entitled to some of the
good things of life. In a dispatch from
Quebec, in the morntag press comment was
made on the fact thnt tlie colleges ta tliat
province are turning out tliree times as
many lawyers as geologists. In spite of the
fact that the greater need is for geologists to
develop the country and industry, the colieges
are graduating lawyers in abundance. And
I might say that all Canadian universities are
doing tlie saine thing. Tlie lionourable senator from Toronto-Trinity said that many
young lawyers in Ontario have incomes of
$10,500 a year. Well, I would like lia to
show me the young man wlio, unless lie is in
some particularly fortunate circumstance, is
earning $1,000 a year in the practice of law.
There is certainly no young man in Western
Canada doing tliat. There are many of tliem
quite able lawyers, wlio, if they do not have
some sort of a aide-line, sucli as real estate,
cannot make a living practising law.
We have heard a lot of argument to tlie
effect that it will be impossible to find suitable men for appointment to the Bencli unless
the iudges' salaries are raised. To my mmnd,
tliat simply is not a fact. And even if the
salaries are increased there will still be
judges who make mistakes, just as tliere
always have been. They are only huinan.

SENATE
As a result of their mistakes there will be
many appeals and costly litigation. An outstanding appeal that I might mention was the
one that was taken to the Privy Council from
a Supreme Court judgment which ruled that
women were not persons within the meaning
of a section of the British North America
Act. Well, if the judges' salaries are increased judgments will still be reversed, just
as that one was.
Honourable senators, so far as the Senate is
concerned I think that the present is an excellent occasion on which to demonstrate our
independence. There was some boasting in
this chamber not long ago about who were
the great independents here. I think this is
a wonderful opportunity for them to demonstrate their independence in what I consider
to be a first-class cause.
The honourable senator from TorontoTrinity told us that the Minister of Finance
predicted Canada would have a larger national
production this year than at any time in her
history. I only hope that he is not entirely
too optimistic, but I am afraid that he is.
The newspapers this morning carried a dispatch to the effect that 800 textile workers
are meeting for the purpose of considering
a proposed reduction in wages in order to
enable their industry to carry on. I want to
draw attention to what I consider was a very
strange remark by the honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity, that the textile industry should be let go to the wall, that it does
not belong to this countryHon. Mr. Roebuck: I did not use that
phrase.
Hon. Mr. Horner: You said the textile
industry was not indigenous to this country.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Horner: All right. Then why not
go on and say that because we have to keep
our cattle in the barn during the winter,
when snow is on the ground, we should
import our beef cattle from Argentine, New
Zealand and Australia? A similar case could
be made out in favour of importation of
butter. And what about nylon and rayon?
We have a surplus of wood pulp in this
country, but the honourable senator might
go so far as to state that Canada should not
be producing these materials either.
Honourable senators, as I see it a serious
problem that we are facing today is the high
cost of labour in the various articles that we
manufacture. We have raw materials in
abundance, but, as I said earlier, the cost of
labour is a matter that this country is going
to have to deal with if we are to continue to
sell our products abroad.

An Hon. Senator: Are you in favour of
free trade?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Surely I am in favour of
free trade.
The press today contains an article by a
professor pointing out the devious methods
that this Government is applying, through
the application of dumping regulations and so
on, which have the effect of a tariff, and he
said that the Government should come out
frankly and call it a tariff for protection purposes. He is complaining on that score.
Let me repeat: in view of the economic
situation that we are facing today-and I
emphasize that the situation is becoming
increasingly difficult for farmers-I think this
is a very inopportune time to bring this legislation forward. I therefore wish to move
an amendment in the following words:
That Bill 505 be not read a third time this day,
but this day six months.

In moving that amendment, honourable
senators, I have done my duty as I see it.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Is there a
seconder for the amendment?
Hon. Mr. Horner:

Is that necessary?

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Yes.
As there is no seconder, I declare the
amendment out of order.
Honourable senators, the question is on the
motion for third reading of Bill 505, an Act
to amend the Judges Act, and the judicature
provisions of the Yukon Act and the Northwest Territories Act. Is it your pleasure to
adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Horner: On division.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I
do not think any reply is necessary when the
honourable gentleman cannot find a seconder,
but I rise to compliment him. I did so when
this same bill was before us on a previous
occasion. I said then and I say now that it is
difficult to oppose public expenditures and
very easy to be generous with other people's
money. The honourable gentleman has taken
the stand that he believes to be sound, but
with which all the rest of us disagree, and I
compliment him.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I am not so sure whether
you all do disagree.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not compliment
him, however, on the remarks he has made
about those who have favoured this bill,
imputing motives of cowardice or self-interest
or something of that kind because we of the
legal profession, who know something about
the matter, have advocated the payment of
these increased salaries. He suggests that

JUNE 29, 1955

uur action is not robust democracy. He seems to pay a decent salary to the men who are
to think that when he, as a farmer, advocates
the cause of the farmers, that is robust democracy. Then why should it be otherwise
when the profession of which one knows
something happens to be the law? I do not
congratulate him on his reasoning in this
matter, nor for calling into question the
bona fßdes of those of the legal profession
who have expressed themselves and who will
vote in favour of this bill. Neither do I agree
with his statement that, because of competition from abroad, we are pricing ourselves out
of the international market through high
wages.
Hon. Mr. Horner: It is so.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My friend says it is so.
Well, one can imagine wages so high that it
would be difficult for us to sell some of our
products. But this is a country with a high
standard of living, not only for those who
earn wages but for those who run farms.
There are no other farmers in the world
whose standard of living is as high as that of
the Canadian farmers. Far be it from me to say
that that standard should be reduced to enable them to compete more effectively in
foreign markets. As a matter of fact we have
been very successful in meeting competition
in days gone by. The honourable senator
talks about high wages, but for some reasonand I have noticed this on a number of
occasions-he never speaks about high land
values, although there bas been a quiet admission that some Western lands for which the
farmers once paid a dollar an acre are not
selling for any such low figure today. Indeed,
one notes all over Canada increases in land
values which, particularly around the great
cities, have reached fantastic figures. If any
restrictions are necessary to enable us to compete more effectively it is in the direction of
land values, not in wages, that the first reduction should take place.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Tut, tut.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My friend says "Tut,
tut". I suppose he regards it as robust
democracy to be on the side of the land speculator and the land hog, not on the side of the
worker who earns wages. My thought is that
the first thing we should do is investigate
the exorbitant prices, of which I could give
many examples, charged for the mere privilege of doing something, rather than attempt
a reduction of the wages of those who do do
something.
I predict that we shall carry this bill almost unanimously, and that there is no justifiable imputation against anybody who votes

doing a most important job in our communities.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
among the many things of which the people
of Great Britain and Canada can be rightly
proud, is the very high character of their
Judiciary. No country in the world can boast
of judges who hold a higher place in the estimation of their people. In Canada we should
endeavour to maintain the dignity of
our Judiciary; Canadian citizens, in every
walk of life, entrust their lives, their properties, their liberties to the keeping of the
men who are called to the Bench. Canadians
will be a free, a democratic and a happy
people only as long as they may look up
with pride to their judges; only as long as
these judges continue to discharge their duties
as honourably and conscientiously as they
have done in the past, and are doing now.
Members of our Judiciary are selected from
members of the Bar who possess the best professional qualifications. To begin with,. they
must have been actively engaged in the practice of law for at least ten years. They
are chosen by the Minister of Justicean executive who, at all times since Confederation, has been an eminent jurist-who
exercises a wise discretion in the selection
of the men who are called to the Bench.
How could we expect eminent lawyers
to accept appointment to the Bench unless
they are assured, not of adequate or
complete compensation, but at least of
reasonable compensation for what they
have to give up? It would be most unfortunate for us all if the choice of appointees had
to be limited to men who are unable to make
a living in their profession and who seek
judgeship. Let us give the Minister a free
hand to select judges from among men who
have made a success of their professional
practice, men who would make a financial
sacrifice if they accepted appointment. This
proposed increase in the salaries of judges
looms large only in the eyes of those who do
not stop to consider the question under all
its aspects. For instance, how much of the
$2,500 increase would remain in the hands
of the judge and how much would go back
to the Crown? The Crown gives with one
hand and takes back with the other. High
Court judges are now receiving $14,400; if
this bill is passed, they will get $16,900, and
that would put them into a higher income tax
bracket.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: About one-third of their
entire salary goes in taxation.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Let us consider what an
ordinary man, who is industrious and sober,
can make in his trade or commerce or chosen

SENATE
profession, by contrast with the eleven or
twelve thousand dollars net which is left to
the judge. We do not expect a judge to live
as a pauper; we expect him to maintain his
family and himself on a dignified level. He
cannot live in the slums, nor can he dress
shabbily. Furthermore, a man is usually called
to the Bench at a time in life when his
children, if be bas any, are attending universities or other expensive institutions of
education. A judge has to incur certain necessary expenses and bas to maintain a fairly
high standard of living. I daresay that all
reasonable citizens, when considering the
net salary left to a judge after he bas paid
his income taxes, will applaud us for having
voted this measure. Indeed, many will deplore
that compensation to judges will not be
higher than that fixed by this bill.
Honourable senators, I believe this measure
will help to keep our Judiciary at its present
high standard and, for that reason, I shall
very gladly vote for it.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed, on
division.
INTERNATIONAL RIVER IMPROVEMENTS
BILL
THIRD

READING

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald moved the third
reading of Bill 3, an Act respecting the construction, operation and maintenance of international river improvements.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
CANADA ELECTIONS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. William H. Golding moved the second
reading of Bill 415, an Act to amend the
Canada Elections Act.
He said: Honourable senators, in moving
the second reading of Bill 415, an Act to
amend the Canada Elections Act, I should
give the house something of its background
and a few of the reasons why it is before us
at this time.
I may say that on February 25 last reference
was made by the House of Commons to their
Standing Committee on Privileges and Elections, as follows:
That the Standing Committee on Privileges and
Elections be instructed to study the several amendments to the Canada Elections Act, and amendments thereto, suggested by the Chief Electoral
Officer, to study the said act, to suggest to the
house such amendments as the committee may
deem advisable and that the committee be also
empowered to inquire into the different methods of
effecting the adjustment of representation;

It will be noticed that this is a doublebarrel reference, the first part authorizing
the study of amendments to the Canada
Elections Act, and the second part empowering the committee to inquire into different
methods of effecting the adjustment of representation. I shall have something to say
about this later on.
The committee held its first meeting on
Tuesday, March 8, having before it on that
date certain amendments proposed by the
Department of the Secretary of State, the

Chief Electoral Officer and some twenty-nine
individuals and groups, including two judges.
All these people had evidently taken sufficient interest in this problem to write to the
committee offering suggested amendments to
our Elections Act. It is surely a healthy
sign to have so many of our citizens interested in legislation of this kind. I am
sure the committee deeply appreciated having
their recommendations, for they must have
been a great help in reaching the conclusions
on the task which had been assigned to the
committee.
Honourable senators will find a complete
list of these recommendations and the names
of those making them in the No. 1 copy of
the committees Minutes of Proceedings and
Evidence, dated March 8, 1955. I have here
a list of the names and I believe they should
be put in our records. I feel that those who
have shown such interest in the Elections
Act should be recognized in the Senate's
records as well as in those of the Standing
Committee on Privileges and Elections of
the other place. Therefore, with leave of
the Senate, I would ask that this list be
placed on Hansard.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Has the honourable senator the unanimous consent of the
house to have this list placed on Hansard?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The list is as follows:
1. Jean-François Pouliot, M.P., Rivière-du-Loup,

Hon. Mr. Golding: The Standing Committee
on Privileges and Elections held a number of
meetings-I believe twelve, to be exact-and
a perusal of the Minutes clearly indicates
they gave careful detailed study to the subject matter assigned to them. I have read
these Minutes, and as far as I am concerned
they show that the committee did an excellent job.
On April 29 the committee submitted their
second report, which included a draft bill.
That draft bill embodied the conclusions
reached by the committee, as the present
bill does.
While the committee reported their conclusions so far as the first phase of their
reference was concerned, that of making
amendments to our Elections Act, they felt
that they had neither the time nor the
factual data to deal with the second phase
of their reference, namely, to inquire into
the different methods of effecting the adjustment of representations. They requested that
this part of their inquiry should be left over
for another session and this has been done.
Therefore, the present bill deals with amendments made to the Elections Act by the
committee and approved by the House of
Commons after long and careful study.
This bill deals with the position of the
Chief Electoral Officer. He will now be given
the full status of a deputy minister, and his
remuneration will be increased from his
present salary of $12,000 to $13,500.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is that Mr. Castonguay?
Hon. Mr. Golding: Yes. I believe this
change has general approval, for in reading
the discussions on this problem it is a great
source of satisfaction to find so many members
from the different political parties speaking
so highly of the ability and the efficiency of
the Chief Electoral Officer.
While this bill does seem to be quite
lengthy, I am sure if we analyse it carefully
we will find it is not a controversial bill at
50437-47J

all. It simply makes amendments to keep
pace with changing times, and, of course, to
meet the request of the department and the
Chief Electoral Officer, who finds in the
operation of the act that some amendments
are really necessary.
While some of the proposed changes are
important, for the most part they are technical and remedial.
When the act was being studied by the
Standing Committee on Privileges and Elections, the committee agreed to extend the
time for nomination day to 21 days before
the date of an election, instead of the present 14 days, in all districts other than those
listed in Schedule 4 of the Elections Act.
The districts in Schedule 4 are as follows:Ontario: Cochrane, Kenora-Rainy River, and
Port Arthur.
Quebec: Chapleau and Saguenay.
Newfoundland:
Bonavista - Twillingate,
Burin-Burgeo, Grand Falls-White Bay, Humber-St. George's and Trinity-Conception.
Manitoba: Churchill.
Saskatchewan: Mackenzie, Meadow Lake,
Melfort, and Prince Albert.
Alberta: Athabaska, Jasper-Edson, and
Peace River.
British Columbia: Cariboo and Skeena.
Yukon and Northwest Territories: YukonMackenzie River.
In the districts I have just named under
Schedule 4, the time for nomination day will
remain as it is, namely, 28 days before the
day of election.
When this bill was considered by the Committee of the Whole in the House of Commons,
the change which had been made by the
Standing Committee on Privileges and Elections to have nomination day 21 days before
the election day was not favourably received.
In fact, members from all parties in the
house indicated their opposition to such a
change. As a result of this opposition, amendments were made to the draft bill resulting
in the date for nomination being left as it
was, namely, 14 days before the day of the
election. This met with general approval
by the Committee of the Whole. That simply
means that the amendment made in the
Standing Committee on Privileges and Elections has been eliminated and is not in the
bill at all.
Under this bill it will be permissible for
a candidate to spend $2,000 on personal
expenses, instead of $1,000 as under our
present legislation. There was no opposition
to this amendment, as I believe all members
fully realize how the costs of elections have
gone up. The use of radio, television and
other modern appliances has sent the costs to.
candidates very high.

SENATE
The bill provides that the wife of a serviceman will be entitled to vote if she is living
abroad with her husband where he is
stationed.
The bill reduces from eight to two days
before an election the period in which a
person is not permitted to supply, display, or
wear badges, ribbons, flags, etc., indicating
which party or candidate he is supporting.
There are many amendments, technical,
remedial and consequential, all of which are
intended to improve the situation for the
electors, the Department of the Secretary of
State and our Chief Electoral Officer.
Honourable senators, I would like to
emphasize this point: the bill as finally passed
by the other place, and as it now stands, met
with the general approval of the members.
I therefore recommend that the Senate adopt
the bill as it is. After all, it is the members
of the other house who are affected.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Golding: We in the Senate are
not affected by the bill. The members of
the other house reached agreement on the bill
as it now stands, and I think we should accept
it as it is, and give it second and third
readings.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Were any of the parties
favourable to it?
Hon. Mr. Golding: The matter was discussed, but it was not pressed. That feature
is not embodied in the bill at all.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall the bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Golding: Next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
may I be permitted to congratulate the bonourable senator from Huron-Perth (Hon. Mr.
Golding) on his admirable explanation of
this bill, and to say that I agree that it is
unnecessary to refer the bill to a committee
of this bouse, since it bas been thoroughly
studied by a committee of the other house.
I understand that it will be placed on the
Order Paper for third reading next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Next sitting.

opium spree, sober and agonizingly sorry for
it, and bitterly resentful mentally. Small
wonder that they immediately seek and find
a further supply of the drug, and by peddling,
theft and worse means the vicious circle
goes on.
Some time after the beginning of the
present session of Parliament the honourable
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) discussed the matter very freely and
well on the floor of the Senate, for which
the members of the Senate and addicts and
society at large owe him a debt of gratitude.
As an outcome of his speech the Senate
decided to investigate the whole matter, and
a committee was appointed for that purpose.
We sought and received testimony from
many well-informed witnesses. They were
by no means in universal agreement. Among
our early witnesses were the Chief Constables of Vancouver and Edmonton, who
testified as to the very deep and difficult
nature of the problem. They were of much
the same opinion, namely, that addicts should
be apprehended, isolated and the drug withdrawn; that they should be treated intelligently and not unkindly, and not released
until there seemed to be little doubt of their
being cured temporarily at least; that if and
when they broke down again they must be
returned to the hospital, treated again, and
receive good food and proper exercise, and
so on, until they were finally returned to
health and wellbeing.
While we were at Vancouver we were surprised to hear some quite prominent people
suggest that addicts should be supplied with
the drug at no expense from "service stations". This they claimed would freeze out
the trafficker, and so overcome the chief
source of the trouble. We just could not belleve
their claim, and we soon learned that whereever free drugs had been supplied the evil
worsened by leaps and bounds. So we discarded the suggestion. After obtaining and
sifting much evidence, we were bound to
decide that the only course was to confine the
addicts in an isolated institution where they
could have no contact with the outside world,
and where their habit could be cured and
their health restored under intelligent kindly
treatment.
Can this be done? Yes, indeed it can. Such
a program is proceeding continuously in the
United States, at the Public Health Service
Centre of the National Institute of Mental
Health, at Lexington, Kentucky, under Dr.
Harris Isbell as director. He has been in
public health service for twenty years, and
for the last eleven of those years he has
been in charge of this centre.

Now, honourable senators, what we learned
from Dr. Isbell is really the meat of the
whole situation. When he commenced his
work at Lexington fifteen years ago there
were approximately 200,000 addicts in the
United States of America, and now, by the
best official figures, there are only 60,000. Dr.
Isbell is a psychiatrist or research scientist.
He knows all the answers and gives them
freely. He acts on straight lines and does
nothing by guesswork. He bas restored to
health hundreds of addicts and sent them
back into lives of useful activity. He spent
a whole morning with us in going over his
work, and although he was asked many
annoying questions he paused to answer them
all without exception and to thresh them out
with us. He believes in isolation absolutely,
but did not think so much of the island idea.
Here is a method, the only watertight
method submitted that has proven Its worth.
When asked by our legal adviser if he would
favour our launching such a program as his,
Dr. Isbell said he was much in accord with
the idea. We do not have such a great number of addicts-about 3,000 odd-but enough
to cause concern. For me, I believe the way
bas been pointed out and that it is up to
us to follow.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, before the question is put for adoption
of the report, I should like to take this opportunity of commending the Chairman (Hon.
Mr. Reid) and the members of the Special
Committee for their industry and thoroughness in conducting the various phases of this
important inquiry. I think it is most gratifying to know that senators of their own free
will and accord will give of their time and
ability to inquire into a question of this kind.
It will be recalled that during the Easter
recess members of this committee voluntarily
gave up part of their holiday to hold meetings
of the committee for one week in the city of
Vancouver. I think that in itself speaks very
highly of the spirit in which the committee's
work was undertaken and carried through,
and it reflects credit upon not only the commitee but the Senate as a whole.
On behalf of those of us who were not on
the committee I wish to express grateful
appreciation of what the Chairman and members have done in the rendering of splendid
service to our country.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

I was pleased that the honourable senator

turned down the suggestion that free drugs

know why the idea of giving free drugs to
addicts stîli persists. To my mind you might
just as well gîve one or two botties of whisky

suggesting that elinics for this purpose should
be tried out, I wish to say that if they will, look
over the evidence they will find that out of 13
doctors, including Dr. Isbell, one of the great
authorities on drug add.iction on the North
American continent, only two advocated
establishing such clinics. I ask you, were il

experienced medical men wrong and two
lone doctors correct? I hope that this inf ormation will be made known to the public,
especîally to those who are toying wîth the
idea that such clinics would lead to cures. In
my opinion, which is based on the evidence,
they know flot whereof they speak. In our
report we have spoken not from aur own
knowledge, and flot from our own experience,
but from the wealth of evidence that was

APPENDIX
REPORT 0F JOINT COMMITTEE ON CAPITAL AND CORPORAL PUNISHMENT
AND LOTTERIES
(Presented by Hon. Mr. Mcflonald. See p. 734.)

The Special Joint Committee of the Senate
and the House of Commons on Capital and
Corporal Punishment and Lotteries begs leave
to present the following as its second report.
Establishment of Committee.
On January 14, 1955, the House of Comnmons resolved to establish a joint committee
in effcct to resume the studies and continue
the inquiries initiated by the corresponding
Joint Committee at the previous session of
Parliament. On January 26, 1955, the House
of Coinmons appointed its membership to the
committee.
On January 25, 1955, the Senate united with
the I-lYuse of Commons in the establishment
of the committee and on February 1, 1955,
appointed its membership.

Senator Tremblay was appointed to the committee in substitution for the Honourable
Senator J3ouffard).
The House of Commons (17): Miss Bennett, Messrs. Boisvert, Brown (Brantford),
Brown (Essex West), Cameron (High Park),
Fairey, Garson, Leduc (Verdun), Lusby,
Mitchell (London), Montgomery, Murphy
(Westmorland), Shaw, Mrs. Shipley, Messrs.
Thatcher, Valois, and Winch. (On February
21, 1955, Mr. Johnston (Bow River), was
appointed to the committee in substitution
for Mr. Shaw, and on March 22, 1955, Mr.
Thomas was appointed to the committee in
substitution for Mr. Johnston (Bow River)).

Sources of Evidence.
During the course of the inquiries by this
and last session's committees, evidence was
obtained on ail three subi ects from the sources
listed in an Appendix to your Committee's
Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence, No. 21.
In addition, miscellaneous representations on
ail three subjects were received from many
individuais and organizations in the form of
letters, resolutions, petitions and brief s which
were examined and analyzed, along with
other reference materiai obtained through
research, for the best possible evidence and
for further sources of information.
Your commîttee very much appreciated this

enquiries may have been overlooked or
minimized.

session printed evidence from 40 individuals

Approach to and Method of Ineqjdry.
Your committee and its predecessor recognized early in their proceedings that public
opinion was a major factor to be considered
in deciding the three issues of capital punishment, corporal punishment and lotteries. It
was f elt that an extensive and fair coverage
of the work of this committee by news
agencies would lead to a better informed
public opinion and would assist your committee in its approacli to its inquiries. The
numerous editorials, articles, and broadcasts
during the past two years are evidence of the
co-operation received. These agencies also
assisted immeasurably in bringing to the
attention of the public and organized bodies
the committee's desire to obtain their views.
The preceding committee had given consideration to the possibility of completing the
hearings of evidence on one subi ect before
proceeding to the niext or at least limiting

50437-48

each hearing to one subi ect. However, some
witnesses wished to give evidence on ail three
subi ects and others had difficulty in findîng
time to appear and, accordingly, it was
decided to hear evidence in an order'that
would meet the convenience of witnesses.
Your committee also had considered
obtaining authority to hold hearings across
Canada and to, visit certain institutions.
However, the information required was
obtained from witnesses who appeared voluntarily and from selected experts called by
the committee thereby making it unnecessary
to travel beyond the seat of government.
Appreciation of Assistance.
The committee wishes to, record its gratitude to those individuals, organizations,
agencies and departments of the federal and
provincial governments that made oral or
written representations or in other ways
assisted your committee in its inquiries. In
respect to its legal and secretarial assistance,
the committee was very fortunate that these
duties were again performed by the counsel
and clerk who so capably and energetically
served last year's committee.
Interim Recommendations.
The evidence for both sessions lias been
completely summarized but, because of lack
of time, your committee lias not been able to
prepare a comprehensive final report formulating conclusions and making recommendations relating to the many aspects involved in
ail three questions of capital punishment,
corporal punishment, and lotteries.
Your committee accordingly recommends
that another joint committee be established
early in the next session of Parliament, with
the same powers and membership, to complete a final report on the three questions of
capital and corporal punishment and lotteries.
A copy of the comimittee's Minutes of
Proceedings and Evidence taken at this session is appended, together with the Minutes
of Proceedingsand Evidence of last session's
corresponding committee which were referred
to your committee.
Ail of which is respectfully submitted.
Salter A. Hayden,
Joint Chairman.

The report was read by the Clerk Assistant

The Standing Committee on Natural Resources,
to whom was referred the Bill (481) intituled:
"An Act to amend the Prairie Farm Assistance
Act", have in obedience to the order of reference
of June 28, 1955, examined the said bill and now
beg leave to report the same with the following
amendments:
1. Page 2, line 11: strike out "of sections"
2. Page 2, line 19: strike out "of sections"
3. Page 2, line 28: strike out "of sections"
4. Page 2, line 30: strike out "of sections".

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall these amendments be
taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Now.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: I move that the
amendments be concurred in now.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable members, I
want to say a word or two for the benefit of
those who are not on the committee. The
amendments were made at the request of the
Government, because the bill as it came to us
from the House of Commons included references to river lots, and to make the wording clear it was necessary to strike out the
words "of sections."
These amendments
which we are now considering will not change
the bill in any material way at all. As
honourable senators know, the bill provides,
among other things, for the granting of assistance to farmers of Western Canada whose
crops were damaged or lost in the recent
spring floods. I have had a great many letters
from people who suffered from floods, and I
should like to see them receive some assistance as soon as possible. As the bill has
been amended in this bouse, it will be necessary for it to go back to the other house in
order that the amendments may be concurred
in there. It is for that reason, honourable
senators, that I support the motion that the
amendments be concurred in now.
The motion was agreed to and the amendments were concurred in.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall this bill, as amended,
be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Honourable senators,
I move third reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill, as
amended, was read the third time, and
passed.

I move that when the Senate adjourns today

That the name of the Honourable Senator

That a message be sent to the House of Commons to inform that house accordingly.

The motion was agreed to.

ELECTIONS BILL

THIRD READING

Hon. William H. Golding moved the third

Canada Elections Act.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

CRIMINAL CODE (RACE MEETINGS) BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck moved the second
reading of .Bill 504, an Act to amend the
Criminal Code (Race Meetings).
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
very simple matter and not a particularly
consequential one. As honourable senators
know, betting and gaming and so on are
prohibited by the Code; but there are certain
exceptions, among which is betting on horse
races, under certain conditions. I am not
going to defend it or attack it. There are
good reasons, no doubt, for the exception.
For instance, a very large number of good
people enjoy watching the ponies run and
most of them seem to like-I say this because
of the numbers who take part in it-placing
a little bet on the side. So far as can be
seen, no very great harm seems to have
come to our community as a result of that.
However, whatever the reasons may be, we
are not concerned with them now, but we
are concerned with two little points having
to do with the administration of this exception. I have in my hand a copy of the Criminal Code, and I direct attention to section
178, subsection (1),(d),(ii), which says:

running races and a certain number of
harness races, rather than have one or the
other exclusively. So this amendment adds
to the category, two dashes and four heat
races of two heats each, which is ten starts.
The bill does not add to the number of
starts. I do not see how any possible objection can be taken to this amendment, and
none has been, so far.
The only other amendment, which is perhaps a little more important but, I think,
no more objectionable, is to subsection (3)
of section 178 of the Code. This subsection
now states:
No pari-mutuel system of betting shall be used
upon any race course unless the system has been
approved by and its operation is carried on under
the supervision, at the expense of the association,
of an officer appointed by the Minister of Agriculture, whose duty it shall be to stop the betting
before each race and to see that no further amounts
are deposited . . .

Under this provision, the Department of
Agriculture bas for many years supervised
the accounting of the races and bas seen to
it that so far as possible the system is regularly and honestly carried on. The cost
involved under the present act, it will be
noticed, is borne by the association. It bas
been usual to send two officers to each race
meeting, certainly to al big meetings, and
the charge has been $27 for each officer.
That charge, which is the same in respect
of the largest and smallest meetings alike,
has been a burden to the smaller tracks.
Some of them do not make much more than
the cost to the association for the supervision
charges of the dominion Government. As a
consequence, there have been protests. In
no more than eight races or dashes, or four

expression "eight races or dashes". That is system has been suggested, and this is proto say, races may be of two kinds; they may vided for in the bill. Instead of a flat charge

I would point out that it is the provinces

which make money out of racing, not the
dominion government, although Parliament
carries the legislative responsibility.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Has the honourable
senator any information as to the "take" of

the various provinces?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I have the percentages
which the provinces levied on the race meetings held within their respective provincial
jurisdictions. They are as follows:
Quebec ......................
Prince Edward Island ........
Ontario .......................
M anitoba .....................

51 per cent

5 per cent
7 per cent
10 per cent

................

5 per cent

Alberta .......................
British Columbia ............

5 per cent
12 per cent

Saskatchewan

It can be seen that some of the provinces
are doing pretty well.
The next point which I think is of interest is the cost of the work of supervision to
the Department of Agriculture. This work is
both extensive and important, for we are all

interested in the common honesty of every
big institution of this kind and we do not
want a bad reputation to be made anywhere.
Everybody has complete confidence in the
way the supervision is carried on under
supervision of the dominion Government; and
therefore even the larger tracks are in favour
of this change, although it means that they
will

pay

more

revenue

into

the

federal

treasury.
The charge of $27 per day does not pay
the cost of the supervision even at the big
tracks. It has been estimated that at least $40
per day per man would be required, and that
even that rate would pay for only supervision such as is now being given. The Minister of Agriculture estimated that in 1954
the charges for the particular division carrying the work, together with administrative
costs, ran as high as $257,000. The amount

actually collected was very much less. The

total revenue for 1954, on a basis cf $27 per

per man engaged, was only $52,210.50.
Fifty men are connected with this eperation
ail across Canada. They are not fuil-time employees, but are engaged only while race
meetings are in progress. It 15 necessary that
be thoroughiy trained ti their duties,
nd last year a class was held in the WestI think at Calgary-for this purpose. Se far,
mest of the werk has heen done by the Royal
Canadian Meunted Police. I am told that if
there was complete supervision and the men

were properly trained, the training alene
would cest as much as the entire revenue now
derived trom these tracks. The charge as to
aks the particular
ef
cst shown on the b
division is nly $53,000-just a litte more
than the revenue-but it includes, only the
amount of the salaries paid to the men doing
the work, and does not take into account
the cost of administration.
As shown by the statement I placed on
Hansard, one half of one per cent on the
amount wagered in 1954-$84 million-will
give the department a revenue of $420,000,
which is a good deal more than the actual cost
this year, but it will not be much higher
than the actual cost when complete and
proper supervision is given to all tracks, large
and small, throughout Canada.
I see no possible objection to the measure,
because there is no real change in principle.
In future, those who enjoy the protection of
the supervision will pay the cost, but it will
be on a fairer basis, and the regularity with
which this work is carried on all over the
province will improve the situation generally.

In conclusion, may I say that although
some people may object to the method of
financing, running races have a real value
to the country, for the race track produces
light horses, with the result that a large
number of high-class horses are available
as sires throughout the entire dominion.
These sires have no doubt greatly improved
the quality of light horses needed particularly
for farms. The farm horse of today is a
light horse, not a heavy horse-the heavy
work being done by tractors.

Honourable senators, I bespeak the support of this house for this measure.

Hon. Mr. Burchill: Honourable senators, the
honourable member from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck), as I understood him,
described dashes as running races, and heat
races as harness races. I do not think the
legislation
was
designed
to distinguish
between running races and harness races. In
modern practice we have got away from the
old style of three heats, or the best three in
five, in a harness race. Except in special

JUNE 30, 1955
cases, nearly all races are known as dashes,
whether they are harness or running races.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My friend may be much
more familiar with racing than I am. When
the Minister of Agriculture spoke on this
matter he confessed that be knew very little
about it, and I must confess the same. However, I certainly was under the impressionand I got the information from very good
sources-that what was meant in the bill
by dashes was running races. I may be
wrong, and I accept correction if my friend
is sure ofHon. Mr. Burchill: I am not sure, but - I
know that today harness racing is designated
as dashes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am unable to make a
definite statement on the point.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall this bill be read the
third time?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Next sitting.
FISHERIES IMPROVEMENT LOANS BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. John J. Kinley moved the second
reading of Bill 452, an Act respecting loans
to assist fishermen engaged in a primary
fishing enterprise.
He said: Honourable senators, Bill 452, an
Act respecting loans to assist fishermen engaged in a primary fishing enterprise, comes
to us from the Commons, and its short title
is the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act. The
purpose of the bill is to increase the availability of intermediate credit to bona ßlde
fishermen in a primary fishery enterprise. A
bona fide fisherman is described as one whose
principal occupation is participation in a
primary fishing industry. This bill is fashioned
after the Farm Improvement Loans Act. In
speaking about the bill, on the resolution in
the Commons, the Minister of Fisheries said
that in the four years when he was the
Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of
Finance he twice sponsored the Farm Improvement Loans Act in that house. The
act did not become very well known for
some time, and in the first year only $3
million was lent under it, but in recent
years the amount lent annually has been
almost $100 million. He was impressed by
the usefulness of the legislation, and when
he became Minister of Fisheries he thought
it would be a good idea to have similar legislation passed in order to enable fishermen to

get the same type of intermediate credit from
the chartered banks at reasonable rates because of a government guarantee to the banks
against losses. The present Minister of
Fisheries has brought forward a number of
fine pieces of legislation designed to aid the
fisheries, and for so doing he deserves commendation, especially from my part of the
country. In attempting to draft this Fisheries
Improvement Loans Bill he found that there
were certain obstacles. For example, the
type of fisherman who most needed the assistance that would be granted under the bill is
the so-called shore fisherman, who has a
small boat, which it is almost impossible to
insure at reasonable rates. He operates alone
or with the assistance of his family, and he
is subject to loss through storms and other
misfortunes. One day he may be quite well
off, and the next day be worth very little.
In these circumstances he finds it difficult
to get insurance coverage on his boats and
equipment, and as a result the Minister
brought forward and Parliament approved
the Fisherman's Indemnity Fund, through
which, for a premium of 1 per cent, the
fisherman could get his boat and gear insured to the extent of 60 per cent of its value,
up to a total of $7,500.
The next step by way of legislation for the
assistance of the shore fishermen is the bill
which we now have before us, which is for
the purpose of guaranteeing to the lender
repayment of loans made to fishermen. Sections 3 and 6 of the bill are the enabling
sections. Section 3 provides that the loans
may not exceed $4,000, that they will bear
interest at the rate of 5 per cent and be for a
period of not more than eight years. There
can be no other charges against the loan
except for insurance purposes. The guarantee
is available on loans made by the lenders
within a three-year period from the passage
of this legislation.
The principal need for such financial assistance is for improvement to boats, engines,
gear and equipment of the shore fishermen.
The maximum amount of the loan readily
indicates that it is of little use to any other
than shore fishermen. A loan of $4,000
would not go very far in building, for instance, a deep-sea fisheries boat, or in the
repair or refitting of it. The bill excludes
electronic equipment from those items for
which loans may be made. As honourable
senators know, electronics are used extensively in deep-sea fishing for depth sounding
and that sort of thing, and the equipment
is quite costly.
The only criticism the bill received in the
other place was that the maximum of $4,000
was too low and 'was inadequate for the

SENATE
purpose. However, it was pointed out by
the minister that the fishermen had the benefit of insurance coverage to the extent of
60 per cent on a total of $7,500, and that
the maximum loan of $4,000 fitted in with
that insurance coverage, and in that respect
would be a safe loan.
Throughout the Maritime Provinces there
are provincial loan boards which lend large
amounts to fishermen. However, as they
require the borrower to put up one-third of
the cost of the project, and as even the
smallest deep-sea fishing boat costs in excess
of $100,000, il. is more difficult for the fishermen to take advantage of this source of
financing. Further, it might be pointed out
that the federal Government, through the
Department of Fisheries, pays to owners of
larger boats of a certain size a subsidy of $165
a ton. Honourable senators will readily see
that the deep-sea fishermen are being looked
after in another way.
The total amount of the loans that may be
made under the bill, within three years, is
$20,000,000, of which the Government guarantees to pay any losses suffered by a lender
up to 15 per cent of the first $500,000, and
10 per cent of ail additional loans made by
that lender. Fifteen per cent of $500,000
amounts to $75,000, which would be taken
up by the guarantee before the lender would
suifer any loss. Such losses are not the
experience of the industry, so the lender is
practically assured that his transaction will
not be unprofitable.
As the bill was originally drafted, it defined
"lender" as a bank, but when the bill was in
its resolution stage in the other house so
much general interest in its provisions was
shown al across Canada, and especially in the
Maritime areas, that the Government saw fit
to consider including credit unions in the
definition of "lender". In fact, the pressure in the Commons for such an amendment
was so strong that the Prime Minister called
the Minister of Fisheries to his seat and suggested that the matter be referred to a committee with a view to seeing what could be
done to provide for the inclusion of credit
unions as lenders under this legislation. The
bill went to committee, where it was subsequently amended by the inclusion of credit
unions of various kinds as qualified lenders;
and of the $20,000,000 allotted for total loans,
$10,000,000 was allocated to the chartered
banks and $10,000,000 to the credit unions.
The Canadian Fisherman's Loan Act, which
was passed in 1935, and is Chapter 52 of the
Statutes of Canada of that year, provides
some financial assistance for fishermen, but it
has proved too complicated for general use.

It requires that loans be secured by a
mortgage on the homes of fishermen, and
there are other objectionable features. As a
result only $40,000 of the amount provided in
that legislation was ever taken up, and today
only eight loans are outstanding. Section 13
of the bill repeals this legislation.
The addition of credit unions as qualified
lenders is an interesting feature of this bill.
It is the first time that these financial institutions have been recognized on government
guaranteed loans. However, the bill as
amended received the unanimous consent of
the other house, and the tenor of the debate
throughout was that this is highly salutary
legislation.
In passing, I might mention that while the
measure was in committee two young men,
one from New Brunswick and the other from
Nova Scotia, representing credit unions,
appeared before the committee and informed
its members that the credit unions had
already lent to the fishermen in Nova Scotia
some $40 million, and in New Brunswick
$34 million. What appeals to me about the
credit union movement is that it was initiated
during a depression. It was an effort amongst
the people in the eastern sections of Canada,
especially in Nova Scotia, and sponsored
largely by the St. Francis Xavier University,
with a view to helping people to help themselves. The operations of the various credit
unions have been watched over carefully and
they have become quite successful. I am
agreeably surprised that these institutions are
willing to take on loans at 5 per cent. However, they are subject to the same rules and
regulations as are the chartered banks, and
with the security that this legislation offers
they are willing to reach out into a new field.
I wish them every success.
The Minister of Finance will keep flexible
control over this legislation, in virtue of
sections 4 and 5 of the bill, in which he is
given the power to terminate and to restore
his liability to a lender with respect to
guaranteed loans.
I look back on the development of the
fishing industry in my own county, where it
has been eminently successful and always in
the forefront on the east coast. I attribute
that success to the fact that we always operated under a co-operative system in that area.
But it was a peculiar co-operative system.
Honourable senators probably know that
down east we have the term "highliner". In
the old days of the fishing industry ahl fish
caught were counted and every man was paid
accordingly. That system has been carried
on throughout the industry, and today each

JUNE 30, 1955
fisherman receives a share from the catch.
In the production end, there is the keenest
of competition.
There is another kind of co-operation,
namely overall co-operation between all classes
for the benefit of the industry, the effect of it
being that we all stand and work together.
The whole arrangement makes for effective
progress and efficiency in the fishing industry.
Down in Lunenburg we like that kind of
co-operation.
In the debate on this bill in the House of
Commons some members, referring to the
way the fishermen obtain funds to carry on,
said that it is hard for them to borrow money,
that they must be financed by the merchants
and other people. That is so, but it was
further suggested that there was a bit of
feudal bondage ir the set-up-I suppose because the members thought the fishermen was
not really dealing at arm's length with the
merchant. There might possibly be something in that, but the merchant likely has his
troubles too. But so far as Lunenburg is
concerned, we have never had any trouble
with our merchants. Shares in a fisbing
vessel were taken up by the fishermen, the
merchant and citizens in general. Even as a
youth I bought shares in vessels, and I still
hold some. Everybody wanted to get a share
in a vessel, because the return was good.
I remember we used to endorse notes, one
person for the other, and in that way we could
go to the bank and borrow money to buy
shares in a fishing boat. The merchants and
owners were most anxious to get a good
skipper for a ship because so much depended
upon him. In order to obtain the best possible skipper, they would help him to finance
the purchase of a big share in the catch and
in the ship, and he would be sure to do his
utmost to have a profitable year for the ship.
In that way we had splendid co-operation all
around.
We are proud of our West India and fish
merchants in Lunenburg, first of all because
they know the business and share in this
co-operation. Our merchant companies have
survived, some for over 100 years. They have
most valuable foreign connections, they find
our markets, and they have been and are a
bulwark of the town's industry. A point that I
would like to stress is that most of the merchants in Lunenburg started their lives in the
bow of a fishing dory-it can truly be said
of them that they started at the very bottom
of the ladder and worked their way up. When
they went into business for themselves they
had the great advantage that comes from
practical experience, as fishermen, and that
is one reason why we have such a splendid
economy.

As honourable senators know, the Report
of the Rowell-Sirois Royal Commission on
Dominion-Provincial Relations contains a
glamorous account of the golden age in the
Maritime Provinces, when wooden sailing
ships carried our commerce far and wide.
The fading of that golden age led to the
decline of some of our ports, but Lunenburg
survived and carried on with sailing ships
in the fishing industry. We built ships, and
sailed them; we caught fish, and carried the
catch to the markets in our own ships; and
we brought back the money or the products
of other countries. In this way we continued
to prosper.
This leads me to say a word about the
banks. As honourable senators know, most
of the banks in this country started in the
Maritime provinces. The Royal Bank of
Canada was started there, and it was known
first as the Merchants Bank of Halifax. The
Bank of Montreal took over the Peoples Bank
of Halifax, and the Canadian Bank of Commerce took over the Halifax Banking Company. The Bank of Nova Scotia, which for
many years had its head office at Halifax, is
now one of the biggest institutions of this
country. Our banks are doing a splendid
job, and we believe that they will assist in
great developments under this bill. Personally, I am glad that the co-operative credit
institutions also are included as lenders under
this measure. In time, they too may become
great bankers. This measure stirred up a
lot of interest in the other house. The remarks
on it there were all favourable, the only
criticism having been that the maximum
amount of the loan may not be large enough.
But, honourable senators, this is only a start.
In time and in the light of experience we
shall be able to make any necessary changes.
The measure is a good one, and we are glad
to have this assistance for the fisheries.
The bill will come into force when it is
proclaimed. The Minister of Finance is the
minister referred to in the bill. There are
sections dealing with such matters as interpretation and penalties, and these can be
dealt with in committee, where I hope there
will be a full discussion. However, I believe
other members in this house wish to speak
on the motion for second reading.
All in ail, I believe the bill represents a
great step toward providing needed assistance
to fishermen, especially the shore fishermen.
They are the small men in the fishing industry, but they are numerous. I believe that
legislation of this kind is salutary and a credit
to the Department of Finance, and I am glad
to support it.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I ask the honourable senator if he can say how many people
would be directly affected by this legislation?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Well, that is a question!
The legislation would benefit fishermen in
Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,
Prince Edward Island, part of the province
of Quebec, and British Columbia, besides lake
fishermen. I would not like to say how many
would be affected. It might be 100,000.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: As far as Nova Scotia
is concerned, could you say how many would
be affected?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I would not even like to
say that. There might be upwards of 15,000
people.
Hon. John A. McDonald: Honourable senators, I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon.
Mr. Kinley) upon his very clear and interesting explanation of the bill.
I want to take this opportunity of commending the Government for this legislation,
and, especially, the amendment which was
made in committee and which, as the honourable senator from Queen's-Lunenburg has
said, will extend to the credit unions the
same privilege as the banks have in the
loaning of money. Truly, the growth of the
co-operative movement and of credit unions,
especially since the early thirties, has been a
great achievement. I can remember, when
I was in office at Halifax, meeting some of
the pioneers of this movement, who were
looking for what assistance we could give
them. Some of those who were connected
with the organization gave more than they
could afford to give in order to get co-operatives started. One day, when a clergyman
came in, I may not have been as discreet
as I should have been, because I glanced at
his waistcoat, and noticed that the silk was
worn down to the canvas. Seeing that I
was looking at it, he said: "I am sorry, but
these are the best clothes I have. I used
everything I could get to support my
co-operatives".
I could tell some very interesting stories
about how these clergymen, especially those
who had received their training in St. Francis
Xavier University, went into our communities during the depression, when most of the
people were on relief, and by using what
little credit they had they would buy, let
us say, perhaps, a second-hand sawmill, and
then take the villagers into the woods to cut
wood, first for the co-operative store, then
for the school, and also for the improvement
of their churches. In several communities,

by this means, people were taken off direct
relief. The men went fishing and caught
lobsters, which were canned by their women
in the factory; the children who could be
spared went into the fields to pick blackberries, wild cranberries or foxberries, which
were canned, and the produce was taken to
the Montreal markets and sold. By such
means many of the people were able to
dispense with relief.
The record of this work is very impressive,
and I shall never tire of singing the praises
of some of these wonderful men. I might
instance Doctor-or as we used to call him,
"Jimmy"- Tompkins; the Reverend Father
Macpherson, another great leader; Monsignor
Coady, who is still with us and who gave inspiring leadership; and A. B. Macdonald,
who has passed on. They served their people
well, especially in connection with credit
union activities.
It is a pleasure to support this legislation.
I might say that it was with great satisfaction
that, when listening to the debate in the
other place, I noticed that representatives of
all four political parties rose one after the
other and commended the Government for
having introduced this bill. I hope it will
receive its second and third readings within
a very short time.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri
moved the
adjournment of the debate.
He said: Honourable senators, before the
debate is adjourned I would like to express
my astonishment that the Canadian Press
and the British United Press have failed to
give credit to the caisse populaire of Quebec
for its work on behalf of the fishing industry.
Credit unions, which have done splendid
work in the Maritime Provinces and in
British Columbia, were organized 23 years
ago, but it is 55 years since the caisse populaire of Quebec began its operations. The
total assests of all the credit unions in Canada
are $450 million, 80 per cent of which is
held by the caisse populaire of the province
of Quebec. The caisse populaire is not exactly
the same as the credit union, because the
union is organized on a community basis and
the caisse populaire works on a parish
plan. For thirty years we have extended loans
to fishermen on the Gaspe coast, the Magdalen
Islands and the Labrador coast, and millions
on millions of dollars have been loaned with
no guarantee except the moral integrity of
the fishermen. That moral guarantee is, I
think, of the first importance.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt, the
debate was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, July
5, at 8 p.m.

supply and demand, and it may be termed
artificial, but it is one of those props, whether
artificial or not, which nowadays we must
have if our Canadian standards of living are
to be maintained.
Recently, as a result of labour negotiations
between a United States labour union and an
American corporation, we heard something
regarding a guaranteed annual wage. I wonder whether honourable senators realize that
here in Canada we already have a guaranteed
annual wage-guaranteed by the national
Unemployment Insurance Fund, and amounting at the present time to over $840 million.
In the United States unemployment insurance
is a matter of state legislation, while in this
country it covers the entire nation and is
administered by the federal government. I do
not know the details of the agreement
recently made between a labour union and
the Ford Company, but I am informed that
the broad principle is similar to that governing our unemployment insurance measure,
with this difference, that under the United
States agreement the Ford Company will set
up their own individual insurance fund,
whereas here in Canada they would be
assessed and pay into a national fund. I
understand that this agreement will require
changes and amendments of the present
Unemployment Insurance Act of the State of
Michigan.
Because unemployment insurance is indispensable, it should be safeguarded by careful
administration in order to carry out the
original purpose of making it serve as an
insurance policy against work stoppages with
no pay envelope, and it is our responsibility
to give those charged with this administration
every possible support in carrying out their
task. The intention of the act is very clear,
and its plan sound, but in a country like
Canada, with its far-flung spaces, involving
seasonal activities and the production of
natural resources, the work of administration
is not always easy; and from time to time,
we who represent such regions hear complaints and criticisms of the administration.
We are told of cases where the fund is being
made use of by people who are drawing
benefits under circumstances and conditions
which were never contemplated when the
legislation was drawn. I can quite understand how these things can happen and I
have every sympathy for the local and
regional managers who are on the firing-line
and charged with making the act work.
It may be that more information or education is needed as to the purport of the act,
for I fear that many of our people regard
unemployment insurance as a fund from

which they can draw out their contributions
when requirements as to period of payments
have been satisfied. This practice not only
places the fund in jeopardy, but our people
should realize that the fund is there because
the workers of Canada-both capital and
labour-made it possible by their spirit of
vision, venture and hard work; that that
spirit is as essential today to the nation and
to the character of our people as it ever was;
and that we must never allow it to be
replaced by another philosophy or code which
seeks security first or is satisfied with the
second-rate.
Those of us who are on the committee
which studied this bill and heard the members
and officials of the commission, were impressed with their statements and with the
conscientious manner in which they are
endeavouring to do their job, which is such
an important one for Canada. However, I
came away from the committee feeling that
more inspection-much more inspection-was
needed in order to strengthen their hands and
help the local managers in administering the
act. One local manager with whom I discussed the matter stated that when he wished
a case investigated and asked for an inspector
it would at times be a matter of weeks before
the official arrived, owing to pressure of work
and the amount of territory which he had to
cover. I think this act is too precious and the
principle of unemployment insurance too
important for us to risk its being taken
advantage of or used unworthily for the sake
of the extra cost involved in providing a
closer check on its administration at the local
level.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Calvert C. Pra±t: Honourable senators,
I should like to follow up the last point that
has just been made by the honourable
member from Northumberland (Hon. Mr.
Burchill). First I would say we all agree,
I am sure, that unemployment insurance is of
great importance to this nation. The value
of its stabilizing effect and the place it fills
in the social life of our people cannot be
overestimated.
However, my reason for rising now is that
I wish to acquaint the house with a thought
which I expressed when this bill was discussed in committee the other day. At that
time I asked how inspection of individual
applications was carried out. I assumed, and
I think quite rightly, that inspection of individual cases is not carried out very
thoroughly, because of lack of facilities or
lack of staff to enable inspectors to rotate
properly and visit places frequently.

JULY 5, 1955
I mentioned in committee some actual cases
that came to my notice which, while they
were not irregularities, in the meaning of
fraudulent acts, were illustrative of what
seems to be going on frequently and such as
to make the application of the act a laughing
stock. I say that quite deliberately. It is
most unfortunate that while perhaps 99 per
cent of the people who claim unemployment
benefits are entitled to them and honestly
seek them, the fact is that some people apply
with a view to getting something for nothing.
The impression one gathers is that there is
a lack of adequate inspection facilities. I do
not want to confuse "inspection" in this sense
with inspection of books and accounts and so
forth, but it appears that there is a lack of
checking off of individual cases and that as
a result abuses creep in. By proper inspection
they could be spotted, and the next one could
be stopped, and thus prevent a continuous
growth of abuses. It must be remembered
that the filling out of forms can never tell
a whole story, and also that in communities
there is a natural reluctance for people to
act as informers.
There can be no doubt that the administration of the Unemployment Insurance Act
requires a lot of tightening up. I think the
act is one of the finest in Canada, and that
therefore it needs to be kept at a very high
level of fairness and equity. It should not
be open to an endless chain of abuses whereby
some people may treat opportunities for employment lightly and one person after another
make application for benefits to which they
are not entitled.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time and passed.

FISHERIES IMPROVEMENT LOANS BILL
SECOND READING
The Senate resumed from Thursday, June
30, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Kinley for the second reading of
Bill 452, an Act respecting loans to assist
fishermen engaged in a primary fishing
enterprise.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt: Honourable
senators, I am pleased to follow two colleagues from Nova Scotia (Hon. Mr. Kinley
and Hon. Mr. McDonald) in approving of

Bill 452, an Act respecting loans to assist
fishermen. However, I would not have
approved of the bill but for amendments
made to it in the other chamber, not that I
considered it as not being good and useful
legislation, but because, as drafted, it
appeared to me absolutely inoperative. And
in fact, without those amendments the bill
would have been inoperative, since there
are no banks, or almost none, in fishing
centres, whereas caisses populaires and credit
unions have been organized in these areas
for many years. Credit unions have been
making loans to fishermen for over 20 years,
and caisses populaires for 35 to 40 years.
Honourable senators will notice that I refer
to caisses populaires and credit unions. The
fact is that caisses populaires have been
organized in Canada for 55 years, while
credit unions began to develop some 20 or
25 years ago. I must emphasize that both do
not operate in the same way: Credit unions
operate on the occupational plan; caisses
populaires are founded and organized on the
parochial plan. Moreover, caisses populaires
lend their money, to a great extent, on mortgages, but credit unions do not lend much
in this way.
However, caisses populaires and credit
unions have the same object and aim, namely,
to help people of the working classes; and
both organizations have done really wonderful jobs. In Prince Edward Island, credit
unions have lent, since their organization,
nearly $6 million; in Nova Scotia, $37 million;
in New Brunswick, from $32 to $33 million;
in the province of Quebec, caisses populaires
have lent over $700 million; in British
Columbia, credit unions have made loans of
about $90 million. Savings (shares included)
in credit unions in Prince Edward Island,
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick total about
$40 million; in caisses populaires in the
province of Quebec, savings total $375
million.
The $700 million lent by caisses populaires
in the province of Quebec is not all that has
been lent, but millions and millions of dollars have been lent on the Gaspe peninsula,
and on the Magdalen Islands; and on the
north shore caisses populaires have three
men engaged in the work of supervising
loans to fishermen. Our caisses populaires
cannot hope to receive big returns from
money lent to fishermen, but all our members are very happy to be of service to the
fishermen because we realize they contribute
greatly to the general prosperity of the
country. By putting our growing funds to
use in a co-operative way we are able to
help all of the people in the country. We
cannot draw any line between fishermen,

SENATE

farmers and people in other occuptions; the
farmers must buy certain of their goods
from the manufacturers, and the fishermen
must make purchases from the merchants,
and they all work together. So we in turn
are happy to have this opportunity of being
of service to the fishermen who, as I have
said, contribute greatly to our general prosperity.
The development of credit unions in the
Maritimes is due, to a large extent, to the
wonderful work done by the university at
Antigonish. We pay tribute to this university,
especially for its educational work. That
university was the first to organize study
clubs for the advancement of credit unions,
and educational institutions in other provinces have taken their inspiration from the
development at Antigonish. I am pleased to
say that when that university started its
credit union movement, it came to Quebec to
study our organization there and to learn
our procedure.
Fishermen have in the past been able to
meet and solve their financial difficulties,
both before and during the crisis, to a large
extent by the help received from caisses
populaires and credit unions. In this respect
I speak especially for the province of Quebec
and the Maritimes. In Quebec legislation
which provides loans to fishermen was introduced by the provincial government and
is operated by caisses populaires, and for
many years these co-operative lending
societies have helped fishermen by loans
amounting to many millions of dollars. I
understand that with the co-operation of
credit unions similar conditions exist in the
Maritime provinces.
I would have deplored the bill now before
us if it had failed to recognize the wonderful,
efficient, necessary and urgent work being
done by caisses populaires and credit unions.
There, I wish to thank the Prime Minister
-and I am aware of his personal intervention
-for his part in allowing the amendments
which permit co-operative lending societies
to participate in loans to fishermen.
I should like to pay tribute to those who
for so many years have devoted themselves
to the organization of the economic relief of
the labouring classes by founding savings and
credit co-operatives. I would mention first,
Commander Alphonse Desjardins, who in 1900
founded his first caisse populaire in my city
of Levis. I wish also to pay sincere tribute
to those who immediately supported him,
namely: Canon Grondin, Father Turmel,
Canon Rochette, Mr. J. A. K. Laflamme and
others. And I would pay homage to men
from other provinces who have given outstanding help: Monsignor Coady, Father

Tompkins, and as well to A. B. Macdonald,
Martin Legere, and others. I name these
men with full knowledge of the facts, for
I myself have been in the co-operative
movement for 49 years, and have witnessed
its development almost since its birth.
I do not wish, however, to give the impression that I am ill-disposed towards banks.
They do a very considerable and necessary
work, but they are organized especially to
lend to commerce. On the other hand, caisses
populaires and credit unions have as their
aim to help people of the labouring classes,
and these societies have been organized
wherever people are willing to help themselves and one another. Caisses populaires
and credit unions are in a position to exercise more effective control over loans than
are banks. The co-operatives know their
borrowers, and they have their moral guarantee-which is most essential today-and other
necessary information which the banks cannot
have. These things may be said to constitute
80 per cent of the guarantees behind loans.
Moreover, caisses populaires in making
loans to fishermen, carry insurance in the
event of the death of the borrower and also
against losses from tire or disaster at sea.
I believe this bill, as it is now worded, will
be very useful, and will be another effective
piece of legislation brought in by our
Government. I hope that it will be referred
to a committee, where I would have certain
remarks to make. For example, section 8
gives certain powers to the banks to take
security by way of a mortgage on real or
personal, movable or immovable property.
Caisses populaires and credit unions may take
security on mortgages, but the law does not
allow them to take good security on movable
property. I am hopeful that something can
be done to improve this situation.
In conclusion, honourable senators, may I
say that this bill provides real social legislation in every sense of the term.
Hon. A. Neil McLean: Honourable senators,
because one of my chief concerns in life is
the fishing industry generally and the welfare
of "those who go down to the sea in ships",
I should like to take this opportunity of
congratulating the Government on its positive approach to the problems of fishermen
through the legislation contained in the bill
before the house. The purposes of the bill
have been clearly explained by the mover
of the motion for second reading (Hon. Mr.
Kinley), and I do not wish to dwell on its
details. It is, however, gratifying to note that
legislation for fishermen comparable to that
enabling farmers to obtain loans with a minimum of difficulty has now become a reality.

JULY 5, 1955
This is all part of the pattern clearly established by the present Government, which
reflects not only its concern for the primary
producers of this new nation but also for its
confidence in the future of these two major
industries.
While I shall deal later with the underlying
principles and purposes of protecting primary
producers, I should like to preface my remarks by reference to the fiscal policy of the
Government and the manner in which it
encourages development of both business and
primary industries. I have given the budget
for the coming fiscal year considerable study.
I think there is a great deal in it worthy of
favourable comment, and the Minister of
Finance is to be congratulated upon the careful way in which he has explained the present financial position of Canada and upon the
adjustments that have been made throughout
the budget, which are bound to stimulate
business and industry. 1954 was, on the
whole, a year of what might be called mild
recession. The national income of Canada
from production, which is the basis of our
country's prosperity, declined around 2 per
cent as compared to 1953, which was less
than the decline experienced by our great
neighbour to the south. After many years of
budget surpluses, our national budget deficit
for last year was less than that which we
received from our national production covering a period of three or four days, so there is
nothing to worry about in this connection.
The debt of our country was reduced, during
the past year by $2.00 million, and taxes
have been reduced for the current year by
around $150 million, which is bound to stimulate expansion and add to our prosperity. It
is true that the Minister of Finance has
budgeted for a comparatively small deficit
for the current year, but with business on
the upturn as it is, my prediction is that
the budget deficit for the current year will be
small indeed, if any at all. In this year's
budget there has been a reduction in the
main estimates, the first in seven years, which
is all to the good, but there has been no curtailment in the planned program of useful and
necessary public works.
Referring to our national debt, I might
say the real burden of this debt on the taxpayer is the lowest in many years. This has
been brought about by two factors, low interest rates and high national income. Carrying
charges now represent a smaller portion of
the total income of the country than at any
time during the last quarter of a century, so
one can easily see how important it is to
keep our brawn and brain fully employed to
keep our national productive income at a
maximum.

I think I have laid the foundation, honourable senators, to the point where I am now
going to ask the Government to spend some
money on research work.
As a primary producer I am very glad
to see that moderate increases are proposed
in the outlays for research services which in
time will provide aid beyond measure toward
the development of our natural resources.
Even greater expenditures are fully justified,
as no moneys spent by any government pay
off to a greater extent than those spent on
research and conservation work. Al our
wealth originally comes from the land, sea
and forest and it may seem strange that the
sea, which is really the greatest storehouse
of wealth of them all, bas had the least
research work directed toward it. Living by
the ocean most of my life and living off it,
so to speak, I have often marvelled at the
great wealth it contains in animal life, minerals, metals, oil, fertilizers, vegetation, etc.
We know, for instance, what top soil means
to land. Well, in a period of millions of
years, billions of tons of top soil have been
washed from the land into the sea until it
is miles deep in some places. The population of the globe is increasing by about 84,000
people a day, and this rate is bound to
increase annually; the time is not far distant
when the wealth of the sea will have to be
drawn on to a far greater extent than it is
now, and at the present time there is an
urgent need for a far greater study of the
resources of the ocean, especially its animal
life. We need such information not only for
this generation but for those who will follow
us. Greater knowledge about fish life in the
sea would be invaluable, for we would then
be in a much better position to both increase
and conserve the great animal life of the
ocean.
I fully realize that a great deal of work has
already been done in this connection, with
excellent results. One has only to look, for
instance, at the fine work that bas been
accomplished in connection with the sealing
industry of the Pacific coast, also the halibut
and salmon industries; and I wish to give
the honourable senator from New Wesi
minister (Hon. Mr. Reid) great credit for his
efforts in this connection. However, we must
realize that the oceans cover three times as
much of our globe as land does, and there
is need for far greater ocean research work
in the future than has been done in the past.
For instance, the great depth of the sea is
almost unknown to mankind, but we do
know it contains animal life and great
mineral wealth.

SENATE
Federal expenditures for each ton of food
produced from the sea amounts to very considerably less than federal expenditures
spent in connection with each ton of food
produced from the land, so one can realize
there is plenty of room for a reasonable
expansion program which will give our people more knowledge of the resources of the
sea.
I do not need to tell you, honourable senators, that Canada has one of the finest coastlines in the world, and we must never forget
it. Newfoundland by coming into confederation added immeasurably to that great
coastline. The seas have never been mapped
for their vast resources. Even the lowest
estimates promise about one hundred times
as much food and mineral products as are
being harvested frorn the sea at the present
time. At the present time there is said to
be only 1,300 ocean scientists in North
America. Today seafood forms less than 2
per cent of all foods eaten by mankind
throughout the world.
I would now like to call the attention of
this honourable house to our Atlantic coast
and the scientific progress which has been
made there. We have come a long way
since the great explorer Samuel de Champlain discovered our Southern New Brunswick
coast, but we still have a great deal of necessary work to do regarding scientific
research. Champlain spent his first winter
in Canada on an island near the mouth of
the St. Croix River, and during the winter
between scurvy and starvation he lost half
his crew, who are buried on the island. The
island was covered with evergreen trees, and,
had it been known at that time, if the evergreens had been boiled and the juice drunk,
an effective remedy for scurvy was right at
hand. But more important, there was food
right nearby for tens of thousands of people,
for it was discovered in later years that the
Bay of Fundy was one of the greatest berring-fishing grounds of the world.
During the last half century tens of millions
of dollars have been invested by thousands
of fishermen and fish packers in the herring
industry of Southern New Brunswick, and a
very large income is derived from this great
natural resource which means the livelihood
of many thousands of fishermen, fish packers
and boatmen. The honourable Minister of
Fisheries has well said that Canadian fishery
resources are among the world's most bountiful. It is to his credit that some valuable
research is under way to bring still more
benefits to Canada by conservation and
regulated productivity in the fishing industry. It is the department with the greatest
potential field of operations to be concerned

with about three-quarters of this planet's surface. But there is urgent need of greater
awareness of the magnitude of the expanse
to be harvested and of Canadian preparedness to move in with every available resource of modern science.
Herring are vegetarians. These fish are
the bread and butter of the ocean. The Bay
of Fundy and adjacent shores have always
had a great herring industry and I hope
always will, but changes in the habits of
these fish have been taking place in recent
years. Big herring are becoming scarcer and
the large schools of sardine herring, which
used to arrive in March, have been arriving
in late May or June and have been making
their first appearance down the Maine Coast
instead of along the New Brunswick shoreline. Where these herring schools come from
or where they go, no one seems to know.
Why they come at times and leave at other
times is equally a mystery. It is known, however, that sometimes large schools of "Brit",
or baby herring, far too small for canning,
visit the bay and thousands of hogsheads are
often sold for a pittance to the fish meal
people. These small fish remain in the bay
for some weeks, then disappear, but we are
led to believe those not caught and sold for
fish meal come back again in a few months,
at which time they are mature and worth
several times the amount for canning for
human consumption Ithan had they been
caught and sold for fish meal when they
were small herring. We believe that the
netting of large quantities of herring full of
spawn, along the New Brunswick shore, for
cat and dog food may be unwise and destructive to the industry. Every spawning herring
is capable of seeding the coastal waters with
31,000 eggs. Conservation is a manifest need
in fisheries as it is in forestry and in wild life.
The Department of Fisheries has a young
and aggressive Minister who is doing excellent work for the fisheries and in making an
argument for greater and more effective
federal research and conservation work in
connection with our herring fisheries, I am
not overlooking the fine work that has been
and is now being done on the coasts of
Canada; but expansion of this work is
needed.
Wherever Canada is represented at international conferences relating to the fishing
industry, the views expressed by members
of Canadian biological staffs are highly regarded. Canadian experts in any province of
fisheries are deservedly honoured as among
the leading authorities.
One practical service, to the national advantage of Canada, would be to develop
facilities, equipment and trained workers,

JULY 5, 1955
under experienced direction already available, for more intensive research, and conservation work. The need of more scientific
information on the migration of herring, one
of the most prolific sources of sea food, is
an instance in this regard. A great deal
more information is needed in the Department of Fisheries about the sardine herring.
It should be known where they are spawned
and full knowledge is required of their Atlantic feeding grounds. At times they come to
feeding places along the Atlantic coast, most
notably the Bay of Fundy, when they are
young, and leave again; possibly they come
back, but no one seems to know where they
have been in the meanwhile.
It should be possible to anticipate the year,
or years, when the crop of fish will be
bountiful; also the year or years when the
yield will be poor. In good years extra factories could be put into operation, and a
carryover could be financed for the years of
scarcity. This information would help to
level out the peaks and valleys of production
in the fishing industry. It would ensure a
steadier continuity of supply to the consuming public. It would put more money
into the pockets of the fishermen; the prices
paid to the fishermen for fish would be on a
better basis. Research workers should keep
in close touch with fishermen and packers
and benefit from the experience of those
who toil from daylight to dark during the
fishing season and thus gain practical knowledge.
It would be money well spent and to the
national advantage of Canada, to put an
extra million dollars or more into the Fisheries estimates for research of this character.
In this connection it is well to note that the
United States federal Government recently
voted three million dollars extra for research
for the New England fisheries under the
Saltonstall-Kennedy Bill. In this case both
parties got together, and by the setting aside
of this annual grant the work of the United
States in this regard has been doubled. It
compares in productive yield with the money
spent in Canada's immensely valuable Geological Survey.
Today there is a confusing conflict of
opinions about diminishing returns in the
Maritime herring fisheries. Some weir men
claim that the seiners are depleting the fish.
Many believe that the manufacturing of fishmeal, or of cat and dog food, with fish fit
for human food, is depleting Canadian fisheries. Winter packing is regarded by some as
against the best interests of the fishing industry. A comprehensive survey would surely
be warranted to determine whether the fish
are so being depleted.

In Bay of Fundy communities, alone, there
is no lack of facilities for canning fish. The
companies pay out millions of dollars in
wages and for the purchase of fish. The
markets too can be found for this valuable
seafood; but the fishermen cannot always
find the fish to be so prepared for the market.
More help by the Department of Fisheries in
this direction would be of benefit primarily
to the fishermen, and generally to the whole
community.
As a practical instance of the need of conservation, the disappearance of clam beds
should be prevented. Unless immediate,
effective measures are instituted, the clam
industry will become a thing of the past. It
is plainly seen that clams along the shores of
the Maritime Provinces cannot survive without a greater measure of conservation.
Within the memory of adult dwellers along
the south shore of Nova Scotia, there were
prolific beds of this succulent shellfish. In the
sands at the mouth of Sable River, or even
nearer the villages, as in Lockeport harbour,
a school child with a clam hoe could take a
bucketful in a few minutes at low tide. The
clam chowder served at the Lockeport station
restaurant became so popular that the trains
would stop to allow passengers to partake
of a clam chowder lunch-and, of course,
blueberry pie. The trains still stop, but
Lockeport clam chowder is no longer on the
menu. The clam beds have disappeared. The
clam beds of New England, which at one time
were worth many millions, have been ruined
through lack of conservation. The Indians
of North America used clams as a food before
the coming of the white man and conserved
them, but now the clam beds are a fast
vanishing asset.
Surely it would be to the advantage of
Canada to save the clam industry from dying
out. Vessels are going as far as Grand Manan
for clams; but unless there is conservation,
the days of that source of supply are numbered. Closed seasons in which this conservation will be put into effect should be
instituted, and action should be taken
promptly before it is too late. Some of the
clam packing plants on the southern shore
of New Brunswick have an investment as high
as a hundred thousand dollars and are running only part time: their investment will
be entirely lost when the clams disappear.
The Christian Science Monitor stated a year
or two ago that clams were once dug in
abundance around Boston harbour, but not
only are none there now, but clam beds are
few and far between throughout all New
England, owing to lack of proper conservation laws. Clams are prolific if given a
chance, and will bring in as substantial an

SENATE
income in future years as they have done in
the past two hundred years. Clam fishing is
one of the oldest branches of the Atlantic
fishing industry, but it can only be preserved
by the adoption of conservation regulations.
Once again, it should be said there are
experts in biological research and conservation on the staff of the Department of
Fisheries. It would seem a wise government
policy to build up the department substantially around the present expert staff in order to
meet the needs of the fishing industry. This
would be no mere measure of aid to a local
situation; the benefit would be nation-wide, as
in government measures to get the best results in agriculture, mining and forestry.
About the time the herring fisheries were
discovered in the Bay of Fundy the Swedish
towns of Skanor, Bohuslan and Falsterbo
were enjoying unheard of prosperity as headquarters of the Baltic herring fisheries. These
conditions had lasted for centuries; there
seemed to be no end of the silvery wealthbringing fish. Then quite suddenly the fishery
ceased, for the herring withdrew into the
North Sea and came no more into the gateways of the Baltic, and Sweden was impoverished. This change in the habits of these
herring have never been satisfactorily explained. There are known to be vast floating
meadows where fish go to pasture to feed on
plankton and other vegetable and animal
matter. But whence they come or whither
they go is less known to the ordinary fishermen than the pasture lands of the buffalo or
the habits of the beaver was known to the
red men.
In very recent times a commercial tragedy
came upon the sardine industry of California.
The New York Times, under date of January
24, 1953, reports as follows:
In a sixteen-year period the sardine business on
the Pacifie coast has dwindled to almost nothing
from a $65,000,000 industry. More than $600,000 a
year is being spent in California to find out why.
With only one catch left in the 1952-53 fishing
season the total catch for coastal waters now
stands at just about 3,000 tons, which is less than
four-tenths of 1 per cent of the catch during the
record-setting year 1936-37.
During that season the 300 sardine-fishing boats
that put into the home ports of San Francisco,
Monterey and San Pedro accounted for 723,000 of
the 791,000 tons caught on the whole coast. It was
traditional that California contributed about 90
per cent of the West Coast total.
The Pacifie Northwest, however, bas recorded no
sardine catch since 1942-49, and now California,
for the first time, has come close to being sardineless. Even during the last several post-war years,
when northern and central California fishermen
were going broke, the southern California fleets
continued bringing in fair sized catches.
Last
year's total for the south was approximately 125,000
tons.

This disappearance of the sardines from
Monterey Bay and other California ocean

pastures came about too suddenly to be
entirely due to "over-fishing". The yearround harvesting of the sardine crop may
well have been one contributing factor; but
the expenditure of $600,000 now of government money a year to discover other causes,

if any, would suggest that the stable door
should have been closed before the horse
disappeared.
Five agencies are now engaged in research
on the California sardine problem; the California Academy of Sciences; the California
Department of Fish and Game; Hopkins
Marine Station of Stanford University; the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; the University
of California, Scripps Institute of Oceanography. Whatever the cause of this $65
million loss of annual income in one primary
industry, when it is discovered it will surely
demonstrate the need to have research and
conservation before the event rather than
after.
The harvesting of annual crops of fish can
surely be made as permanent and increasingly
productive as the harvesting of field crops or
forest resources. Even as the Douglas firs,
the white pines and other commercial trees
scatter millions of seeds and need only to be
safeguarded against depredators to reproduce,
so it is with ocean pastures. The reproductive
capacity of fish is prolific indeed.
The killing of wild fowl-ducks, geese or
other bird life-to feed cats, would seem to
be an offence against nature. There is equal
need for awareness of the possible consequences of depleting operations carried on
unwisely where scientific information is lacking in connection with our Canadian fisheries.
In terms of productive human labour the
annual amount contributed to the pool of
food production by the fishermen is 47,000
pounds as compared with 34,500 pounds produced by the farmer. Private enterprise in
the Canadian fisheries industry is making a
substantial contribution to scientifie research.
The fish packers maintain modern laboratories where handling, preparing and packing
seafood are constantly being developed. This
private investment in service to the ultimate
consumers is expensive, but it does contribute
greatly to the high standard of Canadian fish
products to the advantage of producer and
consumer alike. The oceans are a vast
expanse to be explored, however, and oceanography is a field of scientific research away
beyond the resources of the laboratories
maintained by private enterprise.
Now, we do not want anything to happen
to any species of fish on our coast like I
mentioned as having happened on the West
Coast of United States and in Sweden. Such
a thing would be a much worse tragedy if it

JULY 5, 1955
occurred on our Maritime coast, for fishing
is one of our largest industries and hundreds
of thousands of people depend on the sea of
our Atlantic coast for their very livelihood.
Never in my memory has there been so much
worry among fishermen and fish packers in
Southern New Brunswick with regard to the
future of the herring industry and the clam
industry as there is at the present time. We
had an example before this honourable bouse
very recently when we were told by our
federal fishery officials that the terrible destruction of trout and other fish in our Great
Lakes by lamprey eels amounted to many
millions of dollars, but thanks to the excellent
work of our Department of Fisheries and
United States co-operation, we now have
every hope that the eels will ultimately be
exterminated and the lake trout fisheries
restored to normal in due time.
The day has long since passed when any
important industry, especially a primary
industry, can be operated successfully without the benefit of intense research work.
Modern scientific and efficient methods must
be applied. The days of any rule-of-thumb or
guess system have been numbered. Without
scientific research work, an important industry courts disaster; perhaps not this year, but
disaster will surely catch up with such an
industry in the not too distant future. The
United States and Europe are spending many
hundreds of millions in research work and
they find it is an investment that brings
greater returns than any other government
expenditure. It is said that in Soviet Russia
research laboratories have no budget. They
work far into the night, and moneys provided
for research have a preference over other
expenditures.
Recently an outside company was subsidized by one of the provinces to the extent
of several hundred thousand dollars to introduce North Sea methods of catching herring
in the waters off Nova Scotia and the Gulf of
St. Lawrence. The venture is said to be a
gamble. Whether the operations of this outside company will have a further adverse
effect on the herring ooming into the Bay of
Fundy, we do not know, as such data is not
now available. If the spawning grounds of
the herring, which at present are not charted,
are seriously disturbed by draggers and
trawlers of this company, that may well further diminish the supply of the larger herring
entering the Bay. At one time fishermen in
Grand Manan did a large business in kippered
herring, but the volume bas steadily declined
in recent years. So far this year most of the
sardine herring packed in New Brunswick
have come from the Maine coast, so fishermen

and packers alike along the Southern New
Brunswick shore are seriously concerned
about the changes in the habits of the herring
during the last few years. They would like
to know the cause of the irregular ways of
the fish which are costing them substantial
losses in catch.
The greatest untapped source of wealth in
food for people everywhere in the world is
in the ocean. Canada has far more coastline
per capita than any other nation I know of.
It is practical politics on the part of the
Parliament of Canada to build up fisheries
research and conservation and perpetuate the
harvesting of seafoods. Fish is a concentrated
protein diet equal in food value to the finest
meats. This high nutritional value of seafoods has been scientifically demonstrated;
it is on record in all food research laboratories. In the circumstances, as stated, there
is quite a remarkable contrast between annual federal expenditures for the increase of
fishing products and those for the increase of
products from the land. The fishermen I
have known, and they are many, are sturdy
citizens and homemakers, resourceful and industrious. They build homes where they
can make themselves self-supporting. With
so much individual initiative, they are doing
their share in contributing to Canada's
wealth production.
Charles K. Kettering, of the Sloan Kettering
Research Laboratories, whom I think we will
all acknowledge as the greatest research
scientist of our time, is quoted as saying:
If there were only a million more youths being
taught what it takes to make a research scientist,
what an America this would be.

That indicates what Dr. Kettering thinks
of research work.
The devoted and highly expert workers
in the Department of Fisheries do not need
to be persuaded of the possibilities of increased and more stable production through
the benefits that will come from more scientific research and conservation work, but they
need the interest and practical support of
Parliament in the form of liberal estimates to
give the nation the full benefit of this great
Canadian heritage-our fisheries.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators, I confess at once that I am unable to
speak on this subject in sa scientific a manner
as the honourable member from Southern
New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean). I am
sure that we all listened with great interest
to his very fine address on conservation of
the fishing industry. Nor am I able to claim
such a long association with the credit unions
as can my honourable friend from Kennebec
However, from
(Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt).
1928 until I had the honour of appointment

SENATE
to this chamber, in 1950, a period of 22 years,
I represented fishing districts along the Nova
Scotia coast, reaching from Hubbards, on
the western side of Halifax, to Ecum Secum,
on the extreme east, about 104 miles distant.
It was there that I came in contact with
the very finest type of our fishermen-honest,
hardy, and absolutely reliable. During the
depression years, in the thirties, these men
hesitated to go on relief, and preferred to
fish, eat their home-grown potatoes, and live
in a very simple way until conditions improved. On many occasions I visited their
small homes on the shore, in such fine places
as Peggy's Cove-which artists have made
to be perhaps the best known village on the
Atlantic coast-Hubbards, West Dover and
East Dover, Indian Harbour, Glen Margaret,
and in the other direction on the western
shore; and, on the eastern shore, such places
as Musquodoboit Harbour, and others whose
names you would hardly recognize, such as
Petpeswick down to Necum Teuch. Here you
find hardy fishermen of the finest type. It
is that type of individual I have in mind in
considering this bill which has been so ably
explained by the honourable senator from
Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley).
I
wish to pay a compliment to the Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) for
selecting him to sponsor the bill, because he
is an authority on the fishing industry and
understands how our fishermen will be benefited by the provisions of the bill.
This proposed legislation could provide
fishermen, through loans, with better equipment and the necessary facilities to handle
their catch. It could help them in much the
same way as the Farm Improvement Loans
Act helps farmers to improve their farms.
The bill is somewhat similar to that fine
piece of legislation introduced after World
War II, entitled the Veterans Business and
Professional Loans Act, which was of great
benefit to young returned soldiers starting
up in peacetime careers. I was instrumental
in changing one clause of that bill, by recommending that a group of perhaps five, six
or seven veterans get together as a cooperative. I am wondering why the bill now
before us does not include a provision of
that kind, instead of providing for individual
loans up to $4,000. Possibly the sponsor of
the bill has already considered that aspect
and will tell us, when closing the debate,
whether it is possible for co-operatives to be
formed so that larger amounts than the
$4,000 specified in the bill could be borrowed. If the bill should be passed without
that provision, I think its future inclusion
should be considered.

In this connection, I have in mind the
point raised by the honourable senator from
Southern New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean),
in regard to the clam canning industry. I was
pleased to hear him speak of the wonderful
clam chowder of Lockporte, which is known
from one end of the country to the other.
We in Nova Scotia sometimes raise a smile
by asking the visiting tourist, "What is a
farmer doing when he is digging clams on
his own farm-fishing or farming?" We
create interest in the fishing industry, particularly the clam industry, by raising that
question.
Like the honourable member from Kennebec, and others, I am quite familiar with
St. Francis Xavier University's credit unions
movement; they have done wonderful work.
I recall that in 1943 the Reverend Dr. Coady
appeared before a committee-I believe it
was the Reconstruction and Rehabilitation
Committee-and outlined the work of that
university in regard to credits from 1932
onward. He stated that the Maritime Provinces, with a population of roughly 1,300,000,
have 40,000 people engaged in and entirely
dependent on fishing for a livelihood; and
there are about 25,000 steel workers and
coal miners. It will be seen, therefore, that
fishing is an important industry in the
Maritimes. This bill which will allow the
individual fisherman to borrow as much as
$4,000 to carry on his occupation is a
measure which will be well received by all
people. Speaking not in a political sense at
all, I think the Government is to be congratulated on this fine, helpful piece of
legislation.
As honourable senators were told by the
honourable gentleman who explained the
bill, it provides for loans in the aggregate
of $20 million within a three-year period.
According to the measure as originally
drafted, the loans were to be handled
entirely through the banks. We Pr" well
aware of the efficiency with which the banks
have handled loans on housing developments,
under authority which was only recently extended to them. It is perhaps of passing
interest to note the encouraging extent to
which these loans have been taken up. If
my memory serves me correctly, in the very
brief period in which the banks have enjoyed this authority some 23,000 individual
loans on houses have been made. It may be
said that when the measure affecting loans
on houses was before Parliament we
wondered whether the banks would be able
to handle this type of business as efficiently
as it had been done by certain other lending
institutions.

JULY 5, 1955
When the bill now before us was discussed
in the House of Commons and in a committee of that house, members from the
Maritimes and elsewhere were instrumental
in having it amended to include credit
unions. I give credit particularly to the Nova
Scotian member for Inverness-Richmond,
Mr. Allan MacEachen, who at one time was
on the staff of St. Francis Xavier University
and is very familiar with the work of credit
unions. He placed before the house strong
reasons why these societies should be included as lending sources under this bill.
Personally, I was very ýpleased to see the bill
amended to place them on the same basis as
the banks in this respect.
As honourable senators know, loans under
this measure are to be made at 5 per cent,
which is a reasonable return. From the evidence given before the committee of the other
house, it would appear that the credit unions
have been lending at 6 per cent. Now it will
be up to them to lend to the fishermen at 5
per cent, and the same rate will be charged
by the banks.
In my view the credit unions will be of
greater service to the fishermen than the
banks-and they have a very high reputation
in the lending field; because the banks are
not always located in small villages, and they
are not in as close touch with the fishermen
and their needs as are the credit unions. I
was impressed with the statement by my
honourable friend from Kennebec that the
credit unions rely greatly on the moral
guarantee of the borrower. I venture to say
that 95 or perhaps 100 per cent of loans are
made on that basis.
Before concluding my remarks I should
like to pay a special tribute to the persons
who came from all across Canada, and particularly from Nova Scotia, to appear before
the Banking and Commerce Committee of the
other house to place the case of the credit
unions before it. The Credit Union League of
Antigonish presented a fine brief in which
they showed that they now have 222 credit
unions with a membership of 52,000; that the
unions have savings amounting to $3 million,
and have lent a total of $40 million. Further
they show a rate of loss which would be
envied by many finance companies operating
with greater facilities and highly trained
personnel. I believe experience has shown
that any lending institution which lends a
fisherman $4,000 can be almost 100 per cent
sure that he will repay it. I am sure my
honourable friend from Kennebec will confirm me in saying that the loss on loans made
by credit unions has been almost nil.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: The loss bas been
one-fortieth of one per cent.

Hon. Mr. Isnor: That is remarkable. We in
business get credit information from three or
four sources before we grant credits, and
even then we count ourselves lucky if our
losses amount to only five-eighths of one per
cent.
Mr. Speaker would be justified in calling
me out of order if I made reference to government assistance which is to be given in another form to the fishermen. But in view of
the fact that the honourable senator from
Queen's-Lunenburg made reference to it, perhaps I might also do so. I refer to the 50 per
cent salt fish benefit assistance for which the
supplementary estimates provide $500,000.
In conclusion, I am pleased to join with
those who have expressed their appreciation
to the Government for this fine piece of legislation. I am sure everyone recognizes the
need which this bill will serve, and the fine
type of people who will benefit from it. I
trust that the house will give it unanimous
support.
Hon. Calveri C. Prait: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to detain the house for long,
but I wish to say something about this
measure particularly with respect to its application to Newfoundland.
First, I agree with the bill as far as it
goes; it can do good work where it is
applicable. It will have its benefits only in
relation to the amount of use to which it
will be put, and that use will be governed
largely by the conditions in various parts
of the country. It will have some benefits
for all fishing populations, but for the
province of Newfoundland it certainly will
not be nearly as beneficial as previous
speakers have said it will be for the other
provinces concerned.
In the first place, honourable senators, it
is based on the Farm Improvement Loans
Act which provides for a maximum loan of
$4,000. That does not fit very well into
the Newfoundland picture. To the small inshore fishing boats of comparatively low
value it may apply, but it certainly is not
applicable to off-shore boats which are
coming more into use and run in value considerably in excess of that provided. Those
off-shore boats are still far below the value
of the deep-sea fishing boats which the
honourable senator from Queen's-Lunenburg
(Hon. Mr. Kinley) has referred to. There is
nothing in between which would apply in this
case. It has been mentioned here that the
deep-sea fishing boats run in cost as high
as $100,000. They are not within the provisions of this bill, and possibly rightly so,
because the owners may have other means of
financing. As far as what I term off-shore
fishing boats are concerned, the maximum

SENATE
loan of $4,000 is altogether too small. Probably $15,000 or $20,000 might be a more
appropriate amount for assistance.
I find that this maximum loan of $4,000 is
somehow or other linked with the Government-operated insurance plan, and I cannot
understand just why. That insurance plan
is a great help to fishermen. This $4,000
maximum loan figure is arrived at, I understand, by the fact that it is not in excess of
the insurance coverage, which is 60 per cent
of valuation up to $7,500.00. In that way it
seems that the amount of the loan is fixed to
correspond to the insurance coverage. I do not
think that that makes sense. The conditions
that apply to insurance on the general run
of risks under the Government insurance
plan have no application to the needs of the
fishermen for loans on specific risks and
values.
I was very pleased, as I know we all were,
with the very fine explanation given to us by
the honourable senator from Queen's-Lunenburg when he moved the second reading of
this measure. However, there are a few
points that I will refer to. He said that the
maximum of $4,000 for loans may be regarded
as a starting point and that increased limits
will come as experience is gathered. Well, it
may be so, but I am afraid that the provisions will not be availed of in Newfoundland sufficiently to gather very useful experience, and I will briefly state the reason
why.
The Speech from the Throne at the opening
of this session made reference to this legislation, and during the debate on the Address
in Reply I had something to say on the
matter. At that time I said that, as far as the
province of Newfoundland was concerned,
with its extended coastline, its scattered
population and with the chartered banks
located where they are, I did not think that
the proposed measure could function broadly
enough through the banks. It will, no doubt,
function very effectively in certain areas
where banks are established. But, Newfoundland, apart from Labrador, has 4,000 to 5,000
miles of coastline. This fact is not realized
outside, and I have yet
to meet anyone
from the other provinces, except perhaps,
from the Maritimes, who are aware of this
geographical fact. There are a great many
other features that people on the mainland
do not realize, but no doubt they will learn
in time. Newfoundland, with its long coastline and numerous bays and islands, has not
means of communication comparable with
the other provinces. Everywhere along the
coast, however, there are fishing operations.
It is difficult to see how the banks can
service these risks outside their immediate

areas of operation, and I would point out
that the need for modernization of equipment
is very great and widespread. There are
stretches of hundreds and hundreds of miles
of coast where there are no banks, and in
many of those stretches the need for this
assistance is the greatest.
Honourable senators, like the preceding
speakers, I am very pleased with the fact
that the credit unions have been brought in
under the provisions of the bill. I was really
amazed at the extent of the operations of
these credit unions as described in Nova
Scotia, New Brunswick and Quebec. They
have undoubtedly been a tremendous factor
in the economy of the fishing population and
the fishing areas of these provinces, but in
Newfoundland unfortunately we have not got
such credit unions to take advantage of the
provisions of this bill. There are very few,
if any, amongst fishermen. So what applies
admirably to Nova Scotia, New Brunswick
and Quebec has very little application in
Newfoundland. I may say in explanation
that Newfoundland has been rather unfortunate-and I say unfortunate in the full
meaning of the word-in that the cooperative societies have not had the measure
of growth in our province that they have had
elsewhere. The credit unions are, of course,
the offshoots of the co-operative societies.
Unfortunately, in the early days of Commission of Government the co-operative
movement got off to what appeared to be a
fine start, with a great deal of fanfare. There
were a lot of wise announcements, but time
showed that those wise announcements were
followed by very foolish practices. There was
too much paternalism. The co-operatives were
not allowed, or made, to stand on their own
feet and thus grow and gather strength. They
did not have leadership at the top. Consequently, the co-operative movement in Newfoundland-I am referring to producers' cooperatives, fishermen's co-operatives and so
forth-have not expanded; in fact, they are
on the decline. However, in industrial areas
there are some consumers' co-operatives
which are doing very well.
I might say, however, that the first cooperative society in Newfoundland was
started in the days when the co-operative
movement in the other provinces was in its
infancy. It was established in the north of
the island, at St. Anthony, by the late Sir
Wilfred Grenfell, and that co-operative movement still carries on there. That is one of
many legacies left by that marvellous benefactor of Newfoundland, whom we remember
as our Doctor Grenfell.
But what I wish to say here is that while
this bill will be of advantage in its aid to

JULY 5, 1955
fishermen in some of the provinces, and I
approve of it, I fear that as it is now drafted
it is not going to be of major benefit to
Newfoundland fishermen, and certainly not
to the extent that previous speakers have
anticipated for the other provinces. I wish
just to put on record this remark, that, in
order to make the act more applicable and
valuable to Newfoundland, it should be the
subject of special and constant study. In
ten years' time our province may be served
by credit unions which will fill such gaps
as cannot be occupied by the banks, but we
cannot afford to delay action for ten years;
the fishing industry of Newfoundland should
be able to take advantage of what is
certainly a world wide movement to make
it easier for the producers-in this case the
fishermen-to acquire what they need for
greater production. I suggest, therefore, that
the Department of Fisheries and the other
appropriate federal authorities should be in
continuous negotiation with the Newfoundland
Fishermen's Federation, with the co-operatives-such as they are-with the provincial
Government, with our provincial Fisheries
Loan Board, and any other agencies, including the banks, that can assist in working
out plans which will be applicable to the industry as a whole in our province. Although
the economy of Newfoundland is more diversified today than it was in past years, and
diversification is growing, fisheries mean
relatively more to Newfoundland than to
any other province; and to my mind it is
too bad that this bill, through its limitations,
both as to the amount provided and the
extent of its application, will have so little
significance for our fisheries.
Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,The Hon. the Acting Speaker: If the
honourable senator from Queen's-Lunenburg
(Hon. Mr. Kinley) speaks now, be will close
the debate.
Honourable senators,
Hon. Mr. Kinley:
there is very little I need say about this
bill. We have had a splendid discussion,
very complimentary in character. The bill
was passed unanimously in the other bouse,
and I am sure it will receive the same
treatment here. I was much interested in the
talk on conservation, by the honourable senator from Southern New Brunswick (Hon. Mr.
It seemed to me as though his
McLean).
thoughts were almost good enough to stand
on their own feet and be embodied in a
resolution which would give us the opportunity of a splendid discussion on the preservation of our fisheries.
This subject is not merely of national but
of international importance. Perhaps it is

not realized that Europeans take more fish
from the banks adjacent to Canada than do
Canadians themselves, including Newfoundlanders. Some months ago I had the pleasure
of inspecting a Portuguese fishing fleet in the
harbour of Lisbon. It is the finest fishing
fleet in the world. The boats were all ready
to sail for the banks of Newfoundland. They
carry on a very successful industry; they are
I was
equipped "to the last minute".
impressed with the dignified bearing of the
labour engaged in Portugal's fishing industry.
With them, their occupation ranks as a profession. The would-be fisherman must attend
school for years; his apprenticeship is very
severe; in consequence his country is in the
very forefront of the industry. These people
have some concern with the matter of conservation, because the fishing banks are free
to the nations of the world.
It may be recalled that some years ago I
moved in this bouse the second reading of a
Government bill to make an area division
of parts of the sea in relation to certain
countries which are most interested in the
subject of control. I note that conventions
have been held and that the participating nations are trying to establish a shoreline
limit of ten miles for the control of fisheries.
I believe it is a salutary project, and I hope
it will be put in effect. Conservation generally is an international matter and is
subject to international control.
I listened with interest to the remarks of
the honourable senator from St. John's West
(Hon. Mr. Pratt) in connection with this bill.
I have been associated with him in business
affairs for about thirty years. I remember
that when he first came to this country he was
interested in the activities of our firm; and I
am pleased that he has had such marked
success in the industry of his own province.
It goes to show that a man of ability can do
well even in the older circles of our industrial life. But I suggest that he is a little
over-anxious about the capacity of Newfoundland's lending facilities. Newfoundland has a splendid banking system. My
honourable friend is a director of one of the
banks, and I know that in that capacity his
business experience and his advice are most
valuable. Business in every corner of Newfoundland is now being served by the banks,
and they are doing a splendid job.
It will be remembered that when the subject of loans for housing was being considered
by our committee, representatives of the
banks showed some reluctance to participate.
But the venture has proved so attractive
that they are now keenly interested in it;
they realize that they have entered a good
and productive field. I believe that their

SENATE
experience will be repeated in this industry,
and that as time goes on, the people of Newfoundland will in increasing measure take
advantage of this legislation. The provincial
Government is spending enormous sums to
build up the fishing industry there, and I
think the honourable senator from St. John's
West will agree with me when I say that the
outlook for this industry on the.island is very
good.
The suggestion has been made that this
legislation will not be of much use to the
fisherman with the small boat. But that is
not my opinion;. all that a fisherman has to
do in order to get a loan is to comply with
the conditions prescribed under the bill. I
believe that fishermen in general will take
full advantage of these provisions.
The honourable senator from HalifaxDartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) who is, I believe,
interested in the shore fisheries-because the
Nova Scotia coastline is long and there are
many shore fisheries around Halifax-wanted
to know if an association of fishermen could
take advantage of the provisions for loans.
Well, a fisherman is described in section
2 (f) of the bill as follows:

If a fisherman has a proprietary share in
a fishing vessel with somebody else, it is
only fair to assume that his associate should
be entitled to get a loan in connection with
his share in the vessel. "Prescribed" means
prescribed by regulation.
Under section 3 the purpose of a loan will
be, among other things, for overhauling a
fishing vessel or its hull, superstructure or
engine, the purchase or construction of a
shore installation, the purchase or construction of fishing equipment, and the purchase
or construction of a fishing vessel. I think
honourable senators will find that anything
which has not been covered in this debate
can be explained in committee. After all,
this is a bill which should go to committee.
Everybody agrees with it in principle and
I trust it will receive unanimous approval
on second reading.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

"Fisherman" means a person who has a prescribed interest in,
(i) a fishing vessel,
(ii) a weir, or similar fish catching or trapping
device, that is affixed to the ground, or
(iii) a proprietory share in a fishing vessel or in
a weir or fish catching or trapping device
described in subparagraph (ii),

On motion of Hon. Mr. Kinley, the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

and whose principal occupation is participation in
a primary fishing enterprise.

DIVORCE
PROCEDURE-QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE

The Hon. the Acting Speaker informed the
Senate that messages had been brought from
the House of Commons returning certain
divorce bills and acquainting the Senate that
the Commons have passed the said bills without amendment.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
may I have consent of the house to speak
at this time on a question of privilege? I do
not intend to enter into any lengthy discussion about divorce at this time. My purpose
in rising is to suggest that at the opening of
next session members of this house hold a
conference on the question of divorce procedure.
Yesterday I sat in the gallery of another
place during a debate, and I was very much
hurt by the attitude shown by certain honourable gentlemen there with regard to a few
divorce bills passed by this house. I do not
know the details of the evidence adduced in
connection with the particular divorce bills
that were under discussion, but I do know
that in the courts of our land the trial judge
-and in this matter our Divorce Committee
corresponds to a trial judge-is always considered the best judge of whether a witness is
telling the truth or not in any trial held
before him, so much so that the court of
appeal will never upset the finding of fact
of a trial judge unless it is so repugnant to
justice that no other course can be taken.
I have some suggestions to make with
regard to our divorce proceedings, not in
criticism of the operations of the present
Divorce Committee at all, but on the over-all
problem of divorce procedure in this house,
particularly on the question of how we should
handle divorces, in view of the rising criticism
in another place. The reason I rise to say
these few words at this time is so that between now and the opening of next session
honourable senators may spend some time
thinking about this problem, and that when
they attend the conference which I suggest
should be held at the opening of next session
they will have made up their minds as to
what ought to be done.

Just one more word, honourable senators.
I have had nearly fifteen years experience
serving on the Senate Divorce Committee,
and I know at first hand of the unselfish work
done by members of that committee, not for
the Senate, but for the people of two provinces. In the criticism that is being levelled
at the proceedings of our committee I do not
think we are getting a fair deal. As a senator
and a lawyer I should like to have the whole
matter discussed among ourselves before we
strike committees at the next session, so as
to determine if any change can be made in
our procedure or if any understanding can
be arrived at for avoiding these clashes between another place and ourselves on this
subject of divorces. I am not citing any
particular case. Critics in the other place
may be right; but I do not think they are.
I thank the house for permission to make
these few remarks. I hope that between now
and next January, or whenever Parliament
shall reassemble, honourable senators will
consider this whole matter and come here
prepared to offer suggestions as to how this
very, very vexed question can best be
handled.

INTERNATIONAL TRADE
CONGRESS OF INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF
COMMERCE AT TOKYO-DISCUSSION,
INQUIRY AND ANSWER

Hon. Calvert C. Pratt rose in accordance

with the following notice:
to

That he will draw the attention of the Senate
the recent Congress of the International

SENATE
Chamber of Commerce at Tokyo, Japan, and will
inquire of the Government:
1. Will the recently concluded negotiations with
Japan under the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade supplement the terms
of the trade agreement signed between Canada
and Japan in 1954?
2. If this is the case, what are the more important respects in which GATT will supplement the
earlier agreement?
3. In the light of the announcement made at the
above-mentioned Congress of the formation of the
equivalent of an international bank, to be known
as The International Finance Corporation, with
authorized capital of $100 million, and the fact that
in the supplementary estimates for the fiscal year
ending March 31, 1956, the Government has provided for the purchase of 3,600 shares in the
amount of $3,600,000 in United States currency(a) In what areas is it proposed that the International Finance Corporation will operate?
(b) Who is going to run it and how will it be
managed?
(c) Is it intended that the capital be used as a
revolving fund and, if so, how will this be
done?
(d) To what extent is it felt by the Government
that this Corporation with the finances available will be able to achieve its purpose?

He said: Honourable senators, having reference to the Notice of Inquiry standing in
my name for today, I feel it will be interesting and, I trust, useful to inform this bouse
of the proceedings of the Fifteenth Congress
of the International Chamber of Commerce
which it was my privilege to attend in May of
this year at Tokyo, Japan.
The deliberations were on subjects of paramount importance to all nations and were
carried on with a very wide background of
practical experience. At the Congress there
were 924 delegates from 42 countries. Every
continent was represented. It was a most
interesting experience to sit in amongst representatives from Iraq and Mexico, Brazil and
Viet Nam, Pakistan and Sweden, the Philippines and the Belgian Congo, Australia and
Germany, just to mention a few to illustrate
how widespread were the homelands of the
delegates. It can well be imagined how
diverse were the approaches to many of
the problems that were brought up for discussion, as well as the complexity of those
problems.
Tokyo being the headquarters of this Congress, Japan naturally had the most delegates,
with 262 in attendance. The United States
came next with 103; India, France and Indonesia had in the 50's, the United Kingdom
36, and Canada 34. This conference was
under the chairmanship of the President, Mr.
Camille Gutt, who is undoubtedly doing a
job worthy of world recognition. During
the period of the meetings at Tokyo, the
Congress was saddened by the news that the
newly-elected President, Mr. George A. Sloan,
had died at New York. His death deprived

the organization of the very valuable leadership which such an eminent figure in industrial and cultural affairs would have
provided.
I think in order to make my comments on
this Congress as meaningful as they should
be, it will be useful for me to tell you something of the International Chamber of Commerce, which is not nearly as much publicized
as its functions and its usefulness in world
affairs really warrant. The I.C.C., as it is
termed, is a sort of co-ordinating body for
the organizations of commerce and finance
throughout the world, and, in general, its
purpose is to help people do business with
one another wherever freedom of trade is
a recognized factor. It is about 35 years old,
has its permanent headquarters in Paris and,
except for the period of the Second World
War, bas held its international Congress every
second year.
As the Chairman of the
Japanese committee recently put it, its lifetime bas been "35 years of wind and rain".
In Canada we have the Canadian Council
of the International Chamber of Commerce,
very ably led by the President, Mr. R. C.
Berkinshaw, C.B.E., LL.D., and the General
Manager, Mr. Carl Bergithon. Both of these
gentlemen played a very valuable part in the
deliberations of the Congress. Our colleague,
the Senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McKeen) is, as you know, a member of the
Canadian executive body.
Needless to say, the I.C.C. has no administrative powers over its members in the parent
countries, directly or through the Congress.
Neither can it speak with authority for any
country.
The organization, however, can
provide the facts, build up the case, and
give invaluable guidance to those who have
the responsibility for the laws, rules and
regulations whereby people in various lands
can deal most advantageously and equitably
with each other. It can be the supporter and
the constructive critic and, in fact, the policy
builder as occasion demands for the organizations existing for the development of world
trade, such as GATT, the international bank
for reconstruction and development, and
others. How useful it can be in facilitating
and expediting international trade depends,
to a great extent, on how closely the trade
organizations within its orbit have the attention and co-operation of various governments.
Because of the wide background of experience possessed by its members, I cannot
think of a more useful medium for the gathering of constructive information and exchange
of views.
At this Congress 51 resolutions were passed,
aimed at lowering barriers and making easier
the fiow of international trade and finance.

JULY 6, 1955
One could be sceptical and lightly pass off
the significance of the long list of decisions
on matters of wide variety, but separate
committees, each in its own specialized field,
have wrestled with the problems, sometimes
over years, and could speak with particular
knowledge.
Before passing on to a summary of some
of the matters of interest to us, may I make
this further observation about the general
usefulness of the I.C.C. It should be remembered, in appraising the value of this organization and its affiliates and component parts
throughout the world, that those who compose
them are the very ones whose ambition and
interest-personal interest, if you like-are
in successful and enlarged international trade,
whose job it is day by day and hour by hour
to wrestle with the problems involved. Theirs
is not an academic nor purely administrative
experience and interest-theirs is the job of
seeing the goods actually made and produced,
seeing a value put on them by buying and
selling, seeing them paid for and shipped.
All the problems of international trade are
right in their laps day by day. Of vital concern to them is an extension of trading within
and without all countries. The widening of
the avenues of distribution for products by
increased purchasing power of peoples is of
greatest practical concern. Their views on
policies to be adopted will differ with circumstances of business and countries, but it is
too often overlooked by governments and the
general public that the implementation and
practical application of the rules, regulations
and laws governing international trade fall
on those in business who direct commerce in
all its branches.
The I.C.C. is the only economic organ
which links the international trading bodies
and persons of the world in close association, and I would say again that it is my
hope that the governments of the various
countries will take the deliberations seriously
and weave into public policy the results of
the experience of those who know the issues
involved in world trading, even though they
do not know all the answers.
I would ask your permission to digress for
a moment from the main subject of this talk
to emphasize by illustration the benefit of
closer collaboration of government and business in international negotiations on foreign
trade. In 1931, being President of the Newfoundlan.d Board of Trade, it was my honour
and privilege to accompany, by invitation, a
Canadian trade mission to South American
Republics on a specially chartered steamerthe Prince Robert. The mission consisted of
150 Canadians, with one Newfoundlander
holding a watching brief. While it was a
50437-49

trade mission under the auspices of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Canadian
Manufacturers' Association, it had official
Government recognition through the presence
of Sir George Perley, then in the House of
Commons, the Honourable C. P. Beaubien and
the Honourable H. H. Horsey of the Senate,
as well as some administrative officers of
Government. Some provinces also had official
representatives. A marked feature of that
mission, and one which largely contributed to
its success, was its constitution of representatives of both business and government.
Ordinarily-though, of course, not alwayson such visits to foreign countries, delegates
of governments meet only delegates of other
governments and representatives of industry
meet only their counterparts in other countries. What I feel is needed is more frequent
association of representatives of government
and trade in missions abroad, so that administrators of public policy will learn, at first
hand, of the practical difficulties of interchange of goods and business executives will
learn of government policies.
In the 1931 Hansard of both houses there
are extended reports on the mission. I refer
to them now for just one purpose: to say that
I found there just what I expected to finda tribute to the fact that the joint nature of
the mission produced concrete results on the
spot. It was not just an academic or administrative survey of conditions in the Southwith hopes aroused and results deferred, as
we see in so many cases these days.
I will quote the words used by the late
Senator Beaubien in summarizing the benefits
of that trade mission:
First: Good will,
Second: Concrete accomplishments by
trade contacts,
Third: Understanding trade difficulties.

active

I am convinced that frequent trade missions, composed of government delegates in
highly responsible posts and business men
truly representative of the trade best suited
for development between Canada and the
countries visited, would have far-reaching
benefits.
I shall now bring to your attention some
details of the proceedings of the Congress at
Tokyo. I shall confine my remarks to matters which may have the greater significance
and interest to us in Canada, although I
would qualify that by saying there is no
practical way in these times of divorcing
things of international consequence from those
of national concern.
The opening session was addressed by the
Prime Minister of Japan, Mr. Ichiro Hatoyama, and the representative of the United
Nations, Mr. James Keen, as well as the leading officials of the I.C.C.

SENATE
As the Congress was held in the East, and
for the first time in the East, it was natural
that its central theme should be announced
as "Asian Problems and World Progress".
The I.C.C. Commission on Asian and FarEastern affairs which functioned to study and
promote economie advancement in the East
was composed of delegates from Burma,
Ceylon, India, Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan,
the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam.
The headings of the discussions throughout
the Congress may be summarized:
1. Freer trade for world prosperity.
The discussion in the general meeting on
this all-important subject was presided over
by our own Mr. R. E. Berkinshaw, the Chairman of the Canadian Council. Under this
heading came trade and tariff policy in the
world today, the future of GATT, the new
plans for reducing customs tariff and similar
matters.
2. Fair competition--A factor in industrial
and commercial progress.
3. International co-operation for stability
in the world markets for primary
products.
4. Progresstowards a new monetary order.
5. Asian development and world economy.
Within these categories were group discussions by members experienced in the particular fields. Such discussions held outside
the general meetings were on many topics,
including:
Freedom and progress in ocean transport,
International commercial arbitration,
Administrative obstacles to trade,
Standardization of commerce and banking
practices,
Air transport in the service of economic
development,
Flag discrimination as applied to shipping,
Public and private investment in economic
development,
The International Finance Corporation,
Nuclear power and economic development,
Convertibility of currencies and economic
problems in Asian regions,
Need for a balanced pattern of development in agriculture, primary products and
industry.
Surely one might say this is a formidable
list for a week's congress, but it is well to
remember that separate and regional bodies
within the organization have made one or
other of these topies their special concern
over the years.
I will now attempt to give you some specific information and views on certain of these

matters, but I can only be expected, I am
sure, to touch the fringe of them.
The subject of the use of atomic energy in
the industrialization of Asia received outstanding attention both at the Congress and
in the press of the East. The discussion was
led off by the well-known and eminent industrialist, Mr. John J. Hopkins, Chairman and
President of the General Dynamics Corporation and of Canadair Limited. His organization, as honourable senators are aware, is
generally regarded as a world leader in the
field of promotion of atomic power for industry. In a speech regarded as of far-reaching
importance, he emphasized the need for speeding up industrial development in the East.
To repeat his words, "Asia will continue to
languish indefinitely in economic chains" if it
has to depend on the kind of historical development that characterized industrialization in
Western countries. How true such a point of
view is, can be realized when we think of
the increasing knowledge by Eastern people
of the outside world by reason of improved
facilities for education, communication and
travel. This knowledge serves to impress them
with the progress of the more advanced
countries while, at the same time, it accelerates the dissatisfaction with the depressing
and primitive conditions of living in some of
their homelands.
Mr. Hopkins advocated the formation of
an atomic energy community devoted to the
cause of greater industrialization in Eastern
countries. The reaction of the Japanese English-speaking press, as well as of the Eastern
delegates, as far as one can judge, was that,
while cautioning against expectation of speed
in that direction, they expressed gratification
at the fact that an eminent body of scientists,
business and government leaders were concentrating their thoughts on Asian problems in
such a constructive way.
At this point I would like to bring to your
attention for a brief period some other
thoughts on the Asian position in world trade.
Although 16 Free Asian countries contain 760
million people, or nearly one-third of the
world's population, they now account for a
little more than one-tenth of the world's imports and less than one-tenth of the world's
exports. I mention this to bring out the fact
that their proportionate share of world trade
has declined since World War II, notwithstanding that a considerable number of independent countries have come into being in
that period and have expressed an active
policy of development.
Asian countries have a tremendous variety
of raw materials required by the West, but our
part of the world cannot continue to regard
the East just as a source of supply for our

JULY 6. 1955
manufacturing plants. We complain-and
with some practical reason-of the low prices
entering into competition with our products.
The answer of long-range importance-and
time is speeding on in this respect-is for
the West to encourage the industrialization
of the East, so that by the higher standards
out there the world trading area and purchasing power will expand, benefiting everybody.
Experience has shown that trade cannot be
successful on a one-way road. Whether the
Western world views it with favour or otherwise, industrialization is not going to be confined to the West. That does not mean that
industrialization of the East will necessarily
take the pattern of the West. While the
people of Japan, for instance, have shown a
marked aptitude for industrial processes, that
does not indicate that the Eastern populations
will or can use to any great extent the
streamline methods of Western peoples. The
Asian approach to work does require the employment of more people and, certainly, more
hours than in the West, for the same volume
of turnout; hence for that and other reasons
the use of payroll rates alone as the yardstick to measure relative costs is wrong and
misleading.
In this connection also I had an interesting
sidelight on the differences between the practices of Japanese industries and those of
Western countries. In reviewing an official
publication of the Japanese Federation of
Employers' Associations, I noticed the surprising fact that the basic wages or "takehome pay" of employees is relatively small
compared with total payment for employee
account. They quoted figures to show that
in the years 1948-1951 basic wages, varying
of course with years and industry, were as
low as 30 per cent and as high as 62 per cent
of the total payments made directly to workers and on their behalf. A review of a publication in 1954 by the Labour press of Tokyo
conveyed the same impression and also
stressed the relatively low per capita labour
productivity as a national problem, although
inseparable from the problem of overpopulation.
The West may well be expected to hold its
lead 'in industry fo generations, if not for
centuries, but it will gain far more by having prosperous peoples in the East than by
having, as neighbours, impoverished millions.
For one thing is certain-geography as a
separating factor is finished and all peoples
are destined to live in one neighbourhood.
Thought in the Western world, and on the
North American continent, in particular, is to
my mind too circumscribed by the urge just
to protect what we have. What I mean is
that we are too "protectionist-minded". Tariffs
are frequently used as a protection for wages
50437-491

and costs that are allowed to run up beyond
what, in some industries, is economically
sound in the world. They are sometimes a
cloak for inefficient management and inadequate modernization of methods and, further,
they are often a shelter under which are
made types and classes of goods which those
abroad might make better and thereby provide themselves with the means to buy from
us what we can produce more favourably.
Do not misunderstand me; there is nothing
practical in an overall repudiation by us or
by any one country, of tariff protection in the
world today, but the evils lie in the excess.
We, right at home-and, if I may add, the
United States also-should keep ourselves
under constant examination to avoid the
evils of these excesses.
I mentioned the contribution to the discussions of the Congress by Mr. J. J. Hopkins.
I would like also to mention another figure
who received outstanding attention. He was
Mr. Russell H. Dorr, head of the World.Bank,
Far-East Section. Incidentally, in meeting him,
I had the pleasure of renewing a friendship
of many years. Mr. Dorr presented to the
Congress the framework of the International
Finance Corporation, the plan of operation
for which is now before the 56 member
nations of the World Bank. The United
States, it was announced, has agreed, subject to legislative sanction, to subscribe for
$35 million worth of shares in the corporation.
The United Kingdom, I believe, has suggested
a subscription of $141 million and Canada's
contribution, as shown by the Supplementary
Subscriptions
Estimates, is $3à million.
range all the way down to $2,000 by the
Republic of Panama. We were informed at
the Congress that when $75 million has been
placed by member countries, the plan will
come into effect. The General Assembly of
the United Nations on December 11, 1954,
endorsed the I.F.C. idea by a vote of 50 in
favour with none against, but with 5 abstentions. I have given notice of inquiry
concerning certain aspects of our Government's point of view on this investment. The
announcement, however, that was made by
Mr. Dorr, stated that the objective is to
encourage productive private enterprise and
to provide capital in ventures where private
investment is committed but is inadequate.
The fund, it was stated, will not be used
where there is public or government investment in a particular project. Also, according
to a statement made, it is intended to function in the less-developed areas of the world.
It appears to be a very worthy project, but
one cannot help feeling that the funds provided are of very modest Droportions.

SENATE
The policy of a return to convertibility of
currencies amongst nations received close consideration at the Congress. This matter is of
very great importance to Canada as a chief
exporting country. The general statements
did not minimize the difficulties, nor, indeed,
the frustrations where convertibility may fail
in practice and be revoked. It seemed to
be the general thought that the world situation now is favourable to a show of leadership in this respect by the United Kingdom
and certain other countries. It has been
officially expressed by the I.C.C. that exchange
control, while unavoidable in some instances,
is still one of the worst obstacles to advancement of world economy. Governments of the
day, while weighing the chances of maintaining stability of currencies-if once free from
control-do not give sufficient weight ta the
possible contribution, by increased competition, to extension of world trade and thus
build stability on its own success. International Chamber of Commerce Councils
throughout the world were urged to keep the
issue prominently before their respective
governments. Mr. Anwar Ali of Pakistan,
Director of the Middle East Department of
the International Monetary Fund, made a
notable contribution to the discussion on this
particular subject. As we know, the International Monetary Fund has resources equal
to around $9 billion, of which $3, billion is
in gold and dollars. The Fund's resources,
he pointed out, are available for the encouragement of its members to move effectively
towards the establishment of currency convertibility or striving to maintain it. The
Fund regards the objective of convertibility
on a stable basis as the very foundation of
an effective system of multilateral trade. Convertibility is not a favour conferred by one
country on another.
It must harmonize
with national policies, and it is hoped that
leaders in countries the world over will become more conscious of what a powerful
instrument it can be for achieving internal
stability, external balance, increased production in trade and a higher standard of
living. The cancellation of control in Canada,
freeing of U.S.-Canada dollar transactions,
was a progressive example. The step-by-step
policy, generally speaking, has been too slow,
sometimes over-cautious, sometimes too much
influenced by politics to heed even the advice
of the best financial authorities. One gathers
the impression that forthright leadership in
this matter of currency convertibility is lacking in some of the countries that are most
favourably placed in respect to their position
of accumulated reserves.
Restrictions of freedom of shipping and
what is termed "flag discrimination" have
been a matter of resolutions by Congress

after Congress, but time has seen restrictions
getting more onerous. The freedom of the
seas is becoming more and more challenged.
That freedom is fundamental in movement
of traffic, for, after all, the economical and
efficient movement of commodities is of
much greater importance than just employment on ships-as necessary as this is.
According to a brief presented, we learned
that there are 16 countries which have
bilateral agreements for control of cargo
movements and nine of them took unilateral
action and dictated use of their own ships
where control of cargo was involved. India
is one of the leaders in dictating policy of
confining cargoes to their own boats. Ocean
freights are much higher in some cases,
double what they were a short while ago.
Controls may have a lot to do with it and
may have a material effect on an exporting
country such as ours. Canada was not cited
as one of the offenders in that respect. It is
my opinion, however, that we shall do well
to be more closely on our guard than we
are, against the limitations imposed by our
inland and coastal shipping laws. That, however, is another subject.
Administrative obstacles to trade was the
subject of many resolutions calling for correction. It is amazing to see how many
trivial-or what appear to be trivial-regulations can obstruct movement of trade.
Consular invoices, for instance, are sometimes an outstanding abomination. Some
countries seem to aim at paying for Consular Office expenses by a charge for Conand other documentary
sular invoices
requirements, which, actually is a cover for
additional protection for their own industries. Valuation of goods for duties other
than the purchase price tends to double up
on the tariff charges. One country watches
another in this matter and there seems to
be a race not to be outdone. A bill, I understand, was introduced in the United States
Congress in 1954 which would have amended
their valuation laws, but action was deferred.
One country does a valuation stunt for duties
and another just slaps it in the face by
similar action, and on it goes. Consequently
I think that our provision for the revaluation
of textiles last year was of doubtful value
from the long range point of view. The I.C.C.
holds to the principle that the contract price
paid or payable, as proven by invoice, should
normally be the basic value on which goods
are assessed for Customs purposes. In fact,
I feel it is thoroughly sound.
The hindrance to freer trade and greater
productivity throughout the world by double
taxation as between countries was a prominent issue. For years past, the collaboration

JULY 6, 1955
of the I.C.C. with the League of Nations on
this subject served as a basis for most of
the existing double taxation treaties. The
I.C.C. has recently taken a step further in
the matter by recommending to the Economic and Social Council of the United
Nations, recognition of the principle that the
country of origin of profits, rather than the
country of residence, should have the sole
right to tax the profits made. In this connection, I might add that, in the ensuing
discussion, it was emphasized that certain
of the less-developed countries are now
endeavouring to attract capital by exempting earned income on new industrial undertakings. The thought was freely expressed
that such profits should not be taxed in a
country where the operation has no connection.
The need for arresting the trend, wherever
it is shown, towards economic nationalism
was one of the keynotes of the Congress.
While it is not always in evidence, the
countries which are the farthest advanced
industrially should, in their own interests, be
the most conscious of the fallacy of hedging
themselves in by excessive tariffs and other
restrictions. It is a policy plausible but shortsighted, seemingly justifiable but practically
wrong and, while it might actually provide
present relief, is undeniably loaded with
future disaster. It should be remembered
that technology is no longer confined to a
few countries. The spread of technology is a
feature of some of the areas of great populations which we shall all need as trading
partners, for the exchange both of raw
materials and finished products.
The General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, or "GATT", as it is termed, came in
for extended study and exchange of views.
The Canadian delegation introduced to the
Congress, a policy statement and resolution
supporting the revision and the proposed
creation of the new organization for trade
co-operation. It called upon all governments
to give effective and practical application to
the policy with the least possible delay.
The Congress was fortunate in having in
attendance Mr. Eric Wyndham White, General
Secretary of GATT. I shall not use your time
to discuss this subject which is constantly
before us in Canada. I think we are fortunate that Canada, through the Government
and organized industry, is taking -a leading
part in that fine instrument for freer trade.
As we all know, it is not perfect by any
means. It needs to be able to act more quickly
in making decisions and readjustments than
it does. It does, however, keep the member
countries in touch with one another's needs
and, undoubtedly, helps maintain the system
of multilateral arrangements. I think I can

say it was a fairly general view at the Congress that, without GATT or something
broader and better to replace it, the world
would fall into narrow sections for trading
and currency dealings which would be too
restrictive to contemplate.
The trade of GATT signatory countries
accounts for 80 per cent of world commerce.
Canada's trade with those countries is about
90 per cent of our total trade. For GATT
or any world organization with similar ideals
to perform its function in a far-reaching way,
there needs to be a greater realization
throughout the world of the mutual advantage of give and take, with not all "give"
expected of some and an attitude of all "take"
attributed to others. The movement needs
more prominence in world thought and understanding so that it will operate on a plane
worthy of its concepts.
I should like to make a particular reference
to Japan, which was our host country for
the Congress. As we know, last year we
entered into a Canada-Japan trade treaty.
The general substance of that treaty was that
Japan agreed not to discriminate against
Canada in favour of any other country in the
purchase of a list of products such as grains,
flour, woodpulp, certain metals and other
commodities which rank high in the list of
Canadian exports to Japan. I heard complaints in Japan, although not officially, of
the unbalanced trade between the two
countries.
In 1949 during the occupation, Japan balanced its trade with Canada at $5 million
arid, in 1950, at about $6 million. After trade
had come under Japanese control, our exports
in 1953 to that country, amounted to about
$118 million, and, our imports from there to
about $131 million. In 1954 they bought from
us goods to the value of $96 million and we
purchased from them $19 million worth.
Japan has been, in very recent years, our
second best customer for grain, having bought
from us in 1954 about $50 million worth of
wheat and $13 million worth of barley. I
cannot take the time to go into the details
which this particular subject warrants, but
I suggest we should be liberal in our outlook
and attitude so as to preserve the good will
and co-operation of this very valuable trading
partner.
And now, honourable senators, here is
something which struck home to me very
forcibly as a practical example of Japan's
foresight in improving its international relations. I was intrigued when I first heard of
the Canada-Japan Society. It is a full-time
organization functioning actively and composed chiefly of Japanese with Canadian

SENATE
associations in business and other spheres, as
well as some Canadians residing in Japan.
I made inquiry and found there are no less
than sixteen such societies in Japan. I have
listed them for the record:
Afghanistan Society.
Turkey Society.
Italy-Japan Society.
India-Japan Society.
Great Britain-Japan Society.
China-Japan Cultural Society.
Canada-Japan Society.
Australia-New Zealand-Japan Society.
Hungary-Japan Cultural Society.
Brazil-Japan Society.
America-Japan Society.
Argentine-Japan Society.
Israel-Japan Society.
Indonesia-Japan Society.
Philippine-Japan Society.
These societies represent a voluntary movement of citizens in various walks of life designed to cultivate greater understanding and
good will in their world contacts. Certainly
this is an idea we could well borrow from
these resourceful people and use in the cultivation of our relations with them and people
of other lands.
I would like to use this occasion to express
appreciation of the personal courtesy extended
to me by Mr. Yahachi Kawai, the President of
the House of Councillors, or, as we would
call him, the Speaker of the Senate. It was
with great interest that I availed myself of
the opportunity of attending at the Upper
House of the Diet while it was in session and,
after receiving numerous introductions, I
could watch-even if I could not understand
-the proceedings of their committees.
I feel very sure that all present at the
Congress in Tokyo were most impressed with
the friendliness and warmth of welcome
extended on every hand.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I am sure we have all listened with great
interest to the remarks of the honourable
gentleman from St. John's West (Hon. Mr.
Pratt). It was not incumbent upon him to
deliver this address, but we are indebted to
him for telling us something of what took
place at the recent very important Congress
of the International Chamber of Commerce.
The fact that it was held at Tokyo made it
memorable in itself. Tokyo must be a most
interesting city, and to have gone there was,
I am sure, a treat for the honourable senator,
which he has now shared with us by telling
us of some of the things that he saw and
heard there.

The honourable gentleman bas also given
his views on certain questions which concern
fiscal policy, and I have no doubt his address
will be read with interest by those in the
other house who are responsible for making
fiscal policy. All in all, it has been an entertaining and informative address, and we are
indeed grateful to him.
On June 22 the honourable senator gave
notice as follows:
That he will draw the attention of the Senate
to the recent Congress of the International
Chamber of Commerce at Tokyo, Japan.

He bas now done that, and very well indeed.
His notice also stated he would inquire of

the Government:
1. Will the recently concluded negotiations with
Japan under the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade supplement the terms
of the trade agreement signed between Canada
and Japan

in

1954?

2. If this is the case, what are the more important respects in which GATT will supplement the
earlier agreement?
3. In the light of the announcement made at
the above mentioned Congress of the formation
of the equivalent of an international bank, to be
known as The International Finance Corporation,
with authorized capital of $100 million, and the
fact that in the supplementary estimates for the
fiscal year ending March 31, 1956, the Government
has provided for the purchase of 3,600 shares in
the amount of $3,600,000 in United States currency(a) In what areas is it proposed that the International Finance Corporation will operate?
(b) Who is going to run it and how will it be
managed?
(c) Is it intended that the capital be used as a
revolving fund and, if so, how will this be
done?
(d) To what extent is it felt by the Government
that this Corporation with the finances
available will be able to achieve its purpose?

It happens I have the answers to these
questions, and they are as follows:
1. Yes.
2. Both the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade and the trade agreement between
Canada and Japan deal with all important
matters in the trading relations between the
two countries.

Their articles cover such matters as mostfavoured-nation
treatment, safeguards respecting the application of import restrictions,
and non-discriminatory
treatment in
the
application of domestic regulations and taxes.

In addition, the Canada-Japan Agreement
provides for non-discriminatory treatment by
Japan in the import licensing of a number
of important Canadian products.
The GATT supplements the Canada-Japan
Trade Agreement in the following ways:
Because

it has 34 adherents, the GATT

provides for multilateral consultations on
trade matters of common interest. It provides
the machinery for such consultations and a

JULY 6, 1955
permanent staff to assist in preparing appropriate background. This machinery can also
be used in matters involving disagreement.
The GATT also deals in more extensive
detail with such questions as customs administration, marking regulations, subsidies,
security matters and the procedures for
negotiation and binding of tariff concessions.
3. (a) The Corporation would be authorized
to make investments of its funds in productive enterprises in the territories of its
members, particularly the less-developed
countries.
3. (b) The IFC will be an international
organization affiliated with the International
Bank which will provide, in association with
local and private investors, risk capital for
financing the establishment, improvement and
expansion of productive private enterprises
in member countries when other sources of
funds are not available on reasonable terms.
Its members will be members of the International Bank affiliated with the Bank
through common membership in their Board
of Directors and Board of Governors. The
articles provide that the members of the
Bank's Board of Executive Directors and their
alternates shall exercise ex offßcio the same
offices in the IFC if the countries they represent in the Bank become members of the
Corporation. The President of the Bank is
Chairman of the Board of Directors of the
IFC. The President of the IFC is appointed
on the recommendation of the Chairman and
the concurrence of the Board of Directors of
IFC. All powers of the Corporation are
vested in the Board of Governors and they
may delegate to the Board of Directors authority to take all but certain specified major
actions. Each member bas 250 votes plus
one additional vote for each share of stock
held.

IFC is a legal entity separate and distinct
from the Bank and its functions must be kept
separate and apart from the Bank. However,
it is authorized to make use of facilities,
personnel and services of the Bank.
3. (c) It is intended that the IFC will provide venture capital but it will not be authorized to invest in capital stock or to assume
the responsibility for managing an enterprise
in which it has invested. It will not be a
holding company retaining its investments on
a long term basis, but will dispose of its holdings to private investors as opportunity off ers
so that it can reinvest its funds in new activities. In this sense, the IFC will be revolving
its funds.
3. (d) Experience with the International
Bank gives good reason to hope that the new
affiliate will be successful in achieving its
purpose.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Honourable senators, I
should like to ask the honourable gentleman
from St. John's West (Hon. Mr. Pratt)
whether Poland is a member of the International Chamber of Commerce. I am interested because we have heard a great deal
about the recent sale of some nine million
bushels of wheat to Poland. If Poland happens to be a member of the International
Chamber of Commerce, perhaps a statement
of that fact would help to shorten some discussion which is taking place in the other
house at the present time. Also it might
help solve the question of whether Poland is
a friendly nation.

understand, the problem is receiving the
treatment which had been requested.
Section 2 of the bill deals with insurance.
As honourable senators are well aware, the
annual depreciation on a property is governed
by the regulations which have been made
under the provisions of the Income Tax Act.
Each year a company is entitled to deduct
from its income the various proper charges
for depreciation on various forms of its
property at the various rates prescribed by
the regulations. At the present time the act
provides that when a building is destroyed by
fire, or by some other means, and insurance
is recovered by the taxpayer he is required
to take the whole of that payment covering
the depreciated part of his building into income in the year in which he receives it.
By this amendment, which is an alleviating
amendment, it is provided that the taxpayer
who receives an insurance payment for destroyed property may defer taking the insurance proceeds into the income of his
company in the year in which he receives it,
if in the following year he devotes that
insurance payment to the replacement of
the property which had been destroyed. In
this way he begins immediately to depreciate
the building again without what was considered under the former law to have been
some unjust deprivation.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable senator a question? I do not understand
that. Is he referring only to the depreciated
value of the building, or the whole amount
of the insurance which is collected? Must the
taxpayer reinvest the full amount of the
insurance collected next year in a new building to escape its being taken into income?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Yes, Senator. To the
extent that he does not reinvest proceeds of
the insurance, he does not get the advantage
of the amendment.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: If he pays part of it
does he get the advantage of the part he pays?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: If he pays part of it,
he gets the advantage of the part he pays.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In the past, insurance
money has not been considered income when
paid for a capital asset that has been
destroyed.
Hon. Mr. Connolly:

I know that is quite

true, Senator. But I am talking about the
50437-50

insurance with reference to the depreciated
portion of the building.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That was the point to
which my question was directed. I take it
that it is only with respect to the depreciated
part of the building that you make these
references?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Yes, indeed, because
that is the only part which has been written
off against current income from year to year.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I understand.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: I am sorry if my
answer was not clear.
I should like to refer next to sections 3
and 4 of the bill. Hitherto the Income Tax
Act has provided that income from property
transferred by a husband to a wife or children
remained taxable in the hands of the husband. The bill provides that in the event of
the husband's death, or in the event that
he ceases to be a resident of Canada, or if
he becomes divorced, that income becomes
taxable in the hands of the recipient of the
income, the wife or the children, as the case
may be.
Section 5 deals with a taxpayer with the
status of an unmarried person, who is supporting another person who is wholly dependent upon the taxpayer, and who is related to
the taxpayer by blood, marriage or adoption,
and where the support is being provided in
a self-contained domestic establishment. Now,
when all of those conditions obtain, the taxpayer providing the maintenance is entitled
to the additional $1,000 exemption allowable
to a married person. Under the act as it
stands today, if such a dependent person
receives any support whatever from another
person, even if that other person is related
to the dependent person, the benefit of the
exemption is lost. This amendment provides
that several members of the same family can
contribute to the support of a dependent
person, and the $1,000 exemption will still be
available, but as between the members of the
family it must be settled as to which one of
them will take the exemption. It cannot be
divided.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And in the case of a
disagreement, who would get it?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: In the case of disagreement I think it probably would be disallowed.
Section 6 provides for a 2 per cent reduction in personal income tax from January 1,
1956. Subsection 3 of that section provides
for one per cent reduction in personal income
tax from January 1, 1955; or, to put it
another way, it provides for 2 per cent reduction from July 1, 1955.

come shall be entitled to make a deduction

JULY 7, 1955

for any depreciation or capital cost allowance which is made in the year in which he
receives his income.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Would the honourable senator give us an illustration of that?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Yes. Say Mr. X receives

$10,000 a year income from an estate and

he is the sole income beneficiary. Say the
depreciation allowance at normal rates provided in the regulations under the act amounts
to $2,000. Whether Mr. X has an interest
in the residue or not, he will be taxable hereafter not on $10,000, but on $8,000 only.
That is, he will get the benefit of the depreciation. One of the reasons for the change
is that in most provinces trustees are not
allowed to accumulate reserves on account
of depreciation. The Income Tax Division
felt that since trustees could not accumulate
reserves for depreciation ultimately to be
used for the residuary beneficiaries, after
the life interest was over, then why not let
the life tenants have the advantage? I think
it is a fair proposition, because if the life
tenants do not get it, nobody gets it. Now
the government is going to collect a little less
tax, but it is going to be a little more helpful
to life tenants in estates, and a good many
of these are people who are left without
active support other than the support provided by an estate. The change will help
a good many people who are dependent on
unearned income.
But, honourable senators, there is one exception to this rule, and that exception
applies in the situation where the estate manages a business. This exception arises out
of a case which I am sure the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and perhaps others know about,
namely, the John Ross Robertson estate case.
In that case the residuary heirs felt that they
should be allowed to accumulate whatever
benefits would accrue from the establishment
of a reserve for depreciation, so as to create
a fund to replace the business premises when
they had become obsolete. The business in
that case was a large Toronto newspaper. In
such a case, the benefit of the depreciation on
the residue of the estate can be built up in
a reserve for the ultimate use of the residuary
heirs.
Now, honourable senators, that is a rather
complicated situation, or at least I make it
rather complicated by my explantion.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is complicated.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: But I feel that when it
is looked at it will commend itself to all
honourable senators for its fairness.
Section 14 imposes a 20 per cent income tax
on investment companies, and the reason for
50437-50J

it is a simple one. Canadian taxpayers who
receive income by way of dividends from
Canadian corporations are entitled to make a
20 per cent deduction from those dividends
when filling out their income tax returns.
The one exception has been income received
by way of dividends from investment companies. That income was not taxed in the
hands of the investment companies, except
such companies that volunteered to pay the
tax. It is now proposed that all investment
companies shall be taxed, and from now on
the people who receive dividends from such
investment companies will be able to make
the 20 per cent deduction. That is simpler
for the dividend receiver, and simpler to
administer.
I am happy to say that section 17 is not a
complicated one. It merely provides that
capital expenditures undertaken for research
are to be allowed from the time they are
incurred, and need not be postponed until a
later time, as is required under the present
legislation.
Section 18 also is simple. An error of one
word was made in the French translation,
and it is corrected by this amendment.
Section 19 is designed to relieve from
double or multiple taxation payments from a
profit-sharing plan when, by some rearrangement or reallocation, amounts previously
taxed against an employee under the plan are
computed in some new payment or new allotment which is made to him. The purpose of
this section is that if the employee has been
credited with a certain amount and taxed
thereon, and in sone way, as a result of a
reallocation of benefits under the profitsharing plan, it happens to be credited to him
again, it will not be subject a second time
to tax.
Section 21 has been inserted in the Income
Tax Act annually for a number of years. It
provides for a three-year exemption from
income tax for a company deriving income
from a new mine. It is now proposed, in the
interests of encouraging the mining industry,
to make this feature of the Act a permanent
one. The section also contains a definition
by implication, stipulating what is not a mine.
I think the committee might well look at that
paragraph of the section.
Section 22 is somewhat similar to the one
which I last discussed. It deals with exploration and drilling costs for petroleum wells,
natural gas wells and mines, and provides
that these costs shall not be taxable and shall
be deductible for a company which incurs
them. This provision in its present form
originally came into the act in 1949, and was
annually renewed in the interests of encouraging the oil, the gas and the mining business.

SENATE
It is proposed now that the section shall be
a permanent feature of the act. It does not
apply to deep test wells.
Section 26 would delight accountants,
because it deals with reserves for containers.
It has relation to companies which sell products in containers-for instance, oil companies which sell oil in drums. I do not
think that it is a provision on which we need
spend much time, and I propose to pass
over it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is it applicable to milk
bottles?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Yes, I think so. On
second thought, I recall that bottles are
specifically excluded.
Section 27 deals with sales of inventories
and accounts receivable. A number of court
decisions have determined that the sale of
the assets of a business, not being in the
ordinary course of business, is therefore
exempt from income tax, and is considered
to be a capital return. It is now proposed
that these transactions shall not be dealt with
as a capital return but shall be taxable. The
method of taxation is not to be merely through
the addition of the amount received by a
vendor to his other income for the year in
which the amount is received. He is given
the option of paying a special tax at his
average rate for the previous three years.
I think this is a section which would bear
some further explanation and investigation
in committee. I believe I have given the
substance of it very faithfully, if not too fully.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: The honourable senator
does not mean to say that merchandise sold
en bloc at any one time is to be taxed on the
returns of the previous three years, irrespective of the amount?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Not when it is done in
the ordinary course of business. If the transaction takes place in the ordinary course of
business the normal rates will apply. This
section has reference only to the sale of
complete inventories and accounts receivable
on the winding-up of the business.
New section 85G, with reference to mortgage reserves, is a rather interesting one and,
I think, helpful. It provides for deduction of
a reserve on loans on the security of a mortgage. At the present time the only reserve
that can be set up against loans on a mortgage
account is a reserve for doubtful debts. This
has not been particularly satisfactory. It is
now proposed that a maximum reserve of 3
per cent of the outstanding amount due on
a mortgage or a group of mortgages may be
set up, but not all in one year. The reserve

can be set up at the rate of a quarter of one
per cent per year, to a maximum of 3 per
cent.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That provision is for
a company, not for an individual?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: I think the individual is
also entitled to the benefits of the clause. I
cannot read in the section a restriction to a
company. Certainly it is available to a company, but the text mentions "a taxpayer
whose business includes the lending of money
on the security of a mortgage", and an individual could carry on such a business. The
provision, I may observe, is something which
the committee might well inquire into,
because if it is intended to apply only to
companies perhaps the wording could be
improved.
There is also a provision that at the end
of a year, if it is found that the mortgages for
which the reserve was set up are paid in full,
the amount of the reserve must be added
back. The provision seems to be a step forward.
The third point in connection with these
sections is that under section 85F of the
Income Tax Act a new definition is provided
for conducting a business on a cash basis.
This is a rule which has been applied in the
department for a number of years and is now
being put into the law. It applies to farmers
and to professions.
Section 29 of the bill provides for a new
section in the act. It deals with a situation in
which a company that has built up an earned
surplus is taken over by another one. As
honourable senators know, at the present time
dividends paid by one Canadian company to
another Canadian company are tax free. It
is also known that a company acquiring control of a Canadian company, which latter
company has an earned surplus, cannot take
that earned surplus tax free. It must pay a
15 per cent tax upon that earned surplus, and
that is done under old section 9 5 A of the
Income Tax Act, which is now section 105A.
Honourable members are familiar with the
pattern, because it has been adopted in a
great many cases in the last few years, A
tax-free surplus is created by paying a 15
per cent tax on the whole or a portion of the
earned surplus that it is ultimately proposed
to pay out. Then preference shares are issued
and the designated tax-paid surplus in question is used to redeem those shares. When
the redemption is carried out the money paid
into the hands of the preference shareholders,
is tax-free money. But there have been some
anomalies. In every case where a security
dealer or a foreign corporation or a charitable
corporation took over one of these companies

JULY 7, 1955
having an earned surplus, the tax rate at
which they could get that earned surplus out
was less than 15 per cent. For example, the
security dealer could write off any loss
incurred by his business in that investment
because he is a dealer in investments. A
Canadian company is entitled to pay dividends to a non-resident parent upon payment
of a 5 per cent tax. Accordingly, if a foreign
corporation took over one of these Canadian
companies with an earned surplus it would
pay only a 5 per cent tax when it passed the
surplus on to its parent. It is now proposed
that in the case of a foreign corporation and
in the case of a charitable corporation taking
over one of these companies with an earned
surplus, regardless of how they do it, the
tax they will pay on that earned surplus will
be 15 per cent when the earned surplus is
passed to the parent.
For some reason I cannot explain, when
a security dealer takes over such a corporation he is going to have to pay 20 per cent
when the earned surplus is paid out. However, that is something that might be cleared
up in committee. I inquired about it from
officials of the Income Tax Division, but not
the Department of Finance, and someone
from that department will appear before the
committee to explain this anomaly.
The only other section I should like to
refer to in detail is section 33, which provides that in a criminal case the signature
on a return, certificate, statement or answer
made under some provision of the Income
Tax Act shall be received as prima facie
evidence by a court. That does not mean
everything in the document makes proof of
itself. It simply means that the Crown does
not have to prove the signature on the document. It also, of course, leaves room for
the accused to be able to controvert the
signature if necessary.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is that only in criminal
cases?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: I think so, Senator.
The section is almost self-explanatory. If
the honourable gentleman would care to
have me read it I will do so. I think it
applies only in a case where a charge has
been laid for an offence under the act.
Section 1 of the bill also deals with terminal payments made into a pension fund
at certain times on behalf of an employee
who severs his employment before normal
retiring time.
Section 8 deals with payments under
profit-sharing plans. It deals also with payments made in recognition of long service
and payments made as death benefits. It
allows the tax on such payments to be paid,

at the option of the taxpayer, in accordance
with a formula that is specifically provided
in the section.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Must that formula be
approved by the income tax authorities
prior to the date of making the grant?
Hon. Mr. Connolly: No. The formula provided is available to the taxpayer, if he
wishes to use it, or be may pay the tax in
the normal way.
Section 10 of the bill deals with foreign
tax credits as a result of the provision with
respect to provincial income tax.
Section 11 repeals section 54(6) of the act,
which was obsolete.
Section 15 prohibits a non-resident owned
corporation from deriving more than 10 per
cent of its income from rents in Canada.
Section 16 excludes from the definition of
a foreign business corporation those Canadian companies which derive more than 10
per cent of their income from the leasing
or operating of ships or aircraft.
Section 23 þrovides that Crown corporations are not to be considered associated
corporations, and this is related to clause 1(2).
Section 24 deals with the reduction in
corporate rates for a special category of
companies, namely, electric, gas or steam
utility companies.
Section 28 provides for a tax on the
premium paid by a company when it
acquires or redeems its own shares.
Section 30 deals with a problem that
has arisen with reference to timber royalties.
Section 32 removes the tax inequity which
has developed in cases where a foreign
borrowing
provides
parent
corporation
power for its Canadian subsidiary. I have
read that section carefully and I think it is
a particularly equitable provision.
Section 34 provides that certain business
undertakings may have a 53-week fiscal
period under certain restrictive conditions
provided in the act. It also supplies much
needed definitions, including one which
assimilates to the position of a parent not
only a father-in-law but also a mother-inlaw!

PUBLIC OFFICIALS SALARIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved the
second reading of Bill 507, an Act to amend
the Income Tax Act, the Railway Act and
the Tariff Board Act in respect of salaries of
certain public officials.
507
He said: Honourable senators, Bi
provides for increases in the salaries of the
chairmen and other members of three
boarcis, namely, the Income Tax Appeal
Board, the Board of Transport Commissioners and the Tariff Board. The explanatory notes set forth the salaries that have
been paid for some years past, since they
were last increased. The salaries provided
for in this bill have a direct relationship to
those established by the amendment to the
Judges Act which was recently passed in
this house.
I might point out that this bill, with its
projected amendments to the three acts,
represents the fifth in a series of salary increases for federal government officials. First,
in 1953 the rank and file of civil servants
were given an increase; secondly, in 1954 an
increase was granted to the deputy ministers;
thirdly, the incomes of senior civil servants,
assistant deputies and directors of departments were increased; fourthly, a bill was
passed this year increasing the compensation of judges in all the courts; and now

lastly, and I understand finally, by this bill
it is proposed to increase the salaries of
the three boards mentioned.
It should be said that regardless of the
salary rates established in the various bills
passed, maximum superannuation benefits
are based upon an income of $15,000 a year;
therefore, where the provisions of this or any
other legislation result in an increase of an
official salary to more than $15,000, the
salary in excess of that amount will have no
bearing on the amount of pension payable.
I think it is unnecessary to describe the
functions of each of these boards, or the
services rendered by the distinguished gentlemen who occupy the positions of chairmen of
the boards. If honourable senators wish any
explanation as to the standard of salaries
established by this measure they can get
that information in the appropriate committee of the house by having the head of the
Treasury Board, Mr. Deutsch, appear to
answer any questions we may wish to ask
him. I think it should be pointed out, however, that the Railway Act provides that the
Chief Commissioner of the Board of Transport Commissioners shall be paid an annual
salary equal to that of the President of the
Exchequer Court.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That has not been
changed?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: No. His status is provided fo'r under the Railway Act, and that is
statutory, so this bill has no effect at all on
that point. Under the recent amendment to
the Judges Act the salary of the President
of the Exchequer Court was raised to $18,500,
so the salary of the Chief Commissioner of
the Transport Board has to be set at that
same figure. The other two boards, the Income Tax Appeal Board and the Tariff Board,
are regarded as being on the same plane as
a court. The salaries of the chairmen of
these boards are kept in line with the salaries
paid to puisne judges of the Exchequer
Court and of the superior courts of the various provinces.
Honourable senators, if any further information is required as to the services rendered
by the chairmen and members of these boards,
or as to their qualifications, it may be readily
obtained in committee.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I note that the increases
are not equal in all cases, as they were in the
Judges Act. Some salaries are being increased by $2,500, and some by only $1,500.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The increases of $2,500
a year apply to the members of the boards,
with some exceptions, including the Chairman of the Tariff Board, Mr McKinnon, whose
salary is being fixed at the same amount as

SENATE

that of the Chairman of the Income Tax Appeal Board. As to Mr. McKinnon-and in
making these references I certainly do not
intend to be invidious to others-I would
point out that he has occupied his present
post since 1940, and for fifteen years before
that he was associated with the Tariff Board.
He is deserving of special appreciation at
this time. Since 1948 he has performed judicial functions. It will be remembered that in
that year the Tariff Board really became a
court. Previously, appeals under the Customs
Act and Excise Act were heard by the Board
of Customs, but from 1948 onward, they were
made to the Tariff Board, the Board of Customs having been eliminated from the machinery of government. Since that time over
two hundred cases have been heard by the
Tariff Board. Of that number, in only fifteen
cases has permission to appeal from the Tariff
Board's decision been granted; five of these
have proceeded to appeal, and judgments
have not yet been handed down. So it may
be said that the batting average of the Tariff
Board in its quasi-judicial status is very
creditable indeed.
I should like to place on record appreciation
of the services which over the last thirty
years have been rendered by the Chairman of
the Tariff Board. In my opinion he renresents about the ideal type of civil servantself-effacing, industrious and able. With some
of our distinguished diplomatic heads-Mr.
Norman Robertson, now in England, and Mr.
Dana Wilgress,-he bas served in Washington
and at the trade conferences which followed
the war and thereby has done much to bring
about an improvement in international trade
relations. I say this with no invidious reflection on other civil servants, of whose work
also I know something.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I want to pay my tribute
to them.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The honourable gentleman has made an appropriate reference and
paid a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Hector
McKinnon. I wonder if he would like to
mention some of the others.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I am glad to do so. The
Chairman of the Transport Board, who had
a distinguished career as a diplomat and a
judge, has had brought before him, particularly during the past three or four years, a
great deal of work which the board never
had to deal with before. As everyone knows,
it was required to pass upon a series of very
important cases in connection with railway
rates. It has also been engaged on an entirely
new class of investigation in relation to gas
and oil pipe lines. These cases involved a

fund of knowledge and a type of approach
which had not been required of former boards.
I have no hesitation in saying that we shall
be justified in giving this bill second reading
and having it considered further, if necessary,
in committee. The increase in salaries follows that granted to the other four groups
which I have mentioned. This is the fifth and
last. While it is rather risky for anyone to
venture an opinion about future increases
in salaries, I should think that at the very
least we would be entitled to very definite
reasons for future increases. The arguments
about inflation and the pleas for increasing
our standard of living, which have been behind the introduction of most legislation calling for increases in salaries, have reached a
point where if anything further is done the
authorities will have to start all over at the
bottom with the rank and file and work up
again. The question which naturally arises
in one's mind is this: If deflation occurs will
the order be reversed and will the reductions
start from the top and move down, or will
they start from the bottom and move up, as
the increases have? However, until that
situation arises I do not think we need worry
about it.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators,
I am largely in agreement with what the
honourable gentleman from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) has just stated, and I should
like to take this opportunity to say a few
words about the Income Tax Appeal Board,
which was established as a direct result of
work of the Senate. In 1945, on motion by
the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Campbell), a special committee was appointed to conduct an investigation into the
provisions and workings of the Income Tax
Act and the Excess Profits Tax Act, and
in its report the committee recommended the
establishment of an Income Tax Appeal
Board. The board which was subsequently
set up represents one of the most important
achievements of the Senate. I am more
familiar with its work than with the work
of the Tariff Board or the Board of Transport Commissioners. In carrying on my business I find it important to read religiously
the decisions of the Income Tax Appeal
Board, for they affect most taxpayers in my
province. The members of that board do
highly important work, and their present
salaries are not in line with salaries being
paid officials in comparable positions. I
therefore have no objection to the salary
of the chairman being raised to $16.900,
although I do not know how the increase is
arrived at. In my opinion $16,900 is certainly not too much to pay the person holding
this responsible position.

JULY 12, 1955
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The salary increase
is the same as that which has just been given
to our judges.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It is an increase of
$2,500?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators
who read the decisions of the Income Tax
Appeal Board will realize that its members
do just as important work as do the judges
in our provincial courts and courts of appeal.
As I say, I have no objection at all to increasing the salary of the chairman of this
board, and I think my remarks can be taken
generally as applying to the personnel of the
other boards covered by this bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall the bill be read the
third time?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Next sitting.
TRANSPORT BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. G. Peter Campbell moved the second
reading of Bill 449, an Act to amend the
Transport Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the principle behind this bill is nothing new. The
principle of agreed charges was first introduced into Parliament in 1938, when the
original Transport Act was brought in. Agreed
charges were introduced by reason of the
competition which the railways faced from
As
truck transportation in this country.
honourable senators know, the railways have
been regulated as to rates whereas trucking
companies have not been regulated in this
regard. There was some suggestion in 1937
that regulations should be established for
ail forms of transportation in Canada, but the
Government, realizing that such regulations
would infringe on provincial rights, did not
bring in legislation for this purpose; but in
1938 it introduced the Transport Bill to
provide for control of rates in so far as transportation facilities under the jurisdiction of
the dominion authorities were concerned.
As I have stated, the railway companies
requested the privilege of making agreed
charges. For those who are not familiar
with the term "agreed charges", I might
say that there is a provision contained in the
law permitting the railway to go to a shipper
and make a special contract at a rate lower
than the normal tariff rate for the exclusive
right to move that shipper's goods or a
portion of them between certain competitive

points in Canada. The trucking companies,
of course, had that privilege, for they had
complete freedom of action to make special
deals with shippers to move the whole or any
portion of their goods, and it was felt that
the railway companies should enjoy the same
privilege.
The original legislation is set forth in detail
in Part IV of the Transport Act, chapter 271,
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1952. That legislation provoked a good deal of discussion, as
it was something entirely new to this continent, although similar legislation had been
in force in the United Kingdom, and, I think,
in France. Great caution was taken, therefore, to see that the railways were restricted
and that any shipper or carrier who might
be adversely affected by the new procedure
could be heard before the Transport Board.
The legislation was drafted in such a manner
that any party affected could, within thirty
days of applying to the board, ask to have the
rates changed. The act provided that thirty
days' notice must be given by publication in
the Canada Gazette, so that everyone who
might be affected would have an opportunty
to know what rates were being imposed. As
honourable senators will appreciate, that was
a somewhat cumbersome procedure, because
it did not enable the railways and the shipper
to make a firm agreement which could become
effective immediately. It was soon found
that a shipper would come forward and intervene in the proceedings and take delaying
action, so that often the final decision of the
Board of Transport Commissioners was
deferred for months, and sometimes over a
year. This resulted in only a few agreements
being made providing for agreed charges.
During the first twelve years the act was in
force, I think about forty agreed charges were
put into effect by the railways.
In 1954 the Honourable W. F. A. Turgeon
was appointed to investigate this particular
phase of the Transport Act, and his report
was tabled in Parliament in February or
March of 1955. The report was carefully
prepared, after thorough consideration of
evidence given at hearings which took place
across Canada, and at which everyone concerned was given an opportunity to make
representations. It recommended simplification of this particular legislation dealing with
agreed charges; in fact, I think it contained
an appendix suggesting specific changes to
the act, much like the changes embodied in
the present bill. The amendments proposed
in this bill are towards simplification of the
procedure, and nothing else. Whereas up to
the present time, as I have already stated, the
agreement could not come into effect until
approved by the Board of Transport Commissioners, under the bill the agreement can

SENATE
come into effect after it has been filed with
the board and twenty days have elapsed. So
the railways will no longer require approval
of the board to make their agreement effective.
In order to protect other shippers, so that
there will be no discrimination in favour of
one shipper as against another, the amendments provide that any shipper who considers himself aggrieved or discriminated
against by reason of the establishment of
agreed charges which are less than normal
tariff charges, may give notice to the railway
that he also wishes to have the advantage of
these charges; and provided that his goods
are of a similar class and the conditions of
transportation are similar in every way, the
railways may admit him to the agreement
without any further procedure, in which case
he also gets the benefit of the reduced rates
from the date the original agreement came
into effect. If the railways do not approve,
there is a procedure by which he may apply
to the Board of Transport Commissioners to
have a fixed rate established, so far as be is
concerned. At the time of such application
the usual inquiries are made as to whether
he has shipped similar goods under similar
conditions, and so forth.
Another slight change enables the water
carriers to come in and benefit by agreed
charges. In certain cases the movement of
goods across Canada is partially by rail and
partially by water. Under the present legislation water carriers are not able to come in
and benefit by these agreed charges, although
they have the right to make a special contract
if they wish. The procedure under the bill
enables water carriers to join in the railway
agreements and thus benefit by the special
charges or agreed charges in so far as transportation by water is concerned.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Were water carriers not

excluded under the act in 1938?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Certain water carriers
were included; that is, those carrying package
freight.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: But not bulk cargo?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Under the original act
bulk cargo includes grain and grain products,
and flour, and ore, and all such things as are
generally classed as bulk cargo. Any conpanies engaged in bulk transportation are
specifically excluded from the act, and are
not restricted in any way. As a matter of
fact, there has been considerable litigation
between the railways and the water carriers
so far as agreed charges are concerned, but
under the present measure it is made a little
more flexible and a good deal more simplified, so that all regulated companies engaged
in transportation can benefit by the special
arrangement.

Hon. Mr. Isnor: As I recall it, they were
originally excluded under the act of 1938.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: There was an attempt
to include them. I had the privilege of
representing the bulk carriers at that time.
The matter was very carefully considered
and dealt with in the House of Commons and
by a committee of that house, and later it
resulted in quite an issue before the Transport and Communications Committee of the
Senate. The members of that committee
approached the problem in a very realistic
manner, and after extensive hearings the
legislation was changed, very much against
the wishes of the minister who had promoted
the legislation. I think that was a sound
amendment, because it has stood on the statute books ever since and no attempt is being
made by these proposed amendments to vary
it. It is, in my opinion, another illustration of
the importance of the sober second thought of
this chamber in dealing with legislation of a
commercial character affecting the daily lives
of people in Canada and companies engaged
in the important public business of transportation.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask a question?
Does that mean there is competition between
the railways on the matter of rates?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: No. The Railway Act
still applies to the ordinary tariffs, and the
railways will continue to file their tariffs in
the usual way. This is merely a special provision enabling them to make separate agreements for the movement of the goods of one
or more shippers under special circumstances and conditions.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does that not mean
that a shipper can perhaps play one railway
off against the other?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: No. I should have
mentioned that both railways must join in
such an agreement. When this bill was introduced in the other house it provided that
both railway companies must be parties to
the agreement. By an amendment passed in
the other place the bill now provides that
the competing rail carrier must consent to
the agreement in writing or join in the making of it. For example, the Canadian Pacifie
Railway Company can make an agreement
with a shipper, but it must be consented to
by the Canadian National or any other competing railway.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If the railways agree on
a rate, does the Board of Transport Commissioners have any further authority over it?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: The consent

Transport

Board is not required initially

result of action taken by the minister or
the Governor in Council.

which could be readily explained in committee by someone much more familiar
with it.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Or by any of the shippers affected?

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It could not be better
explained.

Hon. Mr. Campbell: No. Under the present
legislation a shipper could intervene before
an agreement came into effect. Under the
proposed new procedure he no longer will
have that right, but he may ask that the
rate contained in the agreement apply also to
his goods. If the railway does not consent
to his request there is a procedure by which
he may apply to the board to have the rate
fixed. In that respect relief is provided for
him, but as a matter of practice it is unlikely
that a shipper wishing to ship his goods would
be deprived of a rate given to another
shipper.

Hon. Mr. Campbell: A further benefit will
accrue to the shippers under a proposed
amendment which enables American railways to participate in part of a rail movement, by reason not of any action taken by
them but of action taken by the Canadian
railways. In other words, where it would be
more beneficial to move goods in part by
Canadian route, thence by an American route
and back to the Canadian line, an agreed
charge would include that portion of the
route over which the goods were carried by
an American railway. In that respect the
shipper has the alternative of perhaps choosing a more economical route through the
United States. It is further provided that
American railways cannot enjoy this benefit
except in so far as the railways operating in
Canada are concerned, and only then between points in Canada. In other words, they
cannot have these benefits to operate over
part of the American system and also the
Canadian system, but are confined to competitive points within Canada.
The new section 33, which was introduced
in the other house, sets forth in some detail
the basis for dealing with companies with
respect to agreed charges which have been
in effect for at least three months. It provides
that any carrier or body of carriers may
complain to the minister that an agreed
charge is unjustly discriminatory. In that
case if the minister is satisfied that the
complaint is a reasonable one he may refer
the matter to the Board of Transport Commissioners for investigation. The Governor
in Council also has the privilege of referring
such a matter to the board, if the public
interests are in any way affected.
From my reading of the proposed amendments they seem to me to be a step towards
the modification of a new system of rate
making which is essential to the operation
of railways in Canada if they are to be in a
position to compete with trucks and provide
adequate transportation facilities for Canadian shippers.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Excuse me for asking
so many questions. Is there any limitation
on the term of these agreements?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Under the present
procedure the Board of Transport Commissions requires a clause to be inserted in the
agreements that after the agreement has
been in force for a year either party may,
after giving notice, terminate it. The bill
provides for termination by either party upon
notice after the agreement has been in effect
for one year. In effect, it is an annual agreement but it may continue beyond that period
if no notice is given.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Would it be fair to say
that the only competition is between the railways and the truckers, with respect to agreed
charges?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: What does my friend
mean by "the only competition"?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: The -competition comes
from the truckers, does it not?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: That is where the
entire competition comes from. The trucking
industry is not affected or regulated in any
way by this legislation. This measure is
necessary because the truckers are able to
make special agreements with the shippers,
and the railways say that they must be
allowed to make similar arrangements.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That seems fair enough.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Perhaps I am taking
an undue amount of time to explain this bill,

Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Would my honourable
friend allow a question? The Railway Act
contains a clause providing that no carrier
can avoid his responsibility in the course of
carrying merchandise, unless approval for
doing so has been granted by the board.

SENATE
Will that clause apply to this legislation in
the same way it applies to the act in general?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I would say very
definitely it would, because this is just procedure in so far as rate making is concerned
and it could not in any way affect the provision of the Railway Act.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

INTERNATIONAL TRADE
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. A. Neil McLean, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Canadian Trade Relations, presented the committee's report.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Canadian Trade
Relations beg leave to report as follows:
1. Pursuant to the order of reference dated
February 24 last, whereby your committee was
authorized to inquire into and report on the most
practical steps toward further implementation of
Article 2 of the North Atlantic Treaty, your committee has heard submissions from two leading
members of the Food and Agriculture Organization
of the United Nations.
2. The submissions made during this session of
Parliament as well as during the previous two
sessions have made your committee conscious of
the widespread interest being shown in other
countries, as well as in Canada, in the subjectmatter under consideration and a genuine desire on
the part of member countries in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization for further integration on an
economic basis.
3. Your committee hoped that during this session
of Parliament it would have been possible to
complete its hearings and submit a final report for
the consideration of this honourable house. However, a careful analysis must be made of the submissions by various groups which will involve a
concentrated study on the part of a person or
persons qualified to assist the committee in the
preparation of its recommendations.
4. Your committee, therefore, is desirous that
during the next session of Parliament your Canadian Trade Relations Committee be authorized to
complete its work under the Order of Reference.
Your committee also hopes that the basic work will
have been achieved during the intervening period
between the sessions and that its final submissions
may be made to Parliament at the earliest possible
moment during its next session.

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable

senators, when shall this report be taken into
consideration?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. McLean: With leave, now.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
this is the first time I have seen the report.
I believe one of the recommendations it contains is that at this session of Parliament the
committee should be re-constituted for next
session. I doubt if we have the power to do
that. I may be wrong.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I suggest that the report
should stand until tomorrow.
The Hon.

PUBLIC OFFICIALS SALARIES BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved the third
reading of Bill 507, an Act to amend the
Income Tax Act, the Railway Act and the
Tariff Board Act in respect of salaries of
certain public officials.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Paul H. Bouffard moved the second
reading of Bill 506, an Act to amend the
Customs TarifT.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Explain.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Honourable senators,
the law which applies to the customs tariff
at the present time provides very well for
an anti-dumping duty, but there is no provision to protect Canadian industry against
subsidization of products by foreign countries
when such products are imported into Canada.
The present customs tariff provides an antidumping duty, in section 6. The main purpose
of the bill before the house is to enact new
section 6A which provides for the imposition
of an anti-subsidy duty which, it is intended,
shall apply in cases where the anti-dumping
duty is not applicable.
The subsidization may take various forms.
It may be paid directly or indirectly. Sometimes the final product is subsidized. At other
times the material embodied in the final
product is subsidized. At still other times it
takes the form of government trading losses.
Such cases happen when the government of
a country buys the product and sells it at
a lower price.
Several conditions must exist for the
application of the legislation provided by the
present act. First: there must be a subsidy
in one form or another paid by a government, or there must be a government trading
in a product at a loss. Furthermore, such

subsidization must cause or threaten to cause
a material injury to an established domestic
industry, or retard materially the establishment of a domestic industry. Unless these
two conditions exist there will be no application of the anti-subsidy legislation or antisubsidy duty.
The present legislation is necessary to fill
a gap. For instance, let us consider that a
product is normally sold on the market of
the country of origin at $1 apiece. The government of such country decides to pay to
the manufacturer a subsidy of 20 cents
apiece. Immediately, the local market may
fall to 80 cents. In such a case our antidumping legislation could not apply, because
the price of 80 cents is the market price in
the country of origin. In such a case, the
Governor in Council may apply the present
anti-subsidy duty.
Contrary to the existing anti-dumping
legislation, the anti-subsidy duty is not mandatory. It would be impossible to ask the
customs officials to make such inquiry as
will decide the amount of subsidy paid by
foreign government, or inquire as to whether
a government sells a product at a price lower
than the price of purchase. Neither could we
ask the customs officials to decide whether
such a subsidy materially injures a domestic
industry or retards the establishment of such
an industry in Canada. The responsibility
for such decision would fall upon the Governor in Council. It is impossible to provide
safer means of application of an anti-subsidy
duty.
The present legislation is not directed
against any particular country and is not
to be applied against any particular known
shipments. It is a simple closing of a gap
to allow the government to face subsidization
which is actually paid by many countries to
dispose of their surplus or help local industries. Other countries have closed that gap.
For instance, the United States levies a
special duty on Canadian cheese to offset a
subsidy paid by our government to cheese
producers. The United Kingdom has recently
announced its intention to introduce similar
anti-subsidy legislation.
The discretion given to the Governor in
Council will be exercised strictly within the
limits agreed to under GATT-the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade-and will
not be used lightly or irresponsibly. Canadian
businesses will be disappointed if they hope
to get new protection by merely showing that
foreign subsidization exists. Each case will
be examined carefully on its merits, and a
thorough inquiry will be made as to the two
conditions required by the law before this
legislation can be applied, namely, the

JULY 13, 1955
existence of a subsidy, and its possibly serious
effect on our Canadian industry. However,
the government will be able to use the legislation as and when it is deemed appropriate
to do so.
Honourable senators, I think that deals
with the main part of the bill. The other
sections amend Schedules A and B to the
Customs Tariff. For instance, section 2 of the
bill amends Schedule A as proposed in the
budget speech of the Minister of Finance on
April 5, 1955. Section 3 is an amendment to
Schedule A introduced by the Government
on June 2, 1955. Section 4 is an amendment
to Schedule B introduced on April 5, 1955,
and section 5 is an amendment to Schedule
B introduced on June 6, 1955.
I have tried to familiarize myself as much
as possible with the details of the changes
proposed by the Government in these different schedules. I do not think it is necessary for me to deal with each section, but I
shall be pleased to answer any questions
as far as possible, if any honourable senator
desires the details of any change. I feel
that I am in a position to explain any of the
sections,' and that should avoid the necessity
of sending the bill to committee. May I add
that there are at least 150 items contained in
the schedules, and there are no increases
except in one or two cases, and these are the
result of re-negotiation in accordance with
GATT. All the other items reduce the tariff
or redefine the product without making any
change in the tariff, but most of them reduce
the tariff to some extent.

to fight against such a subsidy. The antisubsidy law applies only where a Canadian
industry is materially injured or the establishment of a Canadian industry is retarded
unduly. I do not call that protection; I think
that is the proper treatment to be accorded
to our Canadian manufacturers and traders.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Can the honourable
senator give us a single instance, in actual
fact, of that occurring?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I am told by officials
of the department that not a single case of
that has occurred up to the present time, but
they want to be in a position to meet the
situation when a foreign government buys
or subsidizes a product and then undertakes
to dump that product in Canada. That situation would be met by imposing an anti-subsidy duty which would be equivalent to the
amount of the loss incurred in the humping or
the subsidy paid by the foreign government.
At the present time many foreign governments give, or intend to give, subsidies to
their local industries, or are buying on their
local market products which they keep for
a long time and later dump in other countries
at prices below cost. Those are the two
situations that have to be met.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: Can the honourable senator
state who has the authority to consider these
cases and to decide when, where and how,
and to which industry and on what product
the duty shall be applied?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Section 6A, subsection
1, makes that very clear:

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I should like to ask the
honourable gentleman a question with regard
to the proposed new section 6A. This seems
to be a long distance away from free trade,
and I should like to know if it is not strictly
a protectionist measure.

Where in the opinion of the Governor in Council
subsidized goods of a class or kind made or produced in Canada have been or may be directly or
indirectly imported into Canada, he may declare
such goods to be subject to an additional duty on
their importation equal to the amount of the subsidy on those goods as determined by him.

Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It is not by any means
a protectionist measure. It is designed to
prevent importation of goods of a class or
kind made or produced in Canada which have
been subsidized by a foreign government. I
do not think anyone would consider it reasonable that a price which a Canadian manufacturer sets for his goods in the local market
should have to compete against a subsidy
which is paid on the production of these
goods in a foreign country. I will cite an
example. Let us take a product which is
made in England and is selling at $1. The
British Government decides that the industry
ought to be subsidized and gives a subsidy
for export purposes of 50 per cent, which
means 50 cents apiece. I do not think honourable senators would consider it just and
reasonable that our local industry should have

So the Governor in Council has a completely free hand. He has to make the inquiry and find out, first, if a subsidy is
being paid, and if so the amount of it; and,
secondly, if the subsidy hurts a Canadian
industry or permits the establishment of a
similar industry in Canada. It is only when
the department is convinced that it is necessary to do so that an anti-subsidy duty will
be imposed.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: It applies only to goods of
a class or kind made or produced in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Exactly.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: May I ask another question of the sponsor of the bill? I have always
been of the opinion that we had an adequate
anti-dumping duty law in Canada. That being
the case, why could the manufacturer of

SENATE
goods of this kind in Canada not be protected by the imposition of a dumping duty
instead of in the way proposed by this measure? It seems to me a back-hand way of
accomplishing something that is already provided for in the statutes.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: If there were provision
for it in the statutes I do not think there
would be any thought of imposing an antisubsidy duty, but unfortunately there is no
such legislation.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I think there is.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: The dumping duty legislation we have applies only to a product sold
in Canada or imported into Canada at a price
lower than that at which it is sold on the
local market in the country of origin. A product which is manufactured in England to be
sold at $1 .may be subsidized by the government of that country to the extent of twenty
cents. That is applicable to the sale of the
goods on the local market as well as on
the export market. Consequently, a product which sold in England at $1 previous
to the subsidy is then sold in that country
at eighty cents. If it is exported to Canada and sold here at eighty cents, or exactly
the English market price, the dumping duty
law would not apply, because the goods
come to Canada to be sold at the same price
as on the local market in the country of
origin.
It is for that reason that Parliament has been asked to approve this antisubsidy legislation.
May I add a second reason, which did not
come to me from any of the officials but is
my own thought in the matter. While in
some cases there might be a 100 per cent
subsidy, the dumping duty cannot exceed 50
per cent of the value of the goods. If a product that was sold in England for a price of
$1 was subsidized to the extent of 60 cents
and exported to Canada, the 50 per cent
dumping duty imposed here would be ineffective.
In my opinion these are the reasons for
this proposed legislation.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I cannot let the opportunity pass without making some comment with respect to
this type of legislation. To say that I am not
enthusiastically in favour of it, is rather
understating the case. This particular legislation is in fact protective legislation, and my
friend from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
is quite right in his observation on it.
In the first place, the problem of dumped
and bonused goods is vastly overestimated.
There may be some instances of it, but in my
experience I have never come in touch with
an instance where a foreign manufacturer

or government was offering us goods for less
than they were worth. As a rule the seller
offers his goods for the highest price he can
get. This is not an artificial price, but one at
which the seller is trying to dispose of goods
which may not be very saleable. As I say, the
facts upon which this legislation is based
are entirely overstated; they are seductive
arguments put forth by the protectionists.
My second point is that the seller and the
local manufacturer are not the only interested parties. What about the local consumer? He was not even mentioned by the
sponsor of the bill. After all, the action
taken by the Government prevents the consumer from getting some goods at the lowest
possible price, and only the interests of the
manufacturer and the trader are taken into
consideration. In my opinion, the chief party
to the transaction is the man who buys the
goods and pays for them. The true purpose
of production is not to support the producer
and the trader, but rather to benefit the
consumer; the producer and the trader are
servants of the consumer, but it seems easy
to magnify their interests beyond all reason.
Until I raised the question, the consumer
was not even mentioned. I say it is the
right of the consumer to buy his goods on
the market at the lowest possible price. That
is the philosophy of the free trader and of
the Manchester School, to which I belong,
and which I have justified on many other
occasions.
I make this comment in passing, that I
am not in favour of this measure or this
type of legislation, which is protective in its
character and disregards the interests of the
masses, the consumers.
There is nothing to be gained by voting
against the measure, because I am quite
satisfied that this chamber will pass it. It
was part of the budget. Nevertheless, with
the exception of two or three rather inconsequential items, I am in favour of the
remainder of the bill. I approve of the
budget, because it proposed a number of
reductions in tariff which will, to a slight
degree at least, decrease the cost of living.
It favours the production of goods and puts
our products in a position to compete with
products from abroad. In these respects, to
the extent that reduced tariffs are features of
the bill, I approve the measure.
Honourable senators, I see no good purpose to be served in referring this bill to a
committee. However, I feel compelled to
express my views with regard to this legislation, and particularly with regard to that
part of the bill which my friend says is
its main feature. I do not agree with him in
that observation.

JULY 13, 1955
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators, I should first like to compliment the
honourable senator from Grandville (Hon.
Mr. Bouffard) upon the study he has made
of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: It is encouraging to hear
an honourable senator when explaining a bill
say he is prepared to answer any questions
which may be asked of him.
I am not sure that I do not agree with the
sentiment expressed by the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
I myself am a free trader and I like to see
goods put on the market at the lowest price
possible. From the consumer's standpoint I
believe that is a good principle. Of course,
we in the retail business have to contend
with competition from the department and
so-called chain stores, which feature lossleader products.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I take it you are not in
favour of loss leaders.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: The loss leader is to me
an instrument made use of by those who
are in a financial position to take advantage
of a situation, and perhaps to a certain
extent it is of advantage to the consumer;
however, on the whole I believe it is not a
good business practice.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: I agree.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: May I explain to honourable senators that I rose to ask the honourable
senator sponsoring the bill if he would be
good enough to turn to Schedule A, on page 8,
and look again at tariff item 418, dealing with
machinery and apparatus for use in the
manufacture of fish meal and other fish
products. I may say that I am interested in
the fish industry, and I am wondering what
effect the proposed change in the tariff would
have on the future of the fish meal manufacturing industry. Perhaps the honourable
senator would be good enough to explain the
proposed change.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators, I
suggest that the sponsor of the bill answer
those questions when be closes the debate.
I want to say a few words myself before he
answers questions.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I do not mind.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: That will be satisfactory to
me. If the honourable senator from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) has any questions to askHon. Mr. Aseline: I was only going to
make a few remarks. Have you finished?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I am always ready to yield
the floor to the Acting Leader of the
Opposition.

Hon. Mr. Aseline: Honourable senators, I
agree with the honourable gentleman from
Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) that we
have had an excellent explanation of this
bill. It is one of the best I have heard for
some time.
The bill deals with a very difficult subject;
tariffs and protectionist measures and dumping duties are always more or less mysterious
to the public at large. Like the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck), I, too, look at this measure from
the standpoint of a consumer. I am afraid
that the bill is not going to be very popular in
the Prairie Provinces because the people of
the West feel that they always have to pay
more than they should for the goods they
purchase from protected industries in Ontario
and Quebec. In other words, Westerners feel
they have to pay through the nose for everything they buy, yet when they sell their
products of the farms they have to compete in
the world market.
I fail to see any need for the bill, because
in my opinion the dumping duties as provided
for in the present law today cover all cases
of the kind referred to by the sponsor of the
bill. He has been unable to give us any
concrete illustrations of anything that has so
far happened which would justify the
measure. He said that the Government is
afraid something might happen, and it is
looking into the future and trying to protect
the manufacturers of this country in advance.
I do not like that kind of thing at all. I
think it is straight protectionism, and if it
spreads to any great extent the people of
Canada, and particularly those in the West,
are going to pay a great deal more for their
goods.
Again like the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity, I am pleased that there have
been certain reductions in the tariff. While
I do not intend to vote against the bill, I
would warn the Government that it should be
very careful in bringing into full force and
effect the new section 6A.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
as a theoretical free trader, like some of my
honourable friends on the other side, I do not
think I should allow this occasion to pass
without associating myself with what has
been said by the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and the
honourable senator from Dartmouth-Halifax
(Hon. Mr. Isnor) with regard to the, shall I
say, dislike with which I regard the proposed
new section 6A.
I compliment the honourable senator who
introduced the measure upon his admirably

SENATE
lucid exposition, but for myself I should have
been much happier if this section had not
appeared in the bill.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Because I support what
has been said by other honourable senators,
that it is or at least that it can be made a
vehicle of a rather extreme form of protection, and that it apparently takes into account
only the possible interests of manufacturers
in this country and disregards the interests
of the ultimate consumers who represent,
shall we say, perhaps 95 per cent of the
people of the country.
I should have liked, as I say, not to see a
section of this kind in the bill. The honourable senator who sponsored the bill gave one
explanation on which I should like to ask him
a question. He said that this extraordinary
power conferred upon the Governor in Council would only be used in cases where it was
quite clear that there was going to be some
really serious damage done to a local Canadian industry. He may be right in that statement, but the bill says nothing of the kind.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: As far as I have been
able to read it, in the short time at my disposal, the only requirement for action being
possible by the Governor in Council under
Section 6 A is that the goods imported shall be
of a kind similar to those manufactured in
Canada, regardless of whether importation of
subsidized goods might or might not cause any
serious damage to a Canadian industry. If
we are to have a section of this kind enacted
I would much prefer to see a provision formally inserted in the bill to make quite certain that it should not go into effect unless
there was a likelihood of very serious damage to our own manufacturers as the result
of importation of subsidized goods. Perhaps
my honourable and learned friend can make
it a little clearer where he finds a provision
of that kind in this measure.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Before the
sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr. Bouffard) rises
to reply, I should like to join other honourable senators who have spoken, in complimenting him on the very lucid manner in
which he has explained this complicated
measure.
Views have been expressed as to the effect
of the proposed new section 6A with regard
to subsidies. I do not think that that section
can be interpreted as a protective measure.
All of us-for we are all consumers-want
the consumer to buy goods at the lowest price
possible; but we want to be fair both to
the manufacturer and the consumer. The

trades unions have declared emphatically that
there must not be unfair competition, and it
is to prevent what would be unfair competition that this clause is to be inserted in the
Customs Tariff Act.
When the tariff schedules were adopted
they were fixed at a rate which would represent a percentage of the cost price of the
goods: when that cost price was ascertained,
the appropriate tariff item was inserted in
the Customs Tariff. It is now evident that in
many countries the selling price of goods is
not the cost price, and that the tariff on such
goods when they come into Canada is computed, not on the cost price, but the cost price
less a subsidy. Admittedly the result is that
the consumer pays a lower price, but it is
unfair to our manufacturers, and to the working people they employ, that manufacturers
must compete with goods produced in a
foreign country and brought in at a price
less than the cost at which they were manufactured, upon which cost the tariff is based.
So the section in question is included in the
bill for the purpose of preventing unfair
competition. I think it is a proper section,
and that it should be enacted.
Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
it may be said that this bill is being dealt
with here as though it were more or less in
the committee stage. However, as it is not
going to committee, I should like to say a
word or two about it. First, may I compliment the honourable senator who moved the
second reading (Hon. Mr. Bouffard) on the
splendid explanation he has given us.
I think the bill is a very reasonable one
and it may be very useful to our economy
under present conditions.
On this occasion I am not to be understood
as joining the ranks of either the protectionists or the free-traders. I have heard the
leader of the Conservative party in this
House-a party whose followers have talked
protection all their lives-advocating free
trade; andHon. Mr. Aselline: You are not referring
to me?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I am not a free-trader.
I believe in adequate protection. But I am
against this provision; I do not want to gu
that far.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I was about to say that
the honourable senator who moved the second
reading of the bill was defending himself
against accusations of protection. I believe
in the freest kind of trade which is beneficial
to my country, but I am for my own country
first, and will not support measures which I
believe are detrimental to Canada. I believe

JULY 13, 1955
that the theories of the Manchester School,
of which we heard this afternoon, are inapplicable today. When we look around and
see what is going on in the modern world
we must agree that free trade is outmoded.
We must also recognize that those measures
which we used to associate with protective
tariffs are only a small factor in the carrying on of national and international trade.
At one time England was the citadel of free
trade in the world. But things got to a stage
where the British Government not only
adopted tariffs, but refused to admit any
importations of some goods from overseas.
For example, Nova Scotian apples and other
Canadian products have been denied entry
to what was once a free-trade market. If
that sort of thing is not the most vicious kind
of protection, I should like to know what is.
I remember that years ago, when Canada
negotiated a reciprocity agreement with the
United States, there was what is called a
countervailing clause. In the 1911 election
I heard Conservatives going around our province telling the fishermen that if they voted
for reciprocity they would imperil their fishing bounty, because the countervailing provision of the agreement would prevent them
from shipping fish to the American market
from a bonused industry. But we eventually
got reciprocity, and the fishermen's bounty
continued-which after all was the interest
paid by the American Government for fishing
privileges.
The sponsor of the bill was quite right in
his contention that dumping duties do not
meet the present situation, because a dumping
duty is dependent upon a declaration by the
shipper that the goods he has for sale are
sold under like conditions and price in his
own country. But where producers are subsidized by the Government they can sell in
their own country at a lower price. The
proposal before us will prevent the sale in
this country of imports produced under unfair
and unequal conditions at the place of origin.
References are frequently made to the
rights of the consumer. But I believe many
people have been misled for a long time by
what is called "free trade".
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Certainly Canada has
been fooled.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: The greatest country in
the world which has adopted protection is
the United -States of America. Its whole
tariff is built on the principle of protection.
Who can say that the United States economy
has not been successful and beneficial for
the people of that country? Can it be argued
that the working man and the consumer
have not benefited more substantially than
if adequate protection had been denied them?

Can anyone with a sense of responsibility
condemn our manufacturers? Today they
are exposed to the strongest competition in
a competitive world; they are fighting for
their economic lives in order to survive and
to give employment to the people. I believe
that industry should be permitted to carry
on in circumstances which are reasonable
and under conditions which will give it the
chance to survive. Some people produce,
some others are parasites, and they also are
necessary and do well. As we know, the
orchid, a beautiful flower, is a parasite.
When I hear some people talk, I am inclined
to wonder whether they could make good in
the competitive struggle which is necessary
to success in industry nowadays. I wonder
if they realize that those who participate in
the struggle for existence in the manufacturing field depend upon the excellence of their
product and the degree of productibility, and
that they have to face competition both
inside and outside the country.
It has been said that farmers are not in
favour of protection. Oh, no! They are for
protection, all right. I recall legislation under
which the export price of our domestic grain
was lower than the price Canadians themselves had to pay. In order to help the farming industry Canadians had to pay more for
their grain.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Our farmers furnished
wheat to the rest of Canada at a price of
77 cents a bushel at a time wheat was selling for $2 on the open market.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I think the man who
speaks up for free trade is the one for whom
free trade is a protection. We are all for
protection. At one time in Prince Edward
Island there was a legislator who was very
much in favour of free trade. When he came
to Ottawa and took a place in the seats of the
mighty he was always seeking to have a duty
imposed on pork, for he knew that Prince
Edward Island produced a considerable
amount of it.
We in the Maritimes want an entry into
foreign markets for our primary products.
Under the Fielding reciprocity treaty we
would have enjoyed a preference in the
United States for our primary products. At
the present time our fish products can enter
the United States at a fair duty, but we have
to compete for the U.S. market against countries which have a lower standard of living
and which pay low wages to labour. Fish
dealers in Boston and New York will tell us:
"We don't mind buying your exports, because
you pay fair wages and you enjoy a high
standard of living. We will gladly take your
goods, but we don't like having to buy goods

SENATE
from countries like Denmark and Iceland,
which pay low wages and undermine our
markets."
We must realize that these conditions prevail, and there is no use in my friends talking
about free trade when there is no longer any
such thing. Every country in the world is
busy putting up barriers to protect its own
economy. For instance, everyone knows that
Australia and New Zealand have restricted
the importation of foreign goods. In the face
of such conditions why should people bother
to talk about the impossible conditions of
free trade?
I come from a free-trade province, and I
think our people have been exploited a little
on this free-trade shibboleth. We in the
Maritimes would be better off if we were
placed in a position where we could share in
some of the benefits resulting from protections instead of being left out on the fringe
of the country and obliged to face the world
by ourselves, as we now have to do in our
coastal trade.
Trade is purely a scientific matter of
arrangement between governments, and it is
something which should be given the most
careful consideration by those in public life.
It is ridiculous for men to make the sweeping
statement "I am in favour of free trade,"
when there is no such thing today. It is outmoded and a thing of the past. We cannot
have it unless we achieve certain world conditions which cannot be envisaged at the
present time.
For these reasons I say that this is a salutary bill. I commend the honourable member
from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard) who
moved its second reading, and I want to say I
am enthusiastically in favour of its adoption.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: I should like to ask
the honourable senator from Queens-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) a question. I understood him to say there was a time recently
when Canadians had to pay more for our own
wheat than it was sold for on the export
market.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: My honourable friend
would be right if he deleted the word
"recently".
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: How long ago was it?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: It was quite a while ago,
but I was in Parliament at the time.
Hon. Mr. McLean: Do I understand that
this bill raises the duty on machinery and
apparatus used in the fishing industry?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: The amendment reduces
the duty on this machinery. I would refer
the honourable senator to tariff item 418 in
Schedule A to the bill. At present, under the

British preferential tariff it comes in free;
under the most-favoured-nation tariff the
duty is 15 per cent; and under the general
tariff, 20 per cent. The new rates are free,
10 per cent and 20 per cent.
Hon. Mr. McLean: I believe that most fish
machinery originates in the United States.
Does the United States come under this?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It comes under the 10
per cent rate. There has been a reduction
of 5 per cent.
Hon. Mr. McLean: Honourable senators,
the honourable gentleman from Queen'sLunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) spoke about
conditions in the United States. It is true
that that country imposes rather high tariffs,
but at the same time it accepts the currencies
of other countries. I know it has put through
a bill which will authorize the acceptance of
$700 million worth of foreign goods. The
United States accepts the pound sterling, the
French franc, the Italian lira and other
foreign currencies, and in this way it is helping its own trade relations a great deal
Hon. Mr. Kinley: It accepts these currencies
at the going rates.
Hon. Mr. McLean: Well, Canada does not
even recognize the British pound or the
French franc. I notice that recently Japan
got a credit in dollars which it paid for in its
own currency. The United States accepts
these foreign currencies and uses them to buy
goods from those same countries, and in this
way it is doing its part to extend world trade.
At the present time there is a dollar gap,
with some free nations being desperate to
obtain dollars. Their purpose in endeavouring
to export goods to Canada is to secure Canadian dollars in order to pay for goods they
buy from us. These countries can only pay
for imports with what they produce from their
own land and sea. Their real objective in
trying to sell us their goods is to get Canadian dollars, but we are making it more difficult for them to achieve this purpose. It is
only natural for these countries to assist their
manufacturers in some way or another in getting control of Canadian dollars in order to
pay their bills over here. We should not do
anything unnecessary to make it more difficult
for these people to obtain our dollars, but by
refusing to accept their currencies that is just
what we are doing.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Honourable senators,The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, I would point out that if the honourable gentleman from Grandville speaks now
he will close the debate.

JULY 13, 1955
Minister of Defence Production, the Right
Honourable C. D. Howe, is also Minister of
Trade and Commerce, and as such he receives
a salary. Therefore he is not eligible to
receive the salary provided for by this bill.
However, if at any time a minister should
hold this portfolio. and not be the minister
of another department, he would be paid
the salary specified in this bill.
The bill also provides that sections 23 to 31
of the act shall expire on July 31, 1959. Without this amendment the act would expire on
July 31, 1956.

Department of Defence Production a man of
the stature and ability of the Right Honourable C. D. Howe.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: During the war he
rendered outstanding service to Canada in
a similar capacity, when he held a portfolio
of another name. I think an especially fine
tribute to Mr. Howe is implied in the fact
that be is probably the only statesman who
held such a position throughout the war
years and still serves his country in a similar
position today. He proved himself to be
worthy of the office during the war, and we
continue to have confidence in him.
I also wish to pay a tribute to the Parliamentary Assistants who have been associated
with Mr. Howe, Mr. George James McIlraith,
the member for Ottawa West, his Parliamentary Assistant for many years, was faithful and industrious and gave all his time and
efforts to the task. Since then, Mr. Howe's
Parliamentary Assistant has been Mr. John
H. Dickey, who became senior member for
Halifax when the honourable gentleman from
Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) was
summoned to this house; and Mr. Dickey
also has given all of his time and great ability
to the duties which fall to his lot in this
onerous post.
Honourable senators, I have no hesitation
in commending this bill to your favourable
consideration.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable sena-

tors, there is little need for debate on this
bill at the present time, in view of its history
since it was introduced in another place.
However, I have a few remarks to make.
When the Defence Production Bill was before this house in 1951 I voted for it. But
I stated at that time that I viewed with
alarm legislation which gave extraordinary
powers to the executive. I have always
stood, as my honourable colleagues know, for
the freedom of the individual, for fundamental liberties and all such rights. I am
an intense Liberal. Nevertheless, I voted
for the bill at that time and I had my reasons for doing so.
We were then entering into a war in
South Korea, and I expressed the view that
if as a nation we were ready to conscript
our young men and send them across the
sea to fight our battles, we were prepared to
take away the freedom of the individual in
a most drastic way. One could scarcely
imagine a greater interference with the rights
of an individual than to take him away from
school or his job, and, without his consent
or that of his family, put him into uniform
and send him to war against an enemy in a

far distant country. I said that when we
were doing that, or even contemplating it,
the owners of supplies or of factories capable
of producing war materials had very little
to complain of if at the same time we told
them that they must participate in the war
effort. So we passed legislation which contained such extraordinary powers as those
which permitted the minister to say to a
manufacturer that he must sell his goods to
the country, even though he could get a
higher price elsewhere, or that his plant
should be under different management. While
these powers were extraordinary and of a
nature that should not be granted in ordinary
peace-time, I thought that under the circumstances the citizens who stayed at home and
proposed to make money out of the war had
little to complain of by the passage of such
a measure. So, I voted for it.
As to the term of the legislation, I
expressed the view that five years was too
long and that two years would be sufficient,
after which time the Government, if it so
desired, could come to us and ask for an
extension of the powers; and that we could be
counted on to extend them if circumstances
justified our doing so. However, the measure
passed at that time was for a term of five
years, which has not yet expired, and the
Government has now stated that the extraordinary powers are required for another
limited period. I am satisfied to take its
word for it, and to vote for the bill as it now
stands, realizing of course that the powers
are not the kind that I am prepared to give
to the executive in ordinary peaceful times.
I am satisfied to pass the bill to provide for
the extension of the powers for a limited
time.
May I say that in my opinion it was never
the intention of the administration, at any
stage of the consideration of this bill, that
these powers should be given in perpetuity.
The bill as it was first introduced in the other
place contained nothing about permanent
powers. True, it abolished the time limit.
But I would point out that the Emergency
Powers Act was passed without limit as to
its life, on the understanding that it would
be repealed when it was no longer necessary;
and in due season it was repealed. Similarly,
even if the time limit in this measure were
abolished, the understanding would remain
that when the act was no longer necessary
it would be repealed. So, let nobody go away
with the idea that the administration, or any
of us on the Liberal side, at any time had
any thought of asking for these powers in
perpetuity. As the bill now stands, it is
limited in its term and with very good reason,
and we can bring up its details at any time
in the interval.

My second reason for speaking to this bill party might not warrant the trust that we

THE LATE SENATOR KING
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable sena-

tors, before the day's business is proceeded
with, I should like to make reference to the
passing of our very dear friend and colleague,
the late Honourable Senator James H. King.
The late senator had many close friends in
this assembly and throughout Canada. I well
recall that when I first entered Parliament,
in 1935, I was fortunate enough to make his
acquaintance, and he helped me greatly during those early days. I understand there are
other members of Parliament who recall his
many kindnesses and great assistance to them
when they came to Ottawa as young men.
Senator King comes from a very distinguished family in respect to public service.
His father was the Honourable George Gerald
King, and it is interesting to note that he was
a member of the House of Commons from
1878 to 1886 and from 1891 to 1896. He was
first elected to the House of Commons in 1878;
he was defeated in the election of 1886; he
was elected again in 1891, and re-elected in
1896, in which year he was summoned to the
Senate. He was a member of the Senate in
1922 when his son, the late senator, came to
Ottawa to accept the portfolio of Public Works
in the federal Cabinet. There may have been
other instances of a father and son being
members of Parliament at the same time, but
I recall only one. The honourable senator
from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon), who is
present today, became a member of the House
of Commons when his father was a member
of the Senate. Those are two outstanding
examples of fathers and sonsHon. Mr. Burchill: All from New Bruns-

wick.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: -who have given so
much to the public service of Canada. It is
interesting to note that-as we have just
been reminded by the honourable gentleman
from Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchill)Senator Turgeon and the late Senator King
and their fathers were all born in New
Brunswick.
Our late colleague Dr. King left new Brunswick and established a medical practice in
the south-eastern part of British Columbia,

where he was beloved by many. He had a
very extensive practice; and no effort was
too great for him to make to serve as a
doctor the people who lived in that rugged
country-and indeed it was rugged when he
went there.
I know we all feel very deeply his passing,
because he was so close to each one of us.
I think I should put on record a brief
statement setting forth the more important
events in his life. As I have said, he was
born in New Brunswick, at Chipman, on
January 18, 1873. He was the son of the late
Senator George Gerald King; and his mother's
name before marriage was Esther Briggs.
After receiving his primary education at
Chipman and St. Martin's Academy, in New
Brunswick, he entered McGill University,
from which he received his medical degree
in 1895. His earliest experience in the field
of medical practice was at Andover and Saint
John, New Brunswick, after which he took
up residence in Cranbrook, British Columbia,
in 1898, where he continued his medical
career and became Canadian Pacific Railway
surgeon of the Crowsnest line.
Dr. King's medical career was not limited
to his own general local sphere of practice.
In fact, it was broad enough to include the
Vice-Presidency of the Graduates Society of
McGill University in 1908. He attended the
Western Congress of Medicine and Surgery
at Budapest in 1910. One of the most outstanding accomplishments of his career was
as an original founder and Governor of the
American Congress of Surgeons at Chicago
in 1913. Had Senator King done nothing else
for his country, we realize that he rendered
a splendid service to Canada in the field of
medicine and surgery. In recognition of his
unselfish devotion to the welfare of unfortunate people, he was created a Knight of
Grace of the Venerable Order of the Hospital
of St. John of Jerusalem.
May I refer now to the late Senator King's
political career. Before doing so in detail I
should like to point out that his record in
public life was long and distinguished. For
more than half a century he served the people
of Canada in parliament, including the Legislature of British Columbia. In 1903, only
five years after his arrival in British Columbia, he became the representative for Cranbrook, and he held this seat in the Legislature
until 1909. Although unsuccessful in Kootenay, in the federal election of 1911, he returned to the provincial field and was
re-elected to the Legislature for Cranbrook in
1916 and 1920, and from 1916 to 1922 he was
Minister of Public Works in the governments
headed by Mr. Brewster and Mr. Oliver.

JULY 14, 1955
In 1922 Dr. King resigned from the Legislature to accept appointment as Minister of
Public Works in the government of the Right
Honourable William Lyon Mackenzie King.
He was elected to the House of Commons in
a by-election that year, and was re-elected in
the general elections of 1925 and 1926; and
in the latter year he was appointed Minister
of the Department of Health and Soldiers'
Civil Re-establishment. That was a very
important department in those days. I do
not say it was more important than the
present Department of Veterans Affairs, but
it was a more or less new venture, and the
foreruner of that Department.
Dr. King was summoned to the Senate in
1930 and, as many of you recall, he was
appointed Leader of the Government in this
bouse in 1942, and was Speaker of the Senate
from 1945 to 1949. Since then he bas continued to sit in this chamber as one of our
very dear colleagues.
I have outlined two of the outstanding
phases of Dr. King's service to his countryhis medical and political careers.
His interest in the field of education
throughout his long and useful life was recognized by Honorary Doctor of Laws Degrees
awarded to him by Acadia University, in
1923, and Ottawa University, in 1924.
Constantly striving in the interests of
peace and order in the world, his contribution to Canada's war effort as a member of
the Mackenzie King administration was
crowned by his participation in the World
Security Conference at San Francisco in 1945.
I know we ail feel his passing very
deeply, because be was so close to each one
of us. We have lost a great friend, a great
physician, a great statesman and a great
gentleman. To his widow I am sure we ail
join in extending our very deep sympathy.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
this is one of those sad occasions when we
pay respect to a departed friend and colleague. I wish to join in everything that has
been said by the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) with respect to
Senator King. He has given us such a fine
resumé of the life and work of Senator King
that very little is left, perhaps, for me to say.
I very much regret that the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), whom I am
replacing today, is not here, because be was
much more intimately acquainted with Dr.
King than I had been. However, I notified
hirn this morning of the death of our dear
senator, and he will write immediately to
Mrs. King from Winnipeg.
The Leader of the Government bas stated
that for more than half a century Senator
50437-51j

King was in public life in this country, first
as a member of the Legislature of British
Columbia, then in the dominion Parliament,
as a member of the House of Commons and
later as a senator. During ail that time his
record was second to none. We learned this
morning, with very deep regret, of his passing. He was a great Canadian: I consider
him to have been one of the foremost citizens
of this country. At the time of his death
Dr. King was the sixth member of the
Senate, according to seniority. I myself am
not so far down the list, being ninth.
Senator King, of course, was here when I
first came to this house. I shall always remember how well he treated us new members, how he helped us in our work, and
what a good friend be was to ail of us. He
was a real gentleman of the old school, and
a fine character in every way.
I wish to pay a tribute to Dr. King for
the splendid service be rendered as Minister
of the Department of Health and 'Soldiers'
Civil Re-Establishment. He was directly
responsible for that very fine legislation
known as the War Veterans' Allowance Act,
and veterans throughout Canada are greatly
indebted to him for the benefits they have
received over the years. Last year the benefits
paid under the act amounted, I think, to
approximately $28 million. I repeat that as
minister of that department Dr. King
rendered splendid service to Canadian
veterans.
On behalf of the members on this side
of the house, I join with the Leader of the
Government in expressing deep sympathy
to the widow of our late colleague.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators, I
am greatly moved by the tributes paid by
the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Ross) and the honourable Acting
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
to the memory of our late colleague.
Dr. King's death is to me a personal loss.
It has in truth been said that he was a great
friend to ail of us. I believe no higher compliment could be paid to this gentleman of the
old school, as he was described a few minutes ago, than to mention the quality of
friendship which was, so to speak, shining
in him. To people in ail walks of life in
Ottawa, from the lowliest employee in government or hotel to those occupying the most
exalted posts, Senator King expressed the
same words of kindness and friendship.
I believe that I knew Senator King for
more than thirty years. He became a colleague
of my father, Sir Lomer Gouin, in Mr. Mackenzie King's first government, in 1922, and
I became acquainted with him about that
time. When he was made Leader of the Government in this house after the death of

SENATE
Senator Dandurand, I was closely associated
with him; and during the critical years of
the war especially, I was in a position to
appreciate his great quality as a true Canadian, a broad-minded patriot and a serious
and sincere champion of national unity.
Dr. King tried to be of service to everyone be met; he was exceedingly kind, and
be liked to remember occasions in family life,
such as marriages, births and deaths; and
whether they were gay or sad occasions he
always did the right thing in a charming way.
The late Dr. King's political career, as it
was outlined by the Leader of the Government, was indeed very interesting. He gained
experience in politics in his province of adoption, British Columbia, where he became the
provincial member for Cranbrook in 1903,
more than fifty years ago. He later became
Minister of Public Works in that province,
and in 1922 be assumed the same portfolio
in the federal Government. Four years later
he was appointed Minister of the Department
of Health and Soldiers' Civil Re-Establishnent, the department with which his name
will ever be associated. For that post be was
admirably qualified by a deep knowledge of
people of all classes and of medicine, a profession of which he was an outstanding
member.
In the late Dr. King I salute a good citizen,
a true and excellent Canadian. Born in New
Brunswick, having studied medicine at
McGill University and having made his home
on the Pacific coast since 1898, be was as
familiar with the problems of the Maritimes
as with those of Western Canada. And above
all, from my point of view, be had the very
great merit of understanding, perfectly the
good people of Quebec. The late senator was
always anxious to render justice to Canadians of all creeds and ethnic origins. Into
all his work be carried the splendid qualities of British fair play, a broad tolerance
and a truly liberal mind.
With much sadness I pay this last tribute
of respect to my dear friend the late Honourable James King, and express to his widow
and family my sincere sympathy.
Hon. Gray Turgeon: Honourable senators,
I rise to speak at this tirne with a very tense
feeling within me. Never in my life have I
had a closer or better friend than the late
Senator King, who has just departed from us.
Our late colleague and I worked together
since before he entered the federal Parliament through the House of Commons in
January, 1922. In all that time I cannot recall
a single occasion on which I found in him
anything but the deepest feelings of good will
,and a desire to do right.

When references were made this afternoon
to our late friend's service as Minister of
Health and Soldiers' Civil Re-Establishment,
I recalled a conversation I had with the late
Prime Minister Mackenzie King shortly after
be had asked Dr. King to accept the portfolio.
After saying that the Department of Health
and Soldiers' Civil Re-Establishment required
as its head a man possessing a clear conception of humanitarianism and good will, and
a sincere regard for the welfare of war veterans, the Prime Minister added: "Of all the
men I have met I know of no one who possesses the truly humanitarian spirit in greater
degree than does Dr. King, and that is why
I have asked him to accept this portfolio. I
am sure be will do a great deal of good for
the returned soldiers, and through them for
the various communities in Canada." Honourable senators, I doubt if any prediction
regarding a human being ever proved to be
better founded than that of the late Prime
Minister concerning Dr. King.
As has been said, the late Senator King
practised medicine in the Kootenay country,
and more particularly in Cranbrook. Anyone
who has ever lived in that district will tell
you that his whole thought was for his work
as a doctor, and for the spreading of human
good. He considered cases on the basis of
what should be done. He not only cured disease but be helped to create a good friendly
co-operative spirit, a good family spirit in
the various communities which be entered.
I think the death of Senator King is as
serious a loss as could befall this chamber.
I am certain that his widow and other relatives will deeply appreciate what has been
said by the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald), the Acting Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), and the senator from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin).
I wish to associate myself with their expression of sympathy on behalf of the Senate.
Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourable
senators, in the passing of the late Dr. King
the Senate has lost a figure who played a
very important part not only in the affairs of
this chamber but in the public life of Canada
for a great many years. As a friend and
admirer I mourn his loss, and as a representative of New Brunswick I pay tribute to his
memory with a sense of pride in the fact
that be was born in that province. We have
long counted him as one of New Brunswick's
very distinguished sons.
His long public career has been described
by the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) and other senators, and I would
only add that it is not given to many men
to have such a varied and distinguished

JULY
career. As a medical practitioner, first in New
Brunswick for a short time after his graduation from university, and later in the early
days in British Columbia, he was affectionately regarded as a true physician and friend
by his patients scattered over large expanses
of territory. His medical visits meant hard
lonely trips which tested his physical powers.
He was much beloved in those early days as
a medical pioneer, and be was the chief character in Ralph Connor's widely read book
The Doctor. Honourable senators, what better
tribute could be paid to a man's worth?
Not very long ago, in the course of a
conversation, Dr. King told me that he was
first approached by Sir Wilfrid Laurier to
enter the federal field of politics. At that time
bis father was a member of this chamber.
He hesitated to give up his life as a medical
practitioner, which he would have to do if
he came to Ottawa as a member of Parliament but eventually be responded to the requests of his fellow citizens. His long career
in public life has been described here this
afternoon. During more than fifty years be
gave himself unreservedly to the administration of the public affairs of this country. As
has been said, be held cabinet posts both in
Ottawa and in Victoria, seat of the provincial
Government of British Columbia; and his able
administration of the various departments
over which be presided, especially here in
Ottawa, has been referred to by the Leader
of the Government and others.
He was a gentleman in every sense of the
word, always courteous and kind. I shall never
forget his kindness to me when I came to
Ottawa as a new senator.
His services in this chamber are known
to all of us, and we know with what distinction he occupied the various positions be
held here. I join with the previous speakers
in paying tribute to the memory of one whom
we shall all miss, one whose character, integrity and courtesy have done much to dignify and enrich the public life of Canada.
To Mrs. King, his nephew and nieces, I
tender my deepest sympathy.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
this is a sad occasion. It is not, however, an
entirely unexpected occasion because, I think,
all of us were aware for some days or weeks
past of the critical condition of our friend
and colleague Dr. King.
After the speeches that have already been
made and the references which have been
made to his career and life work, it is hardly
necessary for me to repeat what bas already
been said, and said so well. I think, however,
we can summarize it all in words used by
the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) when he said Dr. King was in

all respects a good Canadian; a Canadian who
devoted his entire active working life to the
service of his fellowman; first as a beloved
doctor at a time and in a place where medical
services were urgently necessary and where
the help and the relief of suffering that be
was able to administer far outweighed any
tangible rewards which be might expect to
receive; and secondly, in the political field,
at first in his adopted and much loved province of British Columbia, and afterwards in
the wider field of federal affairs here in
Ottawa.
I repeat, Dr. King was a good Canadian, and
when all is said and done the man of whom
that can be truly said needs no finer and no
more eloquent epitaph.
To those of his family who survive, and
particularly to his widow, we express our
deepest sympathy. But to them, as to ourselves, we say that for him there is nothing
to regret. His illness was mercifully short.
He bas gone to his last rest, full of years,
full of honours, and with the consciousness
of a life well lived and lived to the full. No,
honourable senators, our regrets are not for
him but for ourselves, for our loss of a wise,
a kindly and a greatly respected colleague and
friend.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable
senators, may I add a few words to the
tributes just paid to the memory of our
beloved colleague.
When I entered the Senate, in 1944, I
called on Dr. King and said to him: "I have
known you for a long time, through your
father. When my father was a member of the
House of Commons, from 1891 to 1896, your
father was one of his best friends. Upon my
coming here, I wish to call on you. It
seems that I am living over again, in my
mind's eye, what your father and mine went
through together many years ago." And this
is what Dr. King replied: "Since your father
and mine were such fast friends, so shall we
be from now on."
As I was a novice, I went to him for advice
and he took pleasure in helping me out, just
as he did, indeed, with all his friends.
Today, it is with the deepest respect and,
I might even say, with affection, that I offer
him the tribute of my appreciation and of
my faithful remembrance. To Mrs. King, I
express my deepest and most sincere
sympathy.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I move that when the Senate adjourns today
it stand adjourned until Wednesday, July 20,
at 8 o'clock in the evening.
If honourable senators will look at the
Order Paper they will see that there are
feur items under Orders of the Day, and a
motion in the name of the honourable senator
from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw). I
anticipate that today we shall dispose of the
first two items under Orders of the Day, that
is, the third reading of two bills, and also the
fourth item, consideration of the report of
the Standing Committee on Canadian Trade
Relations. That will leave one item only,
namely, second reading of an Act to amend
the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority Act, on
our Order Paper, together with the motion in
the name of the honourable senator from
Medicine Hat. From inquiries which I have
made-and this of course, is pure speculation
-it does not appear that the House of Commons will have disposed of the estimates of
the various departments which are now
receiving consideration there, before the latter
part of next week. The business which will
remain on our Order Paper after this sitting
can probably be disposed of in one day, and
at most in two days, and it will then be
necessary for us to stay here until we receive
the supply bill from the other house. I think
that if we resume on Wednesday evening
ample time will remain to dispose of our
business as well as to consider any legislation
from the House of Commons.
The motion was agreed to.

INTERNATIONAL

TRADE

REPORT OF COMMITTEE AMENDEDCONCURRED IN

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the report of the Standing Committee on
Canadian Trade Relations.
Hon. A. Neil McLean: Honourable senators,
with unanimous consent I beg leave to move
that the report of the Canadian Trade Relations Committee submitted on Wednesday,
the 13th of July last, should be amended by
striking out paragraph 4 and substituting the
following paragraphs:
4. Your committee, therefore, recommends that
the Canadian Trade Relations Committee be reconstituted during the next session of Parliament and
that it be authorized to continue its work under a
similar order of reference.
5. Your committee also hopes that the basic work
will have been achieved during the intervening
period between the sessions and that its final submission may be made to Parliament at the earliest
possible moment during its next session.

This is just a technical change from the
latter part of the report I presented yesterday.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
before this report is adopted may I say that
the new paragraph 4 certainly represents a
vast improvement over the paragraph that it
proposes to eliminate. The original paragraph
4 really suggests that we authorize continuation of the present committee. which of course
we may not have power to do, and certainly
should not do. That should be left to the
next session. I would point out, however,
that the new paragraph is also open to slight
objection in that it recommends that the committee should be reconstituted. That is hardly
the correct procedure. What should be done
at the next session is to appoint a committee
anew to carry on this work.
I am not prepared to suggest how this new
paragraph 4 should be worded but I do not
think it does any harm to call attention to the

JULY 14, 1955
proper procedure as I see it, namely, that
at the next session a committee should be
appointed to carry on this work.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That a similar committee be appointed.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes; that is the true
picture. If the mover of the resolution now
before the house agrees with me I would
suggest he withdraw the word "reconstituted"
and substitute the word "appointed".
Hon. Mr. McLean: I am quite willing that
the amendment suggested by the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) be made.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I point out that
the exact wording of the resolution presented
by the honourable senator from Southern New
Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean) is:
Your committee, therefore, recommends that the
Canadian Trade Relations Committee be reconstituted during the next session of Parliament and
that it be authorized to continue its work under a
similar order of reference.

I think that might be reconciled with the
definite prospect that next session, if a motion
is made to reconstitute the committee and
renew the order of reference, the whole question of the personnel of the committee as
nominated and of the subject-matter referred
to it would then be open for debate. All
that is expressed in the report before us is

the pious hope that next session the committee should be reappointed to complete the
work that it has not been able to finish this
session. We can overlook the punctilio of
the thing until next session.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, the question is on the amendment
of the Honourable
Senator
Roebuck,
seconded by the Honourable Senator McLean,
that in the proposed new paragraph 4 of the
committees report the word "reconstituted"
be struck out and the word "appointed" substituted. Is it your pleasure to adopt the
amendment?
The amendment was agreed to.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, the question is now on the motion
of the Honourable Senator McLean, seconded
by the Honourable Senator Vaillancourt, that
the report be amended by striking out paragraph 4 thereof and substituting therefor
the proposed new paragraphs 4 and 5.
The motion was agreed to, and the report
was amended.
Hon. Mr. McLean: Honourable senators, I
now move adoption of the report as amended.
The motion was agreed to, and the report as
amended was adopted.
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday,

INTERNAL ECONOMY
EIGHTH REPORT OF COMMITTEE
CONCURRED IN

Hon. Norman McL. Paterson, Chairman of
the Standing Committee on Internal Economy
and Contingent Accounts, presented the
committee's eighth report.
The report was read by the Clerk, as
follows:
Your committee recommend that during the
coming recess of Parliament the Honourable Senator W. Ross Macdonald, Leader of the Government
in the Senate, and two senators to be named by
him from time to time, be authorized to act for
and on behalf of the Senate in all matters relating
to the internal economy of the Senate.

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall this report be taken
into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Paterson: With leave, I move
that the report be concurred in now.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask whether
this is the usual practice during a recess?
Hon. Mr. Paterson: It 1s my understanding
that it is. This recommendation was passed
at the last meeting of the committee, but
was omitted from the committee's report to
the Senate. That is why it is being brought
before the house at this late stage of the
session.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I also inquire
whether it is usual to give the committee
such wide powers? During the recess three
senators would have virtually the same
powers as are enjoyed during the session by
the Internal Economy Committee itself. Has
this been the usual practice?
Hon. Mr. Paterson: It is sometimes necessary to attend to certain things while Parliament is in recess. The committee recommends,
as a matter of formality, that the responsibility of attending to them be placed upon
three senators.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I explain that
before prorogation last year a similar subcommittee, composed of the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), the honourable senator from Rockcliffe (Hon. Mrs. Wilson) and myself, was
appointed to act in connection with certain
alterations to the Post Office and other matters. As honourable senators know, when

PREPAID HEALTH INSURANCE
PRESENT SITUATION IN CANADA-DISCUSSION

Hon. F. W. Gershaw rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to
the advantages to the public of prepaid health
insurance and the present situation with respect
to such insurance in Canada.

He said: Honourable senators, having given
notice some time ago, I wish at this time to
draw to the attention of this honourable house
what is being done in Canada regarding national health insurance. This important subject has been discussed frequently in the
press, and by organizations at their meetings,
and it has often been brought to the attention of this High Court of Parliament. The
subject is important because it affects conditions right in the homes of our people, and its
neglect results in much sorrow and suffering.
It has sometimes been suggested that doctors throughout the length and breadth of
this dominion should be on salary, and that
is what is often meant by state medicine. I
wish to make it clear at once that such an
arrangement would not be acceptable to the
Canadian Medical Association. Even if the
Association accepted such a plan of state
medicine, it would be very difficult to put it
into operation with any degree of fairness.
Doctors, like other people, differ greatly in
their training aptitude, industry, experience
and so on. The doctor-patient relationship is
a very highly regarded feature. Competition
amongst doctors is not altogether a bad thing.
In this far flung country of ours country practice differs greatly from city practice.
For all these reasons I feel it would be
quite impossible to work out a fair salary
scheme for the compensation of doctors by
the state. On the other hand, by an arrangement controlled by those who give the service and those who receive it, a fee-forservice schedule could easily be worked out;

SENATE
and indeed a great many agreements between
doctors and patients have been negotiated.
I should like to make it quite clear that
the Canadian Medical Association is not in
any way a stumbling block to the advancement of any system of national health insurance. Indeed, for many years it has approved
the principle of health insurance; and doctors
are willing to co-operate in any fair scheme,
provided that it allows for the building up
and improving of the standards of practice
and protects the patient against the unpredictable high cost of medical care.
Honourable senators, I wish to draw your
attention to the fact that the Trans-Canada
Medical Plans operates in every province of
Canada. This is an organization which collects premiums and pays for medical attention when it is required; it is sponsored by
the Canadian Medical Association, and doctors
everywhere participate in it. Up to the present time the plan has been extended only to
group contracts; that is to say, the employees
of a garage or any specific industry, a city
hall, or any department of government, may
pay premiums into the plan at the first of
the year and be entitled to prepaid medical
attention for the entire year.
The body which co-ordinates all the provincial activities under the Trans-Canada Medical Plans is located at 3246 Bloor Street
West, Toronto 18; this office is in effect the
headquarters for the operations of the various provinces. The member plans in the
various provinces are as follows. In the
Maritimes: Maritime Medical Care Incorporated, at Halifax, and Maritime Hospital Service Association, at Moncton.
In Quebec:
Quebec Hospital Service Association, at
Montreal. In Ontario: Physicians' Services
Incorporated, at Toronto, and Windsor Medical Services, Incorporated, at Windsor. In
Manitoba: Manitoba Medical Service, at
Winnipeg. In Saskatchewan: Medical Services Incorporated, at Saskatoon, and Group
Medical Services, at Regina. In Alberta:
Medical Services (Alberta) Incorporated. In
British Columbia: Medical Services Association and B. C. Medical Services Incorporated,
both bodies at Vancouver. These are all
branches of Trans-Canada Medical Plans and
all co-operate with one another.
Now, honourable senators, the idea of providing some measure of health security for
all is not new. In the days of the Roman
Empire steps were taken to encourage people
to set aside a little for a rainy day; that is,
to save something while they were in health
to carry them over times of disease and disaster so as to avoid their dependence on
charity. In 1883 Bismarck introduced a
system of national health insurance in Germany. In 1888 a compulsory scheme became

operative in Austria, in 1891 in Hungary, and
since 1911 in Great Britain and the North of
Ireland. There are at present nine or ten
countries with voluntary schemes and thirtytwo with compulsory schemes. However, the
practice in both types is pretty much the
same: the doctor answers emergency calls
only during the night; in the morning he
visits his patients at the hospital or in their
homes, and in the afternoon he keeps office
hours.
While the doctor is making a contribution
towards good health the outstanding contribution is being made by people engaged in
research into the causes of diseases and their
methods of treatment which will extend and
expand the period of health and vigour. This
is difficult work. The trail of success winds
uphill all the way, but nothing is more striking than the results that have been obtained
by medical research. Fifty-five years ago,
at the beginning of this century, the average
expectancy of life was about fifty years;
today it is about seventy years-not only that,
but people of a given age today look younger
and act younger than did their forefathers at
the same age.
Many of us remember the terrible scourges
such as diphtheria, scarlet fever, typhoid
fever and smallpox, which formerly struck
across the world and brought death to a large
number of people. These diseases caused
great havoc in the country. However, today
they are almost completely under control.
Even tuberculosis, which for so long was
regarded as the captain of the men of death,
is largely being controlled. Not long ago a
T.B. specialist, looking at the large sanatoria
now devoted entirely to the treatment of
tubercular cases, commented that with the
conquest of tuberculosis these buildings will
one day be used as old people's homes.
A word now about poliomyelitis, a disease
which always instills fear into the hearts and
minds of men and women. It is a dread disease, because sometimes it strikes with such
overwhelming violence that a patient dies
within a very few days. Sometimes the acute
attack passes and the victim gets well, but
in many cases a condition is left which lasts
permanently. For instance, paralysis may
cause deformity or some other disability, with
the result that certain attainments are beyond
the reach of the child victim forever.
Recently, after long research, a serum bas
been worked out which holds great promise.
According to the last reports from Michigan,
some 400,000 children were treated; about
half of them with doses of the Salk vaccine,
and about half with a placebo. As a consequence, according to carefully kept records,
the incidence of poliomyelitis was reduced
by from 60 to 80 per cent. Vaccination does

JULY 21, 1955
not invariably prevent poliomyelitis: although
it is efficacious in a great many cases, there
have been some failures in connection with
its administration. But we in Canada can
be particularly proud of the record of the
Connaught Laboratories. By care, caution
and hard work they have produced a vaccine
which bas proven as good as any vaccine
can be. A great deal of the credit for this
result is due to the Minister and officers of
the Department of National Health and Welfare, because they have checked and doublechecked with the object of making sure that
every dose of vaccine given to a child in
Canada shall be as perfect as it can be. I
know that a few days ago a boy of nine or
ten who was vaccinated developed polio.
However, the disease did not occur until two
months after the date of the vaccination, and
clearly was not the result of it, but happened
in spite of it. No one has claimed that the
serum is 100 per cent effective.
I turn now to another department. All of
us are mortals: there is a limit to the length
of life; we all die, and are all equal in death:
the bodily system breaks down sometimes,
somewhere. I once had the privilege of
treating a man who was 107 years old. I am
sure that I correctly state his age, because
his daughter, a woman of about eighty, had
carefully recorded it. This little old man was
completely blind and deaf: he had to be fed
with a spoon and treated like a child. In his
case the system was a long time in breaking
down. Dr. Osler once said that a man is as
young as his arteries. According to statistics,
breakdowns of the cardiovascular system
rank first among the causes of death. The
second cause is cancer. Cancers which are
detected early and are in accessible parts of
the body can be cured, by X-rays, radium
and surgery, but these treatments cannot be
applied to the deep cancers, such as cancer
of the liver. Cancer is not increasing, but
more people are living into the cancer age
and more cancers are being discovered. The
third cause, which I need not dwell upon, is
violent accidents.
Attempts are being made to control all of
these three major threats to human life, and
these efforts, of course, should be continued.
If we are to be worthy of the achievements
which have been made in the past, we must
hold fast to what is good, and add whatever
the light of the knowledge of the age enables
us to achieve. Only by so doing can we live
up to our obligations and be true custodians.
Turning now to the big factor in this matter,
social security-because sickness is, of course,
a cause of poverty-social security falls into
two divisions; one, social insurance; the other,
social assistance. Trans-Canada Medical
Plans takes both of these into consideration.
50437-52j

Those who have promoted this organization
believe that the man or woman who can pay
the necessary premiums should pay them,
and that the comparatively few people who
are unable to do so should receive assistance
from some government. Nowadays, thanks
to provision for family allowances, old age
pensions, old age security, and disability
pensions, not many are unable to pay the
premiums. The system which is being worked
out by the Trans-Canada Medical Plans is
not a revolutionary one. It will not be very
expensive, and it can be put into operation
without much bickering or disagreement. In
fact, it is already in effect. In 1954 the
premiums collected amounted to $33 million,
and $28a million was paid out for medical
care. About 4 -2 per cent of the sums received
went into reserve account, and the total cost
of operation was about 8-8 per cent. So it
can be said that the organization is really a
going concern, and that the Canadian people
favour it and are taking advantage of it
wherever they can. There are now 2,082,828
people in Canada insured through the
organization.
Canadians are becoming increasingly anxious to protect themselves against the unpredictable costs of sickness and accidents. That
is shown by the following statistics. In 1945,
15 per cent of the population had hospital
protection; by 1954 the proportion had risen
to 60 per cent. In 1945, 5J per cent had
surgical insurance; in 1954, 33 per cent. In
1945, 2 per cent had medical insurance; in
1954, 27 per cent. Of course, a large part
-some 20 per cent-of the hospital protection is sponsored by some government.
What are the reasons for this large growth
of protection? The first reason is that people
realize and appreciate the value of it. In the
second place, during the last year of the war
most of us looked forward to times of great
happiness in the brave new world which we
hoped that the peace would usher in, and
national health insurance was one of the
advances which were generally anticipated.
Thirdly, during the war great numbers of
young men and women in the military services got medical attention without receiving
any bill for it, and they appreciated that
service. And still another reason is that as
new skills, new drugs, and other means of
combating disease are being worked out, costs
have risen, and people want to protect themselves against unpredictably high costs of
medical care.
In 1943 the Canadian Medical Association
approved the principle of health insurance
that would develop the highest standard of
health services, preventive and curative.
They went further, and set up an organization through which groups could be insured

SENATE
against the hazards of sickness. In 1947 the
association proposed that the plan should be
extended to cover all Canada and be made
available to every Canadian citizen. At that
time provisions were made whereby a contributor who paid a premium in one province could receive medical attention in any
other province to which he might move. At
present the plan is available to payroll groups
only, but efforts are being made to gradually
include every individual.
As health is a provincial matter, I should
like to outline what bas been done in the
various provinces. I will deal with Alberta
first. For quite a few years groups in that
province have insured themselves against
sickness and have received prepaid medical
care. Recently an agreement was made between Medical Services (Alberta) Incorporated and the provincial Government whereby
the Government approved individual protection for sickness and agreed to contribute $7
per person per year for every person covered by the plan. This agreement was to
have come into effect in June, but there was
a delay because of the recent provincial election. Present plans call for bringing the
scheme into operation on October 1. It will
be a step forward, for the Government will
help to pay for everyone coming under the
plan and will meet approximately one-third
of the total cost. This is entirely apart from
Alberta's present hospital plan, under which
if $7 per day is the cost of hospitalization the
municipality and the provincial Government
each contribute $3, and the patient $1. This
plan seems to be working out quite successfully.
Saskatchewan, which has group coverage,
approaches its health plans somewhat differently. It bas special programs in 58 rural
municipalities and 20 towns and villages.
Everyone living within these areas must contribute towards medical attention, and the
whole scheme comes under the supervision
of the provincial Government. The province
also has a compulsory hospital protection plan
to which everyone must contribute.
In Manitoba, where there is group and
some individual coverage, the Municipal Act
allows rural municipalities to pay for coverage out of general funds.
In British Columbia the groups which have
been insured are smaller in size, so more
people can be protected.
Ontario, a highly industrialized province,
has group coverage which reaches a great
percentage of the people. However, the need
for individual coverage in Ontario is
recognized.

In Quebec the coverage is limited, but active
progress is reported toward extended arrangements.
Efforts are being made to further this
scheme in the Maritimes, particularly in
Nova Scotia, where a plan of individual enrolment was set up in 1954. Careful records
are being kept and the results will be of
great interest.
Honourable senators, Trans-Canada Medical
Plans is progressing in an orderly way. It
has not been encumbered by difficult negotiations or bickering, and it holds out promise
of giving protection to a great number of
people.
As I stressed before, if we have to have
wars then let us have a war against illness
and disease, and let us support methods of
research and co-operation which will bring
rich rewards. Despite the fact that health
is a provincial matter, the federal Government bas contributed approximately $30 million a year for the purpose of conducting
health surveys, constructing hospital buildings and caring for persons afflicted by special
diseases.
However, under this plan the
federal Government could not contribute to
one province without contributing to another.
We are hopeful that by advertising the plan
and pointing out its benefits, more Canadians
will get protection-the protection which they
and their families need.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Cairine R. Wilson: May I ask the
honourable gentleman if there is any provision for giving the rural parts of the country
more service? I think this has always been
a serious problem.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Some 47 rural municipalities in Saskatchewan give complete
coverage, and if more individuals in the
cities would come under the scheme more
people in the rural districts would be eligible
for its benefits. There is, of course, the difficulty of covering long distances in the rural
districts, but that problem is being given
careful study.
Hon. John A. McDonald: I have noticed
in the press recently that the medical authorities in Great Britain have turned down the
use of the Salk vaccine for the control of
poliomyelitis. I wonder if the honourable
gentleman could give us the reason for that.
Is it that Great Britain wishes other countries
to experiment with this vaccine first?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: I have read all the
literature about the Salk vaccine. I think
the British authorities are being very cautious,
and it is possible that they have adopted a
policy of "wait and see". There have been

JULY 21, 1955
very unfortunate results from some vaccine
manufactured in the United States. A great
deal more work will have to be done in
connection with this vaccine, but there is
strong hope that it will be a real factor in
controlling that dreadful disease poliomyelitis.
I am not in a position to express any opinion,
but I can say that a large number of children
have been vaccinated with the Salk vaccine
in Canada, and we have been particularly
fortunate in the results.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: For some twenty
years I carried sickness insurance. I always
paid my premiums and I never made a claim.
When I became 70 years of age the company cancelled my policy. I was informed
that that was the practice among all private
insurance companies; that is, they would
insure you when you did not need protection,
and when you did need it they wouldn't give
it to you. I protested vigorously. I even
invited the insurance agent to play a game of
golf to see if he were in any better condition than I. I trounced him thoroughly
and then asked him if he thought that I
should not be entitled to insurance. But
regardless of what the agent thought, his
company cancelled my policy. It does seem
to me that private insurance companies, by
that sort of treatment, have utterly disentitled
themselves from the right to carry on this
type of insurance. I should like to know
whether any age limit is set by the
Trans-Canada system that the honourable
gentleman has described in so favourable
terms, because if insurance is available only
when people do not need it, and they are cut
off as soon as they do need it, I am not
interested. Insurance should carry on as
long as the insured lives. I think the actions
of the private concerns in the past have been
an outrage-absolutely reprehensible.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Under a group insurance plan people of 70 years and over, who
still carry their cards, continue to be insured,
and are not cut off.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, it is not my intention to take part in
this debate. I rise only to thank the honourable senator from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr.
Gershaw) for his interesting and informative address. His references to the place of
the physician or surgeon in a plan of health
insurance or state medicine will no doubt
be read with interest by our Minister of
National Health and Welfare. In any event,
I shall make a point of sending a copy of
today's Hansard to the minister so that he
will have an opportunity to read this address.
While the honourable senator was speaking,
it occurred to me that other members of this

house who, from time to time, draw attention
to matters of great public interest are helping
to fulfil one of the functions of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Certain honourable
members have special knowledge on subjects of vital importance not only to us, but
to the people of Canada, and a great service
is rendered to the country when they impart
their learning and the results of their research.
I trust that in forthcoming sessions we shall
have the privilege of hearing further
addresses from other honourable senators who
have special information to communicate.
I am sure I express the thought of all when
I extend to the honourable senator from
Medicine Hat our grateful appreciation of
his excellent address.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable leader if it would be possible to have
a committee of inquiry set up, or some other
method devised, to keep this subject under
discussion, rather than let it die in the
air, so to speak? A committee could call
witnesses and information obtained could be
circulated abroad to great advantage.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It could be a very
interesting inquiry, indeed. That, of course,
would be a question for the Senate to decide
at the coming session.
Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourable senators, I was greatly interested in the question
asked by the honourable senator from Rockcliffe (Mrs. Wilson), as to whether there is
any provision for giving more prepaid health
insurance service to rural districts. So far as
I am aware, no effort has been made along
this line in the rural district in which I
live, in New Brunswick. I am wondering if
the Canadian Medical Association is the body
responsible for all the efforts that are made.
Perhaps my honourable friend from Gloucester (Hori. Mr. Veniot), a member of the
medical profession, can enlighten me?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
the office of Maritime Medical Care Incorporated is at Halifax, and the General Manager
is D. C. Macneill. The office of Maritime Hospital Service Association is at Moncton, and
the Executive Director is Ruth Cook Wilson.
According to information I obtained from Mr.
Shillington, Executive Director of TransCanada Medical Plans, so far there has not
been much activity in New Brunswick, but
they are experimenting and have a group
set up.
With regard to rural districts under the
Alberta scheme, I might say that farmers will

SENATE
be entitled to medical care when the individual plan comes into operation.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: May I ask the
honourable senator about rural municipal
hospitalization in Alberta? Am I right in
assuming that the Government of Alberta has
for a great number of years supported and
subsidized a system of established rural municipal hospitals throughout the province? I
can recall an outstanding example of a
co-operative plan of medical attention which
was in operation in that province in 1912, and
I have understood for a long time that Alberta
pioneered in rural municipal hospitalization.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: That is also my impression, and I am pretty close to the situation.
Certainly the province has a good system for
the building of municipal hospitals, and has
shouldered quite a deal of responsibility in
connection with them. The Canadian Governrment has recently contributed toward the
building of hospitals, but it was found that
the revenue was deficient, on account of the
high cost of keeping the hospitals going; so
the arrangement which I mentioned earlier

is now in operation: that is, the patient pays a
dollar a day, and the municipality and the
province pay the balance.
Hon. J. Wesley S±ambaugh: Honourable
senators, I wish to add a word or two with
regard to hospitals in rural municipal districts
in Alberta. Under the scheme in operation
there, a number of sections in a township
are included, and a hospital tax is imposed,
up to 15 mills. The patients, who are ratepayers, are generally charged a dollar a day
for hospitalization, and the balance is paid
by grants from both the federal Government
and the provincial Government.

POTASH AND PHOSPHORIC ACID
INQUIRY AND ANSWER
Hon. John A. McDonald

inquired of the

Governinent, pursuant to notice of July 20:
What progress, if any, has been made in recent
months towards making Canada more self -sufficient
in its potash and phosphoric acid requirements?
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald.: Honourable senators I have received the following answer to
the honourable gentleman's inquiry from the
Department of Mines and Technical Surveys:
Potash:

We have knowledge of six companies investigating the possibilitiea of producing potash £rom
the deep deposits in Saskatchewan. One company
has an exploratory shaft down to a depth of 1,170
feet, near Unity, and has an additional 2,300 feet
to go before reaching the potash. Another company
is preparing to sink a shaft to the potash beds near
Saskatoon and has signed a contract for a five
years' supply of electrical energy. Two other companies are starting drilling campaigns to locate
suitabie deposits. The remaining two companies
have accluired "withdrawal areas" from the Saskatchewan Government but have as yet put down
no drill holes or done other work.
Phosphate

One company

in Ontario is investigating

the

possibilities of producing the minerai apatite (a

phosphate minerai) as a by-product along with
coiunibiuma and tataium from an iron-titanium
property near Sudbury. As yet this property is
flot In production for any minerai.
No deposits of phosphate rock of workable grade
have been found in Canada as yet.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I
have visited the Sait plant near Unity, where

they have a wonderful method of producing
sait from. depth by pumping brine. They had
hoped to use a similar method with potash,
and they spent a great deal of money and

decided to sink a shaft. The area of the
shaft is 13 feet 6 inches, and it has to go to a
depth of 3,000 feet or more, as the honourable
leader just stated. In order to pass through
water and quicksand it is necessary to employ
a method of freezing. An Anierican company
has bought the rights to a great deal of the
land on Patience Lake, 20 or 30 miles east
of Saskatoon, and has declared its intention
of going ahead. I know for a fact that the
University of Saskatchewan holds some
thirteen quarter-sections of land on the
eastern edge of Saskatoon, and this company

has offered $1,000 a quarter-section for the
rights to the potash under that land. It is
quite evident that all that is required to get
potash in any quantity is an economical
method o! bringing it to the surface.
I read in a recent press dispatch that a
firm was considering sinking a shaft i the
vicinity of Yorkton. This is a further indication of the strong possîbility of getting plenty
of potash in the near future.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask what other
use potash has besides being an ingredient
in soap?
Hon. Mr. Horner: It is used in the making
of fertilizer. I am sure that is why the honourable senator from King's (Hon. Mr. McDonald) is interested in it. It is my understanding that great deposits of potash are
found in Germany, and the particular type
of fertilizer made from it is very suitable for
certain types of soil. I think I am correct in
saying that practically ail the potash used ini
Canada today is imported.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: When is the American company llkely to commence producing potash?
Hon. Mr. Hornes: It has been said that the
company is going to build a railway and start
producing immediately. Indeed, I am not sure
that it has not already commenced sinking one
or two sha!ts in what it calîs test holes. It

knows potash is there, and that it is at pratically the same depth as at Unity.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators,
at the suggestion of the honourable Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and
with leave of the Senate, I might offer a
word of explanation as to why I made the
inquiry at this tume. But first may I thank
the honourable leader and the Department of
Mines and Technical Surveys for the inf ormation that has just been presented.
I realize that the session is drawing near to
a close and the time for obtaining information
is short. Last week I gave notice also of an
inquiry as to the possibflity of marketing
Canadian apples in Britain next fah and win-

ter. If it is not; possible to get an answer to
that question before prorogation, I would
appreciate it if the honourable leader would
send it on to me as soon as it comes to hhn.
Indications are that this year Canada will
have a fair apple crop, and it will be necessary to secure an outside market for a large
portion of it. Honourable senators from Nova
Scotia and from other parts of the country

will reniember that last year the fruit growers
in the Maritimes were very hard hit by the
damage caused by the hurricane which hit
that area, destroying 85 per cent o! the apple
crop shortly before picking time. In the provinces o! Quebec, Ontario, British Columibia,

SENATE
and to a lesser degree in two or three other
provinces it is expected that quite a large
crop of apples will be gathered this year.
It will certainly mean a lot to our fruit
growers if surplus apples can be marketed in
Great Britain.
I inquired about the fertilizer, honourable
senators, with a view to following up a recommendation made-as many of us here will
remember-at the conclusion of the inquiry
into plant fertilizers by the Standing Committee on Natural Resources in 1947. At that
time the members of the committee felt that
Canada should become self-supporting in its
supply of the main chemicals that enter into
the manufacture of fertilizers. As honourable senators know, three main chemicals
are needed in the soil to produce maximum
crops, in addition, of course, to a number of
other mineral elements in lesser degree. The
three main elements are, firstly, nitrogen, the
basis of nitrogenous fertilizers; secondly, phosphoric acid, the basis of phosphate fertilizers,
and made from rock phosphate; and, thirdly,
potash, the basis of potassic fertilizers. Canada at the present time is producing its own
requirements of nitrates, although some mixtures of nitrates are being imported, but we
are hoping that the time is not far distant
when it will not be necessary to import any
nitrogenous fertilizer. I understand these combinations will soon be manufactured in Canada. As a matter of fact, only one-fifth of the
nitrates produced in Canada today are utilized
in Canada, the balance being sold to other
agricultural areas of the world.
Canada does not produce potash in any
great quantity. A little phosphoric acid is
produced here, but not very much. As shown
in the report, the reason we do not produce
much phosphoric acid is that no sufficiently
high-grade deposits of rock phosphate have as
yet been found in Canada. We are in hopes,
though, that some of our prospectors, assisted
by the Department of Mines and Technical
Surveys, will soon discover deposits of highgrade rock phosphate, and if this is done our
requirements of phosphoric acid can be manufactured in Canada. Canada imports something like 500,000 tons of rock phosphate a
year, and along with our importations of
potash this means an expenditure by Canada
of something over $12 million a year. At
the time the committee was conducting its
inquiry the annual expenditure was about
$12 million. As the years go by there is an
increasing demand for fertilizers and consequently an increased yearly expenditure
for imports.
According to the honourable senator from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner), potash is
imported from Germany.
Hon. Mr. Horner: And the United States.

Hon. Mr. McDonald: I want to thank the
honourable senator for the information he has
given us this afternoon. Like the answer to
the inquiry, it is encouraging. It shows that
efforts are evidently still being made to find
some economic method of recovering potash
from these Saskatchewan deposits.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable senator a question? I was at Muscle
Shoals, Alabama, in recent years and while
there I was given to understand that there
they are manufacturing both phosphates and
nitrates from the air by an electrical process.
Are we doing that in Canada at all?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: We are producing some
nitrates from the air, but not phosphates.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Pardon me, honourable
senators, for rising again. The Consolidated
Mining and Smelting Company at Trail, British
Columbia, has for years been manufacturing
a fertilizer that sells very popularly in the
Prairie Provinces. Another mining company,
Sherritt Gordon, which formerly shipped its
concentrates to Trail, now has a plant in
operation near Edmonton in which it expects
to produce millions of dollars worth of fertilizers yearly. They are a by-product of the
smelting process. For quite a number of
years the fumes from the Trail smelters were
killing orchards south of the border, and the
elimination of the nuisance led to utilization
of these vapours in the manufacture of fertilizers. This is a great advantage to both
companies. As I understand it, their combined fertilizer products will take care of the
needs of the country.
Hon. Mr. S±ambaugh: The fertilizer provided from the Trail Smelters is chiefly phosphates and nitrates. But I understand that
the addition of potash will make a complete
fertilizer.
Hon. Mr. Horner: For certain soils.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Yes.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable senators, if the purpose of this inquiry is to
obtain further information as to the possibility of Canada supplying more of these
materials as well as importing sufficient
quantities to meet the demand, it would be
important, I think, at this time to indicate
the agencies through which they are now
distributed. If there is any definite object
in mind in bringing this subject to bear
on the needs of agriculture in this country,
certainly it is apropos to gain some knowledge
of the available distributing agencies, because
prior to the late war these chemicals became
subject to, complete control by world-encircling cartels. I believe that once before,

I should like to make a few remarks which

SENATE
to the bushel, which is below the weight of
wheat used for flour. But we were amazed
to find that this wheat possesses the highest
feed value of any of our feed grains. This
can be fairly conclusively proven by making
a test with laying hens. You can put some
No. 1 big, plump wheat and some of this
rusted light wheat on the ground, and the
hens will go for the lighter wheat every time
and they will lay better after feeding on it.
There is something strange about this fact;
perhaps the wheat in its lighter form contains
extra protein value. Eastern feeders pay
quite a high price for bran, which is a safer
feed than wheat, and of course light wheat
is safer than heavy wheat as a feed grain.
When viewing the part of Ontario I journeyed
across yesterday morning the thought came
to me that the oats ripening in the fields
must be of a light quality, and that Eastern
farmers will require some of the light feed
from Western Canada that I have been
talking about. There is a large supply of it.
It is quite safe to use for feed, and it will
be useful to mix with oats. I would recommend eastern feeders and dairy farmers to
buy Western wheat, whenever they are in
need of wheat for feed.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Will the wheat you
speak of cost less money?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Oh, yes, it will cost less
money, but it is good wheat. The price quotations show that some of it grades as low as
feed. No. 1 wheat to grade should weigh at
least 58 pounds per bushel, Nos. 2 and 3
should weigh 56 pounds. Nothing lighter
than 50 pounds per bushel can possibly get
any higher grade than No. 5. So considering
the price of this light wheat, it is good value.
Only last winter I learned that a great many
farmers in the West are of the opinion that
it is valuable wheat for feed. It is necessary
to keep this grain quite dry and to prevent
it from becoming heated. I am assured,
honourable senators, that a lot of it is threshed
in good condition; and except for the small
kernels there is nothing wrong with it.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Since the honourable
senator has just returned from the Canadian
West, can he tell us what the crop prospects are in that part of the country?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Of course, Western
Canada has become hot and dry, except in
some sections where rain has fallen. Thousands of gallons of water have been poured
on the land in the dry sections, but it is still
dry and some of the crops have been damaged.
Rain has fallen in the south. I took a
trip down through Maple Creek, Cyprus Hills,
Medicine Hat and Swift Current, and the
scenery was lovely and green and the crops

good, in spite of the intense heat without rain.
Conditions vary greatly. Where the crops
are lush and green, one may return within
two or three days and see the same fields
entirely different in appearance, as though
they belonged to another farm. I would
hesitate to predict any bumper crop. The
late barley has been attacked by aphids,
and destruction by those pests has been pretty
widespread. I did not have a chance to
examine the barley crop closely, but I could
see fields which had received considerable
damage. I motored across that beautiful
country from Calgary through Red Deer,
Stettler and Biggar, and saw some very nice
stands of grain, but the weather was hot and
dry, and just how long those crops will continue to be good is difficult to estimate. One
year I estimated the crop to the exact million
of bushels, but I am not going to attempt to
estimate this year's yield. It is always someone else, rather than the farmer, who drives
around the country and comes back with
glowing reports, and I do not think that
helps the farmer to get a fair price for his
grain. I hesitate to predict a bumper crop;
it is going to be less than the estimate.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: What is the estimate?
Hon. Mr. Horner: 550 million bushels.
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: Is that the estimate
for wheat?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes. The estimators can
take their pen and cut off 100 million bushels.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: May I ask the honourable member a question? I take it that the
rusted wheat he spoke of is all spring wheat,
and that none of it would be winter wheat.
Hon. Mr. Horner: It is all spring wheat. I
doubt if rust hits winter wheat at all.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: It would be good for
feed, but hardly successful for seed in this
part of the country?
Hon. Mr. Horner: It is quite possible that
it could be used for seed, but I would not
recommend it.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
you will notice that under the heading
Orders of the Day we have a blank sheet of
paper. The only legislation remaining to be
dealt with this session is the bill voting money
to cover the financial requirements of the
Government. That bill can only be presented
to us after the Committee of Supply in the
House of Commons has dealt with the Estimates, and I do not know just when it will
reach the Senate. I have made inquiries and
found that today the Committee of Supply

JULY 26, 1955
has been considering carefully and expeditiously the items before it and that it may
possibly conclude its work some time this
evening. I therefore think it would be advisable for the Senate to adjourn during
pleasure, to reassemble at the call of the bell,
at approximately 8.30 p.m. I so move.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

At 8.30 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
this afternoon we adjourned to this hour to
try to reach some conclusion as to when the
House of Commons might finish its consideration of the estimates. I have learned that
the members of that house have agreed to sit
after ten o'clock this evening. It is therefore possible that the Committee of Supply
may complete its work late tonight or tornorrow morning. It occurs to me that under
the circumstances it might be satisfactory to
adjourn now until one o'clock tomorrow
afternoon. We could arrange to have our
lunch before resuming, and if at that time the

supply bill has come to us from the Conmons
we could consider it immediately, with the
possibility of prorogation taking place later
in the afternoon.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable leader if there is any chance of the
Commons finishing its business tonight? In

THE SENATE

JULY 27, 1955
to this inquiry by the honourable senator
from King's as to the British market for
Canadian apples. Of course the old question
still is: What goods do we buy from Britain?
That is the crux of the whole problem. If we
were to purchase more goods from Britain it
would be in a position to buy more of our
commodities, because it would have the
dollars to purchase them with.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: We are buying motor
cars and other articles from Britain.
Hon. Mr. Horner: We are buying a good
deal more from the United States, with the
result that the balance of trade is upset.
I realize that very little opportunity for
debate is left, for prorogation will take place
shortly. It sometimes seems to me that in this
chamber, which contains so many men of
great experience and ability, questions of
common interest and matters for the general
welfare of the Canadian people are not discussed as fully and as often as they might be.
It may be that the public expects more consideration from us of the trend and scope of
the enormous changes and advances which
are taking place nowadays in this country
and in the world at large.
Take, for example, one consequence of the
enormous increase in the number of automobiles and the extent of our highways: I
mean the rise in the accident rate. In many
cases, as I have remarked before, the victims
are young people, and too often there is no
excuse for these casualties. Our highways as
a rule are good enough for motoring at a
fair rate of speed. Just recently, while driving north from Calgary to Edmonton, I
noticed on the highway signs announcing that
the speed was strictly limited to sixty miles
an hour, and that the road was radarcontrolled. Notwithstanding these warnings,
while I was travelling at 60 miles an hour
several cars shot by me as though I were
standing still. The drivers of one fine new
Studebaker and an older car seemed to be
anxious to outdo each other; and farther on,
while coming down an absolutely straight
stretch of road, I saw the older car virtually
across the road and the new Studebaker
almost hidden in the ditch. Fortunately, no
one appeared to have been severely injured,
but both cars and, I believe, a third one were
badly damaged. There is no justification for
inviting accidents by maintaining these excessively high speeds. The road was good and
entirely clear. That is the sort of thing which
is happening all over the country.
Yesterday, when speaking of "rusted
wheat", I did not make my meaning quite
clear. It is not the wheat which is rusted,
though many people in Eastern Canada may
have a misconception on this point. What

takes place is that the rust affects the straw
by making holes in it so that it is not
capable of absorbing moisture to properly fill
the kernels; so when the wheat forms, it
cannot continue to develop. What I was
trying to point out is that a bushel of light
wheat may contain kernels which have the
wheat germ and are therefore more valuable
for feed than heavier grain.
I want to mention something which has
pleased me greatly. I do not know whether
I should take some credit for it, but Lloyd's
of London have extended by five days the
time limit for insurance on the Hudson BayChurchill route. This will particularly benefit us in Saskatchewan. There is every
modern method of forecasting weather in
the North now, and if it were possible I
should like to see the period of this insurance
made more flexible to suit our varying seasons.
I think that in this year, as in most years,
the time limit could be extended by five
weeks instead of five days.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: The rate of insurance on
the Churchill route is pretty high, is it not?
Hon. Mr. Horner: I understand that during
a certain short period the rate is similar to
that applying to other ports, but beyond that
period the rate is very high. I hasten to
point out that the Hudson Bay-Churchill
route is one of the safest in the world, and
Churchill has the finest harbour, bar none.
Hon. Mr. Isnor. For how long?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Men sailed into Churchill
three or four hundred years ago in wooden
ships, and certainly without radar. Vessels
sailing on the St. Lawrence River require the
services of a pilot for about two days, but
those plying the Churchill route need a pilot
for only about five minutes. So there are
no extra costs involved at Churchill. It is
a beautiful, sheltered harbour in a perfect
setting. No dredging is required in the river
mouth, and there is little doubt that a proper
icebreaker could make the harbour navigable
during the entire year.
The Government is making a wise move in
appointing a Royal Commission to inquire
into the whole economy of Canada. I hope
the inquiry will accomplish a great deal in
answering the question whether this country
is going to be turned into a purely industrial
nation at the expense of agriculture. It is
deplorable that all over Canada farms where
large familles were raised have been abandoned. This is especially so in Eastern
Canada. I understand that the Royal Commission will endeavour, among other things,
to establish what is the best economic farm
unit. Economics involves the question of
trade, which is bound up in the fact that, as

SENATE

pointed out recently by the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), we endeavour to maintain industry
that is not natural to this country. In spite
of the drought and other obstacles to growth,
with which every agricultural country has to
contend, Western Canada still grows the
finest grain in the world-there is no doubt of
that. Even the United States is anxious to
secure the better quality and heavier oats
which is grown in our Canadian West.
Honourable senators, I hope the Government will be very careful in its selection of
the personnel to be appointed on this Royal
Commission. I hope it will not limit appointments to lawyers and judges, but that it will
include at least one practical farmer. Recently
I read a very interesting article in the
Saturday Evening Post about a man who
made a huge success in clearing land and
planting trees for the purpose of obtaining
turpentine. He went to work tapping trees
and catching the gum when he was only ten
years of age, and he became so good at it
that be could tap more trees than any man
on his father's plantation. At the age of
twenty he decided to study law, and later he
became a judge, but that did not prevent him
from taking a practical viewpoint of things
and being a successful businessman. He insisted on giving his sons a good education,
but he also required them to tap trees and
work in the woods from ten years of age,
in the hope that it would make men of them.
Honourable senators, this country is travelling at a great pace, and I hope it will
continue to do so, but I am somewhat concerned about its progress in relation to farming. The part of the country I rode over as
a boy is now practically all staked for
uranium. A lot of people heve traded in
uranium stocks, and I trust their hopes will
be realized. However, I think it would be
safer to invest in a little farm land.
I will now go back to the subject I started
with, that is buying from Britain and selling
to ber in return. For the past eight years
there has been a so-called cement shortage,
and people who have been in a hurry to
build have, without justification, been charged
two prices for cement, sometimes paying up
to $3 a bag. Anyone going up to Churchill
would perhaps sec some British ships coming
in, and notwithstanding the fact their owners
would like to bring over a full cargo-for
instance, a cargo of cement, costing about 80
cents a bag-some of the ships come in
ballasted with water. That is the sad part of
the story. Captains of ships have told me that
if they could have a cargo both going and
coming they would prefer Churchill to any
other port in Canada. Now, why could those
ships not bring in cement, which is so badly

needed here? Of course, Canadian cement
companies announce that they can supply
our requirements; but whether they can or
not they seem to be doing pretty well-I
notice that the Canada Cement Company has
been paying a nice dividend. I wish my
honourable friend from King's (Hon. Mr.
McDonald) would do all he can to encourage
imports from Britain of cement and other
commodities that are scarce here. I might
mention that when I was trying to do some
building on my ranch I was told that the
shortage of cement in Canada accunted for
the high price charged in this country for
American cement. I have heard it said that
in some cases Canadian cement was put into
American cement bags sa as to obtain the
difference in price of a dollar a sack.
These are matters that we in this chamber
should give some thought to. I know that I
have been out of order in discussing them at
this time, but to my mind they are of vital
importance to our economic welfare. I am
delighted that the Government is setting up
a Royal Commission, the first of its kind, to
inquire into the whole Canadian economy. I
repeat that I hope the Government will exercise care in the selection of its personnel and
make sure that men of the right type are
appointed.
Thank you, honourable senators, for your
patience.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

At 5.45 p.m. the sitting was resumed.

BRITISH MARKET FOR CANADIAN
APPLES
INQUIRY AND ANSWER

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Recently, the honourable senator from King's (Hon. Mr.
McDonald) inquired of the Government:
What are the latest developments regarding the
Canadian apples in
of marketing
possibility
Britain next fall and winter?

I have now received the following answer
through the Deputy Minister of Trade and
Commerce:
It is anticipated that a decision will be taken
by and advice received from the Government of
the United Kingdom at an early date relating to
the marketing of Canadian apples in the United
Kingdom during the forthcoming season. Officers
of the Department of Trade and Commerce in
London, England, are maintaining close contact
with the British authorities and keeping them
currently informed of our position.

This information is probably not as com-

plete as some honourable senators would
desire, but nevertheless we know that the
Department of Trade and Commerce is
doing all that is possible to obtain a market
for apples in the United Kingdom.
Hon. John A. McDonald: I wish to thank
the honourable leader, and through him the
appropriate officials of the Department o!
Trade and Commerce, for securing this
information.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
may I at this time refer to the remarks-the
very interesting remarks-made by the honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner) this afternoon. I did not speak at
that time, as I did not have at hand information which I wanted to give to the house.
I agree entirely with my honourable friend
that it is advisable that members of the
Senate who have special knowledge on certain subjects should give to the Senate, and
in that way to the country generally, the
advantage of this knowledge. The honourable senator from Blaine Lake was not here
last Thursday when the honourable senator
from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) spoke
on prepaid health insurance, a subject on
which he has special knowledge. It was a
very interesting discussion that we had at
that time. I notice the honourable senator
from Blaine Lake nods his head. No doubt
he bas read what took place on that occasion. I hope that next session other senators
will give us the advantage of special knowledge which they possess.
ROYAL COMMISSION ON CANADIAN
ECONOMY
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
earlier today the honourable senator from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) referred to

the Royal Commission to inquire into the
economic potentialities of our country. I
might say that the commission bas already
been set up.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I did not know that.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: With the consent of
the house I should like to place on our
records a copy of the Order in Council setting up the commission, listing its powers
and generally setting forth the problems
which it is to study and report upon. This
document could appear in Han.sard or in our
Minutes of the Proceedings, as the bouse
desires.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Put it on Hansard.
For text of Order in Council, see Appendix
to today's Hansard, p.825.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I now table the Order
in Council, P.C. 1955-909, in English and in
French.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Will the honourable
leader tell us who the members of the commission are?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, I will be be glad
to do that. The Chairman of the commission
is Walter Lockhart Gordon, of Toronto, Ontario, a chartered accountant; and the other
members are: Omer Lussier, of Quebec City,
a forestry engineer; Albert Edward Grauer,
of Vancouver, British Columbia, President of
British Columbia Electric Company Limited;
Andrew Stewart, of Edmonton, Alberta, President of the University of Alberta; and Rayof Memorial
mond Gushue, President
University, St. John's, Newfoundland.
I am sure that the report of this commission
will be very useful indeed.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In general, what is the
purpose of the inquiry? What is the commision to study and report on?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: According to the
Order in Council, the commissioners are:
To inquire into and report upon the long-term
prospects of the Canadian economy, that is to say,
upon the probable economic development of Canada and the problems to which such development
appears likely to give rise, and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, to study and
report upon
(a) developments in the supply of raw materials
and energy sources;
(b) the growth to be expected in the population
of Canada and the changes in its distribution;
(c) prospects for growth and change in domestie
and external markets for Canadian productions;
productivity and standards of
(d) trends in
living; and
prospective requirements for industrial and
(e)
social capital.

I think that sets forth generally what the
commission is authorized to make inquiries
into.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Horner: Certainly the problem is
an immense one. I am personally acquainted
with one of the commissioners-Dr. Stewart,
of the University of Alberta. May I seriously
suggest to the Government that more commissioners should be appointed to deal with a
task of such magnitude? I would recommend
the addition of six competent persons, including agriculturists. I suppose the commission
will be required to go into the whole question of the future development of this country; for instance, what type of immigrants
should we bring in, and in what numbers,
to fill our vacant spaces and to assist in the
cultivation of our farms?
I thank the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) for the information he has given, and I would press
my suggestion that additional persons be appointed to the commission.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Including some lawyers?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Possibly a lawyer would
not do any harm.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: That is quite a concession.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I hope that the commission will include at least one practical farmer,
as well as a lawyer to keep the members in
line and ensure that their findings are in
strict accordance with law. In my opinion the
size of the commission as at present constituted is not adequate to so extensive an
nquiry.
Hon. J. Adelard Godbou±: Honourable senators, the proper number of commissioners is
a matter of opinion. Speaking personally, I
never knew of a very big commission which
did very much work. It must be remembered
that the members of this commission will not
be working entirely by themselves, but will
be consulting with advisers.
As a farmer myself, I think the agricultural
industry is well represented on the commission, both as to numbers and quality. Mr.
Omer Lussier, of Quebec, an excellent forestry
engineer, is also a farmer; and Dr. Stewart,
President of the University of Alberta, is also
an agriculturist. About three weeks ago I
had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Stewart,

when he was presiding over a convention that
I attended, at Edmonton; and I understand
that he is one of the most highly regarded
men in the agricultural field in all Canada.
As to numbers, I certainly think that five
members are sufficient to carry on the work
of a commission of this type.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: May I ask the honourable leader if lie knows what itinerary and
meetings have been decided upon by the
members of the commission
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I have no information
with respect to that. I understand the commission has held one meeting, but I do not
know how it proposes to proceed with its
investigation. No doubt the Press will carry
this information when it is disclosed by the
commission.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
the Appropriation Bill has not yet reached us,
so there is no business for us to attend to at
this time. I do not know just when the bill
will come over from the House of Commons,
but I trust that honourable members will
remain in the building, for I have every reason to believe that Parliament will be prorogued today. I therefore suggest we rise
now, to reassemble at the call of the bell.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

At 10.05 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
the Committee of Supply in the House of
Commons has not yet completed consideration
of the estimates, and therefore the Approprition Bill is not before this house. Under the
circumstances, I move, with unanimous consent, that when the Senate rises this evening
it stand adjourned until tomorrow at 12

The motion was agreed to.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, as Her Honour the Speaker has not yet
received the Appropriation Bill frorn the
House of Commons, there is nothing before
the Senate for consideration at this time. I
hope the bill will reach us early this afternoon, and accordingly I would suggest that we
rise now, to reassemble at the call of the
bell.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

At 12.35 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 5
FIRST READING
A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 510, an Act for granting
to Her Majesty certain sums of money for
the public service of the financial year ending the 31st March, 1956.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND

READING

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall this bill be read the
second time?
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I move the second reading now.
Though this is the fifth appropriation bill
that we have had before us this session, it is
only the fourth one voting moneys for the
present fiscal year. Appropriation Bill No. 2
provided funds to cover the supplementary
expenditures made during the fiscal year
1954-1955. Appropriation Bills Nos. 1, 3 and
4, based on estimates for the current year,
were interim supply bills. The first of these,
as honourable senators will recall, provided
supply for two months, with a few additions
to meet expenditures which are greater in the
early part of the year than later on; and the
other two each provided interim supply for
one month.
Section 2 of the bill provides for expenditures amounting to $2,055,741,938.07. Details

of these expenditures will be found in Schedule A, which contains the estimates that were
tabled in the House of Commons and, subsequently, here. They are in ail respects similar to the estimates originally tabled, with
the exception of two items-a reduction of
$30,000 in vote No. 331, and of $199,999 in
vote No. 544. The first reduction is in a
grant to the pulp and paper industry, for research; and the second has to do with the
Canadian International Trade Fair.
Section 3, providing for a grant of $147,724,276, is based on supplementary estimates
which have been tabled and copies of which
all honourable senators have received. The
items are set forth in Schedule B.
Section 4 authorizes a vote of $500,000,
which is a further supplementary estimate
towards defraying the several charges and
expenses of the public service, details of
which are set forth in Schedule C to the bill.
This vote is to urovide for assistance to producers of salted fish.
The total expenditure authorized by this
bill, covering the three items which I have
mentioned, is $2,203,966,214.07.
The three
previous appropriation bills for the current
fiscal year which we passed during this session voted a total of $1,036,498,806.93, so the
grand total of appropriations for the year is
$3,240,465,021.00.
Section 5 of the bill enables the Governor
in Council to raise money by loan to the
extent of $500 million during the present
fiscal year.
Honourable senators, with the brief time
at my disposai I feel I have given as satisfactory an explanation as I can of just what
this bill contains. I suppose that if we had
time it would be desirable to go through all
the items, but I would remind the house that
during the session we referred the estimates
to our Standing Committee on Finance, which
was chaired by the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). He and his
committee examined the estimates very carefully and brought in a report to this house,
which became the subject of debate. At that
time I commended the chairman and the
members of the Finance Committee for the
splendid work which they had done. I am
sure all honourable members studied the
estimates and read the report before it was
concurred in; so in considering this bill we
are not dealing with something which is
entirely new.
The bill authorizes quite a large expenditure, but I feel confident that the revenue
will be forthcoming. The economy of the
country is buoyant. Honourable members
will recall that when the budget was brought
down there was considerable unemployment

JULY 28, 1955
and uncertainty as to what the future held
in store for us. The Minister of Finance, however, was quite confident we would weather
the temporary storm, and he assured us
conditions would improve throughout the
country. His forecast was very accurate. I
doubt whether employment in Canada has
ever been at a higher level, and the future is
indeed bright. I feel we can pass this bill
giving the Government the power to expend
the money, knowing that our economy will
remain on a high level. I also feel sure that
the money will be wisely spent by a provident Government whose only interest is the
welfare of all the people of Canada. I therefore move the second reading of this bill.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I do not propose to say very much on this
occasion. I admire the optimism of the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald), but at the same time I cannot
entirely share his belief that all the money
spent by this Government will be wisely
spent, having regard to some of the transactions that have taken place so far. However,
far be it from me to sound a discouraging
note. I hope that-the economy of the country will warrant the expenditure of this
huge sum of money and that we shall be able
to make the payments. May I remind honourable senators, however, that this time of
year is the season of full employment, although I notice that some of the automobile
manufacturing companies have been laying
off a considerable number of employees. I
have expressed before my anxiety with regard
to the pace at which the national housing
scheme has progressed, and I think a similar
anxiety is warranted with regard to the manufacture of automobiles. We should concern
ourselves with the question of whether
there is a saturation point. Unless there is a
great flow of new people to this country, I
wonder if the expansion can be continued and
how secure will be the ownership of all these
houses that have been built under the
National Housing Act with the help of loans
guaranteed by the Government. That will
depend primarily on continuous employment
of the people who are paying for the houses.
I fear that the farming communities will
be faced with the prospect of reduced income
next year. Countries which formerly purchased grain from Canada are trying to solve
currency and other problems by becoming
as self-sufficient as possible, and if they are
able to produce more grain for themselves
the Canadian economy will inevitably be
affected.
Honourable senators, I think we should also
be concerned about the inflationary tendencies
in this country. Some thirty years ago the

value of the dollar was much higher than it
is today, and many people would have made
better provision for their old age if they had
invested in bank shares instead of life
insurance.
With regard to Government expenditures,
I now express the hope that at the beginning
of next session the Leader of the Government will move that the Standing Committee
on Finance be authorized to examine the
expenditures proposed by the estimates, so
that the committee will continue to perform
its useful function as in the past, for it is impossible to make a thorough inquiry into the
estimates during the last days of the session. I
hesitate to refer to the necessity for the committee to study Government expenditures in
great detail because I am mindful, for instance, that a big sum of money was expended
upon the ,construction of a large ferry to operate from Sydney, Cape Breton, to Part aux
Basques, Newfoundland, and when the ferry
was completed it was discovered that there
was no room for it to dock at Port aux
Basques.
Honourable senators, I do not think I can
serve any useful purpose by making further
remarks at this time.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable senators, at this very late hour in the life of
the session one hesitates to say even a few
words in relation to the supply bill. However, certain references have been made by
my honourable friend the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) to the
work of the Standing Committee on Finance
to which I feel in duty bound to make some
allusion even at this time.
The supply bill represents practically half
of the budget for the current year; it includes
many very substantial amounts involving expenditures which have been the subject of
some discussion in the other place. But to
say, or to imply, that these and other items
of the estimates have been thoroughly examined by our Finance Committee is to take
a little too optimistic a view of the committee's work.
My honourable friend the leader knows
very well the circumstances under which
the Finance Committee performed its functions this year. As its report very eloquently
shows, it attempted to consider only three
examples of spending, and expressed the hope
that it would be possible for the public,
through its moral influence, to do much in
turning the trend away from excessive spending and toward economy. But far from having any opportunity or disposition to examine
closely into the estimates that were published, it was expressly stated by the chairman and members, both when the committee

SENATE
started and in its report, that it had no
intention of making such a general examination. Even if it had done so it would have
been to no purpose in reducing the estimates, because they had already been determined and published as the financial policy
of the Government for the current year.
I do not intend to try to take the place
of the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) in making his yearly complaint that these important matters are left
until the last hours of the session and thrust
in front of us when we have not an adequate
opportunity to consider them. I think we
all understand the situation and the reason
for it. But as a sort of vague hope for
the future I should like to say that it might
be a good thing to consider the possibility
of giving more adequate opportunity to members of Parliament to pass on estimates before
they become part of the budget. I have
thought of this problem for a long time, and
if I may say so I think our system in this
respect is defective. Without any apology
I would draw attention to the practice that
has been established in the neighbouring republic to the south in relation to its budgetary
matters.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Do you think the system
prevailing there, in the United States, is
satisfactory?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: The system prevailing
there of appointing a standing committee on
finance in both the Senate and the House
of Representatives, to examine into the proposed budget submitted by the Secretary of
the Treasury, to summon officials, so as to
get their approval or disapproval of items, and
finally to report back to the Treasury is, I
think, a system which allows the representatives of the people a better opportunity to
consider the country's financing than is given
under our system.
I am not criticizing the extent of this
budget. I know that many items are included
in it as a result of demands, and a good many
of them have public approval.
Reference has been made to the extent of
the examination into the estimates by our
Standing Committee on Finance. I believe
that if that committee, acting with a similarly
constituted committee of the House of Commons, were to work in closer co-operation
with the Department of Finance in relation
to the budget and the estimates of the year,
it could do more satisfactory work than it
now does. If such committees had an opportunity of closely examining into the various
items of expenditures, took the time necessary
to do it thoroughly, and were not crowded
out of the picture by some more extemporaneously appointed committees. the results

would be more favourable. Certainly that
system would at least give us an adequate
opportunity of considering the finances of
the country before the proposed expenditures
came before us in their final form. I think
also that the objectives so often expressed in
connection with the function of our Finance
Committee would be more accurately carried
out in encouraging economy and in creating
more popular feeling about curtailing expenditures.
Now, honourable senators, I make these
references to the Finance Committee because
I do not think the Leader of the Government
(Ion. Mr. Macdonald) intended to convey
the impression that the committee conducted
an exhaustive inquiry into all the items in
the estimates. I do think, though, that it
would be a step forward if in the future our
system of examination could be adapted so
as to make it possible, with the leadership
of the Department of Finance, to examine
into the estimates more closely.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
perhaps as an example of what the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
bas just said, there is one item in the estimates which interests me a good deal and I
am sure interests every member of this bouse,
an item which the Finance Committee did
not have an opportunity to consider and
which this bouse bas not so far had any
occasion to deal with. I refer to the estimates
for the Federal District Commission of
Ottawa, item No. 340.
I read with a good deal of interest the
statement made by the Prime Minister in
the other place yesterday when be introduced
the estimates of the Federal District Commission. He referred to the general plan for
the development of Ottawa as a national
capital, and the attempts that are being made
to preserve around the city a green belt which
will ensure that the city and its environs will
always be a credit to our country. The part
of the Prime Minister's statement which particularly interested me had relation to the
problem of railway traffic in and around the
city, and I noticed that be tabled in the
Commons a document entitled "Traffic and
Transportation Plan for Ottawa, Canada",
prepared by Wilbur Smith and Associates.
Also he stated that at the next session of
Parliament a joint committee of the two
houses will be established, as I understand
it, to make a general inquiry into the basic
plans for the development of Ottawa and its
environs. I wonder whether the honourable Leader of the Government would consider tabling that document here, so that we
might have an opportunity to examine it.

JULY 28, 1955
As I said, I was particularly interested in
the Prime Minister's remarks on the problem of railway traffic in and around Ottawa.
Honourable senators will recall that the
original Greber plan, produced a number of
years ago, envisaged a number of admirable
proposals and suggestions, but it included
one recommendation with which I have
always found myself totally unable to agree,
and that was that the railway station, now
situated in the middle of the city, should be
removed to some place on the other side of
the Rideau River, two or three miles away.
I gathered from the remarks of the Prime
Minister in the other place that that part
of the Greber project, at least, is not to be
proceeded with at the present time, and I
shall be very glad to hear that it has been
abandoned. It is proposed, however, as the
Prime Minister said, to remove as much as
possible of the freight trackage from the
centre of the city to the southeastern
boundary; and with that change, I think, all
of us will be in agreement. But for the life
of me I have never been able to see whose
advantage would be served, unless it be that
of the taxi drivers of Ottawa, by removing
the passenger station two or three miles out
of the centre of the city. I know of no capital
in the world which has its railway passenger
station or stations remote from the centre
of the city. For example, take Washington,
or London, or Paris. There are very good
reasons why that is so. Honourable senators
who travel to and from Ottawa can readily
appreciate that it is an enormous convenience,
not only for legislators but for business men
who have to visit the capital, that the station
at which they arrive shall be close to the
government offices. That is the situation
which exists here. It is true that for a time
there was a good deal of complaint about
smoke from trains in the middle of the city,
but that condition is in process of being
rapidly extinguished through the substitution of diesel engines for steam engines.
The principal object for which I rose was
to say that I am delighted to find-assuming
it is a fact-that the original proposai to
remove the passenger station from its present
location has been abandoned, at least for the
time being, and I trust that it will be abandoned permanently.
Hon. ýGordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators, I rise for the purpose of offering, very
briefly, a different view from that expressed
by the honourable senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) as to the system of
preparing the budget estimates. For the past
twenty-five years or more I have followed
the American system very closely, and I am
at a loss to understand why the honourable

senator from Ottawa, with his long experience, should advocate a change from what,
I feel, is regarded by Canadians as a whole,
and by the whole of North America, as a
system very much superior to that of our
neighbours to the south.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Would my honourable
friend indicate his authority for saying that
everybody in North America regards our
system as superior?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I did not say that. I said
the great majority, the people as a whole.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I would like some
authority for that other than his own.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I can refer to as good
authority as my honourable friend relies on
when he expresses an opinion. Honourable
senators will no doubt recall that during
World War II the United States sent a team
of experts to study our financial system,
particularly in relation to wartime expenditures. They examined into our system down
through the years, and I think it is generally
accepted that there has been little if any
criticism of it by American financial authorities.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I interrupt my
honourable friend again? Would he agree
that that delegation from the United States
studied our monetary policy rather than the
machinery of Parliament as related to
finance?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I think perhaps the honourable senator is right in that; but, after all,
the effect of our monetary system upon our
general expenditures involves the basic principle. That is why I feel that our systemHon. Mr. Lambert: I do not want to persist
in interrupting my honourable friend, but I
should like to clarify a point he is bringing
up. I remember quite well the visit of the
American financial experts, for I met some
of them in conjunction with the late Deputy
Minister of Finance, Dr. Clark. The whole
purpose of their visit here was to examine
into the existing situation in Canada that
made it possible for this country to pay a
larger measure of the current expenses of
the war as it went along than the United
States was able to do.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: That is quite right. I did
not raise that point at ail. My honourable
friend is only enlarging the thought I was
expressing. I did not think time permitted
to go into details. If the policy advocated
by the honourable member from Ottawa were
put into effect here, and a committee were
set up to handle our budget items, we would
have the same experience as they have in
the United States: large pressure groups would

After which His Excellency the Administrator was pleased to close the Second Session of the Twenty-Second Parliament with

Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
Since we first met earlier this year there
has been considerable evidence that the
policies of the free nations to combine their
strength in order to deter any threat from a
potential aggressor have been successful. My
ministers believe that the more encouraging
signs of international harmony are proof of
the wisdom of the measures thus taken in
co-operation with other democracies. While
continuing to support the United Nations and
to use all available diplomatic channels for
the easing. of international tensions, they
remain convinced of the necessity of continuing to improve the combined defence
power of the North Atlantic Alliance. Towards the fulfilment of this aim you have
approved the Paris agreements which ended
the occupation of Western Germany and
which enabled the German Federal Republic
to join the defensive alliance of the West.
During the session several of my ministers
met with representatives of the ten provincial
Governments

to make arrangements for a

federal-provincial conference which will take
place this autumn.
Meetings between the federal and provincial representatives were held in June for
the purpose of determining a plan to share
the costs of assistance to unemployed persons
in need. The suggestions put forward at these
meetings are now being studied by the provincial Governments and the acceptances of
three of them have already been received.

In the early months of thd session the
employment situation gave some concern but
more recently the requests for labour have
greatly increased and the expanding production, rising exports and prospects of bountiful
crops indicate a continuing healthy state of
the Canadian economy.
Because the economic well-being of the
nation depends to such an extent on a high
level of foreign trade, the Government has
pursued policies aimed at securing the most
favourable export markets for the products
of our labour and our land. At the international review of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade which took place last fall
and winter, Canadian delegates were active
in supporting a policy of removing trade
restrictions and negotiating improved tariff
arrangements.
A substantial revision of the Unemployment Insurance Act has been made in the
light of past experience with this legislation.
The coverage of the act bas been broadened,
the periods of entitlement to benefits revised
and the amount of both regular and supplementary benefits augmented.
To maintain the high standards of welfare
measures in this country you have made
amendments to the Blind Persons Act, the
War Veterans Allowance Act and the Veterans
Benefit Act.
Legislation has been enacted to provide
for the inspection of meat and the establishment of standards for other agricultural
products.
The amendments made to the Municipal
Grants Act increase substantially the amounts
to be paid by the Government annually to
the municipalities for their services to public
buildings.
The various enactments relating to the
Canadian National Railways have been consolidated in one statute.
You have passed a measure amending the
National Parks Act and making provision for
the establishment of a national park in the
province of Newfoundland.
Other measures you enacted include: the
International River Improvement Act, the
Foreign Aircraft Third Party Damage Act,
the Canadian Forces Act, 1955, the Great
Lakes Fisheries Convention Act and the
Exportation of Power and Fluids and Importation of Gas Act.
Amendments have been made to the Criminal Code, the Canada Grain Act, the Railway
Act, the Radio Act, the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act, the Defence Production Act,
the Judges Act, the Canada Elections Act, the

Canada's economic future.

upon a uniform system of establishing manufacturers' prices for the application of the
