Bonourable Membera of the Senate:
Members of the Bouse of Commons:
As you are only too well aware, all efforts
to maintain the peace of Europe have failed.
The United Kingdom, in honouring pledges
given as a means of avoiding hostilities, bas
become engaged in war with Germany. You
have been summoned at the earlieat moment in
order that the Government may seek authority
for the measures necessary for the defence of
Canada, and for co-operation in the determined
effort wvhieh is being made to resist further
aggression, and to prevent the appeal to force

War Measures Act and other existing authority.
Proposais for further effective action by Canada

You will be asked to consider estimates to
provide for expenditure which bas been or may
be caused by the state of war which now exista.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I need flot speak of the extreme gravity of
this hour. There can have been few, if any,
more critical in the history of the world. The
people of Canada are f acing the crisis with the
same fortitude that to-day supports the peoples
of the United Kingdom and other of the nations
of the British Commonwealth. My Ministers
are convinced that Canada is prepared to unite
in a national effort to defend to the utmost
liberties and institutions which are a common
heritage.
The buse of Commons withdrew.

THE

ROYAL VISIT

LETTER FROM HIS MAJESTY THE KING

HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able senators, I have been requested to communicate to this Chamber a letter written on
July 13, 1939, by His Majesty King George VI.
It is as follows:
Buckingham Palace
l3th July, 1939.
My dear Prime Minister:
Since my return to England, I have been
f ully occupied with work which had aceumulated in my absence; I fear you must have
had a similar experience when you got back
to Ottawa.
But I do not wish to let more time elapse
without telling you how deeply gra.teful I arn
to you, and to your colleagues in my Canadian

87136-2

REVIsaDEDITION

SENATE

Government. for all the care and forethouglit
that you bestowed on the preparations for my
recent visit. Both the Queen and I realize
what heavy responsibilities such a tour as ours
lays on the shoulders of Ministers, and we appreciate highly the manner in which those responsibilities were discharged. Its unquestioned success
was very largely due to the skill with which
it was planned; and though it could not, in
the time at our disposal, be anything but
strenuous in character, we were sensible throughout that every possible consideration had been
given both to our safety and to our comfort.
It was a great satisfaction to me to have
an opportunity from time .to time of meeting
so many of my Canadian Ministers, and I feel
that my knowledge of the country as a whole
bas been considcrably enlarged by the conversations that I lad with them on many occasions.
To you personally I am particularly grateful
for your helpful advice and support while you
were in attendance on me; I need hardly say
that I found your mature experience of Canadian affairs of very great v.alue.
The gold bowl, given to us by the Canadian
Government, has now arrived here safely; I
should be glad if you wouid, on some suitable
occasion, convey to your colleagues the cordial
thanks of the Queen and myself for this present,
which. apart from its beauty of design and
craftsmanship. is a delightful memento of our
long journey.
Before the summer is over you will, I hope,
be able to get some real rest. for you have

had am especially busy and exacting year.

I

send you my best wishes for a pleasant holiday.

Believe me.
Yours very sincerely.

aeave to meet in the Senate Chamber

The motion was agrecd to.
THE OUTBREAK OF WAR
DOCUMENTS

TABLED

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: I beg to lay
on the Table copies. in English and in French,
of documents relating to the outbreak of war,
September 1939. Copies of these documents
are being distributed this afternoon. I desire
aiso to table copies of emergency Orders in
Couneil passed since August 25, 1939.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I wish to refer to the two
sets of documents laid on the Table by the
honourable leader of the Government, which
are of momentous consequence to us. If I
caught his words correctly, the first set
contains copies of correspondence with the
British Government-possibly other documents too-relating to the subject-matter of
the Speech from the Throne, namely, the
present crisis; and the second set contains
copies of what the honourable leader described
as emergency Orders in Council. As to the
first, before examining it I should like to ask:
does it comprise all such correspondence, and
give a synopsis of communications by long
distance telephone, including any with the
Canadian High Commissioner in London?
As to the second set, I was astonished at the
volume of papers submitted as emergency
Orders in Council. It looked to be large
enough to contain almost a thousand. Would
the honourable leader of the House clarify,
in some way, just what is meant by emergency
Orders in Council? If all these documents
are emergency Orders in Council, the word
" emergency " must have a pretty wide scope.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have not had
occasion to look through all these Orders in
Council. A perusal of them will show my
right honourable friend what important
activities have been carried on by the
Executive during the last few days. I shall
examine these Orders in Council with my
right honourable friend and ascertain whether
they deal only with the emergency situation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is,
whether they relate altogether to the present
crisis in Europe?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: As to the first
set of documents-

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am net in a
position to answer my right honourable friend's
question on that point now. He may get his
answer by perusing these documents. If he
wishes, I shall peruse them with him.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should like
the honourable leader to read the question I
have asked him. It is quite understandable
that he would not be able to answer it now.
The answer cannot be found by perusal of the
documents; that would disclose only what
they contain, but not what is missing.

3

SEPTEMBER '7, 1939
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My rigbt bonourable friend apparently thinks that the
second set of documents is too voluminous,
but that the first is flot voluminous enough.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:- It may flot be.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If perusal of
the documents does not give my right honourable friend the information he is seeking, I
shall answer birn to-morrow.
The Senate adI ourned until to-morrow at
3 p.m.

THE LATE SENATOR O'CONNOR
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, since separating in the early days of
June last we have learned with sorrow that
one of our colleagues, the Hon. Frank
O'Connor, has lef t us. We had heen aware
that for the last two years his health had
been far from good, and that he had in fact
suffered from what, I believe, 'was a stroke.
Nevertheless, we were in hopes that he would
recover his health and return to share in our
labours. But Fate decided otherwise, and at
the age of 54 that once strong and active man
has disappeared from our midst.
I confess that up to the time he entered
this Chamber I knew very little of our late
colleague, except through his activities in the
industrial world and tbe founding by him of
a chain of stores which distributed bis goods
throughout this land and the United States.
He had a decided genius for organization,
and by means of an article of special quality
which was in demand be made bis way up the
bill and became one of the outstanding
financial figures in the city of Toronto-a
man of whom that city and Canada as a
wbole had reason to be proud. Since bis
entrance into this Chamber I learned of bis
generosity to charitable institutions of al
kinds.
He was popular tbroughout the
community because of bis geniality and bigheartedness. As he was flot long among us.
87138--2j

we bad little opportunity to judge of bis
opinions and work in the national field. We
do know that in bis life's short day be did
a good day's work.
I arn sure that ail who knew the late
Senator O'Connor mourn bis sudden departure,
and in the name of the Senate I desire to
convey to his family a sympatby wbich I arn
sure is shared by ail members of this Chamber.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEICHEN: Honourable niembers, those of us who were able
to attend the last sad rites of Senator
O'Connor were deeply impressed with the
evidence everywbere to be seen of universal
affection and esteern for the man. I doubt
whetber in many years I have ever seen more
abundant evidence of this kind; certainly I
neyer did in the case of one who was known
only as a modest business man and good
fellow and in virtually no other way.
The leader of the House bas dwelt upon
the late Senator O'Connor's success in business.'

It was indeed a very marked success, and
resulted in very great wealtb. Reflecting on
that incident, I bave thougbt bow untrue is
the all too prevalent belief that such wealtb
is drawn from the slender resources of others;
that what attached to him was subtracted
His wealth accrued
from someone else.
because he was able to give effect to a sound
idea; to provide for humanity's wants in a
more economical and better way than the
average, or, indeed, any of bis competitors.
A great population benefited from bis
capacity. They did flot lose.
It is a happy reflection that he regarded
bis wealth witb that sense of trusteeship with
wbich wealtb should always be regarded, and
that bis later life at any rate, and I doubt
not bis entire business life, was marked by
continuous

and

extraordinary

benefactions.

One tbinks at a time like this there is, perhaps, nothing better for which a man could
live than the goodwill of bis fellows. One
thinks, toc. of the moment at wbicb Provi-

dence was pleased to take Senator O'Connor
away. To a man like bim, wbo in bis heart
could net conceive of the necessity of making
an enemny of anybody, the approaching noise
and conflict of a battling world, a world he
would not have liked, would probably bring
the conclusion that bis release was a bappy
one. The distress be would have suffered at
this bour would have been beyond bis strengtb,
even were he strong.
I join with the leader of the Governrnent
in tendering our sympatby to the late senator's
son and daugbter, wbo, I know, revere bis
memory witb deep affection.

te thrcc o'rlork I iîad a talk xvith the honour-

SEPTEMBER 8,1939
able leader of the Government (Hon Mr.
Dandurand) anent the general procedure of
the Senate at this most extraordinary hour.
Ordinarily an hanaurable member would now
move that an Address of thanks be presented
to His Excellency for the Speech from the
Throne, this motion would be seconded by
another honouraýble member, and then there
would be a debate, which, in accordance with
historical custam, would revolve around Goverament policy as revealed in that Speech. We
ail know that the Speech ta, which we listened
yesterday does littia more than eall attention
to the terrific exigencies of the present time.
The speéific course which the Government
intend to pursue and the practical measures
which they have to offer to Parliament at
this session are not as yet known, 'but are
expected to ha announced in the other Chamber by the Prime Minister this afternoon. I
feel that in the present circumstances we cannot
advantageously begin a debate upon the
Speech from the Throne until we know what
definite measures the Government -have in
mind. It would be easy enough ta dwell upon

the past in the ordinary way, to seek ta
assess
there;
as this
debate

responsibility here and affer laudation
but ta do so would be valueless Sa far
crisis is concerned, and for that kind of
I have no spirit whatever.

My suggestion-I have already made it to
the honourable leader of the House-is that
either now or after the mover and the
seconder of the Address have spoken, whenever
these honourable members may prefer, the
Order of the Day be postponed until tomorrow, when we ahl shall have had an oppartunity of reading and studying what the Prime

Minister says to-day. The honourable leader
of the Hanse knows, perhaps as well as the
Prime Minister, the course which the Government intend ta take, but 1 should not think
that my hanaurable friend would desire merely

ta duplicata here what is ta be said in the
other House. and certainly he would flot give

the detail which will likely be disclosed there.
However. it is for him ta decide what course

he wishes ta take in this respect.
If we meet to-morraw afternaon at three
a'clack we shauld be able ta camplete our
wark 'befare six, or at ail events in the evening,

and then we may meet again on Manday or
Tuesday, or any other date which the leader

of the House may choose.
I am most

anxiaus,

particularly

at this

session, which wve hope will be short and which
should 'be short, that we be present at our
posts of duty from the beginning ta the end,
that we show we are here ta be of use ta the

country, and that we consider aur own convenience not at ahl.
I trust what I have said will appeal ta the
honourable leader of the House.

Hon. Mr. DANDITRAND: Yesterday' at the

request of my right honourable friend (Right
Hon Mr. Meighen), I maved adjournment of

the Senate until ta-day with the idýea that we
would proceed with the debate on the Address
this afternaan. He has since advised me that
he daes flot feel disposed ta express his views

on the situatian until he has heard the policy
af the Government from the lips of the Prime

Minister. I am, in my humble way, prepared
ta state that palicy ta the Senate, but I yield
ta the wish af my right hanourable friend. I
suggest that the Order be postpaned until the
next sitting of the House.
The Order was pastponed.
The Senate adjourned until to-marrow at

3 p.m.

THE OUTBREAK 0F WAR
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTR

On the Orders of the Day:
Han. RAOUL DANDURAND:

Honourable

senatars, I have received a statement which
the Prime Minister intends ta read ta the
ather Hanse, and is probably reading there now.
It is as follows:
I should like ta makze clear ta the House
the procedure which tha Governmant have in
mind as ta giving affect ta the decisian af
Parliament regarding Canadian participatian in
the war.
The adoption af the Address in reply ta the
Speech fram the Thrana %villha considered as
approving flot only the Speech f rom the Throne,
but appraving the Government's policy, which
1 set ont yesterday, af immediate participation
in the war.
If the Address in reply ta the Speech from
the Throne is approved, the Government will
therefore immediately take steps for the issue
af a formai proclamation declariog the existence
af a stata af war between Canada and the
German Reich.

SEPTEMBER 9, 1939
Ail thinking Canadians understand that our
titie, or rather our status, as an autonomous
nation in the British commonwealth implies
not only rights, but duties as well. Our
Canadians are too manly, ton proud, to misunderstand their duties to themselves and to
others.
There is no question here of imperialism
nor of excessive nationalismn. Let us keep
away fromn the eccentric and extrcmist groups,
one of which would say, "Not one cent, not
one manl" while the other demands, "To
the last cent, to the last manl" The real
Canadian attitude is between those two
extremes; we must keep to a happy medium.
To my mind, the truc desire of Canadians,
enlightened by a clear perception of their
moral and material intercsts, is to support the
cause of England -and the democratic nations
which -refuse .to become the prcy and slaves of
a grasping dictator.
The hour is grave. this humnane and
Christian cause is great: we seek justice in
peace, freedom in security, and it should be
enough to bring us ail into accord. Bei ore
establishing this accord must we wait until
a devastating, victorious power is at our very
doors. rcady to threaten our homes, bomb
our harbours and our cities, ravage our land?
Our co-operation might take several forms.
Compulsory military service is justifiable oniy
for the purpose of defending the soul of our
own country. But we cannot prevent Canadians from going voluntarily to Europe to
fight for a cause dear to us. That should bie
the limit of our military contribution outside
Canada.
There are many other ways in which we
may belp and cfficiently support the cause
of England and bier Allies. above ail and
especially in the economic field.
Wheat, foodstuifs, stores of ail kinds, ammunition and raw materials which we can
supply arc more essential to Great Britain
than our volunteers.
Sucb, no doubt, is the co-operation mentioncd in the Speech fromn the Throne after
the announcement that the Government are
determined first of ail to organize the defence
of Canada.
0f this Speech fromn the Tbrone, I would
repeat what 1 said of the one whicb opened
the previons session:
To apprchend its foul force and consequences,
it is niecessary to rea(l the Speech from the
national viewpoint, withi a national pride, and
the tw~o togetlier dictate our national duties.
And so Canada.
means to remain
possession of its
its responsibilities

to-day as well as yesterday,
a British country, in fuîll
own liberties, conscious of
as a Canadian nation.

It is our duty to defcnd right here, wbile
co-opcrating with nations which defcnd them
in other places, the precious liberties our
ancestors won at the price of the greajtest
sacrifices, yea, of life itself.
Honourable senators, allow me to conclude
these few remarks by quoting Generai Weygand. Speaking at a dinner tendered to Col.
G. P. Vanier, our Canadian, Minister in
Paris, by the France-Amérique Committee,
that great French soldier said:
Once more, the frecdom of the world is
tlîreatcned. It can be saved only through the
union and determination of the nations whicb,
knowing what this frecdom costs and that they
would be untrue to thermselves if they did not
resist the ambitions threatening them, are ready
to do everything to defend the very dignity of
humanity.
Righit Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, oppressed as I feel, and as
indeed everyone must feel, with emotions
whicb grow out of the gravity of this time,
I would very gladly follow the example of the
mover ot this motion (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
and of the seconder (Hon. Mr. Prévost) as
well, and speak with the utmost brevity,
allowing action more quickly to follow our
words, but I do believe I may contribute
sometbing to clarify-I do net, dare to
say inspire-public tbougbt, public feeling,
and to promote the unity of our people. Let
me postulate a sentence or two before I enter
upon what 1 chiefly have to say.
No one who knows me would for a moment
think that any motive can animate me except
assistance to my country at this time. In
whatevcr 1 say as to the Governmcnt and its
head 1 ain going to keep in mind that this
Governmcnt is the Govcrnment of Canada and
represents us all, and that the Prime Minister
is no longer to be regarded as t.he hcad of a
political party. H1e is the hcad of our Dominion. In him must reside the honour, the
dignity, the sense of duty of our whole nation.
It is hie who must interpret 00w our intercst
and our duty and show us that they arc one.
It must flot be prcsumcd, because I do not
make issue of certain matters n0W, ýthat I am
not thinking something else might be doue
which is not bcing donc. There arc matters
on which I might act differcntly-on which 1
know I would-but 1 realize that a united front
at -the present time, and indced throughout, if it
can be sccurcd, may on balance be of more importance than even the prevailing of a better
course. Therefore I defer controversy to the
utmost and scek that my words shall bave the
effect only of encouraizement, of assistance,
and of rallying to our cause the devotion of
our people.

SENATE

There lias bcen confusion in the public mind
and in tise mind of many of us up to this
time as to just what this Governmcnt purposes, some confusion and wonderment as to
whether we really have be,ýn at xvar or flot.
On the latter phase the statemient of the
honourable leader of the bouse (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand), and the corresponding statement
of the leader of the Government in the
other Chamber, have set ail our minds
at rest. It lias been the commitmnent of the
present Administration, as 1 have always understood it, that Parliarnent would decide what
sbould be our participation in any war.
Apparently this bas now bren intcrpreted in
soiinewhat extended formn as meaning that
Parliament lias to decide whether we are at
war or net. Well, it is over now. I do not
think any gond lias corne fromn this special
way of putting to the country the status of
Parliaint nt. Parliament always decides enything within the competence of Canada to
decide. No other body and no one else can
do so. 1 bav e neyer felt that it bas been
witbin the competence of Canada te decide
whether we are at war or net. 1 do net feel
se now. Either we are part of the British
Empire or we are net; and we know we are a
part. We cannot be at peace while the head
of this Empire is at war. The prenounicement
of Laurier stands, and will ever stand. We
ceuld, without iihysical restraint. refuse te be
at war, by nving outsidr' the cireimfrne
cf this Empire ; I say svithout physical external
restraint, for Great Britain would bring noc
te bear. But Canada as a member of the
Britislh Commonwealth cannet so refuse.
We nmay, of course, decide what shall be
the mieasure of our participation. We always
hav e decided it, and always on the recemmendation ef eui- Government, exactly ais we are
doicg te-day. The enly diff erence bias been tbis,
that thl, confusion, which lias alr-cadv ilene seme

if vo will, te confirmaation bv Parliament
wheîa it weuld meet tlien, before the final die
was cast by the arbiter cf Germany, ocr

helding back bis hand from that awful throw.
I did what I could to have this Government
take such a course several days before Poland
svas invaded. My efforts failed.
I cloae the subjeet by saying this. I tbink
it is unfortunate that Canada stands in the
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

poition of baving contributed te the prevention of this catastrophe precisely notbing.
We now bave been at war for seme time.
We are te make a declaration on the passing

on our Table two days age proclaimed distinctly, in many places, a state of war. I bave

SEPTEMBER 9, 1939
about the Treaty, is there among reasonabie
people who believe in right, who bellhve in justice between man and man, flot just in proportion to the individual strength of each, who
believe in those rights of man, who value those
achievements of civilization, which atone make
life worth whiie for us, is there a single being
who can be blind to the issue which faces us
n-ow? Germany, or rather the man who stands
in sole command of that country, says, "We
must, have romr ta live," and in order ta have
room ta live he invades Poland, where the
density of population is double that in Germany itself. He gave his word, on the honour
of his country, first to Austria, then to Czechasiovakia, then ta Poland, then ta Britain, and
at a moment opportune for himself he threw
every covenant away and declared for the ruýle
of btood and iran.
If the principles of Hitler are tu prevailand they wili prevail unless the Allies winthen the world as we have known it wiil have
passed away. It wiII mean not just another
dynasty in Europe; it witl mean another form
of the whoie constitution of humanity. It wili
mean that there is nothing left ta us worth
living for.
I came ta the duty of Canada, and ta the
means by which that duty is ta be discharged, as revealed by the Government.
There are some things contained in the Speech
frosu the Thrane and in what lias been said
by the Prime Minister, particularly in bis
remarks of Sunday, the first of September,
for which 1 am grateful. The Prime Minister said, "There is no home in Canada, no
famiiy and fia individual whose fortunes and
whase freedomn are flot bound up in the
present struggle." Those words are fiat a
platitude; they are true, as true as ever feli
from human lips. Learn those words. Then
your awn minds wiil tell you -the duty that
fiows therefrom, what rational beings must do
s0 that that struggle may eventuate in the
only way which. will mean lîfe ta the people
of aur country.
The Prime Minister also said that we take
aur stand "for effective co-operation by
Britain's side." I am gratefut for those words.
That decision flows from the first promise.
Let us remember that decision, and lot us
stand as one people ta make certain that
those words are translated into deeds, and
translated with fia avaidable delay, and that
fia guilt faits upan Canada in respect of aur
part in this struggle.
There is one misapprehension-I wiit cail
it that-with which I shouid like ta accupy
the minds of honourable members for a
moment. Many a time and oft we have hoard
the assertion that aur duty is ta defend aur
own land. While it is true that this is aur

primary duty, I rather regret the prominence
that assertion had in the speech delivered elsewhere yesterday, and I refer ta, it now oniy ta
make certain that it is not misunderstood.
That our first duty is ta do ait we eau ta render
our own people and country secure froma attack
on aur two shores, from attack by air
and from internai disturbance, there is fia
question. What I want ta cati attention ta, as
I have d-one mrany a time before, is this, that
when we shaîl have takon steps ta, protect
ourselves in that way we shaîl nat have provided for the security of Canada. We shahl
have carried ouf only certain local duties
which, if we were fiat here ta perform them,
wouid have had ta be perfarmed by an
expedition ta aur shores from. the strength af
Britain. But security in that sense is merely
local and femporary. I am sarry we cannot
futly provide even sucli security for aurselves.
We are not equipped ta do so. That we must
endeavour ta do so ta aur ufmost, I quite
agree with the most ardent advocate af Canadian dofence. But, I ask honourable muerabers, what becames af thaf form af protection if on the main issue the arms af the
Allies fait? Wiii Canada then ho securo?
The few provisions we have airoady made for
aur own defence, and any that we may huild
up with aur own strength, wiii they mean
aur security? No. We shaîl have no security
at ait unioss the main issue is won. We can
help ta deferýd aur own country while the
main struggle lasts, and, if that struggle ends
as we att pray if wili, aur dofence wilt be
sure. But if the struggie «shauld end the
othor way, the socurity of Canada will have
gono.
,I read with pleasuro an address detivered
by the Minister of Justice in the other flouse
on the 3lst of Mardi last. I couid see ho
appreciated the actual state of aur dofence
and the impossibiiity of providing anything in
the way of ultimate protection by the energies
of Canadians alono. Hie said we must look
olsewhere for that, as we have ever looked.
Against attack, he said, we can but do aur best
tilt help cames. And, he asked, if we depend
on others ta hoip us, how can we refuse ta thase
others, when in need, the heip of Canada?
We cannat. If there is a mmnd which can
deny the eternity of ti&t truth, I cannot understand fiat mind. Are we dofending aurselves naw? Woli, we try, but we are fiat
equipped. The presont is nlot the timo ta
criticîze aur incapacity. But while we sit in
this flouse this aftornoon warships of Britain
line the shores of this Daminion. The security
of aur coasf cities to-day rests uivlpr the wing
of the Brifish Navy.

is simple in comparison with what would face
us if this issue between the forces of Germany -and thoso of Britain and France shou]d
flot corne out aright.
Let us not loti ourselves into false reasoning by the tbeory that duty in this crisis arises
out of sentiment alone. Why, duty to-day
arises out of our wilI to live. If we have the
will to live and to preserve the reasons why
we want to live, then we mnust build evorything behind those great powers that have led
the world along the path of light. If the
dark day cornes-I mean the day of final
darkness-then everything we have preacbed
against and everything we have debated wvill
be forgotton, and the state of our minds and
the anguisb of our souls will bo a thousand
times worsc than what surrounds and possesses
us now. If we do nlot win this war on tbe
banks of the Rhine we shall have tu fight it
on the banks of the St. Lawrence,' in the
We may as
Indie. and on the Mississippi.
well takie advantage of the light and realize
wbat that ligbt reveals. M'e rnay then get
the meaning of this thing into tbe minds of
ail our people. of ail wbo are willing to see.
I say no more. But as we square ourselves
for the task ahead. as wo stand erect now
and commence the long journey through
troubles, through trials, tbrough tragedies,
through blond, let us not forget that others of
our lincage for the saine great purposes have
trod this path before. Let us remember every
hour tbe two great nations frorn which we
spring, the two great nations that to-day stand
at the side of Poland, the two great nations
tbat have set out together to preserve the
treasures of civilization in the only way tbey
can be preserved. to save tbe altars of
liberty, the altars of religion from destruction
by pagan force. To the heritage we derive
from those beroic peoples let us ail be true.
HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able senaitcrs, I desire tol thank t.he moveýr
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) and the seconder (Hon.
Mr. Prévoist) for the speeches they have
delivercd. The mover bas sbortened bis remarks by declaring that hoe stood by the
policy of tbe Government as expressed by the
Prime Minister in the other House; and my
bonourable friend froin Mille îles (Hon. Mr.
Prévost) bas given a fair view, as he sees
it, of tbe situation to-day in Europe and in
Canada.
I thank my right honourable friend (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) for bis statemnent that
hoe will regard the Prime Minister and the
Government of the day as representing not
fine party. but the whole country. It is
witb that sentiment that I sit arnong tbem.
I do not believe for a moment that there is
8713"13

to-day any party division in tbe country.
We stand as a people shoulder to shoulder
facing a formidable crisis.
I had prepared a statement for the Sonate,
to show ýwbat the Government intended to do.
I also had some idea of examining the situation in Europe as we sec it. I may say that
I have beýen directly in contact witb Europe
since 1924, and for many years have been
interested in international affairs. The situation
in Europe to-day. as my right honourable
friend bias said, is such that the fortunes of
Euirope are virtually ail in the hands of one
man, Herr Hitler, wbo stands at tbe head of
a powerful nation in Central Europe, and
claims to ho a suprerne power, a law unto
hirnself. As for the law of nations, hoe declares
hoe bias no use for it . After the purgt of a

or may ho sent to a concentration camp. We
dIo flot know how many bundrods and tbousands of mon have been sent to concentration
camps. I know of leaders of public opinion
who have been imprisoned in sucb camps since
iler took power in 1933.
Ilere, in part, is what the New York Times
said of Iiim on Sunday, September 3 last:
Since lie came to the leadership in Germauy
-to go no fartiier backz-Adolf Hitler bias
hujît up a record of mendacity and duplicity
Wuich madle it ail but impossible for the statesmon of other countries to know how it was
possible to negotiate wvitb him. Regarding tbe
specific issue of Poland, for example, Hitler
lias repeatedly cleclared sioce 1933 that the issue
was in effeet settled. In Nurenîburg less than
aýyear ago (Sept. 12, 1938) lie deelared: "Wben
ini Poland a great statesman and patriot was
ready to conclude a pact witb us, we immediately accepted the treaty recognizing our respective frontiers as inviolable. This treaty lias
dlone more for peace than ail the chattering
ici Geneva put togetlier."
This is bis statement, made in September of
last year. How can any nation ever accept
bais word or trust bim? How can it accept bais
signature or bis verbal promises? Eightyfive millions of people in the centre of Europe
follow bim blindly, because hie alone can speak
to thern. Tb.ey dare not even listen to tbe
radio for news from abroad. We in Canada,
I think, bave no ill-will towards the German
people. Tbey hear but one voice, that of their
leader, and they follow hirn because tbey must.
Tbey are living in terrer and dare not contradiet him. AIl tbe nations around Germany
are afraid of him. Wbat can the rest of the
world do to caîl a haIt? That is what Great
Britain and France are attempting to do.

SENATE
The Government, assuming that it expresses
the will of the nation, is now asking Parliament to endorse its position, and as a member
of the British Commonwealth to stand by
Great Britain. In many vital respects the
conditions of the present struggle differ very
greatly from those of the last war. We must
frame our policy in the light of our knowledge
of the present situation. To that end, the
Canadian Government is in close consultation
with the Government of the United Kingdom.
Our first concern, naturally, is the defence

and security of Canada.
already been taken for our safety by the
calling out of the Active .Militia, the Naval
Service and the Air Forces. We must provide
for internal security, and guard against
sabotake and hostile propaganda. My right
honourable friend has said that this is not ail
that is necessary; that the trouble, the danger
and the solution lie elsewhere. I recognize
that, but I say we must face the situation as
we find it, and must meet it with ail the
means at our disposal. Economic defence
measures have to be taken. The outbreak of
war involves a tremendous upheaval in both
international and internal trade. Necessary
financial support for military measures must
be attended to, and the credit and financial
relations of Canada maintained. Profiteering
must be rigidly controlled. Close co-operation with the provinces, and with representatives of industry, agriculture, labour and
commerce, will be established. Some of the
measures immediately necessary to that end
have already been enacted.
The safety of Canada depends upon the
adequate safeguarding of our coastal regions.
At the entrance to the St. Lawrence stands
the neighbouring British territory of Newfoundland, the integrity of which is essential
to the security of Canada. By assisting with
the defence of Newfoundland and other
nearby British and French territories, we shall
be not only defending Canada but also
enabling Great Britain and France to concentrate their forces more closely in that part of
the world where their own immediate security
is at stake.
Would the
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
honourable leader tell the House how we are
going to do that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With ail the
means at our disposal.
The British Government, in reply to our
inquiry, has indicated that this would be an
effective and desirable means of co-operation.
We propose also to co-operate in economic
pressure, which is so essential to meet the
Measures designed to

prevent trading with the enemy and for the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

control of vital exports, as well as appropriate
measures with regard to alien enemies,
merchant ships and property, will be adopted.
The furnishing of supplies of ail kinds,
munitions, manufactures, raw materials and
food stuffs, is of vital importance to the
British and Allied powers. There is urgent
necessity for a constant supply of munitions,
and it is apparent that Canada, because of
her industrial equipment and relative accessibility to the European theatres of war, is able
to meet these needs in great measure. This
is a subject on which there has been consultation with the United Kingdom. The British
Aircraft Mission, which was sent to this
country in 1938, received effective co-operation from a group of Canadian aireraft manufacturers in placing initial orders. With the
concurrence of the Governments of Canada
and the United Kingdom, a delegation organized by the Canadian Manufacturers' Association recently visited the United Kingdom to
study aIl forms of armament and munitions
production, with a view to the speedy adaptation of Canadian industry to meet the requirements in this field. Representatives of the
delegation recently presented to the Government a report of their mission and its conclusions. I may say that the inquiry was carried
out in a most thorough way, and will be of
decided help to the Governments of both
Canada and Great Britain. This is a good
example of the capacity and readiness of
leaders in Canadian business to co-operate.
A special mission is now on its way from the
United Kingdom to Canada.
It has been
authorized to make a further survey of the
situation, and to place certain orders in this
country along the lines explored in consultation with the Canadian mission.
Canada, of ail non-European countries, is
the nearest and surest source of these indispensable materials and supplies. It may be
said with assurance that a determined national
effort to bring our industry and agriculture
to the point of highest efficiency, and to maintain them at that high level, will be of the
utmost importance to the common cause.
As regards other theatres of war, essential
information must be available before any
intelligent and definitive decision can be made
as to Canadian action. I may say in this connection that the Canadian Government lias
been, and is, in daily contact with the British
Government, and knows what the exact situation is, and what Canada can do at the
moment to help Great Britain and France. The
question of an expeditionary force, or of units
for service overseas, is particularly one of farreaching significance, and will require the
fullest examination. Sir Henry Gullet, Aus-

SEPTEMBER 9,1939
tralian Minister for External Affairs, told the
Australian House of Representatives on
Wednesday that his Government had not
seriously considered the dispatching of an
expeditionary force overseas. He declared that
when Australia had discharged its first duty to
the Empire, namely, to ensure its own safety,
and when it was better able to assess the
strength of its enemies and the nature of the
conflict, it would evolve proposais for its
further participation in the war. That statement indicates that the Australian Government
is making the same approach to this problem
as the Government of Canada.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Would my honourable friend permit me to direct his attention
to the fact that the strategical situation of
Australia is wholly different from that of Canada, and that any hesitation which may exist
on the part of Australia in sending troops
abroad is due to the threat and the proximity
of another hostile power, namely, Japan. It
is unfortunate, I think, that the honourable
gentleman himself, and his leader in another
place. should have made a comparison between
Canada and Australia in the matter of an
expeditionary force.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps my
honourable friend would wait till I resume my
seat, because I want to inform him of a fact
about which he knows nothing, namely,
Canada's consultation with Australia and the
United Kingdom on this very matter. My
honourable friend may be alluding to a
hypothesis and not to the facts as they are.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That raises another
question. Is it the intention of the Government, before Parliament rises, to put us in
possession of information of that sort in order
that there may be an intelligent discussion
before we leave?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would say,
without turning to my colleagues for authority,
that the answer would be in the negative,
because, in the interest of safety, all these
matters that pass between the British Government and the Governments of Australia and
Canada must remain absolutely confidential.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What then
becomes of the doctrine that Parliament must
decide?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The answer is
very easy. The situation in time of war is
very different from that which prevails in time
of peace. My right honourable friend knows
very well that he and his leader in the other
House, as Privy Councillors, may be informed
of all that goes on between the governments,

but that it is improper, improvident and most
dangerous to impart such information to
Parliament.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What about
the doctrine?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The information in our possession indicates the desirability
and feasibility-I emphasize these words-of
certain measures of naval and air co-operation.
It is evident that the immediate and most
effective measures of co-operation would be
rapid expansion of air training and of air and
naval facilities, and the dispatching of air
personnel. These measures we intend to institute immediately. The veil may be lifted to
some extent. One does not need great
imagination to understand what the instituting
of these measures will mean with respect to
the relations between the United Kingdom and
Canada.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Will the honourable gentleman permit me? He is raising the
veil. Will he raise it far enough to inform
us whether this Air Force personnel who are
to be trained and sent to Great Britain
in the near future will go as Canadian airmen,
under Canadian control, or as recruits to the
British Air Force, having no connection with
this country?
Hon. Mr. PARENT: Time will tell.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not in a
position to state what the exact position of
the Air Force personnel will be when the
men reach the other side. I may, though I
am not sure about this, be able to inform my
honourable friend before the session ends.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: In any event, the
British Government has not objected to the
training of Canadian airmen in England, as
we objected last year to the reverse proposal.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As to the international crisis in Europe and Great Britain's
conduct of foreign affairs, with important and
perhaps dire results for ourselves, I would
suggest to my honourable friend that we take
the situation as it is, that we address ourselves
to projects for meeting the problems of today and to-morrow, and leave the past alone.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The honourable
gentleman is turning over a new leaf, I
understand.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not turning over a new leaf; I am trying to look at
the situation as it is.
My right honourable friend (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) has said, in effect, that we
and all members of the nation should dedicate
ourselves to the task before us. But in doing

groups be willing to abandon the privileged
condition enjoyed in this country by al
religions and ail races, a condition which bas
resulted in the meting out of liberty and
justice to evcry citizen in the land? I doubt
whether any considerable numbers of our
population would manifest a desire to do so.
But if they did, wbat would it mean? Everybody knows the ultimate resuit would be our
exposure to a war, not three thousand miles
away, but at oui' very door-step. It would
mean civil war.
If we are at war, it is not Great Britain
and France who are responsible. Everybody
knows that.
Hon. Mr. LAC ASSE: Even Hitler.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Great Britain and
France have donc evcrytbing in their power,
short of submitting to slavery and dishonour,
to maintain peace.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hcar, hear.

lion. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Everybody knows
that. Thcv have receded from position to
position, sornetimes to the despair of their
friends. For what? To prevent the awful
catastrophe into wbicb the world is thrown
to-day.
If we wisb to go hack, as some persons
desire. and scek in its inception the responsibility for wbat bas taken place, is it flot truc
that Canada niust assume its share? Let us
not forget tbat imimediately after tbe Covenant of the Leag-ue of Nations was signed
Canada was the first nation to tbrow up ber
obligation under section 10 of tbe Covenant
and to withhold participation in collective
security. WTc may be tbe bumbler and the
better for nlot forgetting tbat. ht is true also
that in 1925, wbien the protocol was agreed
uipon bctwccn Herriot and MacDonald, Sir
Austen Chamberlain stated tbat he could not
agree to the protocol, wbich also guaranteed
collective sccurity, because tbe Dominions were
opposed to it.
I arn attacking no party; I arn simply reminding the House that when some persons
inconsiderately go back over a number of
years in an effort to attacb responsibility for
what is now taking place, tbey should not
forget that the first thing Canadians have
to do is to strike their breasts and say "Mea
culpa" with the other nations then members
of the League. Undoubtedly we bave our
responsibility for what bas occurred. But
whatever wc did in the past is irrevocable.
We cannot retrieve or change it; it is done.

But wbat have we to do at present? In my
opinion our duty is simple. We have to upbold
the Goveroment as faitbfully and as strongly
as possible in its guidance of tbe country
tbrougb this war.
Hon. Mr. DUFF:

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Let not tbose who

that in this war everybody's contribution is

quarters it is suggested that there is no sinccrity in tbis proclamation of freedom of
action. Well, the Government, bas pledged
itself to that freedom, and so bas the Opposition. I need scarcely add that we shahl always
remember the speech dclivered at Winnipeg
in 1927 by mny riglit honourable friend to
the lef t (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), in which
be plcdged bimsclf to that freedom of action,
at ail events uintil the people of Canada
should pronounce otberwise. I repeat, we are
free to choose our course. But tbat freedom
does not mean our duty is to do nothing.
Enrolment is going on rapidly tbrougbout the
country. If our young men are willing to
bazard their ]ives for what, after ail, is the
cause of Canada as wchl as tbe cause of Great
Britain and of France, they sbould know that
the wbole country will not hesitate to give
tbem aIl the support it can.
Wlicn I was iii France a fcev weeks ago
I hicard it stated by persons in autbority, and
particularly by a gentleman holding a very
Iiglî positioni in the army. a mienîber of
the Conseil Supérieur dle la Guerre. that the
policy of (3ermany bad neyer w-avered since
the time of Bismarck, wlicn the iron Chancellor propoaccl to Presiclent Grévy of Fiance

an armny of 1,000,000 men to conquer Great

SEPTEMBER 9, 1939
That terrible malediction which those people
called down upon themselves and their

posterity was registered in Heaven, has come
down the corridors of the centuries, and has
been literally fulfilled. Those people, since
then, have been wanderers on the face of the
earth, without a country and without a home.
They have been despised and persecuted in all
lands, and the end is not yet, because, as a
nation and as a race, they have never asked
that the self-imposed curse be lifted. If there
is not a lesson here for all the rest of mankind
that calls itself Christian, particularly for the
distinguished professors and the eminent
divines, I know not where it could be found.
During the nineteenth and part of the
eighteenth century, when the higher critics in
Germany were tearing the Bible into shreds,
rich families everywhere sent their sons, even
those intended for the ministry, to Germany,
to finish their education. Many of these
students came back to their respective countries with minds de-christianized, and the
western world is now reaping the harvest of
the seed thus sown. Some of these men tell
us that Jesus Chist was a. great and good
man, perhaps the greatest that ever lived.
But this is a most insidious doctrine, and is

meant to catch the unwary. If Christ was not

God-what He declared Himself to be-He

was nat even a truthful man; He was a proud,
boastful man, and was not, therefore, a good
man.

The fact is that when the deity of

Christ goes, then go the Bible, the Church and
all the civilization that Christianity has proyears. The
hundred
duced in nineteen
Christian virtues can have no permanency in
fact when the authority of Him who inculcated
them and gave them substance is denied.
Therefore the struggle now on is actual warfare
between Christ and Antichrist.
When I heard that the negotiations with
Russia had fallen through I rejoiced with
exceeding great joy. How we could ever hope
to achieve success by allying ourselves with
Antichrist passes all Christian comprehension.
It is unfortunately true there are influential
parties in Great Britain who worked for such
an alliance, and that this beclouds the issue
and makes the end more uncertain than it
would otherwise be. However, I see the hand
of God in the break-down of these negotiations.
His arm is as potent now as it was when He
led the Israelites unharmed through the Red
Sea; and Jesus Christ has never failed those

who trusted in Him.
Many millions of genuine Christians in
Poland and in Germany may have to shed
their blood in defence of the faith that is
dearer to them than life itself. If so, that
blood will be not only their own salvation,

il

but, in the end, the salvation of their countries as well.
As for Canada, it seems to me that Our duty
is clear. So far as my powe.r to speak goes, I
address myself to Great Bri-tain in the words
that Ruth spoke unto Naomi: "For withersoever thou goest, there also shàll I go. Thy
people shall be my people, and thy God my
God, and in the land that receives thee dying,
there also shall I die."
The Address was adopted.
The Senate adjourned until Monday, September 11, at 8 p.m.

Sections 1 and 2 pro vide:
1. This Act may be cited as The War
Appropriation Aet, 1939.
2. (1) From and out of the Consolidated
Revenue Fund there may be paid and applied
beyond the ordinary grants of Parliament a
sum not exceeding one liundred million dollars
towards defraying any expenses that may be
incurred by or under the authority of the
Governor in Council during the year ending the
thirty-first day of March, 1940, for(a) the security, defence, peace, order and
welfare of Canada;
(b) the conduct of naval, military and air
operations in or beyond Canada;
(c) promoting the continuance of trade, industry and business communications, whether
by means of insurance or indemnity against
war risk or in any other manner whatsoever;
and
(dl Vhe carrying out of any measure deemed
necessary or advisable by the Governor in
Couincil in consequence of the existence of a
state of war.
(2) The six special -warrants, issued on or
since the twenty-flfth day of August, 1939, under
Vhe authority of section twenty-five of The
Consolidated Revenue ani Audit Act, 1931, Vo
the total amount of sixteen million, four hiundred and fifty-four thousand, one bundred and
twenty dollars, shaîl form part of the amount
hereby appropriated.
1 will give some detail concerning this projectedl expenditure. The cost of a wvar effort
by Canada does noV lend itself Vo precise calculations in advance. Fortunately we lack

contracts have been entered into since April 1,
and deliveries are being made. But, broadly
speaking, the majority of the contracts are
sVill in process of being performed, with the
result that approximately 50 millions of the
regular appropriations remain undisbursed,
and that expenditures for armaments in the
next few months will be, in the main, for
those for which provision is already made.
IV is not desirable, -and the reason is obvions,
that I be too specifie in particularizing the
nature of Vhe steps which Vhe general staffs
of the three defence services recommend
should be taken. I trust, therefore., that the
Senate will bear with me if my explanation
takes the forma of broad generalizations.
87136-4j

1r

First, as to the Naval Service: The existence
of a state of war as it is now prosecuted
on the high seas demands that ail reasonable
precautions be taken to safeguard aur ports
The Minister of National
and gea lanes.
Defence is9 of the opinion that this can be
achieved by the acquisition of certain classes
of craft, by the equipping of other craf t with
necessary apparatus and by the provision of
varlous forms of protective works on each
seaboard. There wilI also be expansions in the
Service to permit the navy to perform the
duties expected of it during a time such as the
present.
Next, as Vo the Militia Service: The permanent force and the non-permanenit unrits
of the Militia have been placed on active
service status, and the establishments of the
units are being filled out by recruiting
activities. Therefore, with respet Vo the
Militia, the major costs in the next few
months will be for pay and allowances and
for clothing, shelter, subsistence and training
furnished Vo the men on active service status.
A problem to be faced is that of housing the
memnbers of the forces, because the winter
season is noV far distant. Again, in a country
as large as Canada, the question of transport
is neither a simple nor an inexpensive one Vo
solve. Lt is feit that we should provide so
that the activity of the Canadian Militia at
the moment could take the form. of mobilizing at least 40,000 for general purposes, plus a
further number for coast defence and special
purposes. The acquisition of large quantities
of materials is also necessary, but immediate
disbursements will be mainly on account of
men in training.
Now, as Vo the Air Force: The Air Force's
needs pivot on the acquisition of stores and
equipment, mainly aircraft. It is idie Vo discuss what may be needed. Aircraft cannot be
acquired at once simply by the placing of an
order, as automobiles can. An expenditure
of about 40 millions would bring the Air Force
Vo full peace-Vime establishment, both in equipment and personnel, but it is noV expected
such an amount will be disbursed in the next
few months.
In addition Vo expenditure on equipment, an
immediate expenditure on the training and
dispatching of pilots and airmen overseas will

place, a substantial number of pilots and airmen are already trained or completing their
training, and there will be no delay in proceeding with this effective form of co-operation
with Great Britain. IV is essential that there
be ample funds to meet any emergency which
may arise in the needs of this Service.
The next department which bas material
addition Vo its costs is the Royal Canadian

expanded, 500 former members haviog been
called to report for dîîty and a total of 2,500
special constables engaged. The pay and
allowances for these aod the cost of moving
members to where they xviii be requirod are
the major new items of expenditure to be
incurred by the force. In ai, if the precautienary recommendations are fully impIemented. about tbree millions may be involved.
The Departments of Public Works aod of
Transport expect now activities will have to be
undertaken by them. In tbc Department of
Public WSorks these wilI be in connection with
housiog for expandcd services, parbicularly
those of national defenco. The now costs of
the Department of Transport wiil be mainly
with respcct to additional facilibies for ocean
shipping, and landing fields for aircraft. Jo
neither case can the amounts be estimated with
exacbness, but neither wiil require large expendibures at any one peint. Perhaps three
millions may ho taken as an outside estimate.
Other departments will nced financial assistance for new or expanded services, but it is
hoped that. in the total, these new dishurseinents rnay ho kept ivithin one million dollars.
The various dcpartments of the Government visualize a possible nexv outlay of about
125 millions. It does nlot ueccssarily follow
that the Goverumient wili approve ail the proposals. In fairniess to aIl concerned it slîould
aiso ho said that the subiiiittcd esbimates are
not necessarily the mnost conservabive whiclh
might ho made, for-, as pointed ont before,
an exact forecast rcg-arding the months to come
is nlot possible. Further, while certain costs
will bave te ho paid within the period, many
contrart orders wvill romain uncompleted at the
end cf January, and thereforo unpaid. Likewise, as already pointed ont, deliveries of aircr'ifb arc net secured fortlîwibh sirnply by the
placing of orders.
For aIl these reasons, and in view of the
provision alrcady made by Parliament for
the public services, it is proposed by thiis Biil
te appropriateoune hundreri million dollars.
It is believoîl that tiis amount wiii permit
Canada te perforîn its duties until further
considdration is given by Parliament, te our
national effort,
I confidently hope that the Sonate will agree
te give second reading te this Bill new, and
perhiaps third reading as wcll, se that the
Governmeut xvili imcdiately have parliamenbary sanction fer necossary oxpeuditures.
Hon, C. C. BALLANTYNE:

it would ho quite impossible for the Government te furnish us with a more detailed

and Great Britain's allies; and whereas money
is now being raised for the said purpose, and it
is desirable to provide for the administration
of the same: Therefore His Majesty, by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate -and
House of Commons of Canada, enacts as
follows.
If honourable members will peruse the
present Bill they will sec that it is virtually
in the same form. Its preamble is as follows:
Whereas it is desirable to promote co-ordination and co-operation between existing organizations and to provide, if any need shall arise,
for the assistance of the vives, children and
dependents, resident in Canada, of officers and
men who during the present war may be on
active service with the naval, military or air
forces of His Majesty or of any allied or
associated power: and, whereas it is desirable
to provide an organization for such purpose:
Therefore His Majesty, by and with the advice
and consent of the Senate awd House cf Conmons of Can-ada, enacts as follows.
Section 2 contains the names of the incorporators-Canadians holding high positions
and representative of the whole Dominion.
They will be able to add to their number
from time to time. I should like to have seen
named among the incorporators those devoted
Canadians who gave so frecly of their time
in furthering the ends of the Act of 1914, and
who thereby acquired considerable experience
in administering the fund, but I am told that
the incorporators represent what I might term
"officialdom," and will select the men who are
to carry on the work throughout the country,
the head and executive being resident in
Ottawa.
I may say that I watched with admiration
the devoted service rendered by the Montreal
section of the Canadian Patriotic Fund. Conparisons are, of course, somewhat invidious,
but I cannot fail to mention Miss Helen R.
Y. Reid, who was, I might say, a pillar of
the organization in Montreal.
An Hon. SENATOR:

Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I was in contact also, but not officially, with Mr. E. L.
Brittain, Mr. Thomas H. Blair and Mr. W. F.
Nickle, who later became Attorney-General of
Ontario and who, I think, acted as secretary
of the fund. I could cite the names of many
other workers equally zealous and devoted.
I have mentioned only a few that occur to
me at the moment.

21

In 1914 the Canadian Patriotic Fund proceeded to raise money by voluntary contributions. Cities and towns vied with one another
in subscribing to the fund. I attended a number of meetings in the city of Montreal in
connection with campaigns which brought in
millions of dollars. There was similar activity
throughout the whole Dominion. In five years
public subscriptions were collected to the

amount of approximately $48,000,000. Included

in this sum was a contribution by the Government of Canada of $900,000.
Subsequently, at the request of the Government, the Canadian Patriotie Fund administered an appropriation made by Parliament,
known as the Federal Emergency Appropriation, and expended approximately $5,000,000
to provide generally for returned soldiers
who were unemployed.
The National Committee made arrangements whereby the funds were collected and
distributed through provincial or local conmittees set up in accordance with regulations
established by the Executive at Ottawa. This
was to ensure uniformity of distribution.
It is to be particularly noted that the administration of funds was under the direction of
the Executive Committee, who had full power
under the Act to make regulations regarding
the method of distribution, etc.
The organization to be set up now will
proceed to levy funds on a voluntary basis.
No one will be taxed under this Act. The
appeal will be made to the patriotic sentiment
of the people.
The exact needs of the Patriotie Fund are
not known at the moment, but representations made by a number of patriotie bodies
indicate that during this war the fund will
not be called upon to pay out as large amounts
as were disbursed during the last war. These
representations are based on the fact that the
pay and allowances of soldiers and their
dependents, as provided under the pay and
allowances regulations now in effect, are much
higher than those prevailing from 1914 to
1918. I have here, and shall place upon
Hansard, a table showing what soldiers and
their families will be entitled to under Orders
in Council recently passed.

i-oad in tue paper yestcrdav cf the enlistment

SEPTEMBER 12, 1939
of a man with a wife and nine children. The
pay of a private soldier is $1.30 a day, and a
calculation showed that this man would get in
pay and allowances $180 a month. This sum
would provide pay for five single soldiers. How
the enlistment of a man who has a wife and
nine children can be justified at this early stage
of the organization of the forces is beyond
my comprehension. This question, I understand, was raised in another place, but no
answer was given. I should like to suggest
to the leader of the House that he ascertain
The
whether this report is actually truc.
question of the enlistment of men with large
families is germane to the purpose of this
Bill. The honourable gentleman would perform a useful service if he would endeavour
ta have the Government confine enlistments
to single men. The man with nine children
should not come into the picture until we have
our backs to the wall and are fighting down
on the banks of the St. Lawrence, as it has
been suggested we may have ta do.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I know nothing
of that incident except from what has been
said in the House of Commons or bas appeared
in the Press. In my opinion the enlistment of
heads of large families would be unnecessary
for a long time ta come, and that it should
already be permitted passes my comprehension.
I will not express in more vehement terms my
surprise at the statement that has been made,
but before this session comes ta an end I shall
ascertain whether there is any truth in it or
not. I do not know what regulations have
been issued or what advices have gone out. I
do know that in Montreal more than one man
bas been refused because of having a wife and
two children. I was surprised, therefore, ta
hear that a man with a wife and nine children
had been accepted.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: I know that in one
city a man with a wife and five children bas
been accepted. He is a captain. No distinction at all is made between married men and
single men. In a broadcast over the radio
a colonel, whose voice I recognized even before
his name was announced, said: "Your wife and
children will be taken care of by the Dominion
Government.
Come and join, and get the
pay and allowances." In the city where I live
there is nothing at all ta prevent men from
joining; the larger a man's family the greater
the inducement for him ta join. This is an
outrage. Take the case of a captain, a married
man with five children, who has a job at
which be earns about $150 a month. Can the
honourable gentleman tell me what would be
paid ta that officer? Doubtless it would be
very much in excess of $150. This country is

going ta be loaded with debt. That is one
reason why I abject ta the present system of
enlistment. I think it would have been better
ta adopt some other system.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Sa far, I understand, the Militia have been called out-the
men belonging ta the various regiments.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Let me answer that. In
towns that I know of, the strength of battalions heretofore has been about two hundred
men. Now they are recruiting up ta one
thousand men. The honourable gentleman
from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) can
correct me if I am wrong. In one city where
recruits are being called for, the newspapers
are carrying large quarter-page advertisements.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

What city?

Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is not Montreal. In the
military district ta which I refer nat a single
battalion was up ta strength. Volunteers are
being called for, and I am informed that
inducements are being offered and married
men are joining up. I think it would be far
better ta accept only single men at first.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think the Government would be happy ta receive constructive suggestions from honourable members of
this Chamber at this time in order that
conditions of the kind referred ta may be
avoided.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators, the question raised by the honourable
member frorn Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) is, I think, exceedingly important, and
it seems ta me that we are entitled ta receive
from the Government before Parliament prorogues an official statement as ta the policy
it intends ta pursue in order to secure the
men needed for service. At the present time
we do not know what is being done. We know
that men are being enlisted, but we do not
know under what conditions. Enough bas
been said here to-day ta indicate that this
matter may involve very large and unnecessary
Sa I say again that before
expenditures.
honourable members leave Ottawa they should
clearly understand the policy of the Government in this respect.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I shall ask the
Minister of Defence ta make a clear statement from his seat in the House of Commons.
Would the
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
leader of the Government kindly get this
information for the House? I understand that
recruiting for the Canadian Militia and also
for the "Field Force" is in progress. I do
not understand what is meant by the "Field
Force." Perhaps the leader of the Govern-

24

ment eould get information about this force
and tell us for what pur-pose it is being recruited.
Hoil. Mr. DANDURAND:

SEPTEMBER 12, 1939
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Iu the
HoYuse of Commons Hansard of September
11, at page 135, the Minister of National
Defene gives an explanation of the classes.
Wbat he says there does not seem as clear es
the statement of the honourable senator
behind me (Hon. Mr. Griesbach). Frorn the
Minister's rernarks àt would lappear th-at the
field force is not under absolute obligation to
serve overseas. But he says:
If in the light of developments in the future
the Government policy should be that of sending
an expeditionary force overseas, that reserve
forceHe calis it a reserve force, not a field force.
-weuld be the nucleus of the force so to be
sent.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I understand
the terra "reserve force," but I do not know
what is meant by "fild force." Since 1 arn
flot in my own elernent bere, I will not express
any opinion about tbe matter, but will refer
the whole discussion to the ýMinister of
National Defence.
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable senators,
if I 'heard the honourabie leader of the House
eorrectly, he suggested that a statement migbt
be made in the other Chamber in explanation
of the points that are being discussed here,
and probably other points as well. I should
hike to suggest that we ought to, get a little
To my
nearer to first-hand information.
mmnd, this is not a tirne to stand on formaiity
at aIl. I feel sure that bonoura;ble members
on botb sides of the House desire to be of
use-to serve. But for that purpose we must
have sorne knowledge of wbat is beiug doue
by the Governmen*t. I consider it would be
a calamity that bonourable members sbould
go borne 'with as little knowiedge as they
have to-day about the Governrnent's policies
and actions.
What I have in mind is that some arrangement ought to be made whereby the Minister
wbo is responsible for these matters would
corne into tbe Senate and talk to us directly.
Tbere is no reason in the world why we should
not have a chosed, meeting here, if necessary,
or an adjournrnent during pleasure, so that
the Minister could talk freely and answer
honourable members' questions as fully as
be can. We want to know. Witb ail due
respect to rny bonourable friend wbo, is leading
the House (Hou. Mr. Dandurand), I should
say that be rnay not desire to hoad hirnsehf up
witb ahi the details wbicb the Minister of
National Defence bas in bis possession.
I tbink it must ba admitted that as to steps
taken to organize what is cahled tbe defence
of Canada we are ail in a dense fog. We do
not kuow anything about tbem. I, for

instance, who corne from Nova Scotia, have
flot been «rble to get the faintest bit of news
&bout what bas been done te protect, say,
the barbour of Halifax, with its great oil,
sugar and other industries. I understand that
a flotilla of five British warships is down
there, but I arn entirely in the dark as to
what our own Government have done. Nor
have I beau able to discover what measures
of protection are availabie for the great coal
and steel industries in Cape Breton and elsewhere. We want to be informed as to wbat
the Government are doing ail over thë
country. I think I arn expressing the opinion
of ail bonourable rnembers wben I say that
we desire information, flot for purposes of
eriticism, but as a means of belping us to
co-.operate more fully with the Government
in these important matters.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does rny riglit
bonourable friend desire us to go into
committee on the Bill ?
Rig.ht Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No.

SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators are doubtless aware that this afternoon Hon. Mr.
Ilslev. who for the time being is representing lie Minister of Finance on the floor of
the other House, delivered the Budget speech,
in which he explained the Government's plans
for financing the cost of the war. A government may finance war expenditure by borrowing or by levying taxes. I am not in a position to say that taxes will be levied to cover
war expenditure as we go on, but at the
present time a levy of some $68,000,000
through taxation is projected.
Mr. Ilsley gave a list of bills which would
result from the Budget. Among thern is this
one which we now have before us, an Act to
amend tbe Customs Tariff. It is not a long
measure. It provides:
There shall be levied, collected and paid on
the following goods, whether dutiable or not
dutiable, when imported from any country, the
additional rates of duties of customs hereinafter
specified:
Whisky, brandy, run, gin and all other goods
specified in Customs Tariff items 156, 156a, and
156b-$3 per gallon of the strength of proof.
Ale, heer, porter and stout-9 cents per
gallon.
Wines of all kinds except sparkling wines,
containing not more than forty per cent of proof
spirit--71 cents per gallon.
Champagne and all other sparkling wines75 cents per gallon.
Manufactured tobacco of all descriptions
except cigars, cigarettes, and snuff-5 cents per
pound.
Cigarettes weighing not more than three
pounds per thousand-$1 per thousand.

len the value for duty thereof under
Tea,
tie provisions of the Customs Act:
(a) is less than 35 cents per pound--5 cents

per pound.
(b) is 35 cents or more but less than 45 cents
per pound-7, cents per pound.
(c) is 45 cents or more per pound-10 cents
per pound.
All goods specified in Customs Tariff item
25a-10 cents per pound.
All goods specified in Customs Tariff item
26 except coffee, roasted or ground-10 cents
per pound.
Coffee, green, and coffee, roasted or ground10 cents per pound.
3. This Act shall be deemed to have come into
force on the twelfth day of September, one
thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine, and to
have applied to all goods mentioned in the
preueding section, imported or taken out of

warehouse for consumption on and after that
date, and to have applied to goods previously

imported for which no entry for consumption
was made before that date:
Provided that the additional rate of duty
of customs of three dollars per gallon of the
strength of proof to be levied, collected and

paid on whiskey, brandy, rum, gin and all other
goods specified in Customs Tariff items 156,
156a, and 156b shall be deemed to have come
into force on the third day of September, one
thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine, and
to have applied to all goods mentioned in this
proviso, imported or taken out of' warehouse
for consumption on and after that date, and
to have applied to goods previously imported
for which no entry for consumption was made
before that date.
This is essentially a money Bill, for which
I am asking approval by the Senate.
(Translation)
Hon. ARTHUR SAUVÉ:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If they have not,
I shall lend the honourable senator my copy.
Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ: I am not asking for any
favours. I simply wish to know if copies have
been distributed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Towards the end
of a session, and especially a session as short
as the present one, it is often necessary to
proceed without due regard for' the House
rules.
Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ:

And much too rapidly.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
.this is a money Bill.

Not at all, since

Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ: Why request the House
to adopt this Bill before we have an opportunity of acquainting ourselves with its provisions?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have read it in
its entirety, in order that my honourable
friend may ascertain the exact provisions of
this measure. I have handed a copy of it
to the right honourable leader of the opposition (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen). The honourable senator from Rigaud will readily admit,
I am sure, that his right honourable leader's
qualifications -in the mat.ter cannot be doubted.
Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ: I have .just received the
English version, but there is no French copy.
(Text)
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, this being a money Bill, of
course we would not amend it, and under
the circumstances we certainly would not
defeat it.
There are only two items the identity of
which is not revealed. I do not think the
honourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) told us the general nature of
goods specified in Customs Tariff items 25a
and 26.

28

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think I can
give the explanation to my right honourable
friend, for I read the whole of the speech
delivered in the other Hotiuse.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I presume
the goods are of the same nature as those
mentioned in the preceding items.
The honourable leader of the House said,
"We could not, of course, finance the cost of
the war as it procceds." I hope the Government will not go too far in attempting to do
so. It is obvious that to attempt it would
be to go away beyond the bounds of possibility. The danger is that if taxes that are
too heavy are imposed they are likely to result
in stagnation of business, and therefore deterioration of morale. That has to be very rarefully svoided. As long as we can keep business going and in a liealihy condition, and the
spirit of the people normal, we shall be all
right and shall be able to tax in certain directiens pretty heavily because of special activity
which will be exidenced in business. But, I
repeat, care must be taken net to go too far
in tat directioi. Taxes are already high, and
there is a point beyond which you cannot go.
laving said that, J liave only one other
matter to bring to the attention of the Covsrnmeînt in respect of financing the war. Everyone recognizes that the great financial burden
of this war will fall on Great Britain and
France, but chiefly on Great Britain. It did before; it is bound to again. We export heavily
to the United Kingdom, and the burden on the
people of the United Kingdom will become
greater. We hope it will not become insupportable, but there is a danger that it may.
Unless they are able to continue their experts
against all war hazards and all tariffs, there
will, after a time, be no way in which they
can possibly pay for their imports. I suggest
this. We ouglît to adjust our imports, by
quota or otherwise. but more properly by
tariffs if we can, so as to encourage British
and French imports. I know we are tied by
certain treaties, one very recently made with
the United States-a treaty I have not critirized in this House at all-and possibly we
cannot now make a horizontal increase on
imports from that country. I do suggest the
possibility should be explored of being relieved
frons that disability, so that if we had to we
could put a horizontal increase on those imports. I know every effort will be made by
purchasing countries, and there is evidence
now that it is being made in a very xigorous
way, to control prices.
Nothing is more
reasonable tian that they should do so. The
sca lanes are being kept open by the fleets
of those couintries and a market is thus
Riglt Hon.

Mr. MEIGHEN.

provided for exporting countries, and Great
Britain and France cannot be found fault
with if they use every effort to prevent their
being bled white by increased prices. Now,
the country which apparently is likely to profit
most from exports to the Allies is the country to the south. I speak in no spirit of
jealouisy of, nuch less of hostility to, that cointry when I say we should co-operate to the
utmost with Great Britain and France to
keep prices at a fair level, and help them to
export their goods to us, so that we shall be
able to get paid for our exports. and they will
be able to finance tlie war. The struggle in
finance will be comparable at least with the
struggle in arms. I am sure the sentiments of
the Government towards the problem are just
the arne as those I anm trying to express, but
I suggest that if t here is any way of diverting
purciases fromî colntries not at war to Grcat
Britain and her Allies, upon whiom the great
burden rests. we ought to do se.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Is there not an
clause in the treatv with our neighbours
to the south? I tlsink so.
tscrape

Hou. Mr. DANDURAND: I cannot answer
that question now. I will transmit it to the
Minister of Finance.
I ms say that the siatement of the lon.
Mr. Ilslev represents the views of the Government as to financial policy. I believe my
riglt honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Meiglien) will approve the attitude of the
Government in the matter to which he has
referred: flic applying of taxation in such
a way as to benefit tise revenue of the country, but not to haniper the development of
our industries and their possible extension
in many directions in the work whicli they
will have to earryx on to furnish war materiais
and provisions to ourselves and to Great
Britain and our Allies. I was especially struck
by the well-balanced views expressed by the
Minister of Finance and his representative in
the House of Commons. We shall meet again
to-morrow, and I ana quite sure my right
honourable friend will in the meantime be
able to get a general view of the Governnsent's policy. It is surrounded with considerable prudence and, I should think, considerable
wisdom as well. All these natters have been
approached frocs different angles and will be
worked out as we proceed. Of course, we do
not know exactly what will be the line to be
followed frocs month to month. If the war
lasts a certain time, thon througlh sheer nocessity we imay have to revise the views now held
by the Finance Department. But we have the
assurance thsat there is a healthy state of things
in the couintry to-dy; and by ail means it

SEPTEMBER 12, 1939
should be maintained. I think our people
have the true spirit and will carry on with
courage to maintain our production and, if
possible, develop it.
(Translation)
Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ: I should like to explain
the request I made a moment ago. I have a
great deal of respect for the right honourable
leader on this side of the House, as I have
for the honourable leader of the Government,
but I am convinced that the right honourable
gentleman on this side would never wish to
set himself up as a dictator in this Chamber.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Nor have I ever
suggested that.
Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ: I had no other desire
at the time than to obtain reliable information, in order that it might not be said that
this House had passed very important measures with undue haste at such a critical time.
Yesterday a certain section of our press was
blaming the Senate for adopting measures
without sufficient knowledge of this or that
piece of rather ambiguous legislation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is also rather
weighty.
Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ: Weighty with responsibilities and difficult to explain.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No.
Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ: Notwithstanding the
honourable leader's undoubted intelligence, I
have noted that he sometimes found it very
difficult to give us a clear explanation of certain measures.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
specialist in every field.

I am not a

Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ: The honourable leader of
the Government i clever enough to give
always a satisfactory reply; still, there have
been occasions during this session when his
explanations were insufficient and ambiguous.
I am not blaming him, for he was apparently
unable to obtain the desired information
from his colleagues in the other Chamber. I
would ask him one question: Is this money
which we are requested to vote destined to
meet the expenses of an overseas war?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is very
little relation betwfeen the legislative measures
which I introduced this afternoon and evening,
and my honourable friend's question, which
might have been more opportune at the time
the House was asked to appropriate $100,000,000 to cover the cost of military operations.
The sole object of this measure is to raise
sufficient funds to meet the Treasury's needs

29

and, naturally, to defray to a certain extent
the expenditures approved under the Bill
which was introduced yesterday, I believe.
However, it is impossible for me at this time
to specify the expenditures which those moneys
may serve to meet, since those sums are part
of the general budget.
Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ: I am not asking for any
details. What I am asking the honourable
leader is this: Is it possible that the funds
which we are voting in detail may serve to
cover the expense of an overseas war?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think I can
set at rest the anxiety which prompts my
honourable friend to ask me that question.
I believe that, as regards the general budget,
including the $100,000,000 which we have
voted, should the Government arrive at the
conclusion that the sending of an expeditionary
force to Europe is necessary, the Treasury
funds as well as the moneys we shall vote might
be used, in a certain measure, to this end. That
is as far as I can go. Naturally, whenever the
Government decide to consider the necessity
or advisability of sending an expeditionary
force overseas, they will have to adopt the
ways and means required, and there will be
available for this purpose, in the Treasury,
the sums which we are called upon to vote, as
well as those we have already voted. It is
rather difficult, however, to reply to my
honourable friend's question, because we are
raising money for military purposes.
Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ: I should like to know
the purpose for which these moneys are being
raised.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: Because of the present
situation.
Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ: My sole object in speaking thus and in asking these questions is
to obtain sufficient enlightenment. I am not
endowed with an intelligence comparable to
that of my honourable friend, and I feel the
need of enlightenment. I have observed,
since the opening of this session, that the business of both Houses has been unduly expedited. I came here convinced that Parliament had been summoned to decide whether
or not Canada should participate in the war.
After listening to the speech from the Throne
and to the explanations given to the House of
Commons by the right honourable the Prime
Minister I became convinced that all the funds
we were requested to vote-including the
$100,000,000--were earmarked for national defence in this country, and that Canada would
never be made to take part in an external
war as long as there remained in the Cabinet
French Canadian ministers like those we have
at present. We were told, "t is simply a

SENATE
matter of pro> iding for onr territorial and
coastal defence." But thiat is flot what is
happening. 1 have i'ead, in the in-terval, the

Cotiil ivere pa-sc;d, one on Aîicnst 26, 1939,
and one on Scptomhcr 1, 1939, hotta of wliiclî
were laid on the Table. That of Aug-ust 26
reads:

SEPTEMBER 12, 1939
Whereas Section 63 of the Militia Act provides that the Militia or any part thereof, or
any officer or man thereof, may be called out
for any military purpose other than drill or
training, at such time and in such manner as
is prescribed;
And whereas Section 2 (j) of the said Act
defines "prescribed" to mean prescribed by the
Militia Act or by regulations made thereunder;
And whereas the Minister of National Defence
reports that there are certain duties which in
his opinion are "military purposes" coming
within the meaning of that expression as used
in Section 63 of the said Act for the performance of which the strength of the Permanent
Force is at present insufficient, and it is
desirable to place on service certain parts of
the Militia; and
That it is deemed expedient to make a regulation providing the manner in which the provisions of the said Section 63 may be invoked;
Now, therefore, His Excellency the Governor
General in Council, on the recommendation of
the Minister of National Defence and pursuant
to the provisions of the Militia Act, is pleased
to malte the following regulation and it is hereby
made and established accordingly:
Regulation
The Minister of National Defence may call
ont the Militia or any part thereof, or any
officer or man thereof, for any purpose coming
within the provisions of Section 63. of the
Militia Act, at such times and in such manner
as he may deem expedient.
By this Order in Council the Militia was
called out, in accordance with section 63 of
the Militia Act, as a precautionary measure
for the protection of federal property and for
the manning of coast defences. The call was
sent to members of the Militia, but they were
not obliged to answer it.
The Order in Council of September 1 provides:
Whereas the Minister of National Defence,
under date of first September, 1939, reports that,
by reason of the present emergency, it is desirable to proceed immediately with the necessary
arrangements pertaining to placing the active
Militia on war establishment;
Therefore His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the reconimendation of the
Minister of National Defence, is hereby pleased
to authorize the organization forthwith of a
Canadian Active Service Force, and

for such

purpose, under the provisions of Section 20 of
the Militia Act, to naine as corps of the active
Militia those units, formations and detachments
as set out in Schedule D annexed.
His Excellency the Governor General in
Council, on the same recommendation and pursuant to Section 64 of the Militia Act, is further
pleased to place and doth hereby place on active
service in Canada, the units, formations and
detachments set out in the said Schedule D, and
those other corps and parts of the Militia as
set out in Sehedule E annexed.
It is required that Parliament be called

within fifteen days from the publication of
this Order in Council.

Any member whose

unit is called out under this Order is compeIled
to report for duty for active service in
Canada.

I have asked the Minister of Defence to
give me answers to the questions raised in the
discussion to-day, and perhaps yesterday as
well. I understand one question was: Shall
we contribute trained air personnel directly
to the Royal Air Force, or will the personnel
remain under our own control? The answer
is: Certain trained personnel may be sent over
to the Royal Air Force almost immediately,
but it is hoped that within a few weeks we
may send overseas a composite Canadian
unit of trained personnel, under Canadian
command and direction, to co-operate in the
most effective manner with the Royal Air
Force.
Another question was: Is the Canadian
field force to be the expeditionary force?
The answer is: If as a matter of Government
policy it is decided te send an expeditionary
force overseas, the present Canadian active
service force would be the nucleus of such
an overseas contingent. It is proposed, however, that if such a decision be reached, all
members of the force shall be given opportunity to re-enlist specifically for overseas
service, on a voluntary basis.
This, I suppose, is a complete answer to
the question asked by my honourable friend
from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Sauvé). In the
event of such re-enlistment for overseas
service, training of the men, requiring some
months to complete, would be done in Canada.
There is no desire on the part of the Department of Defence or the Government of the
day, or, I suppose, of any member of Parliament, to send our men overseas to be trained
on the muddy Salisbury Plains. I think the
people of Canada do not desire that that
should be done. Great Britain already has
large numbers of men under training, and we
must not burden her with our own work.
I may say that our medical examination of
to-day is quite severe. There is a determination not to repeat the costly experience of
1914-18, when, according to Sir Arthur Currie
and Dr. Macphail, 100,000 misfits went overseas from Canada.
It is clear that the men who answered the
call under the Order in Council of September
1 would be re-enlisted before being sent
abroad, if the Government decided upon
sending men overseas.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Re-enlisted
voluntarily?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It would be a
voluntary re-enlistment.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
it seems to me that the explanation with
respect to the Militia and the field force
brings out the point raised earlier in the day
by the honourable senator from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach).
The Militia has

22

SENATE

always been our peace-tirne for-ce. It formed
the nucleus of our overseas force.
Thaf
ixas the situation in the last war. But if
would appear now that this field force is
going to be the nucleus of oui' overseas force,
if we scnd one. If that be so, it is easy to
undcrstand. that members of the Milifia who
wishi te -et overseas would seek transfer te
the field force. But if scemrs f0 me that if
ibis field force is f0 be the oniy nucleus of
oveixeas forces, we shall not ho making fthe
best use of the mon wlîo for years have
devotcd themselves to the Militia and who
to-day make up what are pei'haps our most
highly quaified unifs. If does seem te me
there shouid be one org-anizafion, the oversýeas
force. whicli w ould inclîde the best, men
ai ailable.
As if appears now, there is a
division bcfween fhe field for-ce and fhe

Hon. '.\r. DANDURAND:

No.

SEPTEMBER 12, 1939
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: There is not the
slightest doubt about it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will my honourable friend accept an explanation? The
Government will not come to Parliament,
because they will by the legislation we are
passing be clothed with authority to develop
the defence of Canada as they see fit, after
consultation with Great Britain.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: There is no cause
for worry. It is merely the Government's
deviousness about the whole business which
has produced this state of affairs. These men,
as everybody knows, will be the expeditionary
force. They are being organized and trained,
and just so soon as Parliament is out of the
way they will be called our expeditionary
force. Therefore those who are worrying
about their military status will find every
satisfaction. They will be described as the
expeditionary force, and nobody will be any
worse off except the unfortunate militia units
which are not ear-marked for this purpose.
These will find themselvs without recruits,
and their men drifting off into the expeditionary force, because of this outstanding
psychological fact, which I referred to this
afternoon as something like Gresham's Law.
As bad money drives out good, so the recruitment of an expeditionary force destroys the
local Militia, for the real fighting men want
to bc in a force that is going on active service,
and a certain odium attaches to the poor
old stay-at-home Militia. That is what is
worrying the honourable gentleman from
Vancouver. If the expeditionary force is
really built up to something worth while,
we can get along without the Militia for local
defence. The organization and training of a
couple of hundred thousand men for an expeditionary force of four or five divisions will
always ensure our having a sufficient number
of men for internal security and coast defence.
This will work out all right. But the method
of filling the expeditionary force is something
altogether different, and if my honourable
friend will allow me to make the speech which
I have been threatening to make, but which so
far he has prevented me from making, I will go
fully into the matter either to-night or tomorrow morning.
Some Hon. SENATORS: To-morrow morning.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Certain Montreal militia units have already chosen their
officers in case an expeditionary force is to
be created. They have their organization
pretty well ready.

33

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Do I understand the honourable leader of the House to say that after
Parliament prorogues the Government will
have power to call for volunteers and send an
expeditionary force overseas?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, if necessary.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, of course I am in favour
of the second reading of this Bill. I rise
only to say one thing. So far as an expeditionary force is concerned, I hope the Government will not remain too long in No Man's
Land. The roar that will go up throughout
this country if they do will be, I think, far
beyond what they conceive. Men are giving
up good positions. They are not giving them
up to hang around the banks of canals or to
loaf around barracks. They are giving them
up to undergo training so they may do a
job for their country, and the Government
have little notion of what will happen unless
the opportunity to do that job is kept open,
the direction pointed and the work advanced.
There 'is no need for argument. Conditions
will dictate everybody's course. The steady,
inexorable march of events will turn the
Government in the right direction. They
cannot possibly resist. We do not need to
plead at all. All will be brought about as
one thing after another will crash, crash,
crash. I just ask the Government to be alive
and get going. That is what the country
demands.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would tell
my right honourable friend that the men at
the helm to-day have a full sense of their
responsibilityRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
doubt it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -and will act
with courage. They will not be swayed by
the appeals coming from members of the
community who are extremely zealous, and
whose zeal I respect. They are in contact
with the development of the situation as
seen from London. Surely my right honourable friend will trust the Government to do
the right thing at the proper time.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
doubt that, and have not the slightest
question in my mind as to the attitude of the
British Government, but nobody can tell me
they are not going to welcome help at the
very centre and crucial point of the struggle
I have noticed a little tendency to dwell
on what happened in 1914. No doubt errors
were made then, in the rush of events. 1

4. Schedule III to the said Act, as enacted

These soft drinks serve a useful purpose
throughout the whole country. In many places,
where the water is unfit to drink, they fill a
very special need.
A large number of makers of these soft
drinks are in business in a small way. A ,tax
of this kind would compel them to raise their
price to the retailer, who in turn would be
obliged to charge the consumer six cents. As
honourable members can imagine, this would
result in a considerable decrease in sales, because people are used to paying a nickel for
these drinks. Moreover, I think the amount
of tax callectible on this item would be so
small that it is not worth while for the
Government to bother with it.
Here is an exHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
planation given by the Minister, Hon. Mr.
Ilsley:
In view of the increased levies on alcoholic
beverages, and on tea and coffee, it seems proper
that some additional taxes should be imposed in
respect of soft drinks. It is proposed, therefore,
to place a tax of two cents per pound on carbonie acid gas and similar preparations used
in the manufacture of non-alcoholic beverages.
There will be no increase in the sales tax, but
the base of this tax will be broadened by removing from the schedule of exceptions electricity
and gas used for domestic purposes, salted or
smoked meats, and canned fish.
With respect to this item, I must explain
that my hands are tied, for we cannot amend
a money bill, our power being limited to
approval or rejection in toto.

This tax will not

SENATE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: If you tax
the product in Canada you will encourage
importation, which is precisely what we do
not want to bring about.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Schweppes and other
charged waters are imported, and, I take it,
they will nlot be affected by this Bill. 1t, does
appear to me that the proposed tax would
encourage the importation of soft drinks of
that nature.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My lionourable
friend is awarc of my predicarnent. This is a
Bill which we cannot amend. I recali that
sonictimies the C-overnment hiave studied

expressed by the Prime Minister to-day,

SEPTEMBER 12, 1939
very significant observations which bear
directly on the proposal now being made by
the Governtnent. In a speech at Manchester,
while organizing the Ministry of Munitions,
he had this to say of its purpose:
We want to mobilize in such a way as to
produce in the shortest space of time the
greatest quantity of the best and most efficient
war material. That means victory; it means a
great saving of national strength and resources,
for it shortens the war; it means an enormous
saving of life. . . .
It requires some effort to envisage the wide
range of our task. Few people would at the
outset imagine how much is covered by the
phrase: "Munitions of war," or dream of the
colossal ramifications of the industries concerned
in their production. . .
M\Iost of the special steps that were taken
after the formation of the Ministry of Munitions
to stimulate production could equally well have
been taken in 1914. It was to those special
steps that the greatly accelerated yield on
account of outstanding War Office orders in the
latter part of 1915, as well as the immense
augmentation of output in 1916 on direct orders
of the Mioistry, was mainly due.
The Government are determined to avoid,
if at all possible. the consequences that would
flow from any delay in setting up effective
machinery in Canada to meet the urgent
demand, inseparable from modern war, for
munitions and supplies. It is for this reason
that we are asking Parliament to give us
authority to set up a new and comprehensive
department with far-reaching powers.
Honourable members will recall that in 1915
a War Purchasing Commission was established,
and in 1918 a War Trade Board, both under
the authority of the War Measures Act. We
intend to take at once measures which were
found necessary as the result of experience
gained after the war of 1914-18 had been in
progress for some time. We intend to establish at once, under the provisions of the War
Measures Act, a War Supply Board responsible
to the Minister of Finance, with comprehensive
powers similar to those contained in this Bill.
As a result of the legislation now proposed,
the Government will have in reserve the
authority to create at any moment a separate
Department of Munitions and Supply. The
new department, if it becomes necessary, will
have the advantage of the experience and
organization which the activities of the War
Supply Board will have made available.
At the last session of Parliament we estabThat
lished a "Defence Purchasing Board.
was in a time of peace; this is a time of war.
Honourable members will recall that at the
time the Defence Purchasing Board was set
up the Minister of National Defence said in
reply to a specific question:

39

The answer is this, that this is a measure
for peace time, and I trust that it will long
be used for that purpose. If an emergency
arises, doubtless other measures will be enacted
immediately to deal with the emergency.
The main concern at that time was to ensure
that there should be no profiteering incidental
to preparations for defence. The Minister of
Finance envisaged different methods for controlling profits in the event of war. In the
same debate Mr. Dunning said:
And of course if-God forbid-war should
come and we have to consider tie results of war
inflation of one kind and another, outside of
this measure altogether we shall have to evolve
schemes for profit control, which will apply not
only on purebases by the Department of
National Defence. I think there is no doubt
we would come to that.
I hope I have already made it abundantly
clear that the attitude of the Government today is just as firm in that respect, and, if
anything more were needed to show our firmness, the tax proposals in the Budget speech
should leave no room for doubt on this
score. What we do want to ensure is that the
procedure for which there may have been time
in days of peace does not hamper and slow
up the meeting of urgent needs in the present
situation. When the saving of time may mean
the saving of lives, the War Supply Board
will be so constituted as to function speedily
and effectively in the matter of purchases.
But the problem is no longer confined to
the purchase of day-to-day requirements on
a comparatively limited scale. The problem
is now broadened to include planning, not only
for months but perhaps for years ahead. Further than that, it includes the whole question
of the supply of materials of all kinds directly
or indirectly necessary for the prosecution of
the struggle. It involves the investigation of
sources of supply of many commodities, not
only those produced in Canada, but, as well,
those which must be obtained abroad; also
the working out of measures to conserve essential supplies here, which otherwise might be
exported, and the ascertaining of capacities
and capabilities of plants and businesses for
producing or supplying essential needs. Equally
important is the endeavour which must be
made to ascertain and forecast, not only
present, but also prospective needs, and to see
that supplies shall be conserved or obtained to
fill these needs from time to time. The experience of the last war revealed clearly that
staying-power, the effective use of econornic
resources, was the decisive factor. It is but
a commonplace to say that, in modern war,
economie defence is as vital as military defence. Canada's particular geographical situa-

SENATE
lion especially fits bier to make a tremendous
material and technical contribution to the
joint effort.
This joint effort raises another problem,
iiamr'ly, the distribution of available materials
as between us and our Allies. Now that purebases on a large scale by tbe British Government, and probably by other governments
associated witb Great Britain in the struggle,
are likely to be made in Canada, it is advisable tbat there sbould be an autbority with
power 10 art not only for Canada, but also as
an agent for other governments if they should
dcsire it, and in any rase to co-ordinate the
purcbases of the Canadian Government witb
thoSe made for other governments.
While tbe legislation wbirb the Government bave introduced provides for tbe creation
of a Department of Munitions and Supply, it
is flot tbe intention of the (3overnment to set
up a full-fledged deparîrnent immediately. We
are desirous of avoiding unnecessary duplication of departmnents, and of having the prelimiinary benefit gained from actual experience
of a fully autborized and competent board,
x4orking to arbieve tbe best methods of bandling the complex and far-reacbing problemns
involved in respect of war supplies.
WVe feel tbat tbe reasons for liaving made
tbe Defence Purcbasing Board responsible to
tbe Minister of Finance apply even more
strongly in tbe case of a War Supply Board
during the period in whicb an organization is
being built up. The problem of finance is
a vital element in the general problem of
supply, and tbe Minister of Finance must
necessarily bc in close contact with wbatever
organization is entrusted witb tbe responsibility of securing munitions and supply.
No one can foreteil wbat demands this war
will make upon the country. We must be
prepared to meet unexpected demands quickly.
Tbis legislation gives us the power to art
quickly and effectively if the need sbould
dcx elop for anotber department witb a fulltime Minister in charge. It is considered,
liowex or, tbat in the early stages surveys,' investigations, organization and administrative
mnethods can be initiated and worked out by
a board in close touch with business and practirai conditions, tbese artivities to be later
continued under the board or merged in a
mîinistry as the occasion and circumstances
demand, and as the experience gained may
warrant.
I have given tbis explanation so tbat bionour-able members rnay understand tbe purport of tbe Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable members,
I tbink we shahl in tbe long run lose very
little time if we postpone tbe second reading,
of this Bihl until to-morrow. Wr could
more easilY follow tbe explanation given by
the bonourable leader if wr had bad an opportunity beforehaiid to peruse this lengtby rneasure. I Abould like at least to look, U. over.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
1 bave no
objection to meeting tbe request of my bionourable friend, tbough I may say wr are not
working under any more difficult conditions
tban tbe House of Commons, wbicb received
tbis Bill only at ten o'clock tbis evening.
That does not mean we sbould not take more
time to examine it tban tbat House did.
It is intended tbat the Senate shaîl convene
again at teni-tbirty in tbe morning. I presumne
my bonourable friend will risc early and digest
the Bill before cominge to tbe Bouse.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: The Bill certainly sbould stand until to-morrow. I amn
astonisbed tbat it passed tbrougb tbe other
House in a matter of minutes. It is a very
important measure and really ougbt to go to
committee. As I understand it, tbe Bill provides for tbe calling into being of a Department of Munitions wbicb will supplant the presont Defence Purcbasing Board. The poor
members of that board have hardly got their
seats warmi yet.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
upon them ton fast.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The board
came into existence as a result of a recommnendation wbicb arose nut of embarrassments
surrounding a certain war contract. Tbey
bave just got tbc glory of tbat around tbeir
beads.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhiaps I was
a littîr hasty in saying tbe board would disappear.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN,: Surely we
are not going to have for Ibis purpose botb a
departmcnt, and a Defence Purchasing Board.
Hon. 'Mr. LITTLE: Tbey moved into a now

Rigbht Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: An.d now
tbey are going out the xindow.
I have looked througb tbe Bill, and can sec
at least one menit wbicli ex idences a certain
degree of education on the part of tbe Governmnent. There is no five-per-cent clause in
tbis Bill.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Black, tbe debate
was adjourned.

WAR CHARITIES BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 11, an Act relating to
War Charities.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND

moved the

second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, I wonder
whether we could not dispose of this Bill
now. It has been drafted on the basis of the
War Charities Act of 1917, with changes
suggested by the experience gained in the
administration of that Act.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We have not got copies
of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the purpose of the Bill.

I shall state

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I object to the Bill being
read before I have a copy of it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Bill says:
"War Charity Fund" means any fund having
for its objects or among its objects the supplying of needs or comforts or the relief of suffering or distress for the benefit of the personnel
of the armed forces of Canada or the families
or dependents of any of them or of any other
sufferers from the present war, or any other
charitable purpose connected with the war.
3. (1)

It shall be an offence

under this Act,

(a) directly or indirectly to solicit or make
any appeal to the public for donations or subscriptions in money or in kind for any War
Charity Fond, or to raise or attempt to raise
money for any War Charity Fund by promoting
or conducting any bazaar, sale, entertainment
or exhibition, or by soliciting for advertising
or by any other means, unless the War Charity
Fend is registered under this Act;
(b) to make or attempt to make any collection
for any War Charity Fund unless with the
authorization in writing of the officer duly
designated in accordance with paragraph (d)
of subsection two of section four of this Act to
authorize collections for such War Charity
Fund;
(2) This section shall not ,apply to any collection at Divine service in a place of public

worship;

41

4. (1) The Minister, on application of any
person, association or institution under whose
auspices it is proposed to raise a War Charities
Fund, may grant registration thereof upon his
being satisfied:(a) that adequate provision bas been made
for its establishment and control in accordance
with such regulations as may be made from
time to time under the authority of section eight
of this Act;
(b) that there is reason to believe that its
specific purpose is not already satisfied;
(c) that the application for registration is
made in good faith.
(2) The Minister shall keep a register of all
War Charities Funds, etc.
-I had forgotten about the legislation of 1917,
but I now remember that all kinds of organizations were springing up. They had to be controlled, and legislation similar to this was
enacted for the protection of the public. I
should think my right honourable friend would
remember that legislation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
well.

Yes, quite

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think it is
absolutely necessary to prevent some evilly
disposed persons from taking advantage of the
emotions created by war and devising various
schemes to raise money, not alil of which would
rea,ch the persons for whom it appeared to be
destined.
If my right honourable friend has no objection, I will move the second reading of the
Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We might
give the Bill second reading now and take
third reading to-morrow.
Bills are coming over here at the rate of
one a minute. I cannot understand it at all.
It is utterly absurd. I do not like, and I am
sure other honourable members do not like,
to see this House passing legislation which we
have had no opportunity to read. Why there
should be such a rush in the Commons to get
home I cannot imagine. I think we should
sit to-morrow and thoroughly study all these
measures, no matter what the Commons may
want.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Shall we take the
second reading now?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And the third
reading to-morrow. We certainly should have
a Bill of this kind.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

SEPTEMBER 13, 1939
Since it is the fund and not the association
concerned which is required to be registered,
the exception in section 2 (b) of the 1917 Act
with respect to churches and the Salvation Army
has been omitted. but the provision is retained
exempting from the application of the Act "any
eollection at Divine service in a place of public
worship."
Two features of the 1917 statute which caused
considerable difficulty have been omitted, viz.,
provision for local registration authorities and
for exemption by the Minister with respect to
certain war charities. It is suggested that
facilities for rapid transmission of applications
by air mail which now exist render it no longer
necessary to provide local registration authorities, and thereby overcome considerable difficulties which had been experienced in the
administration of the 1917 Act. There does
not appear to be any need to impose upon the
Minister responsibility of exercising his diseretion in circumstances which might give rise
to a suggestion of discrimination.
The only other substantial respect in which
the draft differs from the earlier Act is with
regard to the provision for termination of
registration by the Minister "whenever, in his
diseretion, lie may consider that effective coordination of public subscriptions for the relief
of suffering or distress, whether connected with
the war or otherwise, renders such termination
desirable in the public interest," and the provision for establishment, if desired, of a separate
board to carry ont more effectively the work
of co-ordination. It is hoped that by this
expedient it may be possible to avoid unnecessary overlapping of effort in some directions and
inadvertent neglect of necessary endeavour in
other fields where relief of suffering or distress
may be urgently required.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I was unable to catch the full meaning of one part of the explanation, which
stated that the present Bill differed from the
Act of 1917 in that the Minister will no longer
have to exercise discretion in certain circumstances. This change is said to be made
because exercise of that discretion might be
considered biased. I do not know how the
Minister can possibly be relieved of the exercise
of any discretion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am informed
that under the Act of 1917 the Minister could
refuse to exempt an alien organization which
asked leave to carry on its work without registration. Under this Bill all such organizations
must register.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
DEPARTMENT OF MUNITIONS
SUPPLY BILL

AND

SECOND READING

The Senate resumed frorm yesterday the
debate on the motion for the second reading
of Bill 5, an Act respecting e Department of
Munitions and Supply.

43

Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
when yesterday I moved adjournment of the
debate I did so in order that we might have
an opportunity to read the Bill, which was
not possible during the debate.
At the last session we passed legislation for
the appointment of a board to act in consultation with the Minister in the purchase of war
supplies. No doubt the Government introduced that legislation because of a certain
investigation held just before the opening of
that session. I think it was called a Munitions
Board.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Purchasing Board.

A Defence

Hon. Mr. BLACK: In this Bill I do not sec
any reference to the Defence Purchasing Board.
What has become of this body? Apparently
it was considered that in time of peace such
a board was necessary for the purpose of advising the Administration. Does this Bill contain any provision to set up a similar group
of business men and experts to function in
time of war, when their assistance might be
much more important? In other words, when
a new department is being set up, is any
provision made for a board to act in consultation with the Minister who takes charge of
the department?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend is referring to clause 5, which deals
with the powers of the Minister. It reads:
(1) The Minister shall have such administrative powers and duties in relation to the
supply of munitions and supplies and for the
execution and carrying out of defence projects
for, during or respecting the present war as
may be conferred on him by the Governor in
Council, and the Governor in Council may also,
if ho considers it expedient in connection with
the supply of munitions and supplies and the
execution and carrying out of defence projects
that any powers or duties of a Government
department, board or authority, whether conferred by statute or otherwise, shouhl be transferred to or exercised or performed concurrently
or otherwise by the Minister, by Order in
Council make the necessary provision for such
purpose and any Order in Coneil made in
pursuance of this section nay include any
supplemental provisions which appear necessary
for the purpose of giving full effect to such
Order in Council.
(2) Any Order in Council made under this
section may be varied or revoked by a subsequent Order in Council.
I arn informed that the present Purchasing
Board will continue to function until the
Minister of Finance decides whether it should
be replaced by another organization or its
duties transferred to the Department of Finance. The Government are of opinion that
the organization set up last session would

44

SENATE

work much too slowly to meet the stress of
war. and it may well be that the department,
having examined the field, will decide to
organize another system of consultation. It
should be borne in mind that there may be
necessity for co-operation in the purchase of
supplies for other governments, and consequent
need for enlarging the operation of a purchasing board. It is sonewliat difficult to visualize
how a board could be set up outside the Government for. say, Imperial purchases, which
should not be co-ordinated with a purchasing
board attending to Canadian purchases. This
is something which the Minister of Finance
will have to consider, and therefore it is difficult to say to what extent the present Purchasing Board will be utilized. It may be transformed into an organization within the Finance Department in order to act with celerity
and give as much protection to the public
generally as is provided for in the enactment
of last session.
Hon. Mr. BLACK:
Board still exist?

Does the Purchasing

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. BLACK:

Oh, yes.

It is still functioning?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes. It is the
intention of the Finance Department to utilize
the board for the present. We shall very likely
have to co-ordinate it with any special organization that may bu set up by the Imperial
Government. Naturally this step would be
taken with the approval of the Imperial authorities. We are entering a field of such importance that it has been deemed necessary to
constitute this department, which will be
enlarged only when necessary.
In Great
Britain, at a certain stage of the last war, it
was felt that a Department of Munitions
should be created. As I quoted last night,
Mr. Lloyd George in his post-war memoirs
stated the steps then taken accelerated the
suppl xof imunitionsoii
a proper hasis and
in such a way as to lielp win the war. Of
course, we would not for a moment think of
giving such iwide powcrs to any department
in time of peace; but we are at war.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEICHEN: A great
Englishman once wrote-I omit the irrelevant
part: "And so, from lour to hour, we ripe
and ripe; and thereby hangs a tale." How
applicable to the history of this Bill and of its
forbears! Last session a measure was before
us to estabiish a Defence Purchasing Board.
This action was heralded, with no small
measure of propaganda, as a great forvard
step. The measure was born of the finest
lineage that any legislation could have-the
recommendation of a judge of the Supreme
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Court. Its aim was to get the purchasing of
supplies for defence out of the incompetent,
or rather politically blemished, hands of
ministers and into the hands of an impartial
and competent commission, where, of course,
wisdom and capacity always reside. Well, the
Bill passed. It had to include a number of
special features-just about as fine political
provisions as I ever saw in any measure; provisions sententiously designed to usher in a
new reign, wherein profits in relation to war
contracts should be no more.
Who does not remember the 5 per cent
clause? Who does not remember the history
of the part it played all through last session?
When the boys were fighlting and dying the
profiteers were not going to make money under
this Government. Profits were to be limited
to 5 per cent. I do not like to say it, but
at the time I questioned the good faith of
the Governnent in that measure. I have not
now a bit of confidence it was introduced in
good faith.

Board, as such.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

We may.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If this Bill
has any purpose at all, that is it, the reason
being that we have to move faster and cannot
do so under the Defence Purchasing Board
which was established just about thrce or
four months ago. When the lightnings were
flashing and clouds were black, when we
could hear the thunder, not distant, but near,
we did not need to move fast! What were
the trammels in the Defence Purchases Act
which held us back and strangled our action?

45

SEPTEMBER 13, 1939

I do flot know of any that is flot, here, except
the five per cent clause. Under the Act the
chairman of the board had to recommend to
Council and get his order. The new Minister
bas to do the same. According to the Act the
chairman of the board was in the Department
of Finance, under the Minister; by this Bill
he wjhl be under the new Minieter. Thae is the
only difference in lis position. The trammel
was the five per cent clause. I do flot like
the refrain, "I told you so." I was no wiser
than any other business man in Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is something my right honourable friend said which
he seems to forget.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I should like
to be reminded of it.
H1e said it
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
seemed obvious that in time of stress or war
the War Measures Act would supersede al
our legisiation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I arn glad
the honourable gentleman has recalled that.
1 said if there was stress of war we should
make use of the War Measures Act, and I
think I said the War Measures Act would be
used to get rid of this board. But what
did the leader of the bouse say? He said:
"You tell us that we cannot get goods under
this legislation; the manufacturers will not
make t hem. I woul.d invoke the War Measures Act and -compel them to do sn." H1e invoked the War Measures Act ail right, not to
compel the manufacturers to make goods, but
to repeal the Bill just as soon as anything had
to be donc.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That was the
suggestion cd my right, honourable friend.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Yes, certainly
it was. And let me not appear to be boasting
None was needed. The
of any prescience.
evidience 'before our committee showed that
the scheme would not work. But the Gavernmsent persisted.
Honourable members who
Now what?
support the Government know that in the
processes of works of peace at home you cannot apply sanctions that are applicable in
affairs of war. You cannot make a manufacturer produce at a certain rate. Direetors are
trustees. They cannot re'commend something
which goes against the interests of those for
whom they are trustees. If they do, they are
breaking their trust. Everyone behind the
Government knew that; but the Guvernment
They wanted to be heralded
persisted.
throughoiit this country as the fathers of the
idea of five per cent profit and no more. It

was confidently expected, in the-other Chamber at lest, that the Senate would defeat the
6ive per cent clause. I had information to. that
effeet from various sources. Then we should
be heralded as the friends and fortifiers of big
interests, and the Goverument would get
credit for having struggled against the beasts
at Ephesus and gone down. Such was the
whole purpose of the measure. We said it
would not work.
Now, what happened on August 26, the first
day after the Government declared an emergency? Having already put through a Governr General's warrant for $7,500,000 for acroplanes, appliances and such adjunets, most
of which would be covered by designs owned
solely by individual concerus, and could be
produced only by individual concerns, they
enacted under the War Measures Act: "The
Minister reports that under the restriction
of the Defence Purchases Act the board cannot possibly get gonds; therefore the Governor General in Council is pleased to order,
and doth hereby order, that the Defence Purchasing Board secure these gonds in any way
it secs fit, notwithstanding the provisions of
the Defence Purchases Act or any other Act."
There is where the War Measures Act came
in. It was applied, not to compel people to
make gonds, for they could not be compelled,
but to repeal an Act of Parliament. Things
were worse than I suppnsed. I read fron
this morning's paper. and I ask honourable
members to listen.
Two important provisions of tise Defence
Purchasing Board, created at the last session of
P.arli-ament, will -not be carried into a new War
Supply Board to be set up under the War
Measures ActI ask, honourable members to note this carefully.
-Transport Minister Howe tnld the Commons
late Tuesday night.
One provision that will be dropped was that
ail materials sbould be purchased by public
tender.
Then there is this quotation of the Minister:
Tt is perfectly reasonable and satisfactory to
do that in time of peace, but it may be impossible to (Io it in time of war on certain occasions,
and to malze it mandatory that tenders shail
be called as was the case in the iast bill would
not be practical, the Minister said.
The provision that profits sbould be limited
to five per cent of the capital utilized for the
period in wbich the article was produced will
also be dropped.
I have had a great deal of experience in buying materials exten(ling over a gond many years,
and I give it as my opinion that it is impossible
to lay down a uniform standard for profit witb
respect to a wide variety of purchases.
That was euphoniously

and well

expressed.

46

SENATE

The provision of five per cent was put into
the last Act after a great deal of consideration
as a minimum return for the service rendered,
but it was one whicb men of considerable experience believed to be unworkable.
He did not say he was one who believed that,
but I know he was.
I ean say that from that day to this the
Purchasing Board bas done its very best to place
contracts on that basis. au lias used every
pressure tiat couldli be brought to bear in the
form of patriotism and so on, but to date it bas
not succeeded in placing a single contract on
tlat basis.
Thus ends the most fantastie political legislative pantomime that ever entertained any
House. What a farce it was!
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Pressed on by
a dutiful and loyal opposition which unanimously insisted that it should be done, and
which carried it.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I called
attention to that at the time. When a Government are seeking solely their own popularity
the opposition are very likely to chime in
and see if they cannot secure a share.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY: It is human nature.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Human nature,
certainly. But it was utter, transparent nonsense. I opposed it with might and main.
I do not know of anything I left out, but I
did net paint it as bad as it turned out to be.
Throughout the country resolutions were
passed stating that a leader in this Hoise had
taken the side of the profiteers and condemning him as their friend. You cau imagine
what would have been said throughout the
Dominion if this House had defeated the Bill.
I ask the Government net te be guilty of
that kind of conduct during war. It is not
fit conduet even during peace. The Bill was
just as cheap political trickerv as yon can
imagine.
Nobody doubts that Mr. Howe
knew the proposai would not work. He knew
it was politics and nothing else, and other
menibers of the Governnent almxost as experienerd as be, and just as intelligent, knew the
same thing. Now let us have an end of it.
Where are we to-day?
As the Minister
bas said. this Bill provides that we can get rid
of the Purchasing Board, as such. By that, I
praesume, lie means we can attach it to this
new ministry. I do not think it is intended te
get rid of the board, for a tremendous organization bas been built up.
Before proceeding further, let me pay this
tribute to the Government.
I think they
appointed a good board. I do not know the
third man, but I know Mr. Vaughan, and immediately upon his appointment I wrote to
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

him and expressed my gratification as a Canadian. I think he is a competent man. Mr.
Sherman is certainly competent, if he eau give
time to the work. The board is all right.
Here it is. functioning with a very large
organization. I presume the idea is to bring
it under the Ministry of Supply. I think the
whole thought in the mind of the judge was
that these matters should be handled with a
measure of independence from political control. I have no fear of political control where
there is a real minister. Apparently everything
said in support of the Defence Purchases
Bill was a hollow pretence. We are getting
right back to where we were before; the only
difference is that this will come under another
minister. If it is deemed essential te make
the board a subsidiary of the new ministry,
I would point out that you can never make
ils members civil servants. Yeu can never
make a civil servant of Mr. Vaughan, nor of
Mr. Sherman.
Hon.
Grave.

Mr. DANDURAND:

Nor

of

Mr.

Rigbt lon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Nor of Mr.
Gravel. I compliment the Government on his
appointment too. I do not know him personaly, but J have huard him very well spoken
of. So when this statute comes into force the
effect must be te get rid of these gentlemen.
They will net take their places as civil servants
in a department. Se I am somevhat mystified
as to the purpose in view. I am the more
mystified by Hon. Mr. Howe's statement that
a War Supply Board is to be set up under
the War Measures Act. In the name of reason,
wiere are we going to end? Look at wbat we
already have. There is in the Department of
Defence the old purchasing organization, a
very considerable one. I doubt that it bas
been reduced at all. The Defence Purchasing
Board is another large organization, newly
housed in a great building in this city. Now
we are going to have a new ministry, and,
fourthly, a War Supply Board is te be establisied under the War Measures Act. These
boards will cost a huge sum of money. The
Government must have the jitters.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: There will be confusion.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Wbat we
want is one organization, as we had in the last
war. There was a shell committee at first, and
later this was merged with the Munitions
Board. which purchased for Canada, the
British Government and the Allies. This one
organization, under an able business man, set
a pace in the production of munitions, so that
finally we were supplying about 45 or 50 per

SEPTEMBER 13, 1939

cent of the British Empire's requirements.
That was a tremendous achievement. We also
set a pace in reducing the cost of munitions,
and other countries had to follow our lead;
so that before the war ended costs in ail Allied
countries were down to a mere fraction of
what they had been at the beginning.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Can we flot do
as well again?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: We can do
as well again. I hope the Government's future
appointments will be as good as those already
made, but we cannot get on suceessfully with
four different organizations. I know the Government do not intend to continue these four;
so I cannot understand what excuse there is
for creating thern. What need is there for a
War Supply Board? I have gone through the
Bill setting -up the new department, and arn
quite unable to understand why the Goverament jump from one purchasing organisation
to another. A choice will finally have to be
made fromn among four separate bodies, or
they will have to 'be rnerged into one.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The purpose of
this Bill is to, co-ordinate and simplify various
activities and get rjd of organizations that
clash or overlap.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: Then why
create a War Supply Board under the War
Measures Act?
Hon. Mr. DANDUHAND: I have not discussed this matter with the Minister. It may
be that this is but a narne given to a board
that will co-ordinate activities of several
departments. At this time the Parliament of
Canada must trust somebody. My right
honourable friend bas said he would have complete confidence in and coilaborate fully with
the Goveranent.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He will admit
that there are able men in the Department of
Transport, whose Minister, Hon. Mr. Howe,
he bas already commended. I am sure lie will
also cornmend Hon. Mr. Raîston, the new
Minjister of Finance, who is making a great
personal sacrifice, abandoning ail his professional activities, which are considerable, in
order to serve the country at this time. He
and ail bis colleagues will strive to get full
value for every Canadian dollar that is spent.
I suggest to rny right honourable friend that
he revert to the state of mind he rnanifested
last week, and that we ail join in an effort to
save this country and help the Allies. Oneness
of purpose is evident everywhere. 1 think rny
right honourable friend will find there is a

47

true ring to the statement made yesterday by
the Prime Minister that members of the
Cabinet are not now being guided by political
considerations. At this time we must not look
back, but must concentrate on unity of action.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I quite agree.
To be of any use here we have to criticize,
and we should be careful to criticize construetively. I want to assure the Goveranent
that it will be far more pleasant for me to
praise than to condemn. The Government
wiIl neyer wait long for help frorn me, while
I feel they are endeavouring to get on. And
if in my opinion they make a mistake my
criticisma will spring frorn no political motives
whatever, but solely from a desire to cooperate.
I arn glad my honourable friend mentioned
the a.ppointment of the new Minister of
Finance. It was my intention to say a word
about this, and I might have forgotten it.
I arn much pleased that Hon. Mr. Raîston
bas accepted the portfolio. He is an excellent
acquisition to the Goverament ranks, and I
welcome bis coming once more into the councils of the country.
I hope that any other appointment to the
Cabinet will he equally commendable. It
would not be fair to state the name of the
gentleman I have heard mentioned as likely
to be the new Minister of Munitions and
Supply, but I can say he is the right man for
the job and bis appointment would be an
admirable one. I have no doubt my honourable friend knows whom I have in mmnd.
To corne back to the point we were discussîng a moment ago, I urge that we do flot use
four or five wheels where we need only one.
Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
1 would ask my right honourable friend to
be kind enough to tell me privately the name
of the gentleman whose appoi.ntment as Minister of Munitions and Supply he feels would
he a.pproved throughout the country.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

1 shahl do so.

And I shahl
Hon. Mr. DANDUHAND:
sec that the information is made use of.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have a suggestion to make about the Bill. A memorandum from our Parliamentary Counsel, which is
no doubt in the hands of the honourable leader,
calîs attention to the use of the word "community" in section 6. The section reads:
The Minister shaîl examine into and organise
the resources of Canada . . . and shahl explore
and estimate the needs present and prospective
of the Government and the community....
1 neyer before saw that word used in a
statute.

available at this time if we are to make a
great effort on behalf of Great Britain and the
Allies.
Now, as germane to this Bill, I want to
discuss for a moment the question of an
expeditionary force, as Parliament is dispersing without any very clear statement
on this question. In fact some of us were a
little disappointed the other day to hear not
only the honourable leader of the Government
in this House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), but
also the Prime Minister himself, suggest that
our position was the same as that of Australia,
and that in Australia the Government were
merely considering what they ought to do.
I dissent from that view. We are absolutely
not in the same position. Several years ago
in discussing the question of naval defence I
pointed out to the House what Australia was
doing in this direction. The answer which
came immediately, either from the honourable
leader or from some of his friends, was that
the position of Australia was quite different
from that of Canada; that Australia had to
maintain a navy for the reason that she lived
in proximity to a power more or less hostile,
namely, Japan. I agreed at once that the
position of Australia was different from that
of Canada in the matter of naval defence.
It is more so now, when the Japanese are more
threatening. Therefore the position of Australia is quite different from that of Canada
in respect to raising an expeditionary force.
The position of New Zealand is much the same
as that of Australia, though I observed quite
recently that New Zealand is already recruiting an expeditionary force.
The position of South Africa is also different
from that of Canada. The Government of
South Africa have to deal with the Germans in
South West Africa, and General Smuts has
emphasized again and again the danger which
lies in the fact that the Italians are raising a
black army in Abyssinia. Consequently, of
all the Dominions of the British Commonwealth of Nations, Canada is the only country
which is free to dispatch an expeditionary force
without having to consider threats from its
immediate neighbourhood.
The situation as to the dispatch of an
expeditionary force is very simple. About six
months ago, when staff talks took place between high officers of the British and French
armies, the question of an expeditionary force
came up. The French said: "We know we
have the German frontier to fight upon, we
shall probably have to fight upon the Italian
frontier also, and at the moment the Spanish
frontier is threatening. We intend to mobilize
all available personnel to man these frontiers
and defend ourselves. What are you going to

do?" This was a shock to the British people,
for, as you willi remember, Mr. Baldwin had
said a couple of years ago that the day of
expeditionary forces was gone; that there
would be no more expeditionary forces. Our
own Mr. Bennett said the same thing-probably
because Mr. Baldwin had so expressed himself.
But it was an absolutely unwise observation
even then. In reply to the inquiry from the
French staff officers, the British staff officers
promised seventeen divisions, and said that,
given a little time, they would double the
number. To-day there is a British expeditionary force in France fighting along with
the French, and it is being added to day by
day.
There can be no possible question or doubt
that our war contribution must be an expeditionary force. The people of this country have
no understanding of aur waging of this war
otherwise than by the dispatch of such a force.
Therefore it becomes important to state early
that an expeditionary force will be dispatched.
and to proceed with its organization.
The only question upon which there need
be consideration is when it shall be dispatched.
That is determined by two factors: first, the
organization and training of the force;
secondly, its equipment. The most sanguine
individual will not expect that our first expeditionary force at all events will be equipped
from Canadian resources. It will have to be
equipped from the resources of Great Britain.
There is no use in dispatching a force until it
is trained, and there is no use in sending it to
England until it can be equipped.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
train it without equipment?

Can you

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That is another
difficulty. I should say that in from four
to five months, with the equipment we have,
we shall be able to reach a certain stage of
training. If equipment is available in England the troops can then be dispatched. and
another couple of months will be required to
familiarize them with the equipment they will
have to use.
I conclude this part of my remarks by
saying: it should be declared there will be
an expeditionary force; its size should be
stated; organization and training should be
proceeded with; and the equipment should
be brought to hand at the earliest possible
moment.
In the Prime Minister's speech I read another passage which disturbed me greatly
Speaking of what the Government would do,
he said:

timat thie

At thre earliest possible moment I want to
register my earnest protest against any snch
course. In 1899, wvhen Canada offered a contingent for the South African war, the British
authorities said: "We do not care to accept
your untrained units as stciti.
\Vc aro willing
to take your companies and squadirons and
intermix themir with our own troops. They
hav e not got sufficient training." Thereupon
Sir Frederick Bot-den, our Minister of Militia
at that time, stated in plain terms that in
rio tircunistances wouid we dispatch the contingent fromn Canada îînless it served as a
united body comimanded by its own officers.
We took that strong ground, and the British
Cloxernmnent accepted onr ternis. We sent
reginwnt after rogiment to South Africa. each
serx ing undor its own officers and wearing
dhe Canadian uniformu.
Our troops added

have no doubt whatever that thoir achievemoents at the front wiii be of the highest order,
as we re the achievements of our air mon in
the last war, and that again thcy wiii add
lus-tre to the annais of our Air Force. In

I protest
strongly against sending mon te serve in the
British Air Force. Such action wilI net be
approved of by our people. They will demand
that our mon go as formed bodies, that they
wear the buttons and badges and uniforms of
Canada, and serve as solid units of Canadians.
Now I want to draw attention te another
mattor xvhich is urgent, bocause events are
moving rapidly fromt day te day, and in our
miiitary efforts wo are being conîmuitted te certain courses whichi in sote respects are unsound. Thiere are in Canada to-day several
thousands of men who sorved in the late war
and left the serv ice, withi varions ranks, at
a.ges ranging front twenty to twenty-fliv
yoars. Tbey aie now, say, forty-flvo or less.
After the war they re-established themsclvcs,
mnarried, and reared families. During the past
twenty years they have discioscd that thoy
possess enorgy, initiative and capacity, and
they have raised themselx-es te important and
resîtonsible positions in tite financial, indtustrial, social anti econion)ic life of the country.
In cte oast nmajority of cases these mon cotld
afford neither the tintie ner the înoney te join
the otilitia, and have done ne miiitary service'
since thýe war. I liope I shahl ho iardoned
foi, trontinning the came of an indivumai.
An example of the type of men I have in
mind is Mr. David Sinii, now Cornmissionor
of Excise, wlto servod in the First Canadian
Infantry Battalion as a privato soldier, anti
wlto ovas tiemobiiizod in that rank in 1919 at
the ago, say, of twenty-onc. David Siim is
new ene of Canada's outstandicg civil servants. Many of the mon I have in mind
left military service in tite rank of lioeutenant
or captain, having commnandod companios and
hemi staff apîoinitiients witlt distinction. Netwitlistanding titeir failure teo serve in the
miliuia since 1919, 1 venture to assert tiat by
roason of tioir war oxporience and their
suct'ess in civil life since tue war they are of
groait inilitary value te this couîntry. Yet, in
thte schcnîe of mnobilization xvhich is being
carried eut to-day, lhey are comploteiy overlooked. They are net in the picturo at ail.
Thoy tonstitute an oloment of outstanding
rcilitary value which ought te be availod of in

whereby ti)is vory excellent materiai, which

SEPTEMBER 13, 1939
Now I want to draw attention to another
matter of great importance and serious
character in connection with our armed forces
at the present time. I am going back to 1914.
At the outbreak of the war in 1914 the highest
rank obtainable in either the permanent or
the non-permanent force was that of Colonel.
I know of only two exceptions to this rule.
Permanent force officers commanding districts
held the rank of Colonel, and officers heading departments of military administration at
Ottawa held the same rank. Non-permanent
force officers commanding brigades, and other
appointments also, reached the rank of Colonel.
In other words, the rank of Colonel was the
highest that could be obtained in the
permanent or the non-permanent force at
the outbreak of the war in 1914.
When the question of the com.mand of
infantry brigades in the First Canadian
Division arose, Sir Sam Hughes appointed
Colonels Currie, Turner and Mercer, all
of whom were non-permanent officers. When
the war ended Currie was commanding the
corps. The first and second divisions were
commandeld by Macdonell and Burstall,
permanent force officers, and the third and
fourth divisions were commanded by Lomas
and Watson, non-permanent force officers.
After the conclusion of the last war, and
upon reorganization of the forces, the practice arose of conferring the rank of Brigadier,
which is the equivalent of Brigadier-General,
upon permanent force officers commanding
districts, and the rank of Major-General was
conferred upon such officers as were appointed
to the head of a branch at Ottawa. As a
result, there are in the permanent force to-day
from five to seven Major-Generals and from
twelve to fourteen Brigadiers; but no rank
higher than that of Colonel is held by nonpermanent force officers.
Apart from what I have been able to pick
up on the street, I have no information whatever as to the mobilization plans of the Government, but I am given to unde.rstand that
the military policy of the Government will
be to give all senior commands and senior
staff appointments in any expeditionary force
which may be formed to officers of the permanent force. I object to this policy. It is to be
remembered that the permanent force is an
instructor-finding force; that it is to some
extent a staff-finding force; that it has been
used in peace times to furnish aid to the civil
power in police work. On the other hand, the
non-permanent force is the army of Canada.
In peace time it outnumbers the permanent
force by not less than ten to one, and in wartime it will outnumber that force by fifty to
one. It is essential for the self-respect and

ai

morale of the non-permanent force that officers
who enter that' service shall have open to
them the promise of attainment of the highest
rank or appointment in our military service.
It is also to be assumed that in the ranks of
our non-permanent force officers to-day, there
are, as there were in 1914, men of genius and
capacity who are the equal of any professional
soldiers to be found anywhere. If I am correctly informed, it is the military policy of
the Government, at least to begin with, to
give all commands and senior appointments to
officers of the permanent force, and to relegate the officers of the non-permanent force
to distinctly subordinate positions. The opportunity or possibility of developing the capacity for higher leadership, which must exist
in our non-permanent force, though perhaps
at the moment not disclosed, will be overlooked. In other words, if the policy which
is about to be adopted had been put into
effect in 1914 you would never have heard of
Sir Arthur Currie, Sir Richard Turner, Sir
David Watson, Sir Frederick Lomas, or a
score of non-permanent officers who distinguished themselves and rose to high position
in the war.
The history or experience of military effort
in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South
Africa does not support the condition
that the permanent force officer is inherently
the best type of officer to command the forces
of these Dominions. I make the statement,
supported by ample evidence, that the nonprofessional soldier is best led and directed
by the non-professional officer. That is easy
enough to understand. The non-professional
soldier is taken from civilian life. He is
taught as much as you can teach him, but he
bas to be handled in a certain fashion, and
the knowledge of how to handle him is
possessed in larger measure by the officer of
his own type than by the professional soldier.
That is a fact to which all officers present
will witness. I say it is a provable thing.
In point of fact, in Australia, South Africa
and New Zealand, the non-permanent force
officers are kept on terms of parity throughout with the permanent force officers, and at
this moment higher commands in New Zealand,
Australia and South Africa are in the hands
of officers of the non-permanent forces. The
permanent force officers are used for staff
duties of various kinds. In Australia the
particular duty of the permanent force officer
is mobilization and training, and legislation
there requires that officers of the permanent
forces commanding base depots shall remain
in the discharge of those duties.

52

SENATE

I contend, therefore, that the Government
mnust see to it that the non-permanent force
officer bas access to ail higher comnmands and
staff duties. It mnust be the policy of the
Governent to develop the non-permanent
force officer, because it is ùpon him we rely
for the raising, maintenance and training of
our forces. both in peace and in war, and it is
from bis ranks we rnay hope to deveilop the
type of military commander wbicb we did
develop in the iast war.
1 would not bave it thougbit tbat I arn
reflecting upon the permanent force officer.
In my judgment lie is a better officer than be
Ivas in 1914. He, too, miust be given bis
opportunity of adeiancement. I arn merely
contending that bie ougbit in no sense to
bave a monopoly, and that now is tbe tirne
to declare tbere is and sball be no sucb
mionopoly. This is essentially and particularly the duty 'of tbe Minister of National
Defence, because
once the principle
is
adopted and the earlier elements of our
Canadlian expeditionary for-ce corne under the
system, it will be too bite.
Now, I want to discuss for just a few
momients the systern of mobilization at prescnt in effect and contrast it with that adopted
in 1914. Tbe system in tbe last war was
based in lîigh degree upon propaganda and
publicity. There ivas the colourful personiality of the Minister, wbo appearcd evcrywhere, made speeches, gav e interv iews, and
kept the pot boiling. Hc adopted the poliey
in vogue in the reign of Queený Anne, namely,
of appointing as colonels. in varieus communitics througbiout Canada, several bundred citizens who would raise hattalions and units
of one sort or another. ilif a dozen of tbiese
distinguisbcd gentlemen sit in this Chiamber
at the present tirne. The effect of two bundred
colonels raising battalions in two bundred
comuniiities in Canada at the same time wvas
te produce adv ertising, propaganda, competition, a degree of excitenient, and a certain
amnount of entliusiasm. Ultimately
these
mnethods eng-endered a ferai of social conscription. The end of nv intensive policy of
recruitiing wbich fals short of compulsion is
a form of social consciption. Do net forget
that. It manifests itself in the giving of
whbite feathers to able-bodied inen'wbio are
walking about the streets.
The conipetitive recruiiting metbods employed in the last war resulted in the enlistment of a great many uinfit men, a fact
rnentioned by the bonourable leader of the
Hous'e (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) the other day.
I venture to say that at least balf of our
annual pensions bill is a result of those
me tbods.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACE.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
One bundrcd
tbousand unfit men crossed over to Europe.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: 1 would flot say
there were so many. About fifty per cent of
our preserit pensions bill is due te, the fact
that we sent ov~erseas se many men wbo were
net fit for active service, tbougbi they were
able to do other jobs. But tbe outstanding
fact is that before legal conscription ivas
adopted, our systein of enlistment in the last
war produced 500,000 men. It was a costly
and inefficient system, and tbis Governnent is
wise in departing fromn it.
I coule nýow te discuss the -metbod followed
to-day. Certain units of tbe Canadian Militia
are being mobilized and trained. Recruits are
subjected te a very rigid medical examination,
anil I believe tbat in consequence the public
treasury will be protected. I hearf.ily support
the present systemn of inobilization, but I draw
bonourable miembers' attention te the fact
tbat its success is predicated 011 one thing:
conscription. The present systemn destroys or
curbs enthusiasm; there is ne exeitement.
Yeti vill secure tbe enlistmnent of unemplov ed
yoîîng nien, andl of a certain number of ethers
who feel an urge te go te the wvar, or look
forward
wvifl
pleasurable anticipation te
adventure w'îtl an e\peditienary force, but
there will bc, an absence of great mass enlistmient sucb as w e liad in 1914 and following
years, which resulfed from propagandla and
conipetition aniong battalions. TFihs s'vstem
will produce an excellent body of men, and
tbcrefore wvill be suceessful te a point; but it
wvill net provide an expeditionary for-ce of anytbing like tbc size we liad last timne. Fronm the
scientifically military point of view it can only
sueeeed if the policy of voluntary enlistiient
is dispensed with and replaced by conscription.
In the last war wve raiscd our army by
propaganda, by advertising, by press campaigns, by excitement. and by competition
imong 200 colonels wbo werc raising battalions. None of these clements are playing
a part in the present scbeme. It is efficient,
1 agrce, but it is dulI and dcad, and it, will
destroy enthusiasm rather tban engender it.
It puis the voluntary principle riglit on the
spot. At this moment tbat principle is on
trial, and if yen hope te save it you will bave
te do somcething te take the place of tbe
methods followed in the first three years of
the last war. Tbe suggestion 1 xvant te make
te the Goverement is tbat we engage in a
campaigno f advertising and propaganda. The
flow of enlistments must be kept contintiensly moving.
Last session I adx ocated in this llouse the
establishment of a public relations bureau te
"sel'" our military service to our people. No

SEPTEMBER 13, 1939
notice was taken of my recommendation, or at
least nothing was done about it. I again urge
that at the earliest possible moment a number of highly competent persons be assigned
to establish a bureau for the purpose of "selling" the idea of military service to our young
men. I predict that in a week or so the number of recruits is going to drop. It is dropping
already. I have reports showing that recruiting is poor in various parts of the country, and
I suggest the reason is that we are not following methods which proved so successful before. I repeat that if you want to continue
the voluntary service system you will have to
spend a lot of money on advertising. Otherwise you will not build up an expeditionary
force of any worth-while strength without
applying conscription.
I want to draw the attention of the House
to another difference between the existing
situation and that of 1914. Then Canadians
were mentally quite unprepared for war. They
knew nothing about the subject and had no
opinions upon it. In the meantime they have
lived through the Great War. Women who
were twenty a quarter of a century ago are
forty-five to-day, and many of them are
mothers of sons. Everybody has moved on.
We all have now a knowledge of war and war
incidence, and that will powerfully affect the
way our people regard this struggle. Someone bas remarked that there seems to be an
absence of enthusiasm, and others have pointed
to a grim determination. Well, I think there
is a grim determination-and it may well be
grim-to see the thing through.
Because of the fuller information we have
now as compared with 1914, we shall make
sounder and, I believe, more rapid decisions.
But chiefly the difference in the outlook of
our people is due to the fact that there are
in our civil population to-day between 400,000
and 500.000 ex-service men, with their wives
and children. These men are graduates of a
great university, many of them having taken
the full four-year course. They differ in race,
in religion and in politics, but there are some
things upon which they all agree. They feel
a very personal loyalty to the Sovereign.
They accept unreservedly the conception of a
united commonwealth, and to them the
honour, dignity and prestige of Canada are as
dear as life itself. The ideals which animate
them arise from their training and experiences
during the war, and their subsequent associations in ex-service groups, such as are scattered
all over the country. By a process of elimination and selection they are the cream of the
population. They bear upon their bodies the
visible marks of their sacrifice and service.
They have a right to be heard and they will

contribution to this struggle shall be generous,

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach)
gained wide experience during the last war, in
which he played a very gallant part. Unfortunately my presence was required outside
the Chamber for part of the time he was
speaking, but I heard him make some constructive suggestions. Other proposals he made
may run counter to the policy of the Government, but in any event I shall see to it that
his remarks are drawn to the attention of the
Minister of Defence.
Hon. GUSTAVE LACASSE: Honourable
senators, I should like to say a few words on
the general issue now confronting Parliament
and reply to some of the remarks made by
my honourable friend from Edmonton (Hon.
Mr. Griesbach). I will endeavour to disappoint my honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand), who is afraid I may be too
vehement in my observations. Circumstances
are too tragic and the feelings of all concerned too sincere to warrant any violent explosion, particularly in this House. I will
be very cautious and as self-possessed as I
can. But, after all, there is a public opinion
which also bas its exigencies, a public opinion
to which attention must be paid in this
Chamber, regardless of the fact that we are
not elected directly by the people. In spite
of the existence of a state of war in this
country, I believe, as all other honourable
members do, that we are still living under
democratic institutions, for the salvation of
which we have decided to do our bit to help
those European countries which are known as
the great democracies of modern times.
In the remarks just made by my honourable
friend from Edmonton, when be stressed with
much vigour the necessity of preserving the
identity of any Canadian forces sent abroad,
I find a most eloquent and effective argument in favour of the adoption of a distinctive
flag for Canada. I admire his honesty of
purpose and patriotic sincerity, and I hope
no one will question henceforth the loyalty of
those who wonder at the absence of a true
Canadian standard when our boys are called

54

SENATE

to "tle colours." We have reached a stage
in our history where Canada must assume her
responsibilities in the face of the whole world,
and hence, as my honourable friend states, it
is about time that our soldiers should retain
their identity as a Canadian unit.
There is an old French saying: "Toute
comparaison est odieuse." I think it is particularly applicable in this case. I thought
there was net merely a tacit, but a clearly
expressed understanding, in another place as
well as in this House. that in order more
profitably to discuss the problems now confronting us, it would be better for all concerned
to refer as little as possible to the past. I
remember my honourable friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) putting particular
emphasis on that point. Therefore I do not
think my honourable friend from Edmonton
was well advised when he referred to what
took place in 1899. Without being unduly
disagrecable, may I ask him whether he considers the circumstances surrounding the
present war to be exactly the same as those
that obtained in the South African war? But I
do not press for an answer, merely remarking
that in some cases comparisons are far from
being happy ones. I think my honourable
friend was on firmer ground when he conpared the present status of Canada with that
of other Dominions, but here again I believe
tiat rescrvations sbould be made and emphasized. True, New Zealand, South Africa, and
Australia bave problems of their own to contend with. But it is true also that Canada
has a much larger territory to defend than
have ber sister Dominions.
Now J desire to deal briefly with the
question of enlistment, and I shall be careful
not to antagonize any Lonourabie member's
feelings while se doing. I have considerable
respect for my honourable friend and the
lelibers of tue militry li(rarchv to which

which, if truc, is a challenge to the military
authorities and to the Government of Canada.
I an informed tliat in some places military
officers make recruits sign two different
attestation papers, one to enlist for the defence
of Canada, and the other, the significance of
which is net revealed to them, to enlist for
service abroad. I doubt whether the information is truc, but I give it to this Chamber
for what it is worth. If truc, the facts should
be brought to the attention of competent
authorities.
In my opinion tle lionourable gentlemnan
from Edmonton is taking to much for granted
when lie says that, at the present time, an
expeditionary force is being organized to be
sent to the front. I do not object to the
sending of an expeditionary force overseas, if
absolutely necessary. As honourable members
are aware, I have for the last three years
supported the armament policy presented te
tbe country by the Government. and J voted
in favour of a proclamation declaring that a
state of war exists between Canada and Germany. I arm fully conscious of my responsibility in following this course, and J wish to
be consistent in what I do now. Nevertheless,
I firmly believe that to talk of sending an
expeditionary force overseas right now is as
yet out of the question. We muîst be careful
and take into account general public opinion.
Misapprehension mxust be allayed and legitimate susceptibilities must be rcspiected if we
are to preserve the most vital and essentiai
tling upon wlich Confederation is based, that
is, national unity.
The opinion is expressed that ile feeling
against conscription is limited to the province
of Quebec. I take exception to that view.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I say that Frenchspeaking Canadians living outside of Quebec

there aire 800.000 of ticem-are for

been made in this Clamîber and elsewhere by
Ministers of the Crown responsible for the
varions war neasures which have been sanctioned by Parliament, that the present enli stment is being made primarily, if not exciusively, for the defence of Canada. This
principle should not be lest sight of by recruiting officers.
The honourable member from Edmonton
instanced yesterday the case of a man who enlisted, though he had a wife and a family
of nine children to provide for. The honourable gentleman strongly disapproved of that
particular enlistment, and I think his point
was well taken. May I cite another instance

of Quebec,
anld tat
many E nglishi-speaking Canadians,
whetilier living within the boundaries of that
province or not, are equally opposed to compulsory service. That is my understanding of
the situation, and I claim to bave soie personal knowledge of it. Having spent the first
lialf of my life in the province of Quebec and
tli second balf in Ontario, I claim te speak
with some authority. In discussing this issue
J desire to empbasize the necessity for Canada
to preserve unity of thougbt and action when
the enemy is knocking at the door. In short,
as I said to my honourable friend from Edmonton at the conclusion of one of his speeches
last session, unity rnust precede action.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE.

muost

part opposed

to conscription as strenu-

SEPTEMBER 13, 1939
Frequently we hear on the street some such
reference as the following, to members of
Parliament: "Those fellows up on the Hill
have very comfortable jobs, they are living on
the fat of the land, and instead of showing
some appreciation of the struggles of the
humble people who are earning their livelihood
by the sweat of their brow, those fellows are
ready with a cheer to send away our sons and
daughters to be mowed down in foreign lands.
-Those fellows, without hesitation, vote humdreds of thousands, yes, millions of dollars to
finance a war, but they refuse to set aside
half that amount of money to solve the probWell, honourable
lem of unemployment."
members, I repeat to you what I said to one
of my fellow-citizens a few minutes before I
entered this Chamber: "Yes, we do vote millions to finance a war. But do not think for
a moment that in doing so we do not
appreciate our very heavy responsibility. If
we act quickly, it is because this crisis compels
us to do so."
As to sending with a smile the flower of our
youth to face death on distant battlefields,
I had intended consulting the records of
Parliament and ascertaining the number of
provincial and federal members of Parliament
who did their duty in past wars and are ready
to-day to answer the call of their country. I
am confident the figures would prove very
impressive. In this connection let me offer
the following suggestion. If the voluntary
offer of the father of a family could prevent
the slaughter of the youth of our country and
the destruction of his own sons and daughters,
I would suggest to the Administration that a
special battalion be formed to comprise all
men between the ages of 40 and 50. To prevent any person from questioning my own
sincerity in this matter, I do now solemnly
declare that I would consider it a great honour
and a privilege to be the first man to enlist
in such a battalion. This is no idle talk. It
is an emphatic and sincere reply to what we
hear outside this Parliament, and is made to
maintain the trust of our people in their Government and in their representatives on Parliament Hill. Secondly, this solemn offer is made
in order to preserve unity among the rank
and file of our population, and to sustain their
hope and faith in the future. I trust that
every honourable member of this House will
at least give me credit for sincerity, and will
realize that I am not talking through my hat.
I know that among certain honourable members I have the reputation of holding some
radical views. Well, honourable gentlemen,
this is no time to give undue emphasis to petty
things and, forget the ringing call of duty.

55

In consonance with what I have already
said, I would add this. I am irrevocably
opposed to conscription for service abroad.
Enough volunteers will be found to man our
military machine. Last week three large anticonscription meetings were held in the city of
Montreal, one of which I attended in order
to get first-hand information on this subject.
I am glad to tell you that in spite of the eloquence of the speakers who addressed those
meetings, more than 1,200 young French Canadians in the city of Montreal, without any
coercion, flocked to the ranks of the two local
battalions within that very short period of
time.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I contend, therefore,
that we shall have enough volunteers to
perform the sacred task ahead of us without
having to resort to coercion, which is the
antithesis of the very principles for which we
are fighting.
One more word and I am done, for, after
all, I have to be considerate of my leader and
help to maintain discipline in the ranks.
Since Parliament opened a few days ago we
have been working rapidly, and until now
I have refrained from speaking. I think,
therefore, I should be allowed to express my
views at this stage of proceedings. I just
wish to add this. If ever the Government of
Canada think it opportune to raise an army
of one, two or three hundred thousand men
for the service of our country, the defence of
our coasts or the protection of our institutions
-religious, industrial, social or other-I shall
be the first to applaud and welcome conscription. Here again I have some authority
to speak, for I believe that 1, as one of the
thousands of fathers throughout our land, am
in a position to express the patriotic feelings of
all true sons of Canada; and I repeat,
honourable members, this is not cheap publicity. I believe we should do everything we
can, and give all we have, to defend our country. In this there should be unanimity. But
I am opposed to any policy which advocates
the sacrificing of the last dollar, the last man
and the last drop of our blood in a war on
foreign soil.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend stated that fathers of large families
had been enlisted. Some of those men were
officers in the Militia. I may say that it is
the policy of the Government to see that
single men are called first, and that men with
more than two children are refused. Many
of the men who already have answered the
call have done so because they belong to the

56

SENATE

Militia. The services of those who have large
families will be dispensed with. I have in my
hand a statement from the Department of
Defence which I should have read yesterday.
It is as follows:
I the carr.ving out of enlistments, men without

dependents

are

preferable;

married

men

with four or more dependents should not be
enlisted.
I think an order will go out that men with
more than two children shall not be accepted.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
SALARIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 10, an Act to amend the
Salaries Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill is
consequential upon the one we have just
passed. It allows of emolument or salary
being paid to the Minister of Munitions and
Supply when te is appointed.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With the lave
of the Senate, I move the third reading of
the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
EXCESS PROFITS TAX BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 12, the Excess Profits Tax Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I may inform
the Hoise that His Excellency the Governor
Cneral was notified that we could receive
him at noon. The message announcing his
coming lias not yet been read by His Honour
the Speaker. It was ioped that we could
end our labours around twelve o'clock. If
my right honourable friend tells me that this
Bill, the last one on the Order Paper, is likely
to occupy our attention for more than half
an hour, I shall inform the aide-de-camp in
waiting that His Excellency need not remain.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think discussion of this Bill will and should eccupy
more than balf an tour. I aie not objecting
to a profits tax; in fact, I welcome it, and certainlv it should be introduced now. But there
are features of this Bill which would really
merit and demand discussion in any serions
leoislative body. If there is an officer here
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

from the department who is ready to answer
questions, I wish te would keep this in
mindHon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should like
to ask Mr. Eaton to come to the floor.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If he hears
me, tiat will be enough. I know how the
previous legislation worked. I know how the
principles of capitalization and reserves and
accounting were applied, and should like to
know if there are any differences between ttis
Bill and the previous statute in that respect.
While

on

mîîy feet

may

I

say

this?

It

will be remembered that at the last session
of Parliaient I intimated to the Government
from my seat in this House that a profits
tax was the proper method of taking care of
what the public regard as profiteering. It is
the only sensible way I know. This Bill is
along precisely the right lines. As to the
previous legislation of this kind, it is unfortunate that we did not introduce it earlier.
It would have been better if we had donc so.
In saying this, especially when I remember
the services rendered by Sir Robert Borden, I
do not want the impression to go abroad that
the situation was not fully appreciated. It was.
This country was the first in the world to put
a war profits tax into effect. Just whien it
came I do not recall. It was a considerable
time after the war, but not too late for it
to be said that we were ahead of any other
country in the world.
On this subject of profiteerinîg it has to be
kept in mind that because of economic exigencies of war there is an inevitable rise in prices.
We can tope to control it only on the surface.
The real controlling factors are centred in the
great purchasing countries. Those countries
will not succeed in wholly controlling prices,
but I hope they will do much. It is the law
of business-and you cannot alter it any more
than you can the weather-that the sale price
of goods is determined by replacement cost
and not by the price of raw materials. Consequently. when replacement cost riscs inci-eased profits are made on goods sold. That
condition will last so long as the rise continies. but we miust keep in mind what follows. SuddenlyN replacement cost drops, perhaps
to a point below what it was at whien the rise
began. Every business lias to absorb that
drop. The sale price of goods must always te
based on replacement cost, when this is on the
way down as well as when it is on the way up.
It often happens that the replacement cost of
goods falls far below what manufacturers paid
for raw materials in those goods. Then companies which have failed to keep up their
reserves suffer serious consequences. perhaps go

bankrupt.

SEPTEMBER 13, 1939
I want profits to be as moderate as possible,
but I say that the Government ought to be
guided by experience in this matter. I well
recall that in the last war, towards the close
of the upward march, when profits were above
normal-a good proportion of them being
taken back under the Business Profits War
Tax Act-public concern about profiteering
became so strong that some investigations
were undertaken. Two companies in particular
were pilloried throughout this country, and
their heads were looked upon as enemies of
the State-greedy, utterly despicable citizens.
What happened? When the drop in replacement cost had its full effect upon these
companies, both were "broke."
Neither of
them was able to keep from going into
bankruptcy except by merging with another
company. All the tirades which we heard
throughout the Dominion were nonsense. It
may be that the heads of those companies
sold out and the purchasers had to stand
the crash, but that does not affect the
argument at all.
The Government should not get the idea
that sale prices on a rising market are
determined by the cost of raw materials.
Business cannot be carried on that way.
Replacement cost is the factor which determines whether the sale price shall go up or
down. This fact ought to be kept in mind
whenever there is any attempt by the Government to interfere with the process of business.
You can hardly make a profits tax too high,
so long as you do not stifle enterprise. If you
do that, it is the poorer people of the country
who suffer. It is because enterprise has been
stifled so much that there are so many poor
people suffering to-day.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest
that I be allowed to quote the Minister's
statement, which I think will be a satisfactory
explanation of the Bill. I wonder if we could
not then pass this money Bill, which we
cannot amend and which, I am sure, the
Senate would not reject. If that proposal is
not acceptable I will send word to His
Excellency and the Prime Minister that we
had better set 3 o'clock as the hour for
prorogation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not know
whether we shall be satisfied with the Minister's explanation, and so I cannot say how
long it will take to dispose of the Bill. Let
us go into Committee and have a departmental
representative present, so that we may compare this Bill with the previous Act. I am
concerned about the definitions of capital
and so on.

57

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then I will not
read the Minister's statement. It has gone
out to the public, in explanation of this Bill.
If second reading is given now I will move
that we go into Committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the.
Senate went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Copp in the Chair.
On section 2-definitions:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This is the
important section. I am not a good enough
accountant to know whether it is safe or not,
and therefore I am curious as to how far
its accounting basis differs from that of the
previous Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am told that
the first clause of the definitions is essentially
the same and contains the same principles as
in the previous Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In the previous
Act the profits tax did not hegin where this
one does. Just consider where this one
begins. A profit of 5 per cent is permissible,
but in calculating that 5 per cent you are
not allowed to include as assets certain things
which are as truly assets as anything can be.
Over a period of years you may have built
up a good-will which bas a tremendous value,
but you may take into account only such
good-will as you purchased from someone
else for cash. So in most instances the 5
per cent profit can be calculated upon only
a small capital base, and the profit on the
real capital may be as low as 3 per cent.
From this profit, whether it be 3, 4 or 5 per
cent, there is a deduction of 18 per cent, or
nearly one-fifth, for corporation tax. Even in
cases where the good-will bas been paid forwhich will be fewer than one in fifty-and the
profit on the real capital is 5 per cent, the
net profit after deduction of corporation tax
will be only 4 per cent. I should think that
in the average case the profit on real capital
before deduction of corporation tax would be
3 per cent.
I know there bas to be an excess profits
tax, but I wonder whether the Government
appreciate the points I am making. There is
a danger of going so far that you will get less
money than you would under a scheme allowing more opportunity for business enterprise.

SEPTEMBER 13, 1939
drastie as that which we are proposing, unless
they can see an opportunity of being able to
amortize their costs over a roasonable period.
Special provision therefore will have to be
made for this problem.
I think this covers the interrogation marks
in my right honourable friend's mind. In the
circumstances I would suggest that we pass
the Bill in its present form. We cannot amend
it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: I have no
thought of suggesting that we amond the
Bill. I ar n ft clear as to section il:The provisions of this Act shahl apply to the
profits of the year 1940 and of ail periods ending theroin after the 3lst day of March, 1940.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Supposing the accounting
period ends in April this year, the Act wil]
apply.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: But it applies
"to the profits of the year 1940." That means
the profits of the whole year. Then the section continues, "and of ail periods ending
therein after the 31st of March, 1940." That
is to say, any profit made in 1940 is sure to
be taxed; it does not matter when your
accounting period is. Then any profit made in
an accnunting period ending after the 31st
of March, 1940, will be taxed, even thougli
made in 1939.
Hon. Mr. HIAIG: Surely.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: So this taxation bas been effective since the 3lst of
March hast.
The honourable leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) ealled attention to the
difference between this and the British tax.
The British is a heavy tax on what are distinctly war profits on Government contracts.
The way in which they are identified and
isolatod as war profits is this: the average
earnings ove-r a fixed period of yearîs are taken,
and then anything above that average is
troated as war profits. The British tax applies
to a very limitod class of exceedingly large
contractors, and the amount collectod from
tbemn would be considerable; but in this Bihl
we apply the tax to everybody. I do not
criticize the Government in that respect. I
think we ought to apply the tax to, everybody.
There are industries in this country which will
not make a single thing different fromn what
they have always made, but which will be
benefited by the activities of war purchasing.
They wilI do a great deal more business with
companies engaged in making munitions. In
my judgnient the Guvernment are quite
right in that respect. But I have a question

59

mark as to wbether they are flot going ton far,
in view of the fact they are spreading their
taxation over the whole area and piling it on
top of the present taxation as we have just
increased it. They are going much further
than the Covernmenýt of Great Britain dare go.
Long years of experience have taught that
Goveinment flt to deal any death blows to
business. Business is the life blood of Britain,
and it is by maintaining their business that the
British people are able to fight this war. Let
us tako some account of the example thoy
have set. I ask our Government to review the
effeet of this taxation very carefully. These
txes are terrifie, but so long as we can keep
business going I do not, care. The more we
can tax while still allowing business to keep
going, giving it some reason to opeýrate, the
better; but take care you do not go too far.
-If ynu do you will disarm Canada. We sought
ta get the right set-up in the last war, and I
think we succeeded fairly welI. While we may
be able ta go furthor this time, it is vory easy
ta over-step 'the limit, and then the effeet
would ho pretty bard ta remedy.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn glad ta hear
my rigbt honourable friend express bis views
on this matter. I amn quite sure the Minister
of Finance wilI give thern due regard and koep
bis oye on the whole situation as it developa.
With this legislation wo are broaking new
ground. We shall return bore in January, no
levy will have been made up ta that time, and
thon we shail bo able ta review and, if necessary, rnodify this legislation. In those circurnstances I would ask that we pass this Bill.

I thank you in the name of His Majesty the
Ring for the manner in which you have
responded to the demands of this critical time.
In enacting measures necessary for the defence
of Canada you have perforned a primary
national obligation. In providing voluntarily
for effective co-operation by Canada at the
side of Britain and France in a war to resist
aggression, you have made a momentous decision.
The promptness with which you have acted
affords unmistakable evidence of the ability of
a free people, througlh its representatives in
a free Parlianent, to meet the grave emergencies of war.
Members of the House of Commons:
J thank you for the appropriation you have
made to meet the needs arising from the state
of war.
Honourable Members of the senate:
Menibers

of thei House of Commons:

The people of Canada will, I know, face the
future with calm and resolute courage. The
days of stress and strain, which lie ahead,
cannot fail to prove a supreine test of national
determination and endurance.
In bringing this special war session to its
close, I pray that an all-wise Providence may
guard and guide this land, united in an effort
to do what lies within its power to help defend
and preserve the liberties of mankind.
