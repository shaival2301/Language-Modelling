NEW SENATOR INTRODUCED
The Hon. ihe Speaker having informed the

waiting to be introduced:

hearts of all Canadians. We shall also have
the pleasure of receiving Their Royal Highnesses the Duke of Edinburgh and the Princess
Royal.
During the past year, I have visited several
provinces and made an extensive trip to the
Northwest Territories. The great North
brought home to me the vastness, the far
horizons and the beauty of our country. Flying
over it, I thought of the wonderful heritage
which Providence has entrusted to us. May we
be worthy of this stewardship.
While the world outlook contains elements
of continuing danger, there are some grounds
for cautious optimism. Major military conflicts
have been avoided and the processes of conciliation and negotiation are in progress or in
prospect on many of the important international issues. The Canadian Government remains devoted to peace as its primary objective.

Recurrent Soviet pressure on Berlin makes
it necessary for the Governments of the North
Atlantic Alliance to reconcile the preservation
of essential rights and interests with a constant readiness to discuss and enter into equitable and safeguarded engagements. My Government has consistently worked towards that
end, and approves the resumption of preliminary talks with the U.S.S.R., the success of
which will depend on Soviet good faith.
In other areas of tension, Canada has been
prominent in international efforts to relieve
political, economic and administrative strains
which have sometimes accompanied the transition from dependent to independent status of
new nations. International peace-keeping arrangements continue to warrant effective
Canadian support.
International agreements on measures of
controlled disarmament remain vitally necessary if the world is to be freed permanently
from the menace of war. As a member of
the expanded disarmament committee recently
reconstituted, my Government supports the
decision to resume disarmament negotiations
in March.
The Commonwealth continues to grow as an
important instrument for freedom and peace,
linking five continents and people of many
races. The strengthening of this association is
a primary objective of my Government. During 1961, Canada joined in welcoming Cyprus,
Sierra Leone and Tanganyika to full membership in the Commonwealth.
My Government derives particular satisfaction from the endorsement by the United
Nations of a World Food Program sponsored
by Canada, for which you will be asked to
authorize a contribution.
You will also be asked to appropriate funds
to maintain Canada's external aid program.

Canada's diplomatic representation has been
expanded in the Commonwealth, in the
French-speaking countries of Africa, and as
well in Latin America and in Asia.
While striving to reduce international tensions and promote the peaceful settlement of
international disputes, my Government still
considers it necessary to provide the support
required to strengthen and maintain the defence forces necessary to continue an active
role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Important negotiations are now under way
between the British Government and the
European Economic Community following the
decision of Britain to ascertain whether terms
can be negotiated on which it might become
a member of that Community. My ministers
are following these negotiations carefully, having in mind that their outcome should give
full recognition of the vital interests of the
Commonwealth and to Canada's position and
interests as a major trading nation.
My Government in recent international
meetings has reiterated its support for the
expansion of world trade on a multilateral
non-discriminatory basis and it readiness to
play a constructive role in the promotion of
world trade. It stands ready to work with
other countries in the pursuit of this goal.
My Government plans to recommend to you
a number of measures that will constitute
further steps in working out the purposes of
Confederation and identifying more clearly
the Canadian nationality in various aspects of
public and business affairs. With this purpose
in mind, you will be asked to give effect,
with modifications, to the recommendations of
the Royal Commission on Publications.
By means of conferences with representatives of provincial Governments, progress has
been made toward agreement on a means of
amending our constitution in Canada, which
would be the final step to bring our formal
legal position into line with reality. A formula
to accomplish this purpose has been sent to
provincial Governments for their consideration.
Legislation will be proposed to require reports to be submitted by business and labour
organizations concerning the extent and nature
of their operations and whether, and to what
extent, they may be owned or controlled outside Canada.
A measure relating to the Senate will be
placed before you.
My Government will ask you to take steps
to ensure that the forthcoming redistribution
of electoral districts is made in an equitable
manner upon an objective basis. To this end
you will be asked to approve for the first time

JANUARY 18, 1962
in our history a measure to create an independent commission to recommend the
changes required in the electoral districts as
a result of the decennial census.
Comprehensive measures to put into effect
my Government's economic policies were enacted in preceding sessions of this Parliament.
The benefits flowing from these policies are
now evident in record levels of employment,
of production, and of export trade. There has
been a substantial improvement since last year
in the unemployment situation. As the result
of the efforts of my Government through its
municipal winter works incentive program,
notable progress has been made in meeting the
recurrent problem of seasonal unemployment.
The Government has already announced its
intention of asking you to approve another
and larger program of assistance to municipalities for winter works projects.
Further measures to stimulate economic
activity and promote national development
will be placed before you this session. One of
these will be the construction of a railway in
the Gaspe Peninsula from Matane to Ste.
Anne des Monts. Another will be the construction of a floodway and other works to
conserve and control the waters of the Red
and Assiniboine Rivers in Manitoba, for which
agreement has now been reached with the
Province regarding the division of costs.
Other measures which will help to enlarge
employment by stimulating economic activity
will include a bill to increase the total amount
of financing of exports which can be undertaken by the Export Credits Insurance Corporation and an amendment to broaden the
scope of the Small Businesses Loans Act.
The success of the recent "Resources for
Tomorrow" Conference demonstrated the
benefits of co-operation between governments
in this field. My Government, in consultation
with the Governments of the ten provinces, is
examining suggestions made at that Conference for co-operative measures to encourage
the wise management and multiple use of
Canada's natural resources.
The provision of low-cost electric power
is one of the most important factors in the
economic growth and industrial development
of Canada. As a further step in the national
development policy, my Prime Minister has
invited the provincial Governments to join
with the federal Government in early discussions of the steps that might be taken toward the establishment of long-distance power
transmission to link provinces and eventually
the different regions of Canada.
You will be asked to provide for an expanded program of encouragement to scientific research by industry in Canada.
A bill will be placed before you intended to
enable Canada to participate effectively in
26211-3-11

arrangements for reinforcing the International
Monetary Fund when additional resources are
required to maintain stability in exchange
markets in the face of substantial capital
movements.
The maintenance of fair prices for farm
and fishery products also continues to be
a matter of prime concern to my Government
and you will be asked to provide the funds
necessary to sustain the price stabilization
policy. My ministers have achieved a gratifying success in finding markets for grain and
thereby reducing surplus stocks. The drought
in the Prairie provinces during 1961 has
resulted in severe losses, however, and you
will be asked to provide assistance by means
of acreage payments to the farmers who have
been affected. Legislation will also be proposed to extend the period of application of
the Farm Improvement Loans Act and the
Fisheries Improvement Loans Act.
Important measures in the field of social
welfare will also be proposed at this session.
Your approval will be requested for an increase in the amount of the universal old age
pension payable under the Old Age Security
Act, and also for legislation to increase the
amount to which the federal Government will
contribute under the Old Age Assistance Act,
the Blind Persons Act and the Disabled Persons Act. After the concurrence of the provinces for the necesary amendment to section
94A of the British North America Act has
been secured, Parliament will be asked to
approve a constitutional amendment in order
to permit the introduction of a contributory
system of old age pensions and related survivors' and disability benefits which will be
in addition to the existing old age pension
legislation and will take into account private
pension arrangements and the need for legislation concerning portability of pension
rights.
You will be asked to authorize the establishment of a national Council of Welfare similar
to the Council of Health which has had a long
record of usefulness.
You will be asked to approve an amendment to the Civilian War Pensions and Allowances Act to authorize the payment of allowances under specified conditions to merchant
seamen, fire-fighters, foresters, members of
voluntary aid detachments and certain other
civilians whose war services overseas have
been recognized in other respects. Other
amending bills will provide for increased
allowances and other improvements in the
Children of War Dead (Education Assistance)
Act and also for the extension of the effective
period of the War Services Grants Act and
the Veterans Insurance Act and for the
extension of the qualifying period under the
Veterans Land Act.

SENATE
My Government will also ask you to appropriate moneys required in the Unemployment
Insurance Fund to safeguard the rights of
workers until the report of the special committee inquiring into the unemployment insurance program has been received and can be
acted upon.
You will be asked to increase the federal
grants to universities and make suitable provision in those cases where alternative arrangements are made for supplementary provincial grants in lieu of federal grants.
My Government is initiating negotiations
with the provincial and municipal authorities
with a view to removing the tolls on the
Victoria and Jacques Cartier bridges in Montreal; should these be successful you will be
asked to approve legislation for this purpose.
You will be asked to authorize the institution of an automobile ferry service between
North Sydney, Nova Scotia, and Argentia,
Newfoundland, and to provide for the construction of the necessary vessel and docks.
Other measures will be introduced to amend
the Broadcasting Act, the Canada Shipping
Act, the Canadian National Railways Capital
Revision Act, the Bankruptcy Act and a number of other statutes. You will be asked to
approve the ratification of the Universal Copyright Convention.

THE LATE SENATORS LEGER AND
GOLDING
TRIBUTES

Hon. Walter M. Aseltine: Honourable senators, it is my sad duty at this time to report
that since prorogation took place last September two prominent; members of the Senate
have passed to the Great Beyond, namely,
the Honourable Senator Aurel D. Léger and
the Honourable Senator William H. Golding.
I would like to refer briefiy to each of these
deceased colleagues.
Senator Aurel D. Léger, I arn informed,
died on December 28 last. He was a resident
of Kent County, in the province of New
Brunswick. He had been a prominent member of the Senate of Canada for eight years
prior to his death, and before being summoned to the Senate he had been a member
of the House of Commons for some thirteen
years. Before his election to the House of
Commons he played a very prominent part in
the public 11f e of that section of New Brunswick in wbicb. be resided. He was very faithful in his attendance here in the Senate and
was a valuable member of several of its
standing committees.
The late Senator Léger will be sorely
missed by his many friends and colleagues,
and I take this opportunity of extending to
bis widow and the members of his f amrily
our sincere regrets and deepest sympathy.
I wisb now to refer to the late Senator
William H. Golding. Senator Golding's deatb
was a great shock to me because at Christmastime I had received a short letter from him
in which he referred to the coming session of
Parliament and stated that he expected to be
in attendance as usual. I received another
letter from hlm written on December 30. This
letter, which arrived after hie died, was
written in his own firm, legible handwriting,
and in it he congratulated me on my having
been made a member of Her Majesty's Canadian Privy Coundil.
As I have said, that letter did not reach
me until a f ew days after bis death. I can
hardly believe, bonourable senators, that he
is no longer witb us, and I shall always
treasure these two letters that he wrote to
me just shortly before be passed away.
As we ail know, the late Senator Golding
spent a great many years in the public life

of Canada, commencing as far back as 1916,
when he became a member of the Seaforth
Town Council. In 1921 he became Mayor of
Seaforth, and held that position for nine
years. In 1924 he was responsible for the
establishment of the Scott Memorial Hospital,
and took a great interest in bospital work of
all kinds. He was that hospital's first chairman. Later he was also chairman of the
local Public Utility Comrmission.
Quite naturally, it seems to me, when in
1932 there was a vacancy in the South Huron
riding which bad to be filled he was chosen
as standard bearer. He was elected on that
occasion and continued as Liberal member
of Parliament until 1949. In Parliament he
was beld in great esteem, and filled many
important posts. He was chairman of the
party caucus and was also deputy chairman
of the Committees of the Whole House.
In 1949 the late William Golding was summoned to the Senate, and I remember quite
well that bis first task in this bouse gave
him the honour of moving the adoption of
the address in reply to the Speech from the
Tbrone. That was on February 21, 1950.
From that time forward he was on record as
being one of our most faitbful honourable
senators and was noted for always being in
bis place, eitber in the Senate chamber or
ia one of the committees of wbich be was a
member.
He was a member of several important
standing committees to which he brougbt a
wealth of experience and wisdom.
As honourable senators know it bas been
my great privilege and pleasure to bave
known the late senator most intimately ever
since be became a member of tbe Senate,
and even before that time bie was a very
close, dear, personal friend to me. I valued
bis friendship most highly.
For years be sat at my rigbt at the meetings of the Standing Committee on Divorce.
He was blessed with a very bigb degree of
good, sound common sense. He had bis feet
firmly on the ground, and was always present
wben be was most wanted. I, as chairman of
that committee for some time, valued bis
advice and co-operation very much.
Senator Golding was a fine Christian
gentleman, beloved by ail with wbom he
came in contact. He will be genuinely
mourned on Parliament Hill where he was
a famîliar figure for almost tbirty years, and
wbere he was a most outstanding and painstaking parliamentarian.
To bis f amily of two sons and three
daugbters I wisb to express our deep sympatby for the loss of a good father and a
distinguished Canadian.

SENATE
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, when Parliament was prorogued in
September last little did we think that our
honourable colleague, Aurel D. Léger, would
not be with us today. We had known for
some years of his uncertain health, but we
did not realize that he was so critically ill.
The announcement of his passing at the
comparatively early age of 67 years was
indeed unexpected.
Senator Léger was elected to the House
of Commons in 1940, at which time I was
also a member of that house. We continued
our membership there together until 1953
when both of us were summoned to the
Senate. Accordingly, we had, and continued
to have, many interests in common, and in
the light of our mutual experiences we frequently discussed the problems which arose
from time to time in this chamber, and I
never hesitated to look to him for advice.
Having followed his career for thirteen years
in the House of Commons and knowing
something of his devotion to and his untiring,
unselfish efforts on behalf of his constituents,
I attached great weight to his opinions.
During the last few years, notwithstanding
his failing health, his interest in the work
of the Senate never slackened, and when
his health permitted he was always to be
found in his place, so devoted was he to
his duty. During these last years it was a
source of deep regret to him that his physical
condition prevented him from taking a more
active part in our proceedings but never did
he shirk any duty which he was able to
perform. Those of us who were close to him
and had been associated with him over the
years can say of him that he was a faithful
friend and at all times loyal to the high
ideals which motivated his life.
His passing will be a great loss to his
loving wife and family, and I join with the
honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) in extending to them our deep
sympathy.
May I now refer to our late colleague,
the Honourable William Henry Golding, more
familiarly known to us as Bill. He had not
been well for some time but that was never
obvious from any lack of devotion to his
duties. Indeed, no senator has had a finer
record of attendance and helpful, constructive
participation in the work of the Senate than
had our dearly beloved deceased member. To
the end of his distinguished career, even when
his health was rapidly deteriorating, he continued, without a word of complaint, dedicated to his parliamentary duties.
It was my privilege to become acquainted
with Senator Golding when I was elected to
the House of Commons in 1935. He was then

a member of that house. Our friendship increased over the years. It was also my good
fortune that in 1945, when I was elected
Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons,
he was elected Deputy Chairman of Committees of the Whole House. Though he had
no legal training, he had had an unusually
long term of office as mayor of the town of
Seaforth, Ontario, and his experience in that
office stood him in good stead in his more
important office in the House of Commons.
Indeed, he soon had a grasp of the rules
of that house equal to that of any lawyer
who has held that very responsible position.
Over and above the letter of the law, he put
a lot of good common sense into his rulings,
which won the approval of members on
both sides of the house. After coming to the
Senate he continued to take a keen interest
in the rules and in the proceedings of this
chamber, and from time to time he was
unanimously elected as Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House.
In debate Senator Golding's words caught
and deserved the closest attention and respect from both sides of the house. This,
and his unanimous choice as Chairman of
the Committee of the Whole, is perhaps the
most sincere form of recognition that a
member can achieve, and Senator Golding
enjoyed it in full measure. We have indeed
lost a true friend, and Canada has lost a
great statesman and dedicated public servant.
On different occasions the late senator
spoke to me of the members of his family
and of his deep interest in their well-being.
From what he said I know that their love
and devotion to him were indeed equalled
by his love and devotion to them. Honourable
senators, I join with the members of this
chamber in extending to them our deep
sympathy.
(Translation):
Hon. Clarence J. Venio: Honourable senators, as dean of the Acadian representatives
in this house, I would like to add a few brief
remarks to the tribute just rendered to our
late colleague, the Honourable Senator Léger.
I had the opportunity to know him better
than anyone in this house, because we occupied the same office in the House of Commons during the first five years following
his election as the member for Kent, in New
Brunswick. During that time, I had in our
daily relations many opportunities of appreciating the true value of this gentleman whose
behaviour was always unassuming. It is often
said that the actions of a man always count
more than his words, and, though our colleague may not have been a great speaker,
I owe this tribute to his memory that he

JANUARY 23, 1962
was a relentless worker, a conscientious
representative who was, to the highest degree, devoted to those who delegated him
to Parliament as their spokesman, as well as
to his province and to the whole Acadian
people.
I could not characterize him better than
by quoting a few lines relating to him which
were published in the Moncton Evangeline,
which is the Acadian national paper, on the
morrow of his demise, and I quote:
"Senator Léger was a man who did
not make much noise, but he actively
looked after the interests of his
he was a member
county. When
of Parliament, he dealt with all the
problems submitted by his voters.
He was a man of great dignity who
had only friends, even among those who
were his political opponents.
He had taken an active interest in
all the various aspects of the Acadian
cause and had been the spokesman in
Ottawa of the whole Acadian people
not in resounding speeches, but through
his discreet and constant efforts."
I wholeheartedly subscribe to the fine tribute paid to him. The large number of people
who attended his funeral bear high witness
to the great popularity which he enjoyed in
his constituency.
We shall keep fond memories of him, and
I join with my colleagues in this house
in conveying to his family the expression of
our deepest sympathy.
(Text):
Honourable senators, there is little I can
add to what has already been said concerning
the regrettable death of our colleague, the
Honourable William Golding. However, I take
this occasion to say a few words in appreciation of the kindness and the friendship with
which he honoured me since I entered the
House of Commons a quarter of a century
ago. In fact, he was one of the first members
of that body to extend to me a warm welcome, a welcome which he said was addressed
to the son of one of his former esteemed colleagues and friends. His kindly advice to me
in those early days and his friendly guidance
on ever so many occasions later were of great
assistance to me in learning the highways
and byways of law-making in Parliament.
His sudden departure was a great shock and
a source of deep regret to me, and I join the
previous speakers in expressing deepest sympathy to the members of his bereaved family.
Hon. William B. Bruni: Honourable senators, I rise at this time to join my colleagues
in paying a well-deserved tribute to the
memory of a very fine man, namely, William

Henry Golding, who passed away at the Scott
Memorial Hospital, at Seaforth, Ontario, at
the close of last year.
The late Senator Golding was a life-long
resident of Huron County. He was first elected
to the House of Commons in a by-election
held during the year 1932, and was re-elected
at the general elections held in 1935, 1940
and 1945. While a member of the House of
Commons be served as the Deputy Chairman of Committees of the Whole House, a
position which he held on June 25, 1949,
when be was summoned to the Senate. While
a member of this honourable body be served
as a prominent member on the following
standing committees: Banking and Commerce, Finance, Public Health and Welfare,
and Divorce. I have been told that he took
a rather more active part in the debates in
the Senate than he did in the debates of the
other place, which is understandable. The
late Senator Golding was of such a temperament that it was always a pleasure for him
to make his worthwhile contribution to the
debates held in this chamber. His contribution was always made in a very quiet, but
most efficient manner.
I have mentioned the committees on which
the late Senator Golding served, and I know
from personal knowledge that on each of
these committees he made a worthwhile and
worthy contribution to their deliberations.
We in this chamber knew him as a solid,
honest and highly competent member whose
words deserved and received the closest attention and respect from both sides of the
aisle. This to me is the most sincere form
of recognition that a member can achieve
in this chamber, and Bill Golding enjoyed
it in full measure.
In his death, Canada has lost a true gentleman, who quietly carried on with his good
works in a most efficient and effective way.
The passing of our true friend and beloved
colleague leaves a great void in our midst.
He will be missed by ail of us. I tender
my profound and heartfelt sympathy to
his two sons and three daughters who survive him, and I join them and his many,
many friends in mourning his passing.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I have the honour to join others in the
tribute that has been paid to my old friend
and colleague, Senator Léger, whose passing
I deeply regret; but naturally my mind turns
to that of the loss this chamber bas sustained
in the death of Senator Golding, from my
own province, a colleague respected in both
houses, and more recently a colleague on the
committee of which I have the honour to be
chairman. I feel that I can speak on behalf
of all the members of the Standing Committee

SENATE
on Divorce, of which he was a highly valued
member. I say also with confidence that the
first thoughts of all of us are of sympathy for
the members of his family, sympathy for
them in the loss of a kind and loving father
and a distinguished member of their family
circle. The children of Senator Golding must
have been proud of his great career. They
must have recognized the sterling worth of
his character and the strength which he exhibited on all occasions.
I knew Senator Golding for many, many
years. I had the honour to be his principal
speaker at one of the chief assemblies of his
campaign as long ago as 1932, and I knew
him intimately and admired him ever since.
He was successful in that campaign and in
others which followed, particularly in that of
1935. In 1940 I followed him to the Commons,
where I found him to be, as he deserved to be,
a prominent member, enjoying the confidence of the whole house, as was illustrated
in the fact that he was chairman over and
over again of the committees of the whole.
He had the confidence of the Government of
that day, I know very well, and was respected
by all his colleagues in that house. I came to
the Senate in 1945 and he followed me in
1949, and as a member of this house he at
once achieved an ascendancy because of the
confidence which he inspired. His honesty of
thought, his clearness of expression, his genuine worth of character endeared him to us
all and we hung upon his words.
I became chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Divorce in 1954. He was
already a valued member of that committee,
as the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) has mentioned. It
is the most exacting and burdensome committee of the Senate and he was number one
in attendance. There were other members
who occasionally had as good a record of
attendance but never anyone better. But that
was not all. He was not only a faithful
attendant, he was a devoted and dedicated
member of that committee, assisting in its administration of justice, and was always ready
with a kindly word. We will miss him greatly
in that committee, not only for his contribution to the work, but his very presence
will be sadly missed. I am sure that when we
hold our initial meeting tomorrow morning
his vacant chair will be a sad sight.
I can add little to what has been said of the
general facts. It is not necessary to say more.
But I do say to his family that Canada
has lost a faithful and valued public servant. His family loses a kind and loving father
and we of the Senate have lost a tried, true
and loyal friend.

Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourable senators, I can add little to what bas been said,
and so well said, by the preceding speakers
in tribute to our late senator colleague, William H. Golding. They have expressed the
feelings of us all with respect to him. My
only words are, and I am sure you will all
agree with me, that this chamber is poorer
on account of the death of Senator Golding.
I would just like to add a few words to
what my colleague from Gloucester (Hon. Mr.
Veniot) has said about the loss we in New
Brunswick have sustained through the death
of Senator Léger, because be was a very
faithful representative of his province and had
its interest and that of his constituency always
before him.
I always admired his courage. He put up
a brave front here year after year in his
struggle for health, because be was afflicted
and handicapped, and it was a hard battle to
keep going and be on hand for the sittings
of the Senate and to take his place in committees. When I would meet him in the corridor I tried to appreciate what be had to
contend with, the battle be was waging, and
I always had the greatest admiration for his
courage.
Others have sketched the career of the late
senator, his faithful representation in the
House of Commons, and, as we all know, in
this chamber he was a very valued member.
He was a student of parliamentary procedure
and practice and was quite conversant with all
the rules of order. Along with Senator Taylor
(Westmorland) and Senator Savoie I attended
the funeral. The large congregation that assembled to pay tribute to him, which included
many from distant points, I felt was a silent
but most eloquent testimonial to the very
high esteem in which Senator Léger was held.
Hon. John G. Higgins: Honourable senators,
I crave the indulgence of this assembly for a
few minutes to pay tribute to one who in recent days was my guide, philosopher and
friend.
A short time ago there departed from our
midst one who had graced both Houses of
Parliament, but his memory will ever remain in the hearts of those who knew, respected and admired him. To him is given the
eternal reward of a life well spent. To his
friends are left the aching pause, the awful
blank. We mourn the goodness gone from
earth.
It is right and proper that we pay tribute to
Senator Golding. It is a sad duty but it is also
a pleasant one to be able to pay respect to
him who deserves it. Let us praise good men
who are no longer with us, for they earned
praise in life and they deserve remembrance
in death.

JANUARY 23, 1962
As a citizen he was a man without fear or
reproach. He played a big part in the life of
this country. He was a leader in many matters pertaining to the welfare of Canada. For
instance, he was mayor of his home town, Seaforth, for a considerable time and I am told
that, through him, the citizens built a local
hospital of which he became chairman and
which he ran for many years without calling
on government or municipality for aid.
He had many years of service in the other
bouse and he played no small part there. I
remember one time seeing a friend of mine,
a former Cabinet minister, of different political affiliation, talking to Senator Golding.
Later I said to the former minister, "I saw
you talking to my friend Senator Golding",
and be replied, "Yes, John, and he is a fine
gentleman, an able man. I was in Parliament
with him for many years and we became
great friends. He was Chairman of Committees of the Whole on different occasions
and he handled that office in a most admirable
way; he is a man of great capability and a
thorough gentleman."
Although of an easy-going disposition and
an even temper, disliking turmoil and roughness, I think Senator Golding could be aroused
when the occasion demanded action, and I
am sure be was never found wanting when
public spirit was needed. He seemed to me to
be a man who could show an indomitable will
and a strength of purpose. His experience in
the art of politics must have been profound.
We can remember an occasion in this Senate
chamber not so long ago when he ended a
debate by giving us a short lecture on ways
and means, which finished the discussion.
Although he had long passed the scriptural
term of years, he kept his faculties to the last.
To the end his memory was as retentive as
ever, his voice was undisturbed, and his mind
was ever alert. He spent many years in the
Senate. In the short time in which I served
here I can speak from firsthand knowledge
that be was one of the most important senators and, from what I have heard from others,
he was always a great asset in the deliberations of the Senate and its various committees. After all, he came to the Senate with
long and broad experience in the other house.
How often have I gone to his Senate
room to obtain some information on a particular subject, to be enlightened on some
point of political view, or on some piece of
history, and never was I disappointed. He
had great knowledge of political issues of
the past, of important historical events, and
of outstanding characters who had made an
impression on the pages of Canadian history.
I was not the only one to profit thereby.
I know that many others had gone to him
looking for advice and information, and what
26211-3-2

be told could be safely accepted, for he was
a man without guile or prejudice. It was
pleasant being in his company at all times,
because be possessed that characteristic which
makes all other traits so attractive, kindliness
of heart, and be had that in abundance.
Senator Golding was deeply religious. I
am sure that the Sermon on the Mount
appealed to him and that the Ten Commandments ruled his judgment and guided his
actions. He had an abiding faith. He was a
humble man. He held, to a rare degree, that
noblest of all virtues and the one most
sparsely practised in this commercial, selfadvertising age-he was the apotheosis of
humility. He was ever charitable in his estimate of others, and be always paid respect
to opinions that might have differed from
his own. The success of others never aroused
any jealousy or antagonism in him, and envy
could find no place in a nature that was
so soft, placid and honourable.
It was my lot to have known him but a
short time, just for the three years I have
served in the Senate, but that was long
enough for me to evaluate the sterling character of the man, with his unselfishness, his
charity, his beneficence, his probity and his
unbounded humility. Al of us can feel and
say:
He was a man, take him, for all in all
We shall not look upon his like again.
I did not know the Honourable Mr. Léger,
except in a very small way. He was a quiet
gentleman, but was very attentive to his
Senate duties. There are many who can
speak in a fuller way about him than I.
Honourable senators, now that both these
gentlemen have departed to the eternal
bourne, I offer my deepest sympathy to their
families and I express the kindest and most
charitable wish that anyone could express
about the dead: May the Lord have mercy
on their souls and may perpetual light shine
upon them.
Hon. George H. Barbour: Honourable senators, I would be very remiss in my duties
were I not to say a word, because I stand by
one of the vacant chairs in this chamber.
It was my good fortune to be appointed to
the Senate at the same time as the Honourable
Mr. Golding, and he had been my deskmate
since then. Our rooms were on the same floor,
and to go to my door I had to pass his. The
last three or four years had been very trying
for Senator Golding. His wife was an invalid
for two or three years and passed away some
two years ago. During the last two years,
due to the absence because of illness of the
honourable senator from Algoma (Hon. Mr.
Farquhar), Senator Golding was alone in the
room which they shared.

SENATE
Senator Golding set a very rigid, daily
routine for himself. At 7.20 in the morning
he could be seen arriving at this building,
and he stayed here until 9.30 at night. He
did this one day after another. It was rather
a killing pace, but that was the way he
wanted to conduct his life. If I did not look
in at his door and say "Good morning",
when I saw him the next morning he would
say, "You did not call in yesterday." So I
made a point of going into his room and
having a word or two with him. I had many
conversations with him, and although I knew
him perhaps not nearly as long as many
honourable senators, I think I knew him as
well as most.
In his youth he decided on a certain course
of conduct that he intended to follow. It is
one thing to have knowledge, to know what
one should do, but it is an entirely different
thing to have the wisdom at all times to
follow that course. His line was no crooked
one; he followed it to the letter. He knew
when he got up each morning where he was
going and what he was going to do. He was
of an independent nature. He was so independent that he refused to take the pension
until he was over 80 years of age, and then
only after his daughter obtained the necessary papers and got him to sign them. Until
then he was perfectly content to get along
without a pension.
Senator Golding was a machinist by trade,
and he was a success in that occupation. The
Leader of the Government has told us about
the various activities which he pursued. He
was chairman of the Scott Memorial Hospital
at Seaforth for 20 years. When he retired
from that position the hospital had $18,000 in
bonds after meeting expenses.
He felt that one should have enough money
on which to live and pay his bills, but beyond
that he was not too much interested in money.
He told me on one occasion, "When you
come to the end of your life if you have not
a good character you go out of this life
empty handed and take nothing into the next
world." That is the standard by which Senator Golding lived.
I had letters from him to the same effect
as those which the Leader of the Government
received. I received one from him on November 1. At that time he was quite sick. He
wrote that he was living from day to day
and was fully prepared for whatever might
happen. I received another long letter which
he had written on December 28, in his own
handwriting, and in it he said that he hoped
to meet us here when Parliament met.
Senator Golding left what he wanted to
leave, an honourable name to his family. This
house is much poorer for the loss that we

have sustained, and I am sure that I am
joined by every honourable senator in extending sincere sympathy to his family.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliol: Honourable
senators, I hesitate to rise, having listened
to such fine tributes given in such a large
number to our deceased colleagues. In spite
of their proverbial modesty, both of them
had similar qualities. They had wisdom;
they had broadmindedness; they had loyalty
to their friends; and they had all the qualities
that are to be expected from public men.
They were men with a very high sense of
duty. Very often I sought the advice of Senator Golding when I did not know exactly
what course to follow. I relied on him.
What will not surprise honourable senators
is that all of the good things that have been
said about both of our lamented colleagues
was said by them, during their lifetime,
about all of us.
I wrote to the family of Senator Golding,
after having heard of his departure, and
one of his daughters replied as follows:
Dad talked so much about his friends
in the Senate and in Ottawa that I feel
I have known most of them all my life,
even though I have not met them personally. I know Dad valued your friendship over these many years that you
have been together in Parliament.
That is a tribute that honours all of us.
Both Senator Léger and Senator Golding
were the salt of the earth. We shall miss
them in this chamber. We shall miss them in
the committees where they sat and where
they demonstrated their experience and good
judgment. We will remember them as good
friends and good citizens.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt: Honourable senators, may another Quebec member express
his condolences to the families of our two
colleagues who left us since the last session.
They have both passed on. They are no longer
among us, but their memory will endure.
It seems to me that two things could be
learned from the lives of both those late
colleagues: Senator Leger, always gentle,
quiet, but true to his duties, seems to have
always lived according to the saying that:
good seldom comes from noise and is almost
always done without noise. He was a steadfast worker.
Senator Golding, while he was not a
lawyer, always made relevant remarks. I
always wondered how he could remember
such relevant comments. One day I asked
him and he replied: "I lived among the
people, and you know that the ordinary people

JANUARY 23, 1962
teach us many good things". And the great
popularity of Senator Golding was due to his
calm and kind character; at eighty, he remained quite a young man.
To the families of both deceased members,
I offer my deepest condolences.
(Text):
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, in remembrance of, and as a final tribute to, our esteemed colleagues who have
passed away I would ask honourable senators
to rise in their places for a few moments of
silence and prayer.
Honourable senators stood in silence.

been tabled in the form of appendix D to
the Report on Copyright, dated August 1,
1957, by the Royal Commission on Patents.
Copyright, Trade Marks and Industrial Designs, which was tabled in the Senate on
June 11, 1958. This document is quite lengthy.
I am not asking that it be printed in the Debates of the Senate because the Secretary of
State has some 500 copies, and I understand
a copy will be made available to each honourable senator who wishes to have one. That
is all I need to say on the subject at this time.
The Hon. the Speaker: It would not be
practical to have it printed in Hansard anyway.
DIVORCE
REPORT OF COMMITTEE OF SELECTION
ADOPTED

Hon. George S. White, Chairman of the
Committee of Selection, presented the committee's first report:
The Committee of Selection, appointed
to nominate senators to serve on the
several standing committees for the present session, make their first report, as
follows:
Your committee have the honour to
submit herewith the list of senators
selected by them to serve on the Standing Committee on Divorce, namely:
The Honourable Senators *Aseltine,
Baird, Barbour, Blois, Bradley, Burchili,
Cameron, Croll, Farris, Gershaw, Gladstone, Hnatyshyn, Hollett, Horner, Inman,
Irvine, Isnor, Kinley, Lambert, *Macdonald (Brantford), Roebuck, Smith
(Queens-Shelburne), Taylor (Westmorland) and Thorvaldson. (22)
*Ex officio members.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. White: With leave of the Senate,
I move that the report be adopted now.
Report adopted.
APPOINTMENT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Aseltine, with leave of the Senate,

committee that has just been nominated will
meet tomorrow morning at 10.30 in the usual
Senate Divorce Committee premises, and I
trust that all members will be present on that
occasion, for our purpose in meeting will be
to organize for the duties that are to come.
I should like to take this opportunity to
express a welcome to the new members of the
Standing Committee on Divorce who will be
serving for the first time on what I have already described this evening as the heaviest
and the most exacting committee of this house.
It may interest my fellow members to know
that there are already lodged with the officials
of the Senate as many as 400 petitions of divorce. Those will be added to, of course, as
we go on, and so I think we may anticipate
one of the most demanding sessions in this
regard we have ever had.
Hon. Mr. Farris: How many petitions did
you have last year?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We handled about 350
or a little more. This year we will probably
hear as many as 500 cases. It will be a real
burden on those who have generously accepted
service on this committee.
I personally feel grateful to those whom
I have asked to join the committee in its
labours, for without any particular desire to
serve on the committee they have felt it their
duty to accept the task and ta join us. It
may not be quite as bad as it sounds, for we
meet in the mornings and transact the business, and there is a certain camaraderie
among us that is highly delightful. There is
a certain enjoyment in the work, not the work
itself particularly but the associations that go
with it, and the satisfaction that one feels in
doing a service of this kind which brings
little acclaim to the members but which is a
duty we must perform. So I congratulate
those who have come with us this session for
the first time, and I wish to express gratitude
also to those who have served in the past
and who are not on this list today. I can
assure those who have been on this committee
that their work has not been in vain and has
not been unappreciated. I look forward to
meeting the members of the committee tomorrow morning at 10.30 in the usual place.
Motion agreed to.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
His Excellency the Governor General's speech
at the opening of the session.

(Translation):
Hon. Léon Méthoi moved, seconded by
Hon. Malcolm Hollett:
That the following Address be presented to His Excellency the Governor
General to offer the humble thanks of
this house to His Excellency for the
gracious speech which he has been
pleased to make to both Houses of Parliament, namely:
To His Excellency Major-General
Georges P. Vanier, Companion of the
Distinguished Service Order upon whom
has been conferred the Military Cross
and the Canadian Forces Decoration,
Governor General and Commander-inChief of Canada.
May it please Your Excellency:
We, Her Majesty's most dutiful and
loyal subjects, the Senate of Canada, in
Parliament assembled, beg leave to offer
our humble thanks to Your Excellency
for the gracious speech which Your
DIVORCE
Excellency has addressed to both Houses
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ADOPTED
of Parliament.
He said: Honourable senators, in rising to
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Divorce, presented move the address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne, and before discussing the motion
the committee's first report:

JANUARY 24, 1962
just read, may I point out two recent happenings which first of all constitute official recognition for the many services rendered by one
of our most prominent colleagues, while at
the same time enhancing the prestige of this
honourable chamber.
(Text):
The Honourable Walter M. Aseltine, Leader
of the Government in the Senate, has been
appointed a member of the Queen's Privy
Council for Canada. I am sure that all the
members of this honourable house share my
view when I say that this is a reward well
deserved by him and an honour that reflects
on the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It has been too long
delayed.
Hon. Mr. Méthot: May I be permitted to
offer to this honourable gentleman our most
sincere congratulations and best wishes.
(Translation):
To begin with, may I express my personal
satisfaction that those Who direct the deliberations of this honourable chamber are in
their accustomed places and in their usual
good health and spirits-which I trust will
remain with them throughout the session. I
refer, of course, to our distinguished and
affable Speaker, who continues to add lustre
to the Senate whether he is presiding here
or representing us beyond the walls of Parliament. I refer also to the Leader of the
Opposition, whose kindness, competence and
unfailing courtesy to all honourable senators
have won him the admiration of all.
The Speech from the Throne announces
first that Her Majesty the Queen Mother and
Their Royal Highnesses the Duke of Edinburgh and the Princess Royal will come to
Canada next summer.
We have all been very pleased to learn
that we will be honoured with those three
visits in 1962, especially in the case of the
Queen Mother who earned the admiration and
respect of the whole democratic world for
the fine part she played during the difficuit
years that we experienced.
I am convinced that the Canadian people
will show once again their undying affection
for all members of the Royal Family.
On behalf of this honourable bouse, may I
extend to them our heartiest welcome.
In listening to the Speech from the Throne,
we were reminded that our Government deals
constantly in a practical and active way with
al problems regarding the present international situation.

Canada is playing an increasingly important part at the United Nations, within NATO
and during the visits or meetings of high
ranking officials from allied countries; we
are rightly pleased by the role played by our
Prime Minister and our Secretary of State for
External Affairs.
Since peace is the foremost aim of our
country, the Government's intention to support any international agreement concerning
controlled disarmament, as expressed in the
Speech from the Throne, will certainly bring
joy to all Canadians.
Last September, my kind friend, the honourable Mr. Hugessen, and I had the honour
of being chosen to represent the Senate at
the conference of the British Commonwealth
Parliamentary Association held in London.
We were first given the opportunity of visiting all the major places in England, Scotland
and Northern Ireland, and even in the Guernsey Islands. Everywhere, we were treated
with the utmost courtesy and hospitality.
Personally, I had the privilege of discovering
for myself a country of astonishing beauty
and splendour.
In Scotland, after we had visited the bistorical sites of Edinburgh, also its worldfamous university, we were taken into that
part of the country where Walter Scott and
Robert Burns found their inspiration.
In London, our convention was officially
opened by Her Majesty the Queen, and we
witnessed a ceremony which we will never
forget.
That conference at which all the Commonwealth countries were represented and
expressed their views has made us aware of
their views, of their fears about the international situation, of their needs and, at the
same time, of their hopes.
We were given the opportunity to get a
better idea of the close ties that link all those
countries, their common desire to get along
together not only economically but also from
a military standpoint, in order to protect mankind against a war that, with modern inventions, could wipe out our civilization.
To all those who have had knowledge of
the requests of the underdeveloped countries
of Asia, Africa, and elsewhere, the continuation of our foreign aid program remains a
necessity.
Personally, I sought impartial information
on the European Econonic Community and
endeavoured to make at least some inquiries
about the nature and the implications of that
treaty signed in Rome on March 25, 1957
between Belgium, Germany, France, Italy,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

SENATE
In working out that Common Market, its
members had set out as their purposes, and
I quote:
(Text):
Article 3 says:
For the purposes set out in the preceding Article, the activities of the Community shall include, under the conditions
and with the timing provided for in this
Treaty:
(a) the elimination, as between Member
States, of customs duties and of quantitative restrictions in regard to the importation and exportation of goods, as well as
of all other measures with equivalent
effect;
(b) the establishment of a common
customs tariff and a common commercial
policy towards third countries;
(c) the abolition, as between Member
States, of the obstacles to the free movement of persons, services and capital;
(d) the inauguration of a common agricultural policy;
(e) the inauguration of a common transport policy;
(f) the establishment of a system ensuring that competition shall not be distorted in the Common Market;
(g) the application of procedures which
shall make it possible to co-ordinate the
economic policies of Member States and
to remedy disequilibria in their balances
of payments;
(h) the approximation of their respective municipal law to the extent necessary
for the functioning of the Common
Market;
(i) the creation of a European Social
Fund in order to improve the possibilities
of employment for workers and to contribute to the raising of their standard
of living;
(j) the establishment of a European Investment Bank intended to facilitate the
economic expansion of the Community
through the creation of new resources;
and
(k) the association of overseas countries
and territories with the Community with
a view to increasing trade and to pursuing
jointly their effort towards economic and
social development.
(Translation):
There is nothing surprising in the fact
that one can hardly express a definite view
on the matter, since the text only sets forth
a broad outline of the treaty whose terms
and restrictions have not been as yet all and
fully applied.

That is why, at the news that Great
Britain is negotiating terms which would
allow her to become a member of that economic community, our Government may well
be cautious in order to be able to safeguard
the interest of Canada and of the Commonwealth.
In the course of the discussions which
took place, one could readily realize that
certain countries needed food and financial
help, and I believe that our Government
must be congratulated for having taken the
initiative of suggesting a food supply program
for the underdeveloped countries.
Those who are afraid of too heavy foreign
capital infiltration in Canada, will no doubt
welcome the measures which the Government
plans to introduce to require reports to be
submitted by business and labour organizations in order to know whether, and to
what extent, there is foreign control or ownership.
For a long time now, criticism has been
levelled at the Senate; the amending of
legislation dealing with its jurisdiction has
also been discussed. I do not know what
legislation relating to the Senate will be
brought forward by the Government, but I
am confident that it will have the effect of
taking away certain prejudices and that it
will restore in the mind of all Canadians the
real importance of this house which continues
to guarantee the protection of provincial rights
and of minorities all through the country.
Following the decennial census which has
just been completed, certain changes will
have to be made in the various electoral
districts. The Government intends to take
new steps concerning the redistribution of
electoral districts, by creating an independent
commission. This initiative should receive
the spontaneous approval of both houses
since many have long claimed that the redistribution of electoral ridings was done
so as to suit political purposes. The new
independent commission which the Government proposes to set up will surely contribute
to give all voters a fair and equitable representation.
As the speech from His Excellency reminded us, the present Government has already enacted long term measures in order
to boost the national economy, and it must be
recognized that the benefits flowing from
these measures are now very evident.
Indeed, as we read in the press release
jointly published by the Dominion Bureau
of Statistics and the Department of Labour
on January 16, 1962, unemployment is on
the downgrade and the number of workless
in December has lessened by 115,000 compared with last year. As reported by the

JANUARY 24, 1962
same source, the percentage of unemployed
has been lower than last year for the fifth
month in succession. Obviously, there is still
some work to be done. Unemployment is not
a purely local plague. It is an evil which
visits almost every nation. Our southern
neighbours themselves have fallen victim
to it and, at times, suffer from unemployment
to a much higher degree than we do.
The stimulation given to municipal winter
works has made it possible for our cities
and towns to undertake programs which
have considerably improved the situation,
and the Government's intention to offer
municipalities the means of increasing their
winter work certainly deserves commendation on the part of everyone.
In the report of the Special Senate Committee on Manpower and Employment, of
which I had the honour to be chairman, we
read the following in the conclusions and
recommendations, and I quote:
In the field of domestic economy, we
must mainly concentrate on secondary
manufacturing industries and on those
which need capital investments. It is
essential that there be increased expansion in those two fields.
Further we read:
Our secondary manufacturing industries must be encouraged to resort to the
latest technical improvements, to apply
the newest methods in proportion to
their accelerated growth, and also to
specialize in profitable fields and attain
a production rate which will enable them
to compete at home as well as abroad.
That is the best way to maintain a
high standard of living, to achieve a
reasonable rate of growth and to rank
with the giants of industry who surround us.
No doubt the Government wants to follow
up those recommendations and urges us to
encourage the Canadian industry to engage
in research in scientific fields, through which
it can improve and intensify its production.
Talking about production, may I say that
although the economic activity increases
throughout the whole world, Canada is in a
privileged position. The pace of its economic
expansion has considerably quickened during
the calender year just ended. We all agree
that industrial production has reached new
records. An upsurge of activity in Canadian
industries has brought about an increase in
employment and revenues, the trade people
have begun to build up their inventories;

a great volume of mortgage funds bas contributed to intensify the housing activity;
our exports have risen more rapidly than
our imports, resulting in a new improvement
of our trade balance in commodities.
Everything points out to a trade surplus
for 1961 following the deficits of $97 million
in 1960, $369 million in 1959 and $713 million
in 1956; guaranteed bank loans for small
enterprises, the expanded field of activity
of the Industrial Development Bank have
contributed to the betterment of trade in
general, and certain measures mentioned
in the Speech from the Throne will contribute
to achieve greater progress and a greater
stability in every field.
There is no question that our businessmen
are now more confident and that there is every
reason to foresee generally an increase in
production and sales.
Personally, I need no other proof than the
advertising by the industries of the St.
Maurice river region and the considerable
development which no one can fail to note
in the city of Montreal. In fact, very recently,
the president of one of our most important
paper companies in the area, the St. Lawrence
Paper Corporation, announced a $5 million
extension to its Three Rivers plant. They so
decided so that they could produce a new
type of paper which would be used for important de luxe publications. The president of
the Canadian International Paper informs us
that this company will invest, in 1962, more
than $13 million in its plants and forestry
divisions. This figure includes a capital investment of more than $6 million in its six
main pulp and paper plants, of which those
of Three Rivers and La Tuque are the two
most important. The Three Rivers harbour is
increasing its operations from year to year. In
Montreal, in the development of what is now
known as Dorchester Boulevard, there are
springing up, one after another, skyscrapers
such as we have never seen in Canada, reflecting the confidence our banking institutions
and industrialists have in Canada, particularly in its metropolis.
In the last few years, Montreal has made
considerable progress and its population is
spreading from day to day, both northward
and on the south shore of the St. Lawrence,
facing Montreal. New municipalities have
sprung up, and each one of them is expanding
from day to day. The Government, which is
keeping constantly abreast of the economic
situation of the whole population, has deemed
it its duty to contribute to the progress of the
south shore municipalities. In the Speech from
the Throne, it is announcing that discussions

SENATE
are under way with a view to abolishing tolls
on Victoria and Jacques Cartier bridges. This
means that the neighbouring municipalities,
once the tolls are abolished, will be free from
what they call the obstacle to their economic
and industrial development.
Transport facilities were required in another section of our country where the development of our natural resources is expanding
from day to day, thanks to one of our main
industries, and which represents a source of
supplies for business enterprises on the north
shore of the St. Lawrence. So, our Government, which has already set up better sea
transport facilities has now decided to provide this area with a railway line, which
will have its importance. The Government
deserves congratulations for taking an interest in the construction of a railway in the
Gaspé peninsula, from Matane to Ste. Anne
des Monts, a part of Canada where, as elsewhere, progress is on the march.
Another piece of legislation announced in
the Speech from the Throne, and whose importance must not be overlooked, is the one
which is designed to increase the total volume
of export financing. As will be recalled, the
Export Credit Insurance Corporation, in exchange for the payment of a proper premium,
insures Canadian exporters' property and
services, to protect them against defaulting
foreign purchasers.
This corporation greatly helps our industries to create new jobs and to increase their
production.
The number of insurance policies increases
each year. Those policies cover a great variety
of exports to approximately a hundred
countries. At present, the corporation guarantees over one billion dollars and our government intends to grant additional funds to
this body in order to further boost our
economy.
I would be remiss if, before concluding, I
did not mention the importance of the social
security measure referred to in the Speech
from the Throne, that is the increase of the
universal old age pension payable under
the Old Age Security Act and the Old Age
Assistance Act. Those measures are further
evidence that the Government has always
been concerned with the welfare of our old
people. Once again, the Government is carrying out the promises made by the Conservative party to the Canadian people at the
time of the 1957 election. When the Government raised old age pensions in October
1957, the Minister of National Health and
Welfare, the Honourable Mr. Monteith, introduced that legislation by saying that he was

not suggesting that the increase granted provided a final or perfect solution, and he gave
to understand that there would be another
readjustment in the future. The Government
is to be commended for its just and fair treatment of our senior citizens.
The Speech from the Throne further informs us that a new contributory old age
pension plan will complement the existing
legislation. This new plan is no doubt the
result of the investigation carried out by the
Government on the system in force in the
United States, to set up in Canada, in addition to our present pension plan, a general
and efficient contributory program of social
security which would supplement existing
services. All of us are anxious to know the
contents of that bill which will give our
people a greater degree of security.
Honourable senators, I have touched upon
all the points I wanted to raise in moving
the adoption of the address. A moment ago,
I stated that a climate of confidence prevails
in Canada at present, that even in the United
States, our country is considered as the land
of the future, that foreign investments in
Canada are such that some of our fellowcitizens find them too heavy. However, if
we wish to succeed we must remain united;
guided by the loftiest ideals, we must work
together; we must strive to promote national
rather than private interests. I said that it is
only by remaining true to our ideal, by having faith in the future and by trying to serve
Canada well that each of us will be able to
fulfil his own ambitions.
I do not know to what I owe the honour
of being asked by the Leader of the Government in this house to move the address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne, but
I wish to thank him most sincerely and I
am very grateful to the honourable senators for their kind attention.
(Text):

Honourable senators, last night I had the
pleasure of being introduced to the newlyappointed senator from St. John's, Newfoundland, the Honourable Senator Malcolm Hollett.
I wish to congratulate him upon his appointment and to assure him he is warmly welcome to our ranks. Honourable Mr. Hollett
served in the provincial Legislature of Newfoundland from 1952 to 1959, and for the
greater part of that period was Leader of the
Opposition. In view of his vast experience,
there is no doubt, that his contributions to
the deliberations of this house will be most
valuable.
He has been a magistrate for over 25
years and, speaking personally as a lawyer,

the shores of Newfoundland-and I trust my decent living wage.

SENATE
Mines of lead, zinc and iron ore are not
inexhaustible, and year by year each individual mine becomes economically less
profitable, and miners must perforce go to
other areas. Even now in our own province
we are faced more and more with this
problem. One mine alone, supporting 14,000
people, has recently closed down for a period
of seven weeks, and I do hope, honourable
senators, that it is just for a period of seven
weeks.
There is only one way to prevent the coastline of Newfoundland-and we have 6,000
miles of it-from becoming deserted, and
that is to assist in the establishment of more
modern methods of catching, curing and distributing to the markets of the world the
products of the sea.
I am happy to see that the Government is
becoming more active in endeavouring to
tackle this problem, as greater assistance
must come from some source to maintain the
existence of our coastal fishermen and our
sailors until such time as the growth in population across this nation provides a greater
and more constant market for the products
of the sea. If we are to become great as a
nation, and I am sure we shall, then we must
assist in the healthy development of one of
our greatest natural resources.
You will forgive me, I am sure, honourable
senators, for referring again to my native
province, and your tenth liability. I say "liability" advisedly, for each of the provinces
must be a liability when we consider this
fact alone, that last year some $1,470 million
was contributed by the federal Government
to the revenues of the ten provinces. This,
according to my reckoning-and I am not
infallible-amounts to some $82 per head of
our population, and, for our own information, I should like to point out that this
figure of $82 per head of population last year
compares with some $38 per head of the
population in the fiscal year of 1956-57. In
other words, in 1961-62 the federal Government's contributions to the provincial revenues were more than twice what they were
in 1956-57.
I believe that the federal Government's
contribution to Newfoundland's revenue last
year amounted to nearly 60 per cent of the
total revenue. That is why I said that we in
Newfoundland are a liability-we are a
liability like every other province, but we
may be a little more so. Incidentally, the
total contributions from the federal Government to Newfoundland-and this includes
not only grants conditional and unconditional
but also payments to individuals in the form
of unemployment insurance, old age pensions,
and so on-increased from $28 million in

1950, to $46 million in 1956, and from $55
million in 1957 to some $100 million in 1961.
However, we shall not always be a liability,
and in our opinion our natural resources,
when properly developed, particularly in that
mineral and timber rich area of Labrador,
will make us one of Canada's greatest assets
in an economic sense.
Our great paper-making industries at Grand
Falls and Corner Brook have for many years
comfortably supported a large percentage of
our people. They are happy, industrious and
patriotic. At Grand Falls alone in 1940 I
personally helped to enlist for service overseas more than 1,000 men who left good jobs
to fight gallantly for the preservation of that
liberty which we now enjoy.
At this point I must express the great
gratitude of all Newfoundlanders for the
prompt aid sent by the federal Government
last summer when fire threatened, and actually destroyed, large wooded areas in the
centre of Newfoundland.
Our province contains 110,000 square miles
in Labrador, a land which is rich in mineral
deposits and timber. About three years ago I
accompanied Premier Smallwood on a trip
to this vast territory and, as we crisscrossed
the area by low-flying plane, we were
amazed at the extent of wealth in this wooded
area of North America. What a heritage for
Canadians! No doubt you are all aware of
the great developments there during the past
few years relative to mining and power production. In this connection I am happy to
note in the Speech from the Throne that
incentives are forthcoming to assist industry
in scientific research as how best to develop
these immense natural resources of electric
power and mineral wealth. I am not so sure
this refers to Labrador only; I suspect it
refers to the natural resources of the whole
of Canada.
Great pioneering companies like the Iron
Ore Company of Canada and BRINCO and
their associates-and I could mention othersare deserving of every encouragement possible
from all levels of government.
The Speech from the Throne, which has
been so ably discussed by the honourable
senator from Shawinigan (Hon. Mr. Méthot),
the mover of the address in reply, needs but
little further reference from me. At this point
I should like to thank the honourable senator
from Shawinigan for the very kind references
he made to my appointment to the Senate.
Members of the Senate seem to have adopted
the habit of making all new greenhorns like
myself feel at home when they come into this
chamber. I have talked to a good many honourable senators and they tell me that they
went through the same experiences that I am
going through now. I am thankful to say that

JANUARY 24, 1962
irrespective of which side of the house honourable senators are seated, they have made
it very pleasant and comfortable for me as a
newcomer, and I want to express my thanks
to them for this.
The honourable senator from Shawinigan
said something about a magistrate always having the last word. In a sense that is correct.
Sometimes it is not a very comforting feeling
to have to say the last word. Today I can
speak of individuals, perhaps prime ministers
of countries like Canada, who sometimes have
the last word. As a matter of fact, such a last
word will probably decide what date the
voters will next have to go to the federal
polls.
I am sure every honourable senator would
join me in congratulating the authors of the
1962 Speech from the Throne. It is concise,
one must admit, and clear and refers to almost
every aspect of our social and economic life
that touches the welfare of all Canadians.
Many would-be prophets said we were sure
to get a pre-election document-you know,
that something-for-everybody sort of thing.
Well, I am sure that the Throne Speech definitely did not give us even an approximate
date for the coming election.
Increase in federal grants to universities:
Was this not necessary? Help for droughtstricken areas: Who would deny the need?
Increase in ceilings on federal loans to finance
exports and measures to help to enlarge employment by stimulating economic activity:
Will not these sound and sensible approaches
assist our nation's growth? But, is it not
strange how often even reliable newspapers
and many citizens jump to conclusions? For
instance, just one short eleven-word sentence
in the Speech read:
A measure relating to the Senate will
be placed before you.
That is all that was said about this honourable
body, and yet newspaper writers and radio
commentators would have it that reform in
the Senate was imminent. Who knows, the
measure spoken of in the Speech may have
reference to our indemnity and not at all to
our demise.
There are two or three items in the Speech,
apart from various social and welfare matters such as pension increases and the like,
which are of particular interest to my province. I refer first to that item which has to do
with a proposed amendment to the Civilian
War Pensions and Allowances Act, to authorize payment of allowances under specified
conditions to merchant seamen, fire-fighters,
foresters and members of voluntary aid detachments who served overseas in either
world war.

Personally, I know of many in Newfoundland who may come within this category,
some 3,500 I believe, who served faithfully
and well. All had enlisted and were prepared to go wherever their services were
required. I know of one who was badly
injured while in such service in the war of
1914-18, and yet until now he has not been
able to get any recognition whatsoever from
any government. I should like to express, on
behalf of these 3,500 Newfoundlanders, our
thanks for this measure.
Secondly, the institution of a car ferry
service between North Sydney, Nova Scotia,
and eastern Newfoundland is a most essential
service and one which is welcomed not only
by Newfoundlanders but by a host of Canadians all over this country. It should prove to
be economically sound, especially in view of
the fact that the Furness Warren line is, I
understand, terminating its car ferry service
to Nova Scotia. It is an important link in
assisting travel and communications across
the whole of Canada.
I believe right here is where I ought
to refer to another very necessary and important link between Newfoundland and the
other nine provinces. I call it the "missing
link" in the Trans-Canada Highway, the
completion of which highway is all important
if we are to have one united Canada.
When Newfoundland came into Union
there were between 500 and 600 miles of road
to be built and paved according to TransCanada standards. Today, over 12 years later,
there are still nearly 500 miles remaining to
be paved and, in many instances, to be built,
simply because our province could not afford its share of the cost. We do not beg for
special privileges over and above other
provinces, but I think you will agree that
there are several special reasons for another
look at the Trans-Canada Highway agreement as it applies to our province. It is possible, however, that this matter may be one
of those envisaged by the Government in
that paragraph in the Speech from the
Throne which states:
Further measures to stimulate economic activity and promote national development will be placed before you this
session.
We hope that the completion of the TransCanada Highway in Newfoundland will be
included in this particular measure. Who will
deny that the Government's intention to
broaden the scope of small business loans
and farm and fishery loans is a "must" for
a growing young nation facing the competitive world of today?

SENATE
It was a sound and sensible Speech from
the Throne, admirably delivered by Her Majesty's gallant representative, His Excellency,
Major-General George Philias Vanier, D.S.O.,
M.C.
Honourable senators, without wanting to
be accused of political thinking today I should
like to quote one short passage from the
Throne Speech which I am sure will bring
aid and comfort to everybody in this chamber. It is this:
Comprehensive measures to put into
effect my Government's economic policies were enacted in preceding sessions
of this Parliament. The benefits flowing
from these policies are now evident in
record levels of employment, of production, and of export trade. There has
been a substantial improvement since
last year in the unemployment situation.
As the result of the efforts of my Government through its municipal winter
works incentive program, notable progress has been made in meeting the
recurrent problem of seasonal unemployment.

Here also are a few headlines from recent
issues of the press. In the Annual Commercial Review and Forecast of the Montreal
Gazette:
Port tonnage sets the record in Montreal as her best year in history.
1961-Seaway season-good.
Outlook for the shipyards for 1962promising.
Montreal Exchange-buoyant.
Recovery gains-outlook good.
Upsurge in car sales and hope ahead for
textiles.
Mineral exports hit a record.
One could go on quoting headlines from
experts in our Canadian economy. I am proud
to see them. Even if I were sitting on the
other side of the house, I believe I would
like to see headlines like that, because they
refer to this great Canada we have inherited
and for which we have worked hard to make
prosperous.
Honourable senators, I believe that these
comments and headlines will cheer us ail, for
you in the Senate are, indeed, partly responsible for this upsurge of prosperity. You were
a part of the Government which initiated some
of the monetary and industrial policies which,
indeed, aided and abetted the upward march
in our economy. True it is, so I am informed,
that there are honourable members here who
offered criticisms at the time, and, who will
deny that criticisms are essential at ail levels
of government? But even today, I believe they
would be inclined to agree that the Government, including of course this honourabie
chamber, did take the proper steps to help
along that expansion of our economy which is

Then it goes on to say that better things are
going to be done along the same lines
this year, and I am sure that must give some
of us, at any rate, some comfort.
Honourable senators, we ail know what
these measures were, and in case anyone
should still doubt the truth of that paragraph referring to the progress made in the
past year, I would refer you to recent statements and headlines appearing in the press
and elsewhere. Here is one, for instance, by
Mr. Meyer, the financial editor of the so evident today.

TRANSLATION SYSTEM
FOR IMPROVEMENT

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Lionel Choquette: Honourable senators, before the Orders of the Day are called
I wouhd like to make a suggestion as to
the sirnultaneous translation systemi in use
in this chamber. No doubt it has been advantageous, but 1 think it has also becorne
a disturbing factor. Yesterday when speeches
were being delivered we could hear the voice
of the interpreter in the charnber, which was
quite disturbing and distracting. Those who
are responsible for the installation of the
systern should be asked to look into this
rnatter. It may be that the difficulty couhd be
overcome by installing a larger earphone
that would cover the ear, so as to prevent;
the escape 0f the voice of the transiator, as
happens with the apparatus we now have.
Yesterday I know it was quite disturbing
to hear throughout the charnber the voice
of the interpreter immediately after each
sentence was spoken. I think the systern can
be improved.
The Hon. the Speaker: I believe the rnain
difficulty is caused by honourable senators
who use the earphones with the volumne
turned up too high. That was the case yesterday during the speech delivered by the
honourable senator frorn Shawinigan (Hon.
Mr. Méthot). I made an experirnent with rny
own earphone and found that when the volume was turned how 1 could stihi hear very
well, and the voice of the interpreter was not
projected any distance frorn the earphone.
Before we start suggesting changes in the
equiprnent I think honourable senators shouhd
tune down their earphones, otherwise they
becorne broadcasting stations. We should experirnent further along this line, and we may
be able to correct the difficulty without calling
in the Bell Telephone Company. The honourable senator frorn North York (Hon. Mr. Sullivan) rnay have sornething to say on this
matter. He is a specialist.
Hon. Joseph A. Sullivan: Honourable senators, with ahi due respect to His Honour
the Speaker, I think this difficuhty can be
very easihy rernedied by providing a srnalh
maîheable earpiece that couhd be plugged
right into the receiver. It is the extraneous
noises around that interfere with the reception of sound, and rnost of the sound is being
diffused throughout the charnber instead of
into the ear canal. A srnall artificial mold that
wouhd push into the button would rernedy
the problern very easily.
Hon. Norman McL. Paterson: Since I was
one of the offenders yesterday, I apohogize.

I wish to thank him for his complimentary
remarks about me, and I can assure him that
had I had the privilege of speaking first,
I would have expressed similar sentiments
about him.
I wish to welcome our distinguished
Speaker who seems to be in the best of

sincere congratulations on his recent appointment as chairman of the Board of Governors
of the National Theatre School of Canada.
It may be that under his guidance, the debates
of this chamber will become more dramatic.
(Text):
The Honourable Senator Hollett, our new
associate-and I like to think of all the members of this house as associates-we welcome
here as a cultured and scholarly gentleman,
and as a man with considerable legislative
experience. Having sat as Leader of the Opposition in the Newfoundland Legislature be
will not at once feel entirely at home on the
Government side of this chamber, but whether
his stay there is long or short I can assure
him that eventually he will find no difficulty
in feeling perfectly comfortable on the Opposition benches in this chamber.
He referred to all the provinces of Canada
as liabilities. Let me assure him that we
do not, even in the manner suggested by him,
think of them as liabilities, and certainly not
his great province of Newfoundland. It is,
indeed, an integral part of our nation, and
when it joined Confederation it added much
to the strength of our beloved Canada.
The Honourable Senator Hollett spoke in
very complimentary terms about myself and
referred to the fact that I had from time to
time given certain advice to the Government.
I can only say that we on this side of the
house have had no criticism to make of the
Government in so far as the advice which
has been given from this side of the house
is concerned, because frequently the Government has taken notice of what we have said.
This afternoon honourable senators, it is
not my intention to give any advice to the
Government-in fact, I would not presume
to do so-but I trust you will permit me to
bring certain pertinent facts to the attention
of the Government which they, in any event,
should appreciate receiving.
I am not going to speculate on what is
involved in the twenty-one items of legislation mentioned in the Speech from the
Throne. It is indeed heartwarming to gather
from the tenor of the speech that the Government has high hopes for the economic
well-being of our country. I trust that its
hopes and aspirations will be realized, and
there is no reason why they should not be,

but it seems to me that the Government is
going the wrong way about accomplishing
this by refusing to face up to the actual conditions which exist in this country at the
present time. It is of no help to delude ourselves into believing that all is well when all
is not well. Nor do we solve any problems
by branding as "doomsters" and "gloomsters"
those who are interested enough in our wellbeing to ferret out the facts and to place
them squarely before the Government and
the public for their consideration.
I shall mention a few facts and give a few
figures which make it abundantly clear and
which will convince even the most partisan
that there is much substance in the contention that our economy is not as sound and as
robust as we would like it to be.
However, I would not have you believe
that I am a pessimist. On the contrary, I
am an optimist. I believe that given the right
direction, there are great things in store for
Canada. I am quite sure that our present
faltering economy will move forward with
its old-time vigour in the not-too-distant
future, provided we face up to the facts and
then endeavour to bring in legislative measures which will make it possible for our ills
to be cured. By no means can the Government
do it all, but it is essential to adopt a sound
fiscal policy and to present to Parliament
those measures which will create in our people
the necessary confidence, with a resulting increase in the production of those things which
go to make up both our domestic and foreign
trade.
We talk about our booming economy, but
how can our economy be said to be booming
when the percentage of our people who are
unemployed is the greatest of any comparable
country in the world?
During recent months the Prime Minister
has been making statements to the effect that
Canada has less unemployment than the
United States. With respect to one month only,
namely August, that may be right, but as the
Toronto Daily Star has pointed out in a recent editorial:
The Prime Minister has at his disposal
unemployment statistics for the two
countries which eliminate the seasonal
factor and show basic trends. These are
the seasonally adjusted figures, issued
monthly by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics at Ottawa, and the Labor department in Washington.
Honourable senators, I have the average
figures for both countries, taken from our
Bureau of Statistics and from the publication
Economic Indicators, an official publication of
the United States Printing Office. I would ask
to be allowed to put these figures on the
record.

The foregoing figures show that for 1961
our average rate of unemployment was 7.2
per cent while that of the United States was
6.7 per cent, and over the whole period from
1958 to 1961 our average rate was 6.8 per
cent, while that of the United States was
6.1 per cent.
But, in any event, honourable senators,
is it a source of any satisfaction to us to
compare our unemployment figures with the
very high ones of the United States? Why
not compare them with those of the United
Kingdom, West Germany and the other Common Market countries where, as you know,
there is little or no unemployment?
Let me make it abundantly clear, honourable senators, that I am not one of those
who claim that the Government must at all
times find a job for every individual in the
country, but I do say that the Government
can, by its economic and fiscal policies and
actions, create the climate and establish the
confidence essential for national growth and
development which, in turn, bring about high
employment.
I am spending considerable time on the
subject of unemployment because I am convinced that it remains the number one problem in Canada. Surely, there is nothing so
degrading and harmful to an able-bodied
man's moral, physical and spiritual well-being
as being out of work when he is anxious
and willing to work?
According to statistics there are 115,000
fewer people unemployed today than there
were at this time a year ago. But, is that
a true picture? Are we not endeavouring,
as someone has said, to sugar-coat the unemployment figures? Have we, as the Government in its Speech from the Throne would
have us believe, enlarged employment by
measures which have stimulated economic
activity? Judged by that standard, the number
of unemployed today is little changed from
what it was a year ago. It is correct that
due to all causes there are 115,000 fewer
unemployed than there were a year ago,
but if we look at those figures realistically
and seek the correct figures in the light of
our economic activity, we must deduct, I
think you will agree with me, the 25,000
who are now taking the six weeks' survival
training course and who, for that reason, are

included amongst the employed. Surely, no
one would contend that their employment
has resulted from any measures which have
stimulated economic activity. Should we not
also deduct the 12,000 who are taking vocational training courses at Government expense and who hope to find jobs on the
completion of their courses? At the present
time they are included among the employed.
Does anyone seriously suggest that they
should be so included?
Is it not also fair to deduct the 15,000
who have been added to our armed forces?
They are employed, and well employed, but
I am at this time discussing employment
in relation to stimulated economic activity.
We should also deduct that very substantial
number, the exactness of which I have been
unable to ascertain, which has been added
to the provincial payroll to gather the pennies, nickels and dimes which make up a
small percentage of the Ontario sales tax.
However, if the figures that I have quoted
are added together it will be seen that they
amount to 52,000. When this number is
deducted from 115,000 it leaves 63,000 which
is the true reduction in the number of unemployed in relation to economic productivity.
So, let us not talk about a reduction of
115,000; let us talk about a reduction of
63,000.
Honourable senators, I would like to make
a few observations with respect to our trade.
We take great satisfaction in the high level
of Canada's overall trade. The amount of
our trade in dollars was never greater, but
that is not the whole story and we should
not deceive ourselves into believing that all
is well merely because we are dealing in
increased dollar amounts.
The fact is that although our exports have
increased by approximately 70 per cent in
dollar value over the last ten years, there
has actually been a shrinkage of approximately 20 per cent in relation to our Gross
National Product. This in itself is far from
reassuring, especially when we pride ourselves as being a great world trader in a
rapidly expanding world economy. But, just
where do we stand as a world trader? Are
we holding our position? Indeed, we are not.
If anything should shake us out of our complacency it should be the fact, the very disagreeable and disturbing fact, that Canada
has, since the present administration came
into office, slipped from fourth position
amongst the trading nations to the fifth position.
No one can deny that that trend, if not
reversed, will result in economic disaster.
But, here again, let me say that notwithstanding this dropping off in trade I am not
one of those who think that Canada is going

SENATE
to the dogs. As I said, I am not a pessimist;
I am an optimist, and I am sure that no
great decline will continue, provided the
Government faces up to the facts and takes
bold and constructive measures, which for
some reason or other it hesitates to do, in
the interests of the long term well-being of
our country.
Just what is Canada's position as a world
trader? We like to think that we are trading
on a multilateral basis, but if we examine
the statistics we will find that we are trading
with comparatively few countries, and that
Canada is paying only lip service, as the
Globe and Mail has said, to the principle of
multilateral trade. We have, in effect, put
most of our trading eggs in one three-compartment basket.
In 1960, the latest full year for which
figures are available, of all our export trade
over four-fifths was with the United States,
the United Kingdom and the Common Market
countries. The United States is by far our
best customer. We did 55.7 per cent of our
total trade with ber. By the way, the 15
per cent of our imports which the Prime
Minister was going to divert from the United
States to the United Kingdom has, of course,
not been diverted. Any change in our imports
from either the United States or the United
Kingdom has been insignificant, and apparently the Prime Minister has written off that
promise as a lost cause.
But, let me get back to Canada's so-called
multilateral trading policy. The United States
as I have said, has 55.7 per cent of our
trade, the United Kingdom bas 17.4 per cent,
and the Common Market countries 8.3 per
cent. This amounts in all to 81.4 per cent,
leaving only 18.6 per cent of our total export
trade to be distributed amongst our other 22
trading partners.
I am, of course, referring to export trade,
and I point this out to emphasize that our
well-being in so far as our trade is concerned
is tied up with the United States and the
Common Market, including the United Kingdom, and when these countries enter into a
new trading pact, the negotiations for which
are rapidly being concluded, Canada just
cannot remain on the outside. The United
States is putting forth every effort to make
satisfactory trading arrangements with this
enlarged Common Market. Canada cannot
afford to dissociate itself from the United
States in this effort. This is indeed a great
challenge for Canada, and there is no excuse for our not being prepared to meet it.
Indeed, it can never be said that the
Government was not warned of the changing
trend which is about to take place in international trade, especially as it concerns
Europe. In this very house the Honourable

Wishart Robertson, supported by a number
of other senators, introduced a resolution
bringing what was taking place in Europe
forcibly to the attention of the Government.
Aggressive action on the part of the Government should have been taken at that time,
but the Government sat idly by with a selfsatisfied feeling that all was well when it
should have known that all was far from
well. It may be that even now it is not too
late, and it is reassuring to know, although
belatedly, that the Government is at long last
taking some steps towards retaining for us
our market with the United States and with
the proposed enlarged Common Market with
which over the past years we have been
doing 81.4 per cent of our trade.
Honourable senators, perhaps I can restate my points in four short sentences:
1. As everyone realizes, export trade is
vital to Canada's well-being.
2. Our trading position today is seriously
threatened, and in the future will be more
seriously threatened, by the emergence of
new patterns.
3. Our employment position and the maintenance of a satisfactory rate of employment
are inseparable from our strength or weakness as a trading nation.
4. Therefore, we must keep our export
trade high and our traditional markets solid,
and at the same time emphasize our search
for new markets if employment is to be
available for the thousands who are yearly
being added to the labour force.
According to the Honourable William
Nickle, Minister of Commerce and Development for the province of Ontario, 60,000 new
job opportunities must be developed yearly
in Ontario alone for at least the next ten-year
period. Dr. John J. Deutsch, Vice-Principal of Queen's University, who is recognized as one of Canada's most eminent economists, has said that one million more jobs
will be needed in Canada by 1965, which
means that each year for the next three
years there must be created in Canada over
300,000 jobs if we are to maintain even our
present rate of employment. The fulfilment
of that requirement is, indeed, a staggering
undertaking, and sometimes I wonder if the
Government is aware of its seriousness.
But, honourable senators, my object today
is not to blame the Government for its
many shortcomings, but rather to assist it in
finding a solution for the many difficult problems which confront it. An increase in our
export trade is essential, but it must be admitted that many

of our exports

are not

dependent on a large number of employees.

deep-rooted problem which threatens to
strangle our economic growth. A solution, I
am confident, can be found. In fact, it must
be found if Canada is not to continue to slide
further down the ladder as a great world exporter.
Honourable senators, apart from our deteriorating position as a world trader and
apart from what is rapidly becoming a chronic
unemployment condition in our country, there
is one more problem which is of deep concern to our generation, and will also be a
problem for the generations of Canadians yet
unborn. I shall refer to it very briefly and
then I shall not delay you longer. I refer to
the sad state of our finances.
From the close of the war until the former
administration went out of office in 1957, we
had reduced our national debt, with corresponding annual reductions in interst charges,
by $2 billion. Since 1957, that is during the
four years that the present administration
has been in office, we have increased our debt
by $2 billion. All the money which the former
administration saved by its sound financial
and fiscal policies has been spent by this
administration in four years, and there is no
end in sight to the annual spending of
hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars
more than we can hope to raise. The fact is,
and this is a conservative estimate, that we
are going into debt at the rate of $500
million a year; that is, to put it in
other words, at the rate of half a billion
dollars each year. That ever-increasing indebtedness is the inheritance which we are
leaving to our children and to our children's
children. We like to think that we will be
remembered by those who come after us. We
can be assured that we shall be remembered
by many generations yet unborn!

But this
ever-increasing indebtedness
which I have mentioned does not tell the
whole story. During the last year the printing presses have not been idle. They have
been going night and day to keep up with
the Government's demand for more money.
To be exact, from November 1960 to November 1961 our money supply increased from
$13,717,000,000 to $14,677,000,000. That is to
say, with the assistance of the printing presses
we have approximately $1 billion more in
circulation today than we had a year ago;
and even with the extra money our national
debt is at its highest level, and with the
expenditures contemplated in the Speech
from the Throne there seems to be no limit
in sight to our ever-mounting national debt.
I will not say more. I have endeavoured
to bring to the attention of the Government
the true figures as to the number of our
unemployed, our precarious position as a
world trader, our challenge with respect to
the hundreds of thousands of jobs which
must be provided in the next four years, and
to our staggering and ever-mounting national
debt. I have endeavoured not to be overly
critical. I realize the magnitude of the problems which call for solution. I realize that
it will be no easy task, and so far as I am
concerned-and I am sure I speak for all
honourable senators-I will be happy to
associate myself with the honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) in
putting into effect those measures which we
feel are in the interest of the general wellbeing of our beloved Canada.

and hard work of the individual. Governments can advise, encourage and assist, but
under our system they cannot compel.
The honourable the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), when speaking of
our improved export position, found it, I
believe his words were, "disagreeable and
disturbing"l that since the change of Government Canada had gone from the fourth to the
fifth place among the trading nations of the
world. This may be a matter of regret, but
not o! any greater regret than when Canada
slipped from third to fourth place under the
previous administration.
A nation's standing as a trading nation is
determined by adding together its exports and
its imports. Some countries of the world which
are more self-contained and seif-sufficient
than others can maintain a very high standard
of living while importing comparatively littie
and exporting littie. As such they do not rank
very high among the trading nations, but that
fact provokes no comment on their economic
health.
Canada is o! course a great world trader
and we must import and export; a great deal.
However, what is most important to a country
such as Canada, with a high content of foreigu
investment and heavy expenditures abroad
for travel and other services, is the relation of
her exports to imports. As you ail know, it
is indicated that this last year saw our fIrst
surplus of merchandise trade exporta over
imports since 1952. This Governnient is determined to encourage this favourable trend, and
my later remarks will deal with the many
thlngs that-are being done in this respect.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) regrets that while exports have grown i the last decade they
have not grown as quickly as the Groas National Product. This may be so, but it hardly
provides a ground for argument. A host o!
factors, both domestic and foreign, contribute
to determine the growth of the Gross National Product, and another host of factors
determine the level o! our export -trade. Some
of these, but by no means ail, are conimon to
both situations. The Groas National Product
undoubtedly has an effect on exports, and vice
versa, but there is no reason to expect an
intimate relationship between the two. What
is germane is that governmenta do everything
possible within reason under the prevailing
circumstances to improve both, and i this
regard the present administration has an lipressive record as compared to that of the
previous Governient.
I was rather amused when the honourable
Leader of the Opposition referred to the
busyneas of the printing presses In relation
to money supply. One o! the functions of
Government, of course, la to regulate the
money supply, and it la common knowledge

that il the supply o! money becomes too
great in relation to gooda and services available, inflation results and, if it la too small,
we have deflation. I should have thought
that this question is one which the honourable
Leader o! the Opposition would approach
with extreme caution. If the money supply
is being increased too quickly by this Goverient then inflation wiil surely result.
But, what la the record? The followlng
table sets out the rise in the annual consumer
price index between the years 1955 and 1961.

If the greater volume of money mentioned
by the honourable Leader o! the Opposition
had not been needed in our growing economy
the record would have been quite different.
In fact, the efforta of this Goveramnent to
so regulate the money supply are immeasurably better than those of the former administration. In the eight yeara prior to 1957
the Canadian dollar loat 25 per cent of ita
purchasing power, and another dangerous inflationary trend had set in before the change
of goverrnent i 1957. As the D.B.S. figures
clearly show, the present Goveramnent was
able to reverse mhis trend and s0 protect the
purchasing power of our dollar.
There ia just one omher matter mhat I wlah
to refer to, and mhat is the complaint o! the
honourable Leader o! the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) about deficita. In this connection I am reniinded o! a statement made
recently by the Minlater of Finance to the
effect that had it flot; been for mhe extremely
large paymenta made by the federal Government to the provinces in recent years there
would have been no deficit.
Those are my preliminary remarks, honourable senators. I hope I will flot detain you
too long, but my main remarks today have
ta do with what the Goverrnent la doing
to stiniulate the economic growth o! the
country, with particular emphaais on export
activity.
Everyone is aware that in the year 1961
there was a marked and a welcome improvement in Canada's economic fortunes. Everywhere I go I sense a spirit of optimisai whlch
itself, I feel, will contribute to our continued
progresa and prosperlty.
As I have mentioned, preliminary yearend figures now indicate that we achieved in
1961 a surplus in our merchandise trade
balance, In other words, the total value of

SENATE
our exports exceeded the total value of our
imports. This, in my opinion, is excitmng
news. After the war, when the devastated
countries of the world were rebullding and
Canada was helping considerably with boans
and gifts, we generally had substantial trade
surpluses, but these came to an end in 1952.
The year 1961 was the first since 1952 that
Canada has achieved a surplus of exports
over imports. In order to illustrate the trend
which we confidently hope and plan will
continue, may I set out the net position for
1952 and following years:
1952 ........
surplus ........
$421 million
1953 .........
deficit ........
$ 95.5
1954 .........
deficit ........
$ 41.6
1955 .........

$156
1959 .........
deficit ........
$368.6
1960 .........
deficît ........
$ 97
The 1961 surplus according to unofficial
estimates may very well be of the order of
$100 million.
While sales abroad of primary products,
including grain to China, have been an important factor in raising our merchandise
export; total to a record high and in reaching
a net surplus position, we have also seen an
impressive jump in the export of manufactured goods. I venture to repeat the wellworn statement that Canada, as one of the
great trading nations of the world, must export to live. That stateinent has neyer been
more true than at the present time. Our
bettered export position has without doubt
helped to spark the quickenjng growth of
our Gross National Product, and to boost
year-end industrial output by about 6 per
cent over a Vear earlier.
Since exports have such a vital effect on
our economic health I propose to discuss
some aspects of them, and mention what we
are doing to meet the problems which have
arisen.
First of ail, I shahl describe some of the
developments in the Canadian economy in
recent years and the various governmental
measures which have led to an improvement
in it, ahl o! which, of course, have a definite
effect on our ability to sell competitively in
foreign markets.
Secondly, I shaîl detail some of the things
being done by the Governiment here in
Canada with a view to improving our export
potential. Finally, I shail describe the facilities available and the projects which the
Government has undertaken in foreign countries to help our exporters find new markets
and expand old ones. I am sure you will
appreciate that anything which contributes
to the improvement and greater efficiency of

oui productive facilîties in Canada will have
in turn a marked effect on our abillty to sel
abroad. I do not intend to cover these in
detail but I should like to mention some of
the more significant ones.
The National Productivity Council is fiow
getting into, stride and we have recent legislation to encourage better design. You have
heard of the increased emphasis which the
Government is placing on the stimulation of
research. Valuable assistance in the establishment, expansion and modernization of our
productive plant has been given by the Industrial Development Bank. Its credit facilities
have been expanded and more advantage of
them is being taken ail the time. The ban<
reports that boans in the first quarter of its
current fiscal year were up 82 per cent over
the same period last year, and last year
showed an increase of 84 per cent over the
previous one. Since 1958 the bank has almost
doubled the number of its branch offices,
including new ones at Saint John, New
Brunswick, Regina, Saskatchewan, and St.
John's, Newfoundland. This expansion, together with the opening by the Department
of Trade and Commerce of regional offices
across the country, should encourage new
and wider diversification of industry.
The forests, farms and fIsheries of Canada
yield almost haîf our exports in value. For
this reason both Government assistance and
private advancement in these fields are of
the utmost importance.
In the forest products category, a significant
development was the creation of the new
Department of Forestry. There has been an
intensification of research and development
under the direction of that departmnent. In
a field such as forestry a high degree of
co-operation and co-ordination of effort with
the provinces is, of course, most essential.
In 1951 the federal Government commenced
assisting the provinces financially in their
efforts to promote reforestation and to take
inventory of forest resources. Since then the
federal assistance has been progressively
broadened to include capital costs of fire
protection facilities, construction of forest
access roads and, most recently, stand improvement work. The federal expenditure is
distributed among the provinces in proportion to their productive forest area and for.
the current year is about eight times as large
as for the year o! inception.
The industry itself is taking successful
measures to improve its competitivity and is
directing its attention increasingly to export
objectives. In the face of technological developments in other countries and extremely
keen competition, the struggle has by no
means been an easy one. To give you some
idea of the success which is attending these

JANUARY 30, 1982
efforts, I shail give export figures i millions
of dollars for the three mai forest product
items froin 1955 ta 1960, and compilations
available for 1961 show a cantinuation of the
definite upward trend.

While the record is not quite sa good for
lumber and squared tixnber, it has improved
over the years since 1957-58.
Canadian fisheries are being given substanUial help in improving their competitive position and, while production figures are greatiy
influenced by natural causes, export statistics
are encouraging. At home the mnove ta more
modemn fishing vessels is being hastened by
higher construction subsidies. An idustrial
development service of the Fisheries Department is carrying on research on better flsh.ing
methods and related subi ets. The Fisheries
Prices Support Board. has only recently commenced operations and has purchased a quantity af turbot, and is trying ta develop a market for this fish in frozen form. ta replace
ithat which used ta exist for it in pickled
f arn. Exports of fish and marine products
have on the average increased by about
$10 million annually over the last five years.
While Canada can na longer be viewed
basically as an agricultural country, agricultural praducts still make up over one-sixth in
value of aur exports. The Government's conprehensive program, for the improvement of
the 'farin economy therefore has an important
beaming on aur export position. This prograin,
while it produces immediate benefits for the
farmer, looks ta an ultiniate objective af enabllng aur farmers ta meet the requirenents
of the market, bath damestic and foreign, in
the most efficient possible manner. It la having
inipressive success in this direction.
One of the essential requirements of the
agricultural commnunity i making adjustments ta modern conditions is an adequate
supply af credit. Capital is needed ta combie
econamic land units with satisfactomy buildigs, machiery and equipment. Some idication af the seriousness wlth which the Government la tackling this basic need may be gained
fron. the operations of the Farin Credit Corporation. In sllghtiy more than two years- of
existence it has loaned more money ta fammers
than did the Farin Loan Board in the previaus
27 years. Encouragement has long been given
by way af quallty premluins for the production of better hags, and this was extended
ta lain*bs last year. The variaus measures ta

8

encourage better land use and methods, stabilize prices, insure against crop failure and
assist the fariner i other ways should in the
long run help to establish an industry which
is flexible enough to adapt itself to a variable
market and at the saine Urne provide a reasonable degree of security to those working in
the farming industry.
In recent years export statistics for agricultural products have flot been uniformly encouraging. The extraordinary grain sales i
1961, and other expected sales, will no dloubt
boost totals greatly, but hard work is still
required in this area.
At this poit, honourable senators, I think
I should say a word on behaif of the Honourable Alvin Hamilton, Minister of Agriculture
for Canada. I belleve he has performed a
great service in finding markets for our wheat
which w.as pilig up and which we were
unable to dispose of. I believe his efforts are
very much appreciated not only by the faraing community in Canada but by everyone
else, because the healthy condition of our
agriculture and the export of the grains which
are grown have an imnportant effect on our
economy.
In other fields Canada's export attalaments,
on the whole, look promlisig. I wish to give
a little information with reference ta these.
Exports of prlmary and semi-fabricated alumiùum have grown from- $211 million i
1955 to $268 million in 1960; iron ore exports,
from $100 million in 1955 to $155 million in
1960; crude and partially-reflned petroleum,
from, $36 million In 1955 ta $94 million i
1960. Other products of our mines and factories are contributing substantially ta the
export effort. Governinent policies should resuit i future improvements in this area.
Here in Canada there have been varlous
other developments with a more direct influence on our export; industry. Certainly a
most significant one was the readjustment of
the value of the Canadian dollar followig
the budget of December 1960. There can be
no daubt, honourable senators, but that this
must have gone some way ta answer the
frequent complaint; that Canadian goods are
too hlghly priced ta be campetitive abroad.
I think I amn safe i saylng that the readjustinent has icreased the price o f wheat
ta the Canadian Wheat Board by about 20
cents a bushel, and the f amers wlll benefit
by that.
As gratifylng as it la ta have Canada highly
regarded as a fleld of lnvestmnent, we should
not allow that ivestment ta so dlstort; the
exchange value af aur monetary unit as ta
cripple aur export lndustry. When the investment ceases, as it surely wMl one day, we
shail need the lndustry even mare.

SENATE
Honourable senators will recall the Export
Trade Promotion Conference, called by the
Minister of Trade and Commercé in December
1960. A really intensive effort was made to
educate Canadian businessmen to the possibilities of export trade. It will never be
fully known how great a benefit grew out of
this conference, but it is a certainty that
up to the end of last September almost a
thousand new agencies were opened abroad
for the sale of Canadian products, and these
were directly attributable to the conference.
It is also known that $22 million in new
sales abroad by the end of last October can
be attributed to that conference. This effort
to get the message across to people in Canada
who should be in the export field is still
going on.
Honourable senators will have heard of the
conferences which have been going on in
the major cities across Canada in the past
year. When the twelfth and last of these
conferences is held in Montreal on February
14, it is confidently expected that all of the
major businessmen, and a good many of the
thousands of small businessmen, in Canada
will be aware of the many facilities which
exist to help them in the export market. Here
I would like to pay a modest tribute to the
Honourable Mr. Hees, our Minister of Trade
and Commerce, who has been greatly responsible for bringing these arrangements
about.
I should like to mention briefly the Exports
Credit Insurance Corporation, which is receiving wonderful co-operation from the chartered
banks. It will be recalled that recently it was
announced that the maximum guarantee extended by the Government under this program
would have to be increased from the $100
million originally provided to $400 million.
The reason for this was that by the end of
the year guarantee contracts totalling $214
million were completed, in process of completion, or under study. The use of these
facilities gives some indication of the vacuum
which existed before the program was instituted. Honourable senators have no doubt
heard of the recent large sale of 70 diesel
locomotives at a value of $14 million to
Argentina, providing an estimated 1,800,000
man hours of work for Canadians.
Without the benefit of these insurance
facilities, this and other contracts would most
certainly have been beyond the reach of our
Canadian industries. Somewhat along the
same lines is the guarantee which the Government has extended to the Wheat Board in
order to allow it to enter into the sale to
China of 233.4 million bushels of grain. I
might point out that this is the type of
encouragement which the Government can
give without necessarily spending any money

whatever. There is, of course, always a risk
of default, but it is a risk which a government, and perhaps only a government, is
in a position to evaluate and, if necessary,
bear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask a question on
that point? Would the honourable leader
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) inform the house if a
down payment by China has already been
made, and whether that country has been
given a term of years in which to pay for
the wheat it is getting from Canada?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I do not have those
figures here.
Hon. Mr. Reid: You can sell anything on
credit.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: Honourable senators, I
have some general remarks to make before
closing.
Before going on to consider some of the
things the Canadian Government is doing outside Canada to help exporters, I want to make
a few general comments about the trading
world of today. Among the significant trading
nations, the old division between those who,
generally speaking, supplied the raw materials and those who processed them is completely gone. Even the less industriallydeveloped African and Asian nations are making strenuous efforts to process their own
raw materials. There is not only an economic
motive for this, but it involves issues of
national prestige and pride.
On the other side of the fence, within their
own borders, even highly-industrial nations
are by no means neglecting the encouragement of their own agriculture and other basic
industries. We tend perhaps to think of the
European Common Market as a huge industrial complex, hungering for our food surplus.
In actual fact about 70 million of the 170 million people in the Common Market area are
engaged in agriculture and the fish and forest
industries. About 25 per cent of the people in
the Common Market countries are farmers, as
against about 12 per cent in Canada. Economists deprecate such a situation because it is
obvious that some countries are naturally
equipped to produce certain things more
cheaply and efficiently than others. It is
nevertheless one of the facts of life which
must be faced and it calls not only for skilful negotiation on the part of the governments
but initiative and hard work from private
industry. We not only must continue pushing the traditional exports in which our advantage is marked but we must also canvass every possibility of selling new items
for which we have not hitherto been noted.
Foreign governments must be persuaded that

JANUARY 30. 1962
it is in their interests as weil as ours
that the products we produce best be admitted into their countries free of unfair
competition. Needless to say, this is a give
-and take proposition and we must expect to
make some concessions as well. The point I
most particularly want to make is that this
activity on a governimentai level goes on
ail the time and in a variety of ways. Negotiations at GATT or formai contacts with
the European Economic Community perhaps
attract most public notice, but the fact should
not be overlooked that our Government is continually exploring and appraising the situation and encouraging the adjustments which
must be made to meet the changes as they
come along. Not less imnportant than the
governmental efforts however are those of
the producer, the exporter and the distribution agencies, because the success of goverrmental negotiation depends in good part
on our demonstrated ability to deliver goods
which are better, are cheaper, are acceptable
to the foreign consumer, and can be obtained when wanted.
In the countries to which we seil or hope
to seil, we are making a three-pronged seliing attack. First of ail Canada's trade cornmissioners in f orty-nine countries of the
world are really digging for new business.
This is flot a question of sitting in an office
in an aura of diplomatie calm, processing
queries from. home about foreigu markets.
These men have been intensively trained.
They know what Canada can do and they
are bending every effort to make the opportun.ity for Canada to do it. One of the resuits
of the Trade Promotion Conference was that
these men came home and met many Canadian businessmen, and the businessmen
gained a new appreciation of the knowledge
and capabillty of the commnissioners. Needless to say, the commissioners must be backed
up by the export industry. Whatever good
groundwork they may lay, it is still industry
that must produce the goods.
Complementary to the fuil-time efforts of
the trade commissioners are tahose of the
trade missions wbich are now being sent in
increasing numbers into potential market
areas. In October, 1961, after careful study
and evaluation of six missions sent abroad
in the previous year, the Minister of Trade
and Commerce announced that twenty-four
new missions would go out between then
and the end of 1962. From the results obtained
to date, it is clear that the missions are performing a most essential job. Foreign
importers, brokers and distributors who
usually have the task of actuaily placing our
goods before the consumer have continually
stressed the importance of seeing some of the
people with whom they are doing business.
26211-3--4

Ideally, of course, every exporter should
make frequent cails in his market area but
this is flot; always possible, especiaily when
the initial volume of business is modest in
size. Through the use of trade missions, however, representative businessmen go into the
market areas and carry out this important
contact. By personal contact they are able to
overcome or help to overcome some of the
obstacles to greater Canadian participation
in those markets.
Han. Mr. Roebuck: Can the honourable
Leader of the Government give us the nuxnber of the people abroad representing the
Departmnent of Trade and Commerce and
the cost of maintaining them?
Hon. Mr. Aseljine: No, I have not that
information.
The members of the trade missions are
experienced men in the particular industry
their mission represents; they can analyse the
market and, as f ar as possible, sort out any
problems on the spot, and finaily report to
ail members of the industry at home so that
ail may benefit from the efforts of the mission. A great many of these people who go
on foreign missions are themselves the manufacturers and producers o! the goods and
they go at their own expense.
Our missions differ from. those sent out
by some other countries ini that they are
generaily sma]l ini size and highly specialized.
Up until recently many Canadian industries
have been soiely oriented towards domestic
or traditional markets. The trade missions
have served not; oniy to draw the attention
of Canadians to other export possibilities but
aiso to indicate the necessity of more cooperation and consultation wîthin the industries than has been usual in the past. Problems o! quality standards, packaging, and
labeling are among those which cail for collective activity in some cases.
I thlnk the Minister of Trade and Commerce is to be congratulated on his efforts
in respect to these trade missions. He is -doing
an excellent job and one that is absolutely
essential. if we are going to increase our
trade, which is what we are out to do.
0f the trade missions sent out in 1961,
some were sent to Europe to study the oilseeds and paper possibilities. Another, concerned with lumber and wood products, went
to the eastern United States. This year some
of the missions planned are as foilows: A
fisheries mission will visit the Caribbean and
Latin America for the purpose o! looking
into the possibilities of greater markets for
our sait fish from the Atlantic provinces and
Quebec. Another fisheries mission wil go
to Europe, where a growing demand for

SENATE
frozen foods holds out promise of better markets for frozen flsh froiu both our coastal
and inland fisheries. Forest products missions
will go to the Middle East, the United
Kingdom, the Common Market countries,
Latin America and the eastern United States.
Other missions wrnl visit Australia, New
Zealand, Israel and the Scandinavian countries.
A very important one will be the Canadian
Home Heating Equipment Mission which next
month will visit Britain and the continent
to demonstrate home-heating equipment manufactured in Canada. Honourable senators who
have visited these countries and have run into
a cold speil know how difficuit it is to keep
warm. As one of the world's manufacturers
of efficient heating apparatus, we hope to be
able to enter that great market and supply
millions of dollars' worth of heating equipment. This home-heating equipment mission
will visit London, Manchester, Glasgow, Amnsterdam, Hamburg, Dusseldorf and Paris. It
leaves on February 7 and returns on March 5.
Finally, honourable senators, the third
prong of our export attack is in the form of
much greater participation by Canada in exhibiting at fairs abroad. Trade commissioners
and trade missions are, perforce, llmited to
contacts in business circles. To influence the
eventual consumers to buy, it is necessary that
they be exposed to Canadian products. In
1962 Canada will have exhibits at thirty-four
international fairs, and as planned so far for
1963 we will have exhibits at an additional
twenty-one fairs. Expectations are that over
18 million people will see and, in some cases,
sample Canadian products at the fairs
planned.

We are having All-Canadian f airs in the
new market areas of Ghana and Nigeria, at
which about eighty Canadian companies will
exhibit their products. M6st of the participating companies will be sending Canadian company representatives to work with their local
agents at the exhibits which they have prepared to show at these two, fairs.
In one of our more traditional markets
Canada will be the largest exhibitor. I speak
of the Ideal Home Exhibition ini London.
Among the exhibits will be a haif-scale model
house designed to illustrate the principles of
timber frame construction as applied to
typical British house design. Many of you who
are familiar with the United Kingdom will Ïbe
interested in knowing that timber framed
homes, unthought of there a few decades ago,
are now gaining considerable popularity.
Honourable senators, 1 hope that I have
aclded sornething to your appreciation of what
exports mean to our economy and what is
being done to stimulate and encourage them.
In spite of all that has been done we cannot
afford to rest on our laurels. The unofficial
estimate that our exports increased in 1961 by
7j per cent over 1960 is most gratlfying, but
we must bend every effort to continue that
significant trend. In view of the critical influence of exports on our economlc prospects,
I am sure you will agree that these efforts are
well justifled, and I arn confident that they
will yield even more impressive dividends
in the future.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday, consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Méthot, seconded
by Hon. Mr. Hollett, for an address in reply
thereto.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
my first task today is to ask your indulgence
to permit me to refer to our colleagues who
have passed away within the last six or
eight months. Unfortunately I was unavoidably absent from the house when tributes
were paid to the late Senators Euler and
Bradette. I was in an equally unfortunate

situation when reference was made to the
passing of the late Senators Léger and
Golding.
Senator Euler served a long and honourable time in Parliament. He was elected in
1917, at a time when there was much upset
in our Canadian political scene. It is interesting to reflect that until his death he, along
with the honourable senator from DeLorimier
(Hon. Mr. Vien), the honourable senator from
Gulf (Hon. Mr. Power), and myself were the
last remaining members elected to the House
of Commons in 1917. Now that Senator Euler
bas gone there are left only three of the
"Mohicans" who were elected at that time.
My association with Senator Euler began
almost immediately the new Parliament was
summoned in 1917. I sat in council with him
for a number of years and had the highest
admiration for his many fine qualities. At
heart Senator Euler was a shy man; be was
a very sensitive soul; and I have always
thought that the unfortunate experience he
passed through in the city of Kitchener in
1917, when a group of hoodlums insisted that
he kiss the Union Jack, left its mark upon
him in all the after years. But though he
was a shy and sensitive man, he had great
administrative capacity. In my judgment,
for what it is worth, Senator Euler was one
of the best administrators there has been in
a government department in my time. Let
me add that he was not a popular administrator. When be was in the Customs Department, one of the most difficult departments
to administer, and someone, such as a member of Parliament, asked some favour he
turned a stony eye upon the request unless
it was within the law to grant it. It is a
fine thing when a public administrator
charged with the conduct of an important
Government department adopts that attitude
of fidelity to his responsibility.
He was a well-informed man, a man whose
judgment on public questions I respected
very highly, and I might add that it was
respected also by his colleagues and associates. He has now gone to his reward, and we
have but our memories of him.
As to the late Senator Bradette I can say
that he was one of the most lovable men we
have ever had in this bouse. He was not
a giant in intellect, but he had a shrewd
common sense marked with a fine sense of
humour. In his personal relationships he was
the most charming of persons, and no one
could have been more straightforward and
honourable than he. We shall all miss our
late colleague, Senator Bradette.
I come now to those who have passed
away in more recent weeks. With Senator
Léger my acquaintanceship was very slight,
but I always respected him. He had a fine

JANUARY 31. 1962
record of achievement. He was flot one of the
most voluble speakers in titis chamber, nar
was he Sa i the House of Cammons, but
hie attended the committee meetings and he
follawed with interest the work of the house.
His passing is indeed a loss.
Lastly, I have to refer to the late Senator
Golding. He also, was not a giant in intellect,
but there have been few men in Parliament
in my time who had shrewder and sounder
common sense and judgment than had Senator Golding. After ail, as someone has said,
wisdom, is but the essence af common sense.
Senator Golding was a wise man. He had
a record of fine service bef are he came
into Parliament many years ago, and he
served faithfully and with distinction as a
member of the House of Cammons and later
as a member of this chamber.
We ail mourn the passing of these fine
coileagues, but I venture to, say that those
of us on this side of the bouse who marched
with themn in the sunsbine and the rain
will perhaps hold more claseiy in aur memories their achievements during their period
of life with us.
Honourable senators, before coming ta the
motion b-efare us, I do have some other
obligations ta discharge. The first is to you,
Mr. Speaker. We are ail delighted ta see you
back with your usual vigour. We are delighted to see you because we like you and
we respect you. You have always been fair,
and I can say without any effort whatever
at Irish blarney, such as that wbich my
banaurable friend from Gulf (Han. Mr.
Power) could indulge in under similar circumstances, that we ail respect you and wish
you well.
My next task is particularly pleasant. It is
ta congratulate the honourable Leader of the
Government in this house, my oid friend
Senator Aseltine, an bis jaining the brotherhood o! the Privy Cauncil. Quite a substantial
number of these gentlemen are abraad in the
land. It is flot witbout some significance, and
I trust I may not be misunderstood if I refer
ta it, that in this company in point of service
and seniarity I now stand second. And so as
one of the oid stagers, wha is pretty well
dated by that !act, I welcame the most recent
recruit and trust that bis association with the
Privy Cauncil will be as long and as bappy
as mine bas been.
My next task is ta make reference ta the
honaurable senators wha moved and seconded
the motion under cansideration. The mover,
Senatar Méthot, discharged bis duty llke an
aid veteran, although he had been here anly
a few years. We ail like Senator Méthat, and
sanie a! us on this side regret that palitical
fortune did not place hlm differently. We
respect bim, and I compliment him on the

excellence of bis speech in moving the address
in reply to the Speech froin the Throne, for
in itself this motion was a heavy burden as
I sball endeavour ta point out before too
long.
May I also welcome the new senator from
Newfoundland, Senator Hoilett, whose designation I believe is Burin. 1 am flot sure that
I have pronounced it correctly.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: When the bonourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) referred ta him yesterday as a distinguisbed graduate of Oxford University in
England, bemng strong in tbe field of mathematics, I knew we had a most distinguished
addition ta aur assenibly. It was almost frightening ta nme, an aid senator wbo was reared
an the hard-bitten Prairies seventy-odd years
ago. Nevertheless, I welcome Senatar Hollett,
and I venture ta express the hope that his
interest and skill i mathematics may afford
hlm the opportunity o! totalling up sanie
figures and placing themn before tbe Government in respect to d~ur financial situation. I
can assure bum that were bie to do so he
would be rendering a most useful service ta
his country.
I came now ta the Speech froni the Thrane
itself. To say the least, it is an interesting
document. I read it through carefully, weighing ail the sentences. It reminded me of a
stary I heard niany years ago about the late
William Jennings Bryan, who was an eminent
public man in tbe United States 65 years aga,
when, at the age o! 36 years, hie was the
Democratic candidate for the presidency of
the Republlc. He was known as the silvertangued aratar from the Platte-the Platte
being a river in that part a! the United States
from, wbich hie came. There were, of course,
no television or radio broadcasts in those
days and if you wanted to bear a man speak
you bad ta attend a meeting hie was addressing. It is not a nostalgia for aid tumes, but
perbaps those conditions bad same advantages
over what we have today. A Nebraskan-and
Bryan was a Nebraskan-was visiting Chicago after Bryan had created quite a stir in
the country. A Chicago friend asked the
Nebraskan, "What are Bryan's speeches like?"
The Nebraskan replied, "Oh, Bryan's speeches
are like tbe river Platte, which is a thousand
miles long, ten miles wide at its mouth and
two feet deep".
I amn bound ta say that when I read the
Speech from tbe Throne-perhaps it was iii
will on my part, although I think not-this
stary about Bryan was brougbt back ta niy
memory.

The first thing that struck me on reading
the speech was nat anly its length but

SENATE
its character. There was something in it for
almost everyone. Notwithstanding the fact
that we have had huge deficits for five years
and that our deficit for the present fiscal
year will probably exceed, if current estimates are right, the estimate of $650 million
given by the Minister of Finance when he
-elivered his last budget, we are apparently
about to embark on another program of
spending that will add very appreciably to
the burden of our finances.
There are only two legitimate ways in
which a government can meet its financial
obligations and pay its bills. One is through
taxation, increasing revenue by imposing more
taxation upon the people. The other is by
borrowing from the public or public institutions. If those two methods fail then
a government is in a rather difficult position,
but it always has a remedy. I am speaking,
of course, of the central governinent, for it
controls the issue of money and the money
supply. The provinces are in a different
position. As some provinces did in the 1930's,
they must impose more taxes, or cut down
spending, or go into default on their bond
interest. This has not been an uncommon
experience in the United States.
These were some of the reflections that
came to my mind as I read the Speech
from the Throne. In one paragraph we were
told that further measures to stimulate the
economic activities of the country would be
placed before us in a proposal to build
a railway in the Gaspé Peninsula. I have no
doubt whatever that this railway will be of
service. In the same paragraph is forecast
a proposal to assist the province of Manitoba
in building a floodway around the city of
Winnipeg.
Twelve years ago this coming spring, the
city of Winnipeg had a disastrous flood.
Periodic floods have occurred in Winnipeg's
history at intervals of around 25 to 50 years.
The estimated cost of this floodway is, I
believe, $80 million. It will be some 30-odd
miles in length. Its purpose is to tap the
waters of the Red River about 12 miles south
of Winnipeg and bring them around in an
arc to about 20 miles north of Winnipeg. The
federal Government's contribution to that
floodway is 60 per cent. As a Manitoban
perhaps I should not criticize this expenditure.
However, the probability is that we will not
have a flood for many years. Before building
a floodway at this particular time it would be
wise to consider that our finances are in disarray and that our budgets are so much out
of balance that such an undertaking could be
postponed for a few years until our finances
are in a better condition.

There is also embraced in this proposal
the building of a canal, or a ditch, or a floodway, from the Assiniboine River west of
Portage la Prairie to Lake Manitoba. This
would be about 18 miles in length. Of course,
on top of that, under the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act a huge dam is being built at
federal expense on the Assiniboine River at
a point a couple of hundred miles west of
Winnipeg to hold back flood waters.
I do not wish to leave the impression that
these expenditures or proposals are not
worthy of consideration. I think they are.
What I submit to the house is that these
projects, as well as others I shall mention in
a moment, could very well be deferred until
our finances are in a little better order than
they are now.
There is another measure to increase the
total amount that may be made available to
the Export Credits Insurance Corporation.
I have no particular criticism of that either.
We shall have to wait until the legislation
comes and see what the proposals are. All I
wish to point out is that I fear this too will
make another drain on Mr. Fleming's
resources.
There is to be an amendment to broaden
the scope of the Small Businesses Loans Act,
and that falls into the saine category.
Then we have the provision for a new
kind of distribution of electric power. In the
terms of the Speech from the Throne, apparently this does not involve any expenditure
of money at the present time; but may I
say in passing that I think it will be a pretty
difficult proposition to induce the provinces
to come into a federal scheme for the distribution of electrical energy back and
forth across provincial boundaries. I offer
the observation that it would be wise for
the federal Government to keep away from
it and to let the individual provinces make
these arrangements among themselves. There
is nothing more disturbing today, to my way
of thinking, at any rate, than the apparent
differences that are growing up between the
federal authority and the provincial authorities. As we all know, in family affairs, when
money is involved between rival claimants it
often generates a deeper feeling of animosity
than anything else does. I sometimes feel
there is something of that today in the whole
range of our federal-provincial relations.
When I first came to Parliament in 1917,
one of my colleagues in Sir Robert Borden's
Union Government was the Honourable Arthur
Sifton, who had been the Premier of Alberta.
After the election Mr. Sifton presented me
with a volume of our Constitution, that is,
the British North America Act, and all the

JANUARY si, 1912
amndments to it. He said, III arn giving this
to you because I hope you will go far in
public life. If you do, may I say to you that
there is no surer way of meinteining unity
in this country than by maintaining the right
kind af reiationship between the provinces
and the federai authority, where each looks
after its own respansibilities." I think there
was a great deel of truth in that observation.
Our provincial and federal affairs are so
now intertwined and nuxed up, arising out
of rnoney needs, that I fear we will have
increasing friction. We have a manifestation
of it today in the difficul.ties between British
Columbia and the federal authority over the
Columbia River. Another manifestation is in
the province of Quebec, where we see a type
of movement afoot, which I can understend
but I hope will not go very far, towards
separating Quebec from Confederation.
Other criticisms are sometimes levelled by
public leaders in provincial affairs, that the
federal authority is too niggardly in giving
them. money. On other occasions we find that
the provincial authority says ta ciaiments,
"lWe]l, this is a federal responsibilty." Some
municipalities corne to the local government
and say, "'We want your help in this." The
reply goes back, "Oh, no, that is a federal
responsibility.'l And sa it goes. To my mind,
this has elements of dangers in it. I have no
hesitation in saying ta this bouse that so fer
as I arn concerned I would like ta see the
responsibflities of the provinces vis-a-vis the
federal authority clearly defined, and let each
do its own part in trying ta reach some
readjustmnent of general revenues, so that
each authority can discharge its obligations
within its own sphere.
Then there is a proposal ta expand scientific research. I think that is sound. However,
I sometimes wonder if there is not a great
deal ai averlapping lu the expenditures ai
moneys on research. Research work is being
cerried -on by corporations, by universities,
and by the federai Government, and I suspect a good deal oi overlapping occurs.
Next I wish ta mention the question ai the
maintenance of fair prices for -f armn and
fishery products. That has taken a good deal
ai expenditure in the past. It has a very
attractive and alluring appeal, end ai course
if a governiment is wiflbng ta hand out moliey
for a particular lnterest or ta eany particular
comrnunity, it will elways find. many takers
who are. wifltng ta avail themselves ai it.
The money is nat always wisely expended.
For exemple, we have at the present lime
aver 200 million paunds ai butter lu Canada.
That is the result oi maintaining a price
itructure on butter that is tao high lu relation ta cream. which goes into the making af

butter. The butter surplus is continually pling up. 'me proposai advanced, and I have
no doubt the Governrnent wiil agree ta it, is
ta reduce the price af butter ta cansurners by
the difference between 64 cents end 50 cents
and ta make Up the loss ta the praducers by
a subsldy. 'mat is a blessed word-subsidy.
We have a subsidy for this and a subsidy for
that. But, honaurable senators, there has
neyer been a subsidy peîd anywhere in this
country yet for which. the taxpayer did not
have ta foot the bill, and if aur burden ai
taxation is as oppressive, as I believe it is,
then this method ai granting additional subsidies should be rnost carefully scrutinized.
Then there is alsa the proposai which we
shahl have before us in a day or so ta pay
acreage payments ta farmers. I refer ta the
proposai in the supplementary estimates. Naw
the acreage payrnents will be ai the order af
$42 million. Again, as a Westerner I may be
accused af disloyalty ta the Prairie country,
but 1 arn bound ta say that in the vast
majority of instances those payrnents are not
vitelly necessary to farmers. I know ai farmers
who have grass incarnes af from. $15,000 ta
$20,000 a year, yet each one ai them is going
ta get bis $200 under this praposed acreage
payment scheme. I know it is difficult ta do,
but if it were possible ta segregete those
who are in real need end pay it ta them,
we would save a substential sum. ai rnoney
because I ventu4re ta remind the house now
thet when this suppiementery estimate goes
through, aur total spending for this year will
elready-and we are two manths away from,
the end ai the fiscal year-be approachlng
and not very fer from $7 billion. If anyane
thinks thet is peenuts, he had better think
agein.
Now I corne ta the next Item,4 and this is
reelly the prize one-old age securlty. The
Government proposes ta increase at once, or
as soon as legislation is passed, old age
security payments by $10 a manth. That wMf
be a great boon ta gentlemen lilce, for instance, aur colleague from, Vancouver South
(Han. Mr. Farris) and his seatrnate aur colleague fram Wellington (Han. Mr. Howard).
I arn sure they need thet additional pension.
I also wifl be a beneficlary. Honourable
senatars, if we pay this additional pension

SENATE

the federal authority for those mentioned in
the 65 to 70 age group. Now, could we not
have managed for another year or two, until
our finances are in better shape, instead of
putting this out at the present time? When
the old age security committee sat in 1950,
which was a joint committee of the Senate
and the House of Commons, there was an
implied intention in their report that the
contributory system should be considered in
introducing the pension, then $40 a month.
It was never intended that the pension granted
would be the sole means of support of the
person who receives it. It was to be a supplementary aid to him in difficult circumstances.
When Mr. Harris, the Minister of Finance
in 1957, in the face of an election, raised
the pension $6 a month to $46-and he
was greatly criticized for doing so littlehe was within a fine fraction of a point
in matching the increase in the cost of living
that had taken place from 1950 to 1957.
And yet, so alluring was the prospect of
getting votes, this was all thrown to the
winds. The promise of $55 a month, by a
further increase of $9 in the pension, rightly
or wrongly-and I never thought it had
such an impact as did others-was given as
the reason why the Conservative party was
so successful at the polls.
I put it to this house, to honourable gentlemen opposite: Is that the honourable way
to try to win elections?
Hon. Mr. Hnatyshyn: What about the promise of $75 a month?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My honourable friend's
political thinking is running away with his
judgment at the present moment. I have no
more sympathy with the $75 pension, and
I will not be found supporting it unless it
is on a fully contributory principle. If it
is on a contributory principle, yes. I do not
care how large a pension is paid provided
it is based on a contributory principle. The
weakness in our whole pension scheme today
is that the contributory principle was never
considered when it was established.
Life insurance companies have proof that
if a young person contributes regularly
month by month during his earning years,
he could provide for himself a pension substantially greater than that which can be
reached under the law we are now considering. I will venture this further assertion,
and I may find very few supporters in the
house, that if a way can be found-and I
believe it could be found-to take this whole
business of pensions out of the hands of
Government altogether, so far as direct administration is concerned, I think we would
be immensely further ahead. It is possible.

The life insurance companies have in many
cases developed pension plans which they
are operating for corporations. They have
also developed annuities plans that are very
attractive. It is possible to find some way
whereby looking forward 25 or 30 years, we
could ultimately get our whole business 9f
pensions in Canada on a sound actuarial
basis, a sound administrative system, but
only on the basis that the individual who
is to get the pension would make his contribution to it. For those who are unfortunate
and who could not make the contributions
some way could be found to accommodate
them without anything like the high cost
that is incurred today.
Old age pension payments this year will
run well over $600 million.
When the joint committee recommended
pensions they did not envisage that by 19,62
we would be paying out perhaps $625 million
in old age pensions. As a matter of fact, it
was found necessary a few years ago, as honourable senators will recall, to supplement
the income of the pension fund, which was
then financed on what was known as the 2-2-2
formula-that is, 2 per cent of corporation
tax, 2 per cent of personal income tax, and
2 per cent of the sales tax. When the fund
was running behind, and Treasury had to advance money to keep the pension payments
flowing, those percentages were raised 50 per
cent, to 3 per cent in each case. As a result
the fund built up a surplus, though not very
large considering the amount involved; but in
the month of November last, with the 3-3-3
formula, the fund ran behind by $1 million.
Probably from this time on the pension payments out of the fund each month will be
more than the amount paid in. It does not require much imagination to foresee where we
shall be before very long, under those circumstances. That, let me repeat, is in face of a
deficit which this fiscal year promises from
all indications to exceed the deficit of $650
million estimated by the Minister of Finance
in his last budget. At the end of the first
eight months, that is up to the end of November, the deficit had reached $304 million; and
the last four months of the year are, of course,
by far the most expensive ones. Last year
the deficit was $45 million over the same period. So, for the last fiscal year, as compared
to the previous fiscal year, the deficit for the
first eight months was more than six times
that of a year ago. I submit that is not a very
healthy state of affairs.
At the moment, that is all I wish to say on
this matter of social security. I am not opposed to social security: I am in favour of it,
but I say now, and always have said, that I
have a grave doubt as to the soundness of the
practice of making handouts to people. The

SENATE
the Throne-only spend, spend, spend. Indeed, we might be i the sunny climate of
Italy so far as our financial. outlook is concerned. The Speech from the Throne makes
no reference to aur difficulties in that regard,
and yet I submit to this house that that is
one of the most important things, if flot the
mast important thing, which faces this country today.
There is nothing more to be feared than
a depreciatian in the value of aur currency.
If we go an with deficits as we have been
and if we go on with the free spending, not
only here but in our provinces and elsewhere, then 1 think it is inevitable that we
shall have a currency expansion, and once
we get on that slippery slope-and we are
now teetering on the edge-it is a very difficuit matter ta, stop sliding.
My honaurable friend, the Leader of the
Governmnent (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) shakes his
head. I repeat, if we continue as we have
been doing what other answer is theref The
Government must pay its bis. I fancy that
if any of us failed ta get aur indemnity
cheque at the end of the month we wauld
want ta know what had happened. I do not
think there is much doubt about that. The
Government must pay its bis. As I said
earlier, the federal Government cannot go
broke, in the critical sense, but the people
may suifer disastrously in the end if the
Gavernment's policies are flot wise
and sound.'
I think I have talked long enough, honourable senators, but there is one other matter
I should like ta mention and that is that this
program-and in this I certainly do not want
ta be unfair-seems ta indicate that we shall
have an election within the next year. I arn
not criticizing the Government particularly
because, unfortunately, the same thing is ta
some extent found in ather political parties
today; but there is this attitude that if you
are going ta win public support you must
hand out favours ta the public. I do nat
believe in that and I make na bones about
saying so. I think the respansibility is upon
the members of Parliament; in this and in the
other house so ta manage the business aifairs
of this country that aur people have a chance
ta work, ta save, and ta prosper, and that we
should not try ta win their support by these
dubiaus means.
There Is no doubt in my mind that the
1958 election which Mr. -Diefenbaker cauld
have won without making a single promise
was an unfortunate occurrence for this country. This theory that it is necessary ta spend
public money ta win the support of the
electorate certainly is a dangerous one, and
I would like ta register my protest against
it, and I care flot who is criticized by rny
saying that.

Honourable senators, five years fram. now
we will celebrate the centenary of Canfederatian. Thase of us who are familiar with the
conditions which existed between Ontario and
Quebec 100 years aga realize very fuily
indeed the tremendaus task that the Fathers
of Confederation faced when they finally met
in Québec ta agree on the resalutions that
formed the basis of aur Constitution. That
was *a time when palitical differences were
perhaps stranger and more fierce than they
have ever been since. Yet, the Fathers of
Confederation were big enou-gh. men ta farget
ail this for the time being, and ta meet
tagether and finally bring into eifect the
Constitution under which we have worked
f or 95 years.
That was a tremendaus achievement, but
taday, make no mistake about it, the country
is facing very grave problems. Nat anly is the
international situation bad; there are matters
as ta the Cammon Market-about which
I would have liked ta* have said samething,
but which time forbids-and many other
things, which place us in a very grave position with respect ta the world. What the outcorne will be fia one knows, but I submit ta
this house that the first and primary duty of
every member af every Parliament in Canada
is ta conduct aur aifairs and business so
that we may build strength inta aur country,
s0 that we may build unity inta aur country,
and to that Canada will came ta be recagnized
throughout the world as one of the best
instances of the freedom we talk so much
about but often do sa little about.
Han. Mr. Harner: Honourable senators, I
would like ta ask the honourable senatar
a question. He mentioned the Columbia River
situation. Would he care ta answer as ta what
he would do in that situation, or as ta which
party is right?
Han. Mr. Reid: I will answer that later on.
Han. Mr. Crerar: I have my views about
the Columbia River situation which I shal

You, Mr. Speaker, I congratulate most
heartily on your recent appointment as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the National Theatre School of Canada. This, along
with your many other arduous duties, we
know you will execute in your usual distinguished and affable manner.
Honourable senators, this afternoon I wish
to emphasize the humanitarian views taken
and promises fulfilled by our Prime Minister,
the Right Honourable John G. Diefenbaker,
in the field of social justice and of the conservation and protection of human resources.
Neyer before has such a record been equailed
in a similar period of Canadian history. I
do not dlaim that the Conservative Government has solved ail the problems by any
means. It has neyer made sur-h a dlaim. But
I do Say that its record is one of a very
creditable performance.
Pessîndstic utterances must be recognized,
and the best way that this can be done is
by exanining some of the outeries that have
been raised and then stating the facts as
we find them. When anybody accepts the
role of a prophet then we must necessarily
look back and examine the records of the
past.

SENATE
We have been told that the present
Government has been notoriously unable to
carry out its promises. Honourable senators,
I know that you have all read Maclean's
magazine-a publication which has never
been regarded as a Conservative handbookof September 23, 1961, which had this to
say:
Out of 62 pledges made by the Prime
Minister during the 1957-58. campaign,
50 have already been kept or are in the
process of being discharged.
Personally, I consider this an excellent record. Remember, also, that this statement
was made in the month of September last.
The present Government, in economie as
well as other aspects of our public affairs,
is guided by the great principles laid down
at the time of Confederation. Ours is a
nation dedicated to the high ideals of partnership-partnership between the Government and the people, partnership between the
provinces, partnership between public and
private enterprise, and partnership with the
nations of the Commonwealth. One aspect
of the partnership between Government and
the business community which is often overlooked is that while our respective responsibilities may be largely equal in the economic
sphere, this is far from being the case in the
broad field of social justice.
It is true, of course, that business at
all levels has gradually yet steadily assumed
an ever-increasing share of social responsibility. The development of corporate pensions, fringe benefits, limitation of working
hours, profit-sharing, and other measures,
are all, in one way or another, an enlightened
form of the sharing of profits and prosperity
with all those who have had a part in making
them possible.
Government responsibility, and particularly
that of national government in this field, has
increased to a much greater extent than that
of business. People of any community are
divided into two main groups: first, those
who are able to obtain a share of the fruits
of private enterprise and to maintain a high
standard of living, and second, though not as
large as the first but equally as important
and deserving, those who for reasons of one
kind or another beyond their control are
unable to fit into the highly competitive,
high-speed atmosphere of the corporate enterprise system. For the welfare of this second
group chiefiy, government must accept responsibility.
The Conservative Government, upon taking
office, assured every Canadian that every
man, woman and child had the right of a
citizen, that each had the right to share in
the progress and prosverity of the nation. It

is the view of our Government that private
enterprise must operate at a level of efficiency that will provide the necessities of
life for every Canadian. It is the prime and
proper function of government to do everything within its power to help make that
system function in the general interest, and
to assume a full measure of responsibility for
those social requirements which by their very
nature cannot be assumed by business and
the business community.
While the cost of living under the Conservative administration has risen by 8.3 per
cent, today 75 per cent of all Canadians who
pay personal income tax pay less than they
did under the previous Liberal administration, thus showing a substantial improvement
in our standard of living. Every year since
1957 Canadians have earned more, spent more
and saved more that ever before. To prove
this point let us analyse the statistics of
labour income.
Honourable senators will find that in 1956,
the last complete year the Liberal party was
in office, labour income per man employed
stood at the annual level of $2,666, whereas
in October 1961, the last month for which I
could obtain official figures, the level was
$3,174. In terms of total labour income this
has increased from $14,890 million in 1956
to $19,642 million by October 1961, an increase of $4,752 million.
Of course, our labour force has also increased. In December 1956, we had 5,828,000
workers, in contrast to a labour force in
December 1961, of 6,082,000, an increase of
254,000.
In answer to criticism from the Opposition
benches, I consider that the last four years
have been good years for business and for
Canadians generally. The most significant
public proof of that is the evidence of the
economists that Canada, with the second
highest standard of living in the world, has
weathered the hemispheric recession much
better than the United States, the only country with a higher standard of living.
The steady progress of the economy has
made possible the greatest increase in social
justice payments to Canadians in all our
history, an increase of 77 per cent, from a
total of $1.3 billion in 1956-57 to $2.3 billion
in 1960-61.
A part of this is due naturally to population increase, but let us remember that the
level of corporate profits before taxes has
been more than maintained. In the four years
1957 to 1960, compared with the previous
four years 1953 to 1956, corporate profits before taxes in Canada increased by more than
the total increase in social justice payments,
of from $11.2 billion to $12.6 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion. In other words, our

FEBRUARY 1, 1962
business economy during this period has fully
justified itself by demonstrating its ability
to pravide for this high level of increase in
the social needs of Canadians.
Let us compare fixe overail social grants
paid by the present Governiment in four
short years, as compared to those of the
previous administration. Tremendous strides
have been taken in tipping the scale in favour
of the average Canadian citizen-an increase
of 77 per cent, to be exact, and in the current
fiscal year the increase is expected to be
around 85 per cent.
The first grant to be considered is that
of family allowances, introduced during the
previous Governent's terni of office. In
1956-57 the payments amounted to $397,517,840, and in 1960-61 they had risen to
$506,191,647, an increase of $108,673,807, or
27.3 per cent.
Old age security payments have increased
even more. In March 1957 oid age security
payments were made ta 797,486 Canadians,
whiie in March 1961 the number of recipients had risen to 904,906, an increase of
107,420. The comparative amounts paid out
in these same periods are even more inpressive. The total for 1956-1957 was $379,111,374, while in 1960-61 it was $592,413,283,
an increase of $213,301,909, or 56.2 per cent.
During the past four years old age pensions and old age assistance payments were
increased to $55 a month. Later, residence
requirements were reduced fromn 20 ta 10
years, and for the first Urne pensioners who
meet the necessary qualifications may travel
ta and live in any part of the world, be it
for health or other reasons, for an unllmited
length of time and stili draw their pensions.
Blind and disability pensions were also
raised ta fixe maximum of $55 a month.
Since fixe opening of the present session
the Speech from. the Throne has forecast
a measure relating ta old age pensions. Since
that time we have been informed that,
after the fullest cansideratian, fihe Government has corne ta the conclusion that appropriate legislation will be placed before the
house ta increase old age pensions by $10
a month and ta increase the amaunt contributed ta aid age assistance, and pensions
ta blind and disabled persans on the saine
basis.

I shail now deal with the subject of
hospital insurance. This justice was first
promised by the Liberal Governmnent. They
seemingly forgot about it for 37 years, then
suddenly introduced it and put it on the
statute books. It was left, however, to the
present Government to bring it into effect
and pick up fixe tab. This was done in reality
within 12 months after it took office. To date
fixe Progressive Conservative Goverrment
has provided $664.6 million to the provinces
to assist in providing hospital care for
Canadians from coast to coast. For fixe fiscal
year 1960-61 the amount contributed was
$189,368,503, and the estimated forecast for
1961-62 is $274,491,000.
I now turn to a matter closely connected
with hospital insurance grants, that of hospital
construction. In this particular duty we find
that the Government of the day has increased
contributions by more than 177 per cent. In
1960-61 the total payment made was $17.5
million in camparison to $6.3 million in the
last year of the Liberal administration.
The last but in no way the least important
social justice grant I shall deal with is that
pertaining to veterans pensions. Our Government said that it would increase veterans pensions and dependants allowances. There is not
a veteran in this country who does not realize
what has been done in this connection. Because
the Progressive Conservative Government believed that the veterans pensions and dependants allowances were flot in keeping with the
responsibilities that they discharged, for with
the responsibilities of the nation tawards them,
it accordingly went ahead as promised. This
subj ect will be deait with fully later, but for
the record may I state that as a resuit of
changes in the veterans legisiation since mid1957, direct payments to and on behaif of
veterans are up by over 50 per cent, from
$200 million to $305 million. Nearly ail of this
increase is attributable to the impravements
made in the Pension Act, the War Veterans
Allowance Act, and the Veterans Land Act.
Comparative figures for the major continuing benefits under the Veterans Charter, as
at March 31, 1957, and as estimated for the
year ending March 31, 1962, and the net increases, are as follows:

HER MAJESTY QUEEN ELIZABETH II
TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF ACCESSION
TO THE THRONE

Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, on this day, the tenth anniversary
of the accession of Queen Elizabeth II to the
throne may I suggest that, for ber courageous
and successful trip to Africa last fall, for
her Christmas Day message, and for ber
numerous activities in the promotion of peace
during the last ten momentous years, it would
be a very gracious and appropriate gesture
if she were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize
for 1962.
Hon. Walter M. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I am sure we all wish to join with the
honourable senator from De la Durantaye
(Hon. Mr. Pouliot) in expressing felicitations
to Her Gracious Majesty The Queen on this
happy occasion. I agree most heartily with all
the honourable senator has said.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I am certain we are all most happy that
Her Majesty continues to enjoy the very best
of health and that she remains high in the
esteem and affection of us all. We rejoice
with her today, and more particularly as she
unites with her family in celebrating this
tenth anniversary of ber accession to the
throne. As the honourable senator from De
la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) mentioned,
she is indeed worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize
for 1962. Whether or not that honour is
conferred upon her, she remains the First
Lady of the land so far as Canada and the
other realms are concerned.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 1, 1962
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-51, for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money for
the public service for the financial year ending the 31st March, 1962.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second
time?

Hon. Walter M. Aseltine: With leave of the
Senate, I move second reading now.
Honourable senators, Bill C-51, cited as
Appropriation Bill No. 1, 1962, is in the same
form as similar bills presented at previous
sessions.
Clause 2 would grant $82,390,000, to be
paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund,
and clause 3 states that the money is to be
used for the purposes specified in the supplementary estimates contained in the schedule
to the bill. I shall not say anything more
about the bill itself at this time, but will
proceed to deal with vote No. 611 which has
to do with acreage payments.
Honourable senators will remember that
the Speech from the Throne forecast acreage
payments to the farmers of the Prairie provinces. This vote is for the purpose of carrying out that undertaking. It provides for
payments to the western grain producers to
be distributed on the basis of $1 per cultivated acre up to a maximum of 200 acres
per individual farm. The total amount
involved is $42 million.
These acreage payments, honourable senators, are deemed necessary for two reasons.
In the first place they are necessary to take
the place of a two-price systemn for wheat. As
you know, previous payments of similar
amounts were made in 1958 and again in
1960. The two-price system has long been
advocated by the western farmers for the
purpose of giving the actual producer a
higher price for wheat consumed domestically
than for wheat exported, but it has been
feared that a two-price system would serve
as an impediment to the marketing of agricultural products abroad and to free trade in
them. The acreage payments suggested would
provide the wheat producers with about the
same amount of money as they would obtain
frorn a two-price system, namely, approximately $45 million, and would not in any
way interfere with our export trade.
The second reason is to help rectify the
serious financial position in which the small
western producers, particularly, find themselves by virtue of the crop failure in 1961,
and also by reason of the effect of the costprice squeeze on them.
This method of financial assistance has been
adopted because it gives the smaller and
worse-off farmers the largest proportion of
the money being provided. Such farmers are
in the great majority, as will be seen from
the table of figures which I will present later.
Furthermore, acreage payments such as are
being distributed by this vote would not
stimulate production and thus increase surpluses which might be found difficult to dispose of. That is something we are anxious to

FEBRUARY S. 1962
avoid, now that we have reduced oui carryover of wheat from 770,600,000 bushels in
1960 to 488 million bushels in 1961. These
figures cover wheat in ail positions: on the
farm, in transit, and in commercial storage.
To emphasize the serious condition in which
the farmers of the three provinces find themselves, 1 would like to repeat some of the
information which I gave when speaking on
the address in reply, naxnely, that in 1961
Saskatchewan produced only 125 million
bushels of wheat compared to 308 million
bushels in 1960. That loss is going to be
severely feit in 1962. Also a serious feed
shortage resulted in 350,000 feeder cattie being exported to the United States, as against
155,000 the previous year. This was a great
loss to the farmers in these provinces, for
they were seUling this stock as feeder cattie

and not as cattie ready for market. The feed
shortage also resulted in 2.5 million acres o!
seeded wheat being abandoned to grazing,
cutting for feed, or being plowed under.
Each producer holding a Wheat Board
delivery permit will receive $1 for each listed
cultivated acre up to 200 acres as shown on
their 196,1-62 crop permit books. It is estimated
that about 235,000 payments will be made.
I now wieh to produce the table I mentioned a few moment ago, which gives the
specified acreage crops as shown in Wheat
Board delivery permits for the 1960-61 crop
year. The table for 1961-62 is, not yet available. However, the 1960-61 table contains a
great deal of information, and I ask permission to have it placed on the record as
part o! the debate on this subject.

by drought, or whether he has or has not

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: He gets a maximum of
$200.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Is that
correct?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is correct. May I
next refer, honourable senators, to Vote 612.
This item is for $300,000 and is designed to
meet a special situation in Newfoundland.
Perhaps honourable senators are not aware
that during the 1961 fishing season many of the
fishing villages along the coast of Newfoundland experienced a very substantial drop in income by reason of an extraordinarily poor
catch. It was the inshore fishermen who did
not have the equipment to fish out in the
Gulf of St. Lawrence or in the Atlantic
Ocean some distance from land who were
principally affected. The catch of cod was
very poor, and the fish in coming north, or
wherever they come from, did not come in
close to shore as they had done previously.
In addition, there were the extensive forest
fires which prevailed and which kept the
fishermen away from their fishing. On account of those factors they find themselves
in a very poor position financially. The catch
was 40 per cent below normal.
The areas most affected are not organized
as municipalities, and they have very little
in the way of local resources to enable them to
participate in the Department of Labour
winter works program. For this reason, certain
representations were made by the fishermen's
organizations asking for a works program;
and in co-operation with the provincial Government a special program, including road
construction, repairs of jetties, and so on, has
been instituted. The provincial Government
will contribute 25 per cent of the labour costs
of these projects, and the federal Government
will assume the balance. In these areas the
labour content is estimated to be about twothirds of the total cost throughout. The provincial contribution will be approximately
$50,000. The total program will amount to an
estimated $350,000 and should give much
needed help to these distressed fishermen.
This program supplements $80,000 worth of
projects which have been made possible under
the ordinary winter works program and
together the total expenditure of about
$430,000 will go some way towards offsetting
the estimated $1.2 million loss in income resulting from the poor fishing season.
Hon. Mr. Prati: May I ask the honourable
Leader of the Government if it is not so that

the $80,000 to which he refers is a contribution to this fund by the provincial
Government and is not part of the federal
grant?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No. Under the winter
works program $80,000 worth of projects were
undertaken on which the federal Government
of course would pay 50 per cent of the labour
cost. That is the point I intended to make.
I now come to Vote 613, which is the comparatively modest sum of $90,000. It is required to finance the do-it-now campaign, of
which you are all aware. It is interesting to
note that 90 per cent of the cost of all the
promotion that you see and hear about in
this campaign is either contributed as a public
service or paid for by business and industry.
This warm support indicates general realization of the need to stimulate winter construction in order to flatten out seasonal fluctuations in employment.
The next is Vote 614.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Before my honourable
friend comes to Vote 614, may I ask him what
is the total amount being spent under Vote
613, because the $90,000 is supplementary to
something that has been voted before. It
states, "further amount required."
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: In the main estimates
for 1961-62, $498,860 was provided for that
purpose. This supplementary estimate of
$90,000 is in addition to that sum.
I now come, honourable senators, to the
last item in the supplementary estimates,
Vote 614, which provides $40 million for
payments by the federal Government through
the provinces, through the municipalities
under the municipal winter works incentive
program.
You will recall that the Special Committee
of the Senate on Manpower and Employment
concluded that government investment in
social capital was a possible means to counter
cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in employment. It conceded that such might involve
additional effort and cost but these would
be small compared with the wastage resulting from the high level of seasonal employment. This program encourages just this type
of government investment by all three levels
of government at a time and in places where
additional investment in social capital is most
desirable and necessary. When the committee
reported, the winter works program was already in effect, having been introduced in
1958. Initially, hôwever, it was of an experimental nature and indeed some thought
it would not appeal to the municipalities.
It did in fact greatly appeal to the municipalities, and it has now been broadened in
scope to cover any capital project of a
municipality, with only a few exceptions.

FEBRUARY 6. 1962
The federal Government contributes one-half
the labour cost of the projeets and the provincial
Governinents
varying
additional
proportions.
The program also provides for projects
carried out by Indian bands, as has been
the case during the last two winters.
To January 24, 1962, approval had been
given to 6,008 projects under the prograin.
It is estixnated that on these projeets $200
million will be expended during the winter
works program which started on October 15
last. Payroll costs are estimated at $66 million,
of whlch the federal Goveriment will of
course pay one-haif. It is. expected that the
projects will provide 4,700,000 days of work
for about 110,000 men.
I believe honourable senators would be
interested in the details of the distribution
of projects among the provinces, which are
shown in the following table:

The tempo, honourable senators, of the
prograin is considerably higher than last
year. To give you some idea of the participation, I would say that in 1958-59, 647 municipalities took part; in 1959-60, 869 municipalties took part; in 1960-61, 2,163 municipalities and Indian bands took part. This
year the number participating is 2,286 and
there are likely to be further applications.
Since 1958 under this program. the federal
Governiment has contributed ta the construction and improvemnent of roads, streets and
sidewalks to a total value of $167 million;
to the construction and improvement of water
and drainage facilities, a total of $48 million;
to parks and playgrounds $36 million, and
$70 million I the reconstruction or renovation of municipal buildings, making a total
in ail of more than $762 million. You VAUl
appreciate that expenditures of this type have
had their major effect ini the construction
industry where under our clirnatic conditions
seasonal unemployment is most pronounced.
The amount of $40 million will permit the
Governinent ta continue this necessary and
beneficial prograin.

Hon. Mr. Cr.rar: Mlght I ask my honourable friend a question? This is quite an elaborate programn, totalling over $82 million. This
brings our total spending ta, a figure not
very far short of $7 billion for the year. I
think it would be very interesting to the house
if the Honourable Leader of the Government
could teil us where the Governinent intends
getting the money to carry out this prograin.
Hon. Mr. Ro.buck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That is a very important
f eature, and one which should be explained
to the house. How does it propose to finance
this?
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
I wish to make a few observations at this
turne, and in particular would like to deal
with Vote 611. 1 arn sure there will not be
very strenuous opposition ta this vote because
it is necessary to help certain people who
have met with disaster through no f ault of
their own. As alrnost everyone knows, it is
hard ta make money on a f arn. There are so
many expensive repairs and items of equipment required that the average small farmner
can hardly work up a bank account or accumulate much in the way of reserves, s0
that when the current crop fails there is often
hardship, want and despair.
Those who are closest to the situation welcorne this measure, but there are some
farmers who are going to need as much as $3
an acre if they are ta have the basic necessities of life. It happened that the rainfail
last; year was very scant and spotty, sa that
while some districts received a fair amounit
and produced a reasonable crop, 20 to 30
bushels per acre, other districts had no rain
at all.
Honourable senatars, I think the weakness
of this measure is that it gives the saine
amount of money ta the man who had a crop
as to the man whose crop was nil It seems
ta me that more should be given ta those
who have suffered moat and probably less ta
'those who are not i such dire need.'
Hou. Mr. Roebuck: They ail have a vote.
Hou. Mr. G.rchaw: They are to receive $1
per acre in each case. I know that the Prairie
Farm Assistance Act is based on a different
plan. It is deslgned ta caver this very situation. The farmner who harvests only 12 bushels
or less per acre receives a bonus; and if he
harvests only six bushels an acre or leas he
receives a larger bonus. Such a fariner is in
a vastiy different position from the one who
harvests, say, 30 bushels an acre. He can seil
his crop for perhaps $1 or $1.50 a bushel and
get $30 ta $45 an acre. The P.F.A.A. bonus

SENATE
would be only about $4 per acre. It does not
greatly help, for many will need an additional
bonus of $3 per acre.
Honourable senators, very briefly I want
to indicate how this particular problem
might be worked out. For many years the
province of Alberta has been paying pensions
to mothers, widows, and disabled persons,
and a supplementary allowance of $15 per
month on practically all pensions where that
amount is required. They have recently discontinued those particular payments, and in
their place, for the last year, they have been
paying what they call the social allowance
program. Thus, every person in the province
who because of age, physical or mental disability, is unable to earn enough to supply
his basic needs, can reap the benefit of this
social allowance program. This system has
been instituted in order to provide individuals
and heads of families with the necessities of
life, and it is working out very well. It is
based upon the principle that those most in
need receive the most.
Honourable senators, the migration from
the countryside to the cities continues al
over Canada, particularly in western Canada,
because the producer of food has not profited
by the recent general prosperity of this
country. In addressing the Ontario Federation of Agriculture in December last, the
Minister of Agriculture said that the real
income of the industrial worker has gone up
by 35 per cent since 1950, and that of the
farmer has gone down by 20 per cent. So
there is need to give some thought to the
situation of this class of our people who have
met with the greatest measure of disaster.
In the west there is and always has been
a drought hazard. The seven-year drought in
the thirties was the worst since settlement
began, but at other times the rainfall has
been deficient or has failed completely. Back
in 1857, before Confederation and while the
Hudson's Bay Company still controlled all of
the west, Captain Palliser made an investigation for the British Government and marked
out a large triangular area which he said was
unfit for agriculture. Of course his prediction
did not prove true altogether, but it is interesting to note that that is the triangular area
that is in trouble at the present time. Then
in 1874, when the Northwest Mounted Police
made their amazing march out to Fort Macleod they passed through that area and found
desert conditions. The few blades of grass
that had existed had been eaten up by the
buffalo, and there was nothing left. Then the
herds of cattle came in and the buffalo disappeared. In the early years of this century
the days of the open range ended, and the
countryside was opened up for homesteading
and settling.

The years 1910 to 1914 were very dry
years. In 1915 and 1916 there was a lot of
rain and there were bumper crops everywhere. In the following years, 1917 to 1919,
there existed very bad conditions again. Feed
for cattle and seed had to be provided, and
even food for the settlers themaselves. This
was done by both the dominion and provincial Governments. The costs were charged
against the farmer and liens were recorded
on the certificates of title. This caused much
trouble in later years.
In the thirties, in addition to drought, dust
storms and soil drifting, there were the
ruinous loan costs which impoverished many
farmers. Of course, since then irrigation has
done a lot to help improve the situation. On
account of the hills and valleys, and the
contour of the land, only a fraction of it can
be irrigated. The time has now come when
the pastures should be irrigated.
The honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) mentioned the fodder
situation regarding cattle. If those cattle are
to be saved and kept on, the farm pastures
should be irrigated at the present time. Of
course, in those Prairie regions there are
sloughs, dugouts and stock water reservoirs,
but during the long, hot summer nearly all
the water dries up. Some 30 inches of water
have disappeared by evaporation and seepage,
and the conditions can only be described as
desperate.
I attended a large meeting in a part of that
dried out area, at which two or three hundred
farmers were present, and they declared they
had not had one inch of beneficial rain during the season.
I wish to make a plea at this time, particularly for those whose crops have been a
complete failure, because very hard times
are facing thema, and this measure will at least
give some relief.
Hon. Arthur M. Pearson: Honourable senators, I would like to make a few comments
on Vote 611, but before I do so I would like
to congratulate the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) on the fine
honour which has been bestowed upon him
in being made a Privy Councillor. I should
also like to compliment the mover and
seconder of the address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne (Hon. Mr. Méthot and Hon.
Mr. Hollett). Both did a very fine job, and I
am sure we shall hear from. the honourable
senator from Burin (Hon. Mr. Hollett) in
many phases of our work in the future.
Honourable senators, I feel I must say
something about these acreage payments. The
honourable Leader of the Government has
gone through this item pretty thoroughly and
has given a great many figures.

FEBRUARY 6, 1962
It might be interesting to honourable senators to know something about what has happened in the province of Saskatchewan, the
province from which I corne. The year 1961
was the driest for that province in the memory
of living man. We thought we had had dry
years before. For instance, 1937 was a very
dry year, and 1941 was extremely dry, but
1961 was the driest year that any'body in Saskatchewan can rernember.
In the area of central Saskatchewan where
I farrn we had a good rain in 1960 which
resulted in our getting a fair crop in that
season, but that was one rain only and it was
net sufficient to create a subsoil moisture
on the land that was in fallow for the 1961
crop. That meant that the only moisture we
had for the 1961 crop was that received, in
1959, that moisture being stored up in the
surnmerfallow land. There was very littie
snow in the winter of 1960, which dîd not
help the situation. Nearly ail of the side roads
in that area usually drift in and are impassable, but during the winter of 1960 they were
quite open.
The outlook for 1962 is very dimi in the
central part" of the province, and in the
southern part along the United States border,
and from the border of Alberta to the border
of Manitoba, and of course into Manitoba
itself.
When one taiks about 50 per cent cf the
crop in the west being lost this year, one is
talking in round figures which do not have
the saine impact as do the figures of the
losses ini the individual areas. In Saskatchewan
the average is 308 million bushels, but this
year it was only 125 million.. Net having any
cattie or stock on my f armn I attempted te
harvest some of the grain. I went over it with
a combine, and I reaped one bushel per acre,
which was net a very large contribution tewards the total of 125 million bushels. There
was what might be called a zero crop acress
those areas that I mentioned before.
These acreage payments wrnl assist the farmners te buy fuel and seed, and will enable
them. to get started in 1962. The farmner has
te, sow ne niatter ivhat the weather might be

his soul, because if he dees flot SOW he will
net reap in the fellowing year. The farmers
neyer know what the next seasen will bring
forth in the way of moisture
I might say, henourable senators, that the
mnaximumn received under the P.F.A.A. i this
farm fallure area would be $800 per farmner,
previded he had sufficient acreage of crop
land to, entitle him to the $4 per acre on 200
acres. His maximum payment would be $200
under these acreage payments, 50 that any
fariner who had less than three bushels per

acre can receive by way of payment under
the P.F.A.A. and the acreage payments a total
of $1,000. This will help him net enly te
purchase his fuel and seed, if necessary, but
will help hlmi to pay his taxes and carry on
during the next winter.
This disaster has aflected net oniy the
farmers but aise the business people in the
provinces of the west. The implement coinpanies are an exaimple of this. Their sales
drepped off i sorne areas to nothing. This
has a direct effect on the economy of the
east. It slows down the work of these large
companies in the east, and that is an indication of how close the econemies of the
west and the east are tied together.
It is for that reason that I feel this contribution which cornes largely fremn eastern
Canada while being a great heip to the western farmner, aiso helps eastern Canada. These
payments will help the western farmers te
purchase more farrn machinery which is
rnanufac-tured in the east.
Acreage payments were granted in 1958,
in 1960, and new in 1962, and I cannot
understand how members of the other place
can say that this is a political carrot. We
have had these payments before, and I would
point eut that there was ne election in the
fail of 1958 or in the fail of 1960.
Hon. Mr. Wall: ýI wonder if I might ask
the honourable senator a question. I gathered
fromn what the honourable Leader of the
Governinent <Hon. Mr. Aseltine) said that one
of the reasons for these acreage payrnents was
te two-price system. What was done te
rneet the difficulties caused by the absence cf
the two-price system in 1959 and 1961?

Hon. Mr. Pearson: What about the large

wheat production in the world?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): The reason for the surplus of wheat in the United

612, and in doing so, I shaîl give a little background with regard to aur fisheries, wbich 1
am sure wifl be of interest and whicb I
tbink is applicable in the approach ta this
bill.
We have in the province of Newfoundland
about 12,000 fishermen wbo are flshing inshore in hundreds of fisbing settiements. They
did paorly last year in many o! these areas.
The fish did nat strike in the accustomed
quantities and tbey cauld not get the catch
that tbey were prepared for. Tbe bonourable
Leader of the Gavernment (Hon. Mr. Aselfine) bas said that the expenses of the farmer
carry on each year even when he daes nat
get a goad crap. I would say that that is
applicable to the fishermen ta just as great
a degree as ta producers in any other industry. They have ta, prepare their boats, their
gear, their equipment of one kind or another,
and unless tbey have a pretty fair catch they
will wind up sometimes withaut a cent or
may, in fact, be deep in debt. Sa it is a great
problem in these areas wbere they have 10w
seasonal production.
Hanourable senators, the average earnings
o! tbe inshore fisherman in this area in the
past year was one-third less than in 1960.
That is ta say, the 12,000 fishermen I referred
to bad incomes estimated ta be one-third less
than they were in 1960, and 1960 was by no
means a particularly gaod year. It was an
average year.
This grant of $300,000, as stated by the
Leader a! the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), and I would like ta emphasize the fact,
is nat; a handout o! maney. This is a grant
ta permit public works being undertaken in
areas wbere the fishermen have done poorly
in the past year and where they will be able
ta get some work to supplernent; their incame.
With reference ta, the $80,000 which was
referred ta-and which I understand is ta be
paid 50-50 by the provincial and federal Governments-tbat will be of very little assistance ta the fishermen in thase poor areas.
This money is ta be applled ta municipal
works. This applies anly in the larger places
and nat; in the hundreds of small places
where these fishermen are aperating and
wbere many o! themn bave done sa, poorly.

Hon. Mr. Bruni: But that he daes not have
ta seil it?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Yes, sell
it-but he must nat give it away. My point
was that he cauld not help but seli wheat.
My hanourable friend says that the Minister
of Agriculture seils wheat. 1 will say ta him
that the Minister af Agriculture daes nat sel
butter, but he might have sold same butter if
he bad listened ta the honourable senatar fram.
Westmarland (Han. Mr. Taylor).
What is the situation witb respect ta butter? When the banourable senator from Westmarland made bis speech in January 1961 the
Agricultural Stabilization Board then held
118,206,251 paunds of butter. That was a year
aga. What is the situation taday? Instead of
reducing that figure by seUling some butter,
there was in starage on December 31 last, nat,
118 million but 174,611,265 pounds of butter.
Honourable senatars, do yau not agree witb
me that it is about time we sold that butter?
Butter is different fram wheat. If we cannat seIl wbeat we can store it, but butter
cannat be stored forever. In fact some of the

My closing remarks are that I amn going
to support these three supplernentary items,

FEBRUARY 6, 1962
Hon. Mr. Prait: Yes, that is what is generally thought. I do not know that that
condition has really been defined as the
cause of these shortages, but unquestionably
the season was very late opening. The heavy
ice drifts which occurred right up until the
period when fishing commenced probably
resulted in the temperature of the water
greatly affecting the inflow of fish.
Now with that background as to the number of fishermen and the falling off in their
catch, I would like to express the definite
opinion that this appropriation is only a
gesture. It is a small gesture and it will
be useful in a very small degree to industry
and the fishing population. As a matter of
fact, taking into account the amount that
will actually go in wages to the fishermen
who are working, and taking into consideration the other expenses involved, such as
materials and so forth, on the basis of the
number of fishermen in the area it works
out to about $20 a fisherman.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: Does the fisherman have
to work for it?
Hon. Mr. Pratt: Oh, yes. This is not a
handout at all. This is to permit of community work. As a matter of fact they found
it very difficult to get their imagination working, to determine just what work they ought
to do in such a- short time.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Are you referring to
inshore fishermen solely, the type that I spoke
about, or are you referring to the whole
fishing population of Newfoundland?
Hon. Mr. Prati: To the inshore fishermen,
decidedly.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Well, this is not designed to help all the fishermen. It is designed to help a few men along the coast
who were not able to fish because the fish
did not come *to places they formerly did.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: Yes, but you really do not
understand what that word means in this
regard. Pardon me for putting it that way.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Are you talking about
the whole 12,000 fishermen?
Hon. Mr. Praft: There are many thousands
of fishermen involved in this. There are approximately 12,000 inshore fishermen, and
there has been only about two-thirds of the
normal catch, so in total there are many
thousands of fishermen affected in this whole
area. It is not a case of just a few.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I thought you were
referring to all the fishermen in Newfoundland.
Hon. Mr. Prait: No; just the inshore fishermen.
26211-3-5j

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: There are 12,000?
Hon. Mr. Pratt: About that number.
Honourable senators, it is rather significant
that while we have this appropriation for
works which will give $300,000 to the fishermen, at the same time we are providing a
$42 million appropriation for the farmers. I
am not commenting on this agricultural grant
at all, but I would say this, that in our Newfoundland fishery if we could find a name for
"cod" that would sound like "wheat". I think
our industry really would have a chance to
prosper.
We have some very grave problems in the
Newfoundland fishery, which industry is so
important to the province. I have referred to
the number of inshore fishermen, but there
are, in fact, about 20,000 of our population
engaged in the fishery, on the ocean, and
including the comparatively small number
who are working in the plants. The industry
has an export yield of about $30 million to
$35 million.
As it is getting late I shall not prolong My
remarks. But I repeat that we are experiencing
very severe competition in the industry, particularly relating to salt fish, which has really
been the foundation of the industry.
We are situated near what is regarded as
one of the greatest fishing areas in the world,
the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, and the
fish flow into our shores as well. It is recorded
that in 1960 160 vessels came from Russia,
some of them factory ships-they cbmprised
a tremendous fleet of big boats. I was on board
one factory ship, an immense vessel, the cost
of which would run to millions of dollars.
It is stated that there were 25,000 Russian
fishermen on the Grand Banks, fishing off
the Newfoundland waters and the adjacent
areas. There were 50 vessels from Lithuania
fishing in that area. We have direct
competition from scores and scores of boats
from Spain, Portugal and France, coming out
to the Newfoundland waters, and they catch
many times more ground fish than the Canadian fishermen do in the whole. industry.
In Newfoundland we have had an upsurge
in the production of frozen fillets, and this
has been a valuable addition to our people's
income in recent years. However, over the
last ten years while the world production
of fish has risen by 77 per cent and totals
34 million tons, the production of al types
of fish for the whole of Canada during that
period remained at about one million tons.
This increase in world production has come
about largely through scientific means of
production and of preserving the fish.
What Newfoundland lacks and needs is
diversified industry in the fishery. We need
more modern methods of catching, and we

SENATE
certainly need more diversification in the
product which we turn out. This is a matter
which deserves more federal assistance than
is received.
I can only speak of Newfoundland, although
the situation might well apply to many other
parts of Canada. What is very badly needed
is more application of industrial research to
the industry. We need more co-operation
between industry and Government research.
Also, full use of the research can only be
obtained by the Government assisting in the
financing of research experiments and development in industrial plants. Let us not
only catch more fish per fisherman by better
methods, but let us turn out a product that
is more acceptable to the consumer trade
throughout the world. That is really the most
useful pattern of assistance that we could
have in our fishing industry. If that is done
we will merely be copying what is done in
the countries of the world that are most
aggressive in this field.
I should like to emphasize the point that
as far as Newfoundland is concerned we have
very efficient fishing research being carried
on in certain directions, but when it comes
to putting the results of that research into
industry we are lacking. It is in that field
that the Government should actively participate to avoid wasting money on research that
is not put to use.

Hon. Mr. Pratt: One-third would probably
be about $3 million.

Hon. Mr. Wall: They are getting $300,000
which divided by 12,000 makes about $25
per fisherman. If they were getting a comparable grant to that of the farmers you would
have to multiply 12,000 by $200, more or
less, and that would make about $2 million.
But can the honourable senator tell us the
approximate loss in their income, so that we
can more readily compare these two figures
and see just what is the relative assistance
that is offered to the fishermen?

I repeat: ". . . for fishing settlements that
experienced income reduction . . ." The vote

Hon. Malcolm Holleti: Honourable senators,
it is not my intention to take up much of
your valuable time. However, I think I know
something about the fisheries. I was born a
fisherman. My forebears have been fishermen
for generations past in Newfoundland, and
they suffered all the handicaps, all the setbacks, "droughts," if you want to call them
that, and storms. They knew hunger, as every
fisherman did and, I dare say, as a good many
farmers do even today.
The only thing that compels me to rise
and say a few words is that I think the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald, Brantford), was casting a little
ridicule on certain powers that be with regard to wheat. I did not notice that element
in the speech of the honourable senator from
St. John's West (Hon. Mr. Pratt) with regard
to the fisheries. I do not think he would be
capable of doing that sort of thing.
Another point upon which I wish to comment is that I have seen reported in the
Hansard of the other place exactly what has
been done here tonight. That is, so many dollars have been provided, $300,000, and you
divide the total number of fishermen into the
total number of dollars and get $25 a head.
Is that the correct way to illustrate or prove
what will be accomplished by this grant of

Government to assist fishermen in this regard.
Hon. Mr. Prait: Yes.
You will notice that Vote No. 612 states:

Hon. Mr. Prait: That is right.
does not stipulate that it is for 12,000 or
15,000 fishermen. Oh, no, because not onetenth of our fishing settlements experienced
that particular state where there was decreased income.
Hon. Mr. Prati: I think you are wrong
on that.

Hon. Mr. Holleft: The honourable senator
may think what he likes, but let him produce
the facts. We have at least 1,200 or 1,300
settlements, and in the old days a good many
depended wholly on the fisheries. That is
Hon. Mr. Wall: One-third does not tell us not so today. If we have 1,000 settlements
today depending on the fisheries, I think that
how much.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: You are asking about the
loss as compared to the previous year in the
industrial field, as referred to in the bill? I

FEBRUARY S. 1962
is probably ail we have. As I have said, flot
ail of these settiements by any means experienced a decrease in income.
As honourable senators know, today if our
fishermen catch enough, flsh to secure a
certain number of stamps they wiil then
receive the unernployment insurance for
fishermen under that particular scheme. But,
there are fishermen who, by reason of storm,
by reason of the fact that the bait did flot
corne into land, or by reason of the fact that
there was no fish to foilow any bait in certain
areas, experienced a great loss of income, and
will flot receive that benefit.
It is my understanding, honourable senators, that the department of this Government
concerned sent its own people down to inquire as to the areas which were affected by
this lowered income and thiat, having gone
ail around the flshing settiements, they came
to the conclusion that $300,000 would at least
assist a good many fishermen who had flot
caught enough fish to get the necessary insurance stamps, and would enable them to carry
along qintil the comlng spring.
Hou. Mr. Pratt: May I ask the honourable
senator whether it is his opinion that that
same plan should be applied to the wheat
growers?
Han. Mr. Holleli: I know very little about
wheat. I do flot know whether the man who
had a big crop of wheat last year is going
to get the same amount as the man who did
flot have any crop. I have heard that stated
by certain individuals, but I do flot beileve
that is correct. However, I do know that inispectors were sent around the coast of Newfoundland, and that they came to the conclusion that $300,000 would be of great help.
Certainly they did not corne to the conclusion
that it would be sufficient to give the fishermen plenty. There are other sources, of
course. I doubt very much whether it is
enough, but it is flot for me to judge. It .is,
however, a suffIcient amount to carry the
fishermen safely away frorn a condition which
amounts alxnost to starvation.
I just want to correct that rnisunderstanding, because I have heard members of
another place rise to their feet and put
Up the same argument that unfortunately has
been raised here, namely, that there are
15,000 fishermen and $300,000, dlvlded ainong
themn means $20 each. That is flot; the idea
at ail. Let us be fair. Let us be fair to that
department of Goverrnent which sent its inspectors down to Newfoundland. I arn not;
saying the inspectors carne to the rlght conclusion. They can make mistakes, and they
rnay have made mîstakes, and I certainly do
flot know whether $300,000 la going to take
care of the situation. I would strongly suspect

that it is not enough, but what people who
suifer calamity in this world year after year
ever receive enough to compensate them for
the great losses they suifer?
Let us remember that $300,000, even to
poor Newfoundlançlers, is something, and it
is something that we ought to be proud of.
We ought to be proud that we in this country
can contribute $300,000 towards the welfare
of fishermen who work day by day in the face
of danger and tragedy. Do not let us cast any
ridicule upon it. Do not let us say that we
have 15,000 fishermen-we have not 15,000
inshore fishermen. I can teil you, honourable
senators, that we have not 12,000 inshore
fishermen, although some will say that we
have. I amn sure that something will have to
be done in the future for our inshore fishermen, flot in the way of passing out $300,000,
or $1 million or $2 million, but in an endeavour towards finding some way whereby
they are better provided with the means to
catch the fish and to market it. The honourable senator who spoke before me (Hon. Mr.
Pratt) knows more about marketing than I
do, so I shail not go into that subject.
I do say that we on this side o! the house,
at any rate, are very grateful for any assistance that can be given not only to the
fishermen but also to the farmers, and it is
rny hope that the distribution o! the amount
stated ini this bill will be properly made to
those who are in need.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancaurt: Will the honourable senator permit me a question? Vote No.
611 is with respect to payments to western
grain producers to be distributed to ail f armers in the amount of $1 per acre up ta a maximum o! 200 acres. Vote 612 is for the fishermen, but it is only for fishing settlements that
experienced incarne reduction resulting frorn
decreased catches. Vote No. 611 is for al
farmers. The farmer with the good crop gets
the same as the farmer with the poor crop.

Hon. Mr. Bruni: Nor wheat.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: As a matter of fact, where
I grew up I was very fortunate if I saw a
fish once in two years.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: You should eat Newfoundland fish rather than talk about it.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): I think
the Canadian representative to the recent
United Nations Wheat Conference in Geneva
stated the amount to be less than that.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It is approximately that
amount.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Geneva is a long distance
away, and I am prepared to take the figures
submitted tonight by the honourable Leader
of the Government. Of this amount, if that
is the total, I would surmise that probably
there are still 300 million bushels in farmers'
hands. That would allow 188 million bushelsHon. Mr. Aseltine: There are only about
100 million bushels in the farmers' hands.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -for terminal elevators
and country elevators.
Hon. Mr. Emerson: May I ask my honourable friend a question? You are saying that
anybody can sell wheat to starving people.
May I ask you why countries, other than
Communist countries, are buying wheat from
us now? What do they buy it for if not to
eat? It is because they need it.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Well, in reply I would
merely say that that is elementary.
Hom. Mr. Emerson: It certainly is.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Why does any nation, any
country, buy wheat?
Hon. Mr. Emerson: And that is why the
Chinese bought it too.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: They bought it because
they needed it for food.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: Nor am I going to talk
about the sale of wheat to China, other than
to make one observation. The Minister of
Agriculture has been very diligent in selling
wheat everywhere he can, especially to China.
It makes one wonder who is really handling
our wheat business. Is it the Wheat Board set
up under legislation of this Parliament, or
is it the Minister of Agriculture? Is he now
in charge of the Wheat Board, directing its
energies and its work?
With respect to this sale of wheat to China,
for which my honourable friends opposite
want to hang halos around the head of the
Minister of Agriculture, may I observe that it
is not very difficult for anyone to sell wheat
to a starving people especially when it is given
to them on a small down payment. That is
what happened in this case. I really think,
honourable senators, that I might be able to
sell some wheat myself on that basis. The
fact that we have sold wheat to a starving
people when they were unable to pay for it
certainly, in my understanding, does not require any great skill in salesmanship.
There are a few observations I want to
make on this bill. The Honourable Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) told us
in his remarks this evening that the carryover of wheat, or the supply of wheat, is now

the sale to China.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Maybe it is. It would be
rather important to know if that was the
total quantity at the end of the crop year, at
the end of July, and that consequently the
meagre crop which we had this year would
not be included. However, I suspect that my
honourable friend is right.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: I think that figure includes everything we have now as at the end
of the calendar year.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That is what I understand.
Well, 488 million bushels is a substantial
quantity of grain.

Hon. Mr. Emerson: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: You were ridiculing it.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: All I was interested in
was the rather extravagant praise being given
to the Minister of Agriculture, pretending that
he is a great salesman. It was in that connection I made the remark that no one needs
to be a super salesman to sell wheat to starving people when you sell it to them on the
basis of a small down payment.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: What about wheat sold
for cash? Be fair about this. The initial sales
of wheat were made for cash. There was no
credit on the initial sales.

FEBRUARY 8. 1962
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Perhaps I have been misinformed.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I arn taking my informnation from. the Canadian Wheat Board report.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Perhaps the Chinese are
paying: cash for this wheat as they get it.
Does my honourable friend say that?
Hon. Mr. Brunt: No, but I do say they did
pay cash for the first wheat they bought fromn
us, and when nxy honourable friend is finxshed speaking I shail put on record just
how this wheat wiil be paid for.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I do flot; quarrel with
that. My honourable friends missed the point
altogether. What I was commenting on was
this super-ability of the Minister of Agriculture in selling wheat on ie to a starving
people. I do flot; know what quaiity of salesmanship my honourable friend frorn Hanover (Hon. Mfr. Brunt) has but I suspect that
even lie could seil wheat; under these conditions.
Hou. Mr. Horner: What is your authority
for saying the Governinent is seiling wheat
to starving people? What do you know about
that?
Mon. Mr. Crerar: My authority cornes from
people who have been to China and, have
reported upon it. There la no doubt about it.
Hon. Mr. Hornsi: You don't know anythlng about it.
Hon. Mr. Crerai: China was short of foreign
exchangeHon. Mr. Hoinsi: We wiil do better .tilan

Hon. Mr. Cear: Perhaps I better leave
this subi ect. I think I have exhausted it.
There Is no doubt that this acreagé payment
for $42 million under this vote, as the honourable senator from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr.
Gershaw) pointed out, wiil be of value and
benefit to a substantial number of farmers,
and especiaily lI the lower category that the
honourable Leader of the Government spoke
about. I submit, however, there are about
300 million bushels of wheat still i the
hands of western furiners.
Hon. Mr. Assume: I question that. There
are, I believe, about 100 million bushels li
the farinera' hands and the rest la i the

188 million bushels it is pretty near the limit,1
and the bulk of it is certainly li the farmers'
hands. However, we shail get the figures.
Wheat farmers who have had anything
held over have been fortunate. The manner
in which the exchanges have worked has
benefited those selling wheat, and the price
today is about 200 a bushel higher than it
was a year ago. That is ail to the good, so
far as farmers are concerned, but while
there la a substantial number to whorn this
acreage bonus payment will be of value, I
do suggest there are many thousands wha
may have wheat on their farms and who
reaily do not need this payment. I suspect
that the honourable Leader of the Government may know of some cases in his own
district where that holds true. The difflculty
here, of course, is to distinguish between
those who really need it and those who do
flot.
Hon. Mr. Thorvalduon: What about the aid

Hon. Mr. Crerar: In aider to please as many
people as possible, the acreage payment la
pald ta everyone. That appears to be the
principie upon wliich we discliarge ail our
public obligations of this klnd today. AUl I
can say la that I regret that the honourable
Leader of the Gavernment did not; give us an
answer to the question I asked hlm as ta hiow

press-I don't know what decision the Goverrnent has reached, if any-that the price
to the consumer should be reduced to 50 cents

dairyman to make up to hlm the difference be
tween the 50-cent and the 64-cent price he
has been getting? These are things we should
know.
In my old-fashioned way, I think these
matters should be of supreme interest to
Parliament. I make no bones about lt-I think
probably everyone i5 aware of it, and I need
not state it again-that the road we are
travelling is going to land us into trouble. In
the fiscal year ending March 31 we have so far
spent almost $7 billion. Where is it golng to

Parliament should be giv'ing some consideration and, if honourable senators do not throw
me out, I hope from time to time durlng
this session to refer to it again.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I have listened carefully this evening, and I have learned a lot about fisheries,
wheat, and various other matters, and while
I listened to our honourable friend from
Burin (Hon. Mr. Hollett) I was struck by
one statement he made. He said, "I do flot
know anything about wheat". It is a profound error for anyone under this roof, and
I arn speaklng of members of the House
of Commons as well as of the Senate, to
say that he does not know anything about
this. That should neyer be said.
Hon. Mr. Hollett: I said I knew about
Cream of Wheat.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: You know about Cream
of Wheat. It is a morning cereal. But I amn
speaking of the manipulation of wheat. However, there is something comforting: It is
that during the past twenty minutes we have
learned much, and in the future my honourable friend will flot be able to say that he
knows nothing.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
it is impossible for me to remain sulent when
wheat is talked about, and I feel I have a
perfect right to rise whenever it is discussed
i this house. I doubt if any man in this
chamber, or indeed in Canada, has sown
it, eut it by hand and bound it, more than
I have done. I was cradled in the new land
of the west, and even as a young fellow
I could lay a straight swath, rake it up
and tie it. For over fifty years I gained considerable experlence In the growing and
marketing o! wheat i western Canada.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) questioned the wlsdom

of making acreage payment$ to ail farmers,
but hie admitted that it would be difficuit
to deterrnine who should receive benefits,
just as in the case of the old age pension.
However, the position of the farmer in
western Canada is quite different, because
often a district which has a crop failure
one year will have a good crop the following
year.
The senator from St. John's West (Hon.
Mr. Pratt) talked about fish in Newfoundland.
Well, fish is not like a grain crop, which
may blow right out of the ground, or seed
grain which may blow away so that the
farmer has to seed a second Urne.
Han. Mr. Pratt: Fish do swim away, don't
they?
Hon. Mr. Hornor: I must confess I have
littie knowledge of fish, but I have a knowledge o! wheat. I have ploughed with oxen,
and I know what I arn talking about.
The late Dr. W. R. Motherwell, who at
one time was Minister of Agriculture in the
Liberal Government and a member of Parliament for many years, often spoke in the
house against his own party and his own
cabinet. I believe it was in the session of
1936 that he came to me and said, "Horner,
you are doing the best you can. but you
cannot do anything about it; they are bound
to rob the Wheat Board". He was speaking
of the Wheat Board that was set up in 1935.
I was very concerned about the Wheat Board,
and the men who had the responslbility of
disposing of our wheat. When 1 returned to
the west in July I observed the crop failure
that extended right across the prairies to
Rosetown. WhiIe I was on the train I was
reading reports about the work of the Government Wheat Board, boasting of the great job
it was doing in selling wheat-100 million
bushels sold, flot at $1.90 but at 70 cents a
bushel. At that tirne we were alaiimed about
a surplus. In Calgary, I was alarmed because
I had been given an initial payrnent and expected to receive the balance as thousands o!
other farmers did. So I called up the Calgary
Herald. I was lin a very bad humour and I
said, "Send a reporter over to the Palliser
Hotel where I arn staying and I will pay hlm
to publish what I tell hirn." I suggested that
wheat should sell for at least $l.12-that it
was just being given away. 0f course, the
western papers alI carried this statement. As
a matter o!, fact, within about three months
of that time, wheat did go up to $1.15 a
buhel, but even then it was being virtually
given away.
So far as surplus wheat is concernied, I
think we should always carry a surplus for
the hungry. Furtherrnore, we have learned a

FEBRUARY 6. 1962
lot since thope days. We have learned that
wheat is bettèr food for cattie than corn, and
that it yîelds better beef more quickly. We
did not know that untiI a few years ago.
I do flot think we need to hear any more
about giving the Minister of Agriculture
credit for the disposal of wheat. What is the
story? First, on his journeys to, other countries he went to Hong Kong and made the
first sale for cash. Other sales were made at
a reasonable price, and an commitments have
been met so f ar.
What 1 arn more interes-ted in, however, is
the fact that not only have we the best wheat
in the world, but I think perhaps we have
the best systemn of handlîng and grading. Our
wheat is not being graded as high as formerly,
but I think we should be satisfied if it is
graded as the best in the world. I have no
doubt that China found our wheat to be
wonderful, as did Japan, and I hope the
standard of our wheat will remain high.
When we speak of aldJ.ng the western
f armner perhaps we should remember that ini
1937, as I estiniate it, $200 to $300 million
was taken fromn themn in that year by te
injudicious operation of the Wheat Board,
which was set up by the Government. If my
honourable friends want to know more about
it, they should go back to the record and
read, fromn Dr. Motherwell's speeches. I ask,
what about the wheat agreement? It is estimated that we lost about $600 million in
selling wheat at a guaranteed price to the
British Government. So I fail to see where
anyone now has a Ieg to stand on to coinplain that the western farmner is getting the
few dollars we are voting here tonight.
Hon. George H. Barbour: Honourable
senators, I do not think any honourable
senator here is againat paying tis money
to wheat growers in the West. In order to,
appreciate the problem one would have to
personally experience the effects of the
drought over that area and the losing o! a
crop. On the other hand, I think there are
quite a number who do not agree with the
way the payments are being nmade and to
whom, they are being made, but there is
nothing for us to do but to vote for the measure.
Under the acreage plan that the honourable Leader of the Governent (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) descrlbed, practically one-third of
the farmers who stand to benefit have farmns
o! less than 200 acres. I have heard it said
that the small growerswillbenefit the most.
0f that approximately one-third of the number of farmers, not one of them will receive
over $200 even if they had no crop at all.
Then, honourable senators, there is the
matter of the two-price systein. Just why
26211-"-

should we have a two-price system and why
should Parliament be called upon every second year or oftener to pay $20 million or
more to the western farmers for a two-price
system. If the meaning of it is to give
cheaper flour to, the consumer, the consumers,
I think, would just as soon pay for it when
they get it instead of having the Government put through legisiation to, pay it. However, I arn inclined to think it is more to lower
the price of wheat that goes into milling
flour that is to be sold for export to foreign
countries, and I do not know just why we
should do that. Those, honourable senators,
are some comments on the matter as I see it.
Then, there is the way the payment is to
be made: it does flot take much thought to,
say, "We will pay it to the ones who have a
permit to deiver wheat." If the people involved were greatly in need and there was
any reason why payment should be made in
a hurry at a certain time, you could easily
press the button to make the payment.
Hon. William R. Bruni: Honourable senators, there is just one matter about which I
would like to make*a few remarks, and that
is about the sale of wheat to the People's Republic of China.
I have in my hand the latest report of the
Canadian Wheat Board, covering the crop year
1960-61, and in connection with the sale o!
wheat to the People's Republic of China this
report states as follows:
In January, 1961 a large sale was negotiated with the People's Republic of
China; this sale comprised 750,000 long
tons of wheat and 260,000 long tons of
barley. Later a second firm sales contract
was signed for 60,000 long tons of wheat
for shipment from East Coast ports. These
sales were for cash and the Board met the
desire of the Peking Government for
Prompt shipment.
In April, 1961, following negotiations
in Hong Kong and Peking, a long-terin
agreement was entered into between the
Board and an agency o! the Peking Goverient. This agreement, covering the
period from. June 1, 1961 to Decemnber
31, 1963 was a declaration of intent on
the part of the People's Republic of China
to purchase and the board to supply a
maximum of 5.0 million long tons of
wheat and 1.0 million long tons of barley,
with the actual quantities and prices to
be decided by negotiation.
Under the agreement a firmn sales contract was theil negotiated involving 750,000 long tons of wheat and 360,000 long
tons of barley. In the negotiation of the
latter contract a deferred payment arrangement was worked out whereby the

THE LATE SENATOR BARBOUR
TRIBUTES

Hon. Walter M. Assumie: Honourable senators, wa have lost yet another prominent
member of the Senate, one who was a great
personal friend of many of us. I refer to
the Honourable George Hilton Barbour of
Prince, Prince Edward Island, who passed
quietly away la this chaniber last evening.
The lata senator was a valued personal
friend of mina, and frequantly during waekends, as neither of us was able to travel
to bis home province wa used to gat togethar and visit with each other. I would
like to mention that I visited hlm last
Sunday atternoon for a hait hour or more,
at which time he appeared to be in perfect
haalth. George Barbour was a good conversationalist, and I anjoyed listening to him
ta]king about is early days in Prince Edward Island, his business connections, bis
public and political 11f e and other thlngs.
We had a very fine visit together. I know
that 1 arn going to miss him very much.
Senator Barbour was a prominent member
of five standing committees of the Senate,
including the Comnilttea on Divorce. When
I was chairman of that committee ha sat
at my laft most of the time, and I could
always depend upon bis being there and
being of great help to me.
The late senator was a very capable and
succassful businessman, and a public-minded
citizen. From what he told me I gather that
ha had beld nearly every important public
position in the district in wbich he lived.
Also, ha was a deeply religious man. He had
a great sanse of humour and enjoyad doing
things for othar people. I neyer knew hlm
to speak an uakind word to anyone. Ha livad
a long, useful life and in my opinion hae was
a great Prince Edward Islander. In 1935 ha
became a member of the Prince Edward
Island Legislature and beld bis seat until
1949 at whicb time he was appointed to the
Senate. During bis later years in the Legislature ha was Minister of Public Works and
Highways.
Few people knew that Sanator Barbour
was a keen sportsman. Ha was interastad
26211-3--%l

in curling, and also in harness-horse racing,
a popular sport on the Island. At one time he
owned some fine race horses.
His sudden passing yesterday evening was,
I arn sure, a shock to ail honourable senators,
as it was to me, and I wish to take this
opportunity of expressing to bis widow and
f amily our sincere regrets and heartfelt
sympathy.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, our late colleague, the Honourable
George Hilton Barbour, died as he had lived,
faithful to his task. His passing i this chamber a f ew minutes after he had made a
speech, and a good one, was indeed tragie,
but there was also something beautiful about
it. He died in the Senate chamber which, next
to bis own home, was the place hie loved most
and wbere, other thau among bis immediate
family, hae was surroumded by bis closest
friands. This was most evident last evening.
Thosa sitting on this side of the house did
flot notice that he had suddenly becoma ll.
However, the senator from Westmorland
(Hon. Mr. Taylor), who sits on the other sida
of the aisie, saw him and rushed over to hlm.
It was not long bafore two med.ical doctors
in the bouse, Sanators Sullivan and Gershaw,
want to his aid. Senator Barbour was indeed
among friands.
Honourable senators, no one could have
been a more diligent member of this chamber,
and no ona could have had the interests of bis
fellowmen, particularly those of Prince
Edward Island, more at heart than did Senator Barbour. A few months ago, bis closest
friend in this house, Senator Golding, passad
away. The two were insaparable. Now we
can think of them as togethar in the Great
Bayond.
As tbe Leader of the Government <Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) bas said, Senator Barbour was
a friendly man. He came to sea nma occasionaily. In fact, ha visited me the day
before hae passed away. We talked about conditions on the Island, and he was Indeed
optimistic about its future and of the immadiate prospect of the undertaklngs in whlch
he was s0 keenly interested. As we conversed
together, bie bad the spirit, not of one who is
about to reach a goal, but rathar that of a
young man who is about to ernbark on a
great venture. He was neyer one who lived
in the past. He lived In the prasent and for
the future.
The sudden passlng of Senator Barbour
must have been a great shock to bis loving
wife wbo, with hMm, had been looking forward to celebrating their fifty-flfth wedding
ariniversary on April 24 next. To Mrs.
Barbour, to their son and daughter, as wefl

Senator Barbour had a distinguished career.

had flot; attended the committee hearings for
the past two days, which was something very
unusual for him. He and the late Senator
Golding were the two most faithful attendants to the work of that committee. Senator
Barbour told me that he had been at home,
wbere there was work to be done, and he mentioned what it was. I replied that I hoped I
would meet him in the morning, and then
moved on.
Shortly afterwards-and he must have been
111 at the time-he made the speech that has
been referred to and which appears in the
Senate Hansard today. A few minutes after
that he breathed his last.
There is something to be said for a sudden
departure of that kind. It is an easy way out,
but it is a terrible shock to those who remain.
It was indeed a shock to us ail in this chamber, last night.
I join with the other honourable senators
who have expressed their sympathy to the
family, and I do so on behaif of ail the
members of the Standing Committee on Divorce. We sincerely regret Mis passing and
wiil always remember his good judgment, his
klndly attitude, and the constant attention and
devotion that he gave to his work. We Join
with ail others in expressing our sympathy
to Senator Barbour's family and our regret
at bis passing.
Hou. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
I should like to add a word by way of tribute to the late Senator Barbour; and I
sbould like to remark that coming from, the
Maritimes I feel very grateful for the tributes
which have been paid by the honourable
leaders in this bouse.
In the Maritimes we are a littie clannishthere being few of us-and we appreciate
anything that is said about our friends and
their virtues.
Mrs. Kinley and I were associating with
Senator Barbour and bis wif e last week, and
when I lef t for home at the weekend we
planned to meet again this week but, unfortunately, that wiil not be.
I came up to Ottawa on the plane this
morning with Senator Barbour's daughter
and Mis son's wife. They are here in Ottawa
with bis widow, and are taking the body
home this afternoon.
Senator Barbour enjoyed a great length of
days. He always appeared to be a man much
younger than bis years. He had a fine physique
and an alert mind, and looked like one wbo
was growing older gracefully. I believe we
ail considered him a fine example of the
older men of this country who carry their
looks and their dignity to the end.
Recently I asked bim why he was not in
attendance at the hearings of the Divorce

Committee, and be said, "Weil, I had to, do
some work for our friends in Prince Edward
Island." I do not; know what that work was,
but I am sure it was weil done.
Senator Barbour had a great deal of common sense, that virtue whlch, is not as comnmon as some people think, and he had a fine
record of public service. He was a good
farmer, a fine sportsman, and a good civil
servant. He was four times elected to the
Legislature of the province of Prince Edward
Island, and was a competent Minister of
Publie Works and Highways. We expected
that be would be with us for a long time,
but now he has gone. We neyer know what
is going to happen.
I am sure our sympathies and our affections go out to Mis wife and family on his
sudden passing. It is a time of sorrow for
them ail. In their sorrow I feel they can have
justifiable pride and get comfort from Ms fine
record. Their memories of him will be as
pure, clear, and radiant as the waters of a
mountain stream. His family have an abiding
faith, and in Ms last journey they wrnl know
that bis calling and election is sure.
Hon, William M. Wall: Honourable senators, in rising to pay tribute to the late Senator Barbour I, too, appreciated, honoured,
and was influenced by the quiet and unassuming dignity of this very humane man,
gentility and the nobility of character of an
experienced and devoted public servant. He
had the kindness of heart and the sincerity of
purpose which distinguished him and whlch
set him apart; as a fine Christian gentleman
and an exceptionaily fine Canadian citizen.
We shall miss him, and we shail pray for im.
and for those he left behind.
Hon. A. K. Hugesson: Honourable senators,
we are met this afternoon under the shadow
of the tragedy which took place ini tbis chamber yesterday evening. We were brought
very close to the thougbt which pervades
that pregnant statement once made by. the
great John Bright in the English House of
Commons, when he said:
The Angel of Death bas been abroad
throughout the land:
You may almost bear the beating of bis
wings.
We deeply regret the passing of our late

SENATE
which we see so often in our older friends,
that long, slow descent into illness, that gradual decrease of faculties, terminating, perhaps after months of pain and sorrow, in
the end.
What happened yesterday evening in this
chamber will, I am sure, remain always in
our memories, and it will bring back to us
very vividly that famous sentence that Edmund
Burke used in his great address to the electors of Bristol when he said:
Gentlemen... what shadows we are,
and what shadows we pursue.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
in conclusion to these very eloquent and
beautiful words of eulogy, and in honour and
remembrance of our departed friend, I ask
you to rise in your places for a few moments
of silence and prayer.
Honourable senators stood in silence.

the balance in aine niontha.
The !oregoing firn sales contracta involved a total o! 64.2 million buahels o!
wheat and 28.9 million buahela of barley,
of whlch 38.1 million bushels of wheat
and 19.8 million bushela of barley were
exported by July 31, 1961.

SENATE
In addition to these sales which were made
to China, I should like to point out that the
U.S.S.R. purchased 7.5 million bushels of
wheat for shipment from Pacifie coast ports.
Later, Ozechosiovakia purchased 12.1 million
bushels and Poland 7.1 million bushels. Shipments to the U.S.S.R. and Czechoslovakia
were completed by the end of the crop year,
while the shipments to Poland extended beyond July 31, 1961.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I interrupt my honourable friend ta ask a question? Did the last
three countries named, including Russia, pay
cash for the wheat they received or did they
purchase it by deferred payments?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: With the exception of
Poland, I understand cash was paid. Credit
ternis were extended ta Poland, but at this
time I arn nat aware what the credit terms
were.
I should also like ta caîl ta the attention
of honourable senatars the general increase
which has taken place in the expart of wheat
and flour fram this country between the year
ending July 31, 1960, and the year ending
July 31, 1961. 1 do not propose ta burden the
house with detailed statistics and figures but
1 should like ta point out that for that perîad
the increase in aur exparts ta Europe
amounted ta approximately 57 million bushels, and the increase in aur exparts ta Asia
amounted ta over 37 million bushels. In order
ta be perfectly fair I wauld also point out that
aur exparts ta the Union of South Africa decreased by 7 million bushels due ta the fact
that that country did nat purchase any wheat
from us during the last crop year, whereas
in the previaus crap year that country purchased almost 7 million bushels from Canada.

Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes. The increase that went
ta Cammunist China was just aver 34 million
bushels.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Has the hanourable senator
any figures relating ta the carryover?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I shail came ta that in due
course. I think this is a remarkable record
and the Gavernment deserves great credit for
increasing aur sales of wheat and aur exparts
of wheat.

ask the hanourable gentleman, so that we
may get a true picture of the Wheat Board's
sales ta the communist cauntries, if hie wauld

Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Why not?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I da nat have it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): But you

Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is right, but I quoted

board, the Canadian Wheat Board. This repart does not cantain the agreement. I have

FEDRUARY 7, 1962
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I amn asking the honourable Leader of the Government (H-on. Mr. Aseltine) now to produce
the agreement and put it on thxe table or else
we will be suspicious that something is being
hidden.
Hon. Mr. Horner: You would be suspicious
anyway.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I think you would be suspicious no matter what I said or did.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Oh, no.
Just show us the agreernent.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: My honourable frlend,
the Leader of the Opposition, has expressed
some concern, and I arn not being critical of
hlm for doing so, about the carryover of
wheat dixninishing rather rapidly and that
perhaps we were selling our wheat too
quickly. I arn one of those who believe in
Mother Nature, and I think the table which
has been published by the Canadian Wheat
Board justifies this belief.
I would caîl to your attention that for the
crop year 1937-38 the carryover was reduced
to-and I shaîl again give round figures-24
million bushels. It imrnediately started to
increase, and by 1942-43 the carryover had
gone up to 594 million bushels. Then it started
to decrease once again, and by July 31, 1946
It had been reduced to 73 million bushels.
Once again fixe carryover comrnenced to increase, and by 1956-57 the carryover had
reached the figure of 733 million bushels.
Since 1956-57 the carryover has decreased
annually so that at the end of fixe last crop
year, namely, July 31, 1961, it had been
reduced to 524 million bushels of grain. I
feel that fixe carryover can go considerably
below this figure before we have anything
about which to worry.
There is just one other thing I wish to
mention. I believe fixe honourable senator
fromn Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) had some
concern as to the amount of wheat that was
in the farmers' hands on July 31 of last year.
The figures whiclx have been furnished to me
are to the effect that on that date the farmers
had in their granaries slightly over 89 million bushels of wheat. There was a carryover
at that time of 435 million bushels, and the
crop at that date for last year was estixnated
te be 261 million bushels of wheat. So the
total visible supply at that tirne, including
the crop which was growing, was 786 million
bushels of wheat.
Honourable senators will realize that that
is a lot of wheat, and I am sure they will
agree with me when I say that we hope the
Government will continue in its efforts to
seli wheat so that the carryover may be
reduced to an even smaller figure.

Hon. William M. Wall: Honourable senators, if it is flot the intention to refer this
legisiation to our appropriate standing committee, then before third reading is given I
should like to make a f ew related observations which the honourable Leader of the
Governrnent (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) may wish to
comiment upon, along with any other remarks
he may rnake before the bill is flnally passed.
I believe it is proper and correct for the
national economy as a whole that each
Canadian should shoulder the burden of
bringing aid to those sectors of our economy
or to those geographic regions which are
faced with serious economic hardships or dislocations because of the hazards of nature,
because of technological or other production
changes, because of changes in trading polidies, and so on. And as has already been
commented upon in this debate, the amount
or relative level of this assistance must be
reasonably adequate, but it can neyer really
cover the losses whiclh are experienced by
those most directly concerned-in our specific
case here, the grain producers in the Prairie
provinces, or the fishermen in Newfoundland.
Before I address myself to the problemn of
how this aid is being distributed, I believe
that we should keep in focus the problem
raised by the honourable member from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) that this addi-

tional $82,390,000 wili be added to the budget-

ary deficit previously forecast at some $650
million. This means that during the present
fiscal year we shail be short some $730 million
for current day-to-day living expenses which
we should theoretically try to pay from our
current revenues.
Additional legislation already forecast in
the Speech from the Throne and educated
guesses as to the additional current costs involved run to about $300 million, or roughly
equal to the addition-al revenues which will
flow to the federal Government from an increase in our Gross National Product of between 6 to 7 per cent. This additional legisiation appears to indîcate that we shall have
another whoppmng budgetary deficit of about
the same size as this year's for the coming
fiscal year. This brings into sharper focus our
serious fiscal and monetary problems at a
time when- we are told that the Canadian
economy is doing very well indeed, which to
me means that we should at least be able to
pay for our ordinary living expenses out of
the current national revenues, rather than
pushing this burden off as a charge upon the
income of Canadians in the future.
Now, what bothers me about Vote 611 la
not fixe amount of the vote, which may be
reasonable and fair under our present
economic circumnstances, but thxe way fixe
money as appropriated will be distributed

SENATE
among the western grain producers. I agree
with the honourable senator from, Medicine
Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) that the basic weakness in the distribution formula is-and I arn
coinmng my own phrase-a kind of a "lshotgun approach", because we do flot differentiate
between and among the western grain
producers, as the Speech from the *Throne
would have us believe we would differentiate,
so that those producers who actuaily did suifer
from drought-and drought was the word
used-would get help, and more effective help
than is possible when we divide the "kitty"
among ail western grain producers without
any differentiation.
I arn not convinced that we could not work
out a more effective distribution, formula;
and I am perturbed by the answer I give
myseif to this question. I know a lot of
farmers, and I know a lot of regions in
Manitoba, regions where there were poor
crops and regions where there were good
crops, and so I ask myself this question: Why
should a western grain producer who did have
a normal harvest get this assistance?
Are the organizations which represent the
agricultural cornmunity in western Canada
satisfied with this acreage payrnent distribution formula, and how does this aid compare
to and square with the aid to producers in
other sections of Canada-I arn talking about
agriculture-which are also subi ected to the
hazards of nature? In western Canada we
have the P.F.A.A. and this, acreage payment.
What about farmers in. other parts of Canada?
Do they have similar aid advantages or support programs, and are these comprehensive
and reasonably equitable to farmers, irrespective of the province they live in? And are
these aid programs of what we rnay terrn a
"ýcrop insurance nature" here geared to meet
assessed and demonstrable and measurable
needs or losses, or do we give aid to al
producers on a kind of indiscriminate basis,
as Vote 611 provides? What about the cornprehensive and contrîbutory crop insurance
plan for ail agricultural producers wherever
they rnay live in Canada?
But we were told that this acreage payment principle is to meet another basic need
and purpose. It has been described to us as
a means of reirnbursing western grain producers for sorne of the loss of income which.
cornes from the fact that we do not have a
two-price systemn. If that is so, honourable
senators, then I have a right to ask these two
questions: first, why then were no acreage
payments made in 1959 and 1961? Certainly
during those two years, too, our western grain
producers suffered incorne losses because there
was no two-price systern. Secondly, if this is
so, and we are now atternpting a roundabout

method at meeting the demands of the producers for a two-price systern, can we take
it that similar acreage payrnents will be made
in the succeeding years even if there is no
drought or incorne loss frorn the liazards of
nature?
We rnight remember in the context of this
discussion that the latest Dominion Bureau of
Statistics figures for farrn cash income seem
to indicate that with the annual average of
674,000 persons employed in agriculture in
1961, the cash incorne of Canadian farmers
for that year reached an ail tirne high of $2.9
billion higher than in 1952, when the average
annual number* of persons employed in agriculture was 891,000, sorne 220,000 more than
in 1961; and this $2.9 billion does flot include
approxixnately $36 million, which is going to
be paid out to the farmers under the P.F.A.A.The figures for the various provinces are
rather interesting because they show that
there has been an increase in income in each
of the western provinces as compared with
1960.
Vote 612 still perturbs me, because I arn
not convinced that the sum of $300,000 wil
go far to meet the apparent Ioss of income
suffered by what is estimated to be 12,000
inshore fishermen. We were told by one
honourable senator that there was an incorne
loss of one-third, or somewhere in the neighbourhood of $3 million, and this $300,000
bears a percentage relationship to this loss
by Canadians, whose average annual income,
in very modest terrns, is certainly not very
hîgh. It would have been interesting and
reassuring to me if we could have heard from
representatives of the Departrnent of Fisheries, preferably before a comniittee examining this bull, to see how reasonable this surn
total is in relation to the assessed need and
how this aid wiil in fact be distributed.
Now I corne to Vote 614, the one about the
winter works prograrn. I understand that last
year at a cost to the federal Government of
$35,923,000, we provided work for 121,197
people for a total of 5,150,405 mnan days o!
work. If we divide these 5 million man days
into the sum of $36 million, we find that a
man's day of work was provided at a cost to
the federal treasury of slightly more than $7.
0f course, this is only half the total cost of
a mnan's day of work, for the provincial or
local authorities contribute the other half.
Then sornewhere I noted-and I do not know
whether this is entirely correct or not-that
this year a total cost of $66 million was apparently going to provide roughly 111,200
jobs for 4,743,000 man days. If you divide that
into the axnount of money, you also corne out
with a figure of a little better. than $14 per

FEBRUARY 7. 1902
day. Whether these estimates are vaid or
l
flot is something that I cannot now askin
committee.
So we are making progress, but it is interesting, honourable senators, to note that the
average amount of work provided to these
people is between eight and nine weeks, and
the period during which this winter works
program runs, I think, started this year in
October, and is to end some time in May. So
eight or nine weeks out of a long period like
that is flot very much work.
Now, honourable senators, I should like
to read into the record at this point the
interesting comments of Mr. Michael Bancway which appeared in the Ottawa Citizen of
Friday, February 2, under the titie, "Jobless
Benefits Spoil Advantage of Winter Works."
Because I shail not have an opportunity to
asic about this problem in committee, I want
to bring it to your attention now.
Alter commenting on the fact that in
the last two years the federal Government
has paid over $100 million to approximately
440,000 persons who qualified as seasonally
unemployed, and commienting upon the terrific drap in the assets of the Unemployment
Insurance Fund, Mr. Barkway writes as
follows:
But this $40,000,000 programi and al
the other efforts to reduce winter unemployment, have* been completely frustrated by the indiscriminate extension
of seasonal benefits.
They put to work barely hall as many
people as the $100,000,000 of seasonal
benefits keeps away from worlc.
The authorities agree ahnost unanimously with the comment of one labor
expert, who has been associated with
winter work campaigns fram their very
beginning back in 1953.
'For every step forward we have made,'
he said bitterly, 'seasonal benefits have
pushed us two steps backward.'
More than a year ago Goverrnent
officiais had complete studies showing
what had to be done to stop squandering
the resources of the Unemployment Insurance Fund and to put it back on a sound
basis.
It is not the taxpayers who are being
cheated-yet.
The. Hon. the. Speaker: What is the honourable senator reading from?
Hon. Mr. Wall. An article that appeared
ini the Ottawa Citizen.
The Hon. the. Speaker: Is it a leiigthy
article?
Hon. Mr. Wall: I axa almost finished reading the part I want ta read.

I continue reading:
It is not the taxpayers who are belng
cheated-yet. As taxpayers, we start
picking up the. tab orily when the fund's
$900,000,000 has been completely exhausted a month or two hence.
The Canadians who have been cheated
for these last five years are the employers and workers who have been
paying their regular contributions into
the fund on the promise of definite,
specifled benefits.
Hon. Mr. Thorvadmon: May I asic the honourable gentleman a question? 1 take it that
these are the words of some author. Does he
belleve that Canadians have been cheated,
or is he just reading this into the record
with the word "cheated" in there?
Hon. Mr. Wall: I arn reading it into the
record because I wanted ta asic questions
about this particular problem.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldsan: Do you belleve
that Canadians have been cheated?
Hon. Mr. Wall: You want to know whether
I arn adapting these words as my own?
Hon. Mr. Thorvadson: Yes. Are you adopting these words as your own? That Is my
question.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Under the rules of the
Senate you are not ailowed to read that at ail.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
generally speaking, members of the Senate
are here ta give their own opinions on subjects and matters under debate, and not to
read speeches and opinions of others, because
we cannot cross-examine or question those
persans on their words. An honourable senator who wishes to quote from an article should
not do so to any length, and he should
adopt the opinions that he reads as bis own,
and give them, in his own language.
Therefore my ruling is-and I think I
wiil be upheld by honourable senators who
perhaps have more experience than I-that
reading of long speeches and editorials is not;
generafly ailowed, because a member of
Parliament, whether in the other place or
here, should give bis own opinion on matters
and not; those of other pensons who have
nothing to do with the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Wall: I shall desist from reading
anything more into the record.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Might we have an
answer to the question I asked?
Hon. Mr. Wall: Yes, with the comment, that
I would not use the word "cheated".
Hon. Mr. Thorvaidion: Why did you use It
then?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Wall: But I would say that I,
like other Canadians, anm very concerned
about the eftect, namely, that the contributions which have been brought into the fund
an one set of rules have been dlluted and
used after the rules have been changed. In
other words, there has been a problem created, and seasonal payments have been thus
depleting the Unem-ployment Insurance Fund.
This problem has in fact been met at the
expense of the contributors into this fund,
that is, at the expense of the employers and
employees who have been contributing. In
my judgement the proper way to have allacated this burden would have been ta place
it on the Canadian people as a whole, that is,
on the public treasury.
I was very interested in the information
given in the table which honourable senators
will find on page 59 of yesterday's Hansard
ini which were listed the variaus projects
which are already part of the winter weorks
prograni. We are told how much they
amounted to. You can add them up, ta find
how much the federal contribution would be,
and ini which provinces these projects are
being undertaken.
I thought that it might be interesting ta
honourable senators if I made an extension
of this table. Sa I have prepared another
table which gives the relationships of these
projects ta the personal incame. In it I have
used the latest available personal incarne
figures for 1960 for Canada as distributed on
a percentage basis ta the population as of

Personal Income 1960
(1960)

Population
(March 1961)

March 1961, and the unemployment as a percentage af the total labour farce as of December 9, 1961-that, too, is the latest available figure. Then I have taken these projects,
added up the total, and I have made a percentage distribution ai these items. In British
Columbia, for example, there are prai ects
now amounting ta $27.5 million, of which the
federal contribution is $4.2 million. The total
projects amaunt ta $256 million. This warks
out ta 10.8 per cent; and the federal contribution ta British Columbia of $4.2 million,
out ai a total of $32,435,000, warks out ta
12.9 per cent.
I have made percentage relationships to
the personal income, the population, the unemployment level, and the prajects, ta see
how those things fit, and I have came up
with very interesting generalizations which
point Up certain problems.
For example, the people of Newfoundland get 1.4 per cent of the total personal
incarne ai Canada. The population of Newfoundland is 2.6 per cent of the total population of Canada. But in Newfoundland 19.0
per cent of the total labour force is unemployed. The prajects there amaunt ta $3.5
million, as found on page 59 af yesterday's
Hansard, which is 1.4 per cent af the total
projects, and the amaunt ta be spent by the
federal treasury amounts ta 1.2 per cent ai
the tdtal ta be spent.
I should like permission ta place this table
an record, so that honourable senators can
examine it and draw whatever conclusions
they wish.

and the local authorities have to contribute
to make such a winter works program or
project possible, those provinces that have
more means, that often have less unernplayment and greater possibilities, are able to
benefit more from a prograrn of this type.
It would be of interest if one were able ta
compare the actual nurnber of unemployed

FEBRUAIRY 7, 1962
i each region or locality wxth the actual
nuinber of jobs that these projects will provide and the period over which they will be
provided. For example, I read somewhere
that there are 67,000 unemployed in Toronto.
There would be 2,000 jobs provided through
the projects that are being undertaken in that
area.
Consideration of Bill C-51 by a standing
committee might have enabled us to obtain
this pertinent information, to judge what
progress we are really making through the
Introduction of this winter works program,
and how we might possibly enlarge upon it
or Improve It. Thank you, honourable senators.
Hon. Arthur W. Ro.buck: Honourable senators, I should like first ta say that while I
agree with what His Honour the Speaker lias
said with regard to the reading of excerpts
by the honourable senator who has just
resumed his seat (Hon. Mr. .Wall), I think an
extension of what he said ought to, be placed
on the record.. A member of this house has
the right to read an excerpt from a newspaper as the basis for a question, without
binseif endorsing the opinion expressed. The
honourable senator, In the course of his
address, said the reading of the excerpt was
for the purpose of asking a question-I
assume, of the administration. If he has been
prevented from asking a question as a resuit
of the rullng, I submit to, Ris Honour the
Speaker that he should be allowed to use it
i that mariner.
Hon. Mr. Thorvadmon: Even if it is libelous?
Hoa. Mr. Ro.buck:- There is nothing libelous here. Nonsense!
Hon. Mr. Thorvadson: If anYbody is
accused of cheating, and if that accusation is
flot; true, a libel is committed.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It was net a libel. I
was a member of the committee that drew
up the Unemployment Insurance Act years
ago, when I was in the Commons, and we
very carefully provided that the contributions made by the employer and the emnployee
shouid be drawn upon in certain ways. We
had had the reports of auditors and accountants, and we carefufly balanced the one
agalnst the other. During the ensuing years
eniployers have contributed to the fund on
that basis.
This Governnient lias disregarded the basis
of the Unemployment Insurance Act and
lias used the funds for ulterior purposes;
and If that is not; cheating the employers and
the employees, wefl, I do flot know wliat
eheatlng is. The word ta properly used: it is

cheating. It ia cheating those who have pald
money in on a certain basis and their money
has been used for other purposes.
Hon. Mr. Hollett: Honourable senators,
miglit I ask the honourable member who lias
just resumned bis seat (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
what the ulterior purposes were for which.
the Goverriment used the money?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: They were purposes not
expressed lin the original act or ini the act as
it has been administered over the years, up
until very recent times. These were the ulterlor purposes.
Hon. Mr. HoUaitt: Could the honourable
senator tell us exactly what the ulterior
purposes were?
Ha. Mr. Ra.buck: I have not; the list ta
hand. The honourable senator knows themn
just as well as I do.
Motion agreed ta and bll read second ie.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the. Acting Speaker (Hon. Mr.
Pearson): Honourable senators, wlien shal
this bill be reaci the third time?
Hon. Mr. AssUmie: With leave
Senate, I move third reading now.

of the

Hon. W. Rosa Macdonald (Brantford): Honourable senators, before the motion is agreed
to, may I say that I am consentlng to the
bill being read a third time now because
there ta some urgency i the matter. I understand the Government requires the funds sa
that people can be put to, work immedlately.
I would not delay that process i any way
whatsoever. It la for that reason that I am
agreeing ta third reading today.
However, lionourable senators, It Is clear
that we have not obtained all the Information we should have. Leglalation like this
should be considered in commlttee. Also, we
should have more definite information about
the agreement which the Wheat Board lias
with the conimuniat countries.
Hon. Mr. Aseltin.: I will obtain that Iformation, if possible.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): The honourable Leader of the Goverrnent saes he
will get 1t, but in the meantimne we shal
have passed the bill.
Honourable senators, I cannot underatand
why the lionourable senatar frorn Hanover(Hon. Mr. Brunt), who sis on the Government
aide, would read ta us a document which
purporta ta give this agreement, and which,
gives it ta us in tablold fanm. I asked the lionourable senatar if lie wouid produce the agreement, and he told me that Ife would not and

SENATE
could not. It is some kind of a secret document. It is a document that we shouid know
about, because we know it exists. What is the
Government holding back?
My honourable friend the Leader of the
Government says that he wiil produce it
tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: I did not say that. I
said that if I could obtain it I would produce
it. I do flot know whether I can obtain the
agreement; I do not know whether or flot
there is such an agreement.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): My honourable friend from Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt)
referred to the agreement. What it actualiy
contains, we do flot know. We know it contains one thing, and that is that the Government of Canada-that is, we, the peopleare guaranteeing the debts of Communist
China to the Wheat Board.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Just as we do in al
these other exports. The Government guarantees that the money wiil be paid.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): That may
be so, but the fact remains that apart from
what the honourable senator from Hanover
read to us, the only thing we know about the
agreement concerns the guarantee made by
the Government-that is, by the people of
Canada-in connection with the debts of a
communist country. That may be ail right, or
it may be ail wrong. But surely, on important
matters like that we should have the agreement tabled so that we can consider it.
It is too late to do that now. Certainly, we
on this side of the house are flot going to
hold up this bill. We are flot going to deprive
people of employment in order to obtain this
information.
What 1 say to the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) is that ini ail fairness, in
the future-and I know hie is flot deliberately
withholding anything-when we have legisiation which must go through quickly we should
have ail the information which is available,
and that information should be set before us
before the bull is presented.
Hon. Mr. Ro.huck: I should like to suggest
a further provision in connection with this
matter, that when that document is produced
and laid on the table, the debate with respect
to it shail continue and we shail have the
right to discuss the document, as weil as the
opportunity of reading it.
I thin-k it should be understood between
the Government and the Opposition-indeed,
among us ali-that such a document shail be
open to discussion when the appropriate time
comes.

Hon. Austin C. Taylor: Honourable senators, before this bill is given third reading I
should like to say a few words in connection
with it.
In 50 far as Item No. 611 is concerned I am
in agreement as to the amount of money that
is going to be paid to those who need it. Since
the inception of this scheme, in 1958 or 1959,
it seems to me that we have approached this
problem in a bit or miss fashion, and that is
an approach that is not going to solve the
problem at ail.
That the farmer in the west who bas a
5-bushel crop per acre is going to get the
same amount of money as the farmer who bas
only a 5-bushel crop per acre seems to me to
be totally unfair. I know that travelling to,
and fr0, between Ottawa and my home, last
September I saw many thousands of acres of
oats between Ottawa and Montreai completely
ruined, with not a bushel barvested, and yet
the farmers did not get any assistance.
I am suggesting that this Government, or
some other government, give consideration in
the very near future to some form of crop
insurance that will take care of ail these
problems and those individuals who need
assistance, but which wiil flot embrace those
people who do not need assistance, and let it
apply right across the country from one coast
to the other.
Honourable senators, that is the only thing
I have to say about this measure. I do not
like the way this assistance is being given.
I believe there are people who are going to
get money out of this but who do flot need
it and who do not deserve it. On the other
hand, I believe there are many small f armers
in the drought stricken areas of the west who
will get money which they soreiy need, and
for that reason I am supporting the bull.
However, I repeat, I do not like the manner
in which this bill bas been presented. This
sort of thing has been going on for four years,
and it is my opinion that it is time some
method was developed whereby the man who
loses the crops will get the assistance, and
those who lose nothing will get no assistance.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable senator a question? Would hie be satisfied if the Governiment established a fund
such as the Unemployment Insurance Fund
for the payment of crop losses, and then be
ailowed to use that fund for another purpose?
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): No, honourable senators, 1 am flot suggesting that. I am
suggesting that some system of crop insurance
be evolved, with the bulk of its funds being
provided by the national Government. In
three years we have spent $126 million on this
$1 per acre program, and it seems to me that

FEBRUARY 7, 1962
that money could very easily have been used
to build up an insurance fund that could take
care of ail the situations from, coast ta coast
and be applicable flot ta just one individual
area or group of indivlduals.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: Does the hanourable senator mean that premiuxns would be paid by the
praducers year by year as weil?
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): Certalnly.
I think the producers should contribute something ta it in the same way as they contribute under the P.F.A.A. Ail of this money is
coming from. the taxpayers. The farmers of
the west do flot pay any of this except by
way of taxation. There should be evolved
some system of insurance, the funds of which
could be contributed, some by the provinces,
some by the individual farmers, but with the
bulk coming from the national Governient.
Such a schexne will not cost any more than
is being spent at the present time.
Motion agreed ta and bill read third time

SENATE
Honourabie senators, this is a motion to
set up once again the Special Committee
of the Senate ta report on land use in
Canada, and what shouid be clone to ensure
that our land resources are most effectively
utilized for the benefit of the Canadian econamy and the Canadian peopie and, in particular, to increase bath agricuiturai production and the incomes of those engaged in It.
I arn not; going to say very much in support of this motion except that this committee was set up some six sessions ago,
and during each succeeding session it was
set up again. This committee did rnost valuable work, and I have naticed many times
that the newspapers of western Canada, and
sorne of the eastern newspapers, have quoted
whole paragraphs of the committee's reports.
The work that has been dlone by this com.rnittee has been spoken of very highly.
Honourable senators will rernember that
the Agricultural Rehabilitation and Developrnent Act, known as the A.R.D.A., was
passed iast year, and that act was a direct
resuit of the report of this cornmittee with
respect ta its investigation into matters
of this kind.
I have no idea of exactly what the cornmittee intends ta do this year, but it is my
understanding that a large number of its
members have asked that it be reinstituted
so that they wili be allowed ta f ollow Up
the work they have been doing. There are
rnany people ini different parts of Canada
who wish ta corne ta Ottawa ta make representations.
Hon. Mr. Raebuck: Can the honourable
Leader of the Governrnent (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) give any undertaking or assurance
ta the members of the comrnittee as tai the
length of tirne in whîch they will have ta act
on this cornrittee before dissolution?
Hon, Mr. Aselline: I amn neither a prophet
nor the son of a prophet.
Honourable senators, I arn therefore moving this motion, which I hope the Senate
will pass, s0 that the cornmittee can be set
up and get ta work.
Han. W. Rass Macdonald: Honourable senators, I arn very pleased ta associate myseif
with the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) in presenting this
motion ta the bouse. It is aiways a pleasure,
and sornewhat of a change, ta be able ta
agree entirely witb the proposais which he
brings forward. In this instance, it is my
good fortune ta be able ta concur in ahl he
has said.
This committee over the years has undertaken sorne very important investigations,
and It bas presented ta this bouse, as the
bonourable Leader of the Government has

said, very valuabie reports which have
been praised in the press throughout the
land.
It is my understanding that the committee is ta be more or iess a continuing cornrnittee and that probabiy it will be set up
from year ta year. I do not know what the
committee will investigate this year. I do
know that in my district there are two very
grave problems. One is the so-called vertical
integration, where large acreages are being
taken over by corporations and being worked
by those corporations, whlle the smailer
farrner, although be rnight praduce a crop,
cannot dispose of it. It creates a hardsbip
for the srnall farmer.
What is going ta happen ta, the family
farrn? I know the cornmittee bas aiready
inquired inta this problern but it continues
ta be a seriaus one. We have always considered farmers ta be the backbone of this
country, particularly those on srnall farrns.
Unfortunately these farms are disappearing.
The cornrittee rnay deem it worth while ta
consider this particular prablern again. In
any event, I arn happy ta assaciate myseif
with the honourable Leader of the Governrnent (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) in presenting this
rnotion.
(Translation):
Han. Cyrille Vaillancourt: Honourable senators, rnay I be allowed ta add a few words.
This cornrittee for the past few years bas
been doing a magnificent job, but a job that
we bave been daing inside, confined between
these walls. Experts appear before us. We
listen ta what they have ta say. But what
I think this cornrittee shauld do is ta delegate a few of its nernbers, or ta go itself as
a whole, ta study on the spot the problems
we are trying ta salve.
This idea I arn subrnitting today cornes frorn
the fact that I was brought face ta face with
reality a few weeks aga when, at home, we
were discussing an agricultural prablem. We
were trying ta salve it, ail the while discussing it with certain officiais, without ever
reaching a solution.
One fine day we decided to go and find
out about these things on the spot. We went
there in order ta determine what was really
the matter, and, after seeing how the people
lived, we understood the problern and found
the solution.
Furtherrnore, with the legisiation enacted
last year by the Governrnent, and which
derives frorn the study made by this coinmittee, we will be able ta salve more than
one problem.
By thus making an-the-spot studies we are
able ta find solutions which we could not;
devise if we were ta work in the dark, within

FEBRUARY 7, 1962
four walls. The western iarmer's condition
and that ai the fermer in the centre ai the
Maritime provinces are not identical. We are
unable ta put ourselves i thase people's
shoes. We are uneble ta, live the way those
people want ta live and can live. The committee which 15 ta be set up egain has done
some fine work i the past and has secured
the views ai a good many people but I feel
that some ai its members should, either durig
the session or aiterwards, investigate on the
spot, the prablems that arise and the solutions
which could be suggested. That is haw we
would truly be able da sorne constructive
worlc.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN~ REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUTED

The Senate resumed irorn Thursday,
February 1, consideration ai His Excellency
the Governar General's speech at the opening ai the session., and the motion ai Hon. Mr.
Méthot, seconded- by Han. Mr. Hollett, for
an address in reply thereto.
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable senators, in rising ta speak today I find rnyseli
experiencing conflicting ematians. When I
thaught I was going ta speak i the chamber
last evening I was i samewhat ai a fighting
rnood for I couid, as in aid times when I was
in active palitics, smefl the scent ai an election
battle. But aiter the tragic passing in this
chamber last evening af Senator Barbour,
and the eloquent tributes paid ta hlm this
aiternoon, I sat here wonidering just how
worth while is contentiausness in this lufe ai
ours, for even for us "younger" senators the
end cannat be tao far away. I find myseli
twa or three years yaunger than. Senatar
Crerar and one year younger than aur late
calleague. However, the realities ai life require us ta take up the burdens as they came
eliong and ta face issues as they canirant us.
I should like, therefare, wlthout elaborating,
ta, join in the expressions ai congratulation
ta the mover and the seconder ai the address
i reply ta the Speech frorn the Throne. This
Is my twenty-sixth year in the Senate and I
know af no occasion when formal expressions
are mare eppropriately pleced an the record
ai this house.
I should like ta say a iew words about
the honourable Leader ai the Gavernment
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) and the honourable Leader
ai the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald). I am
a little prejudiced, for I like them bath.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is not prejudiée.

Hon. Mr. Farris: But that does not affect
rny honest opinion that their speeches ini this
debate v,#ere well worth while. What appeaied
to me was their fairness and moderation. If
I ever returned to the frame of mind I used
to be in when I was in the Legisiature af
British Columbia, I arn afraid I could not
qualify in that staternent.
I particularly want ta join ini the congratulations that have been extended ta the honourable Leader of the Governrnent in his
appointment as a Privy Councillar. No one
inside or outside this Parliament is more entitled to that position than is he. I amn sorry
ta add some words af regret. First, he ought
ta have been given that position long ago and,
second, he should have been appointed a
member of the Governmnent af this country.
Though I feel that that should came ta hirn
as an individual, I lfeel more strongly that it
should corne ta him on behalf af the Senate
as a constitutional part af Parliament. If yau
look at the recitals af the British North
Amerîca Act you will find these wards:
Whereas the Provinces ai Canada,
Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick have
expressed thefr Desire ta be federally
united into One Dominion under the
Crown af the United Kingdam of Great
Britain and IrelandAnd these are the words I want ta ernphasize.
-with a Constitution similar ini Principle
ta that af the United Kingdom.
As I understand the policy and principles
of the Governmnent af the United Kingdarn,
the Hause af Lards is, in the fullest sense, as
rnuch a part af Parliament as is the Com.mons, and for reasons that are gaod and
valid. On anather occasion I may elabarate
on this and draw comparisons between the
Hause ai Lards and the Canadian Senate,
but for the present I want ta say that one ai
the essentials in the institution ai the Parliarnent af Britain has been recognition af the
fact that there has always been, in modern
times at ieast, one or more prorninent rnembers ai the Gaverinent in the House of
Lords. If there is an exception ta this I do
flot know about it. But I can say with saiety
that almast universally under aur principles
ai government the Senate has been represented by a rnerber i the Government, and
I know af noa one who is more entitled ta
that position, irorn the standpaint ai abillty
and experience, than the honourable Leader
ai the Gavèrnment (Han. Mr. Aseltine). I can
see absolutely fia justification, frarn a canstitutional standpoint, why, in ail the years he
has been Leader af the Government in the
Senate, he should nat have been made a
member af the Government ai Canada.

SENATE
I wish next to extend congratulations to
the two honourable senators who have preceded me in this debate on the address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne. One of
these speakers was the senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar). I had occasion once before
to refer to him as one of the greatest men
of our time in public life. I was very much
pleased to read in today's issue of the Globe
and Mail the following reference to him:
Senator Thomas Crerar this week provided a powerful argument against those
who want an age limit in the Senate. The
85-year old Manitoba senator made by
far the most sensible contribution to the
current parliamentary debate over the
Government's proposed $10 a month increase in the old-age pensions.
A contribution of that kind is not unusual
from my honourable friend. I think now, as
I said last year, that he is one of our outstanding men in public life. He is remarkable for his virility, memory, sound judgment, and the continuous contribution he is
able to make to the public life of Canada.
I would like now to say a word about the
lady senator (Hon. Mrs. Irvine) who preceded
me in this debate. I am sure we all felt great
admiration for her speech. I sat here in quiet
appreciation, almost in amazement, of her
masterly
demonstration
of
indisputable
figures, which came almost like a snowstorm
as she proceeded to analyse the contribution
which Canada is making, under the present
Government, to the welfare of Canadian
citizens. However, when her speech had
ended I could not help wondering why, with
all her remarkable ability to paint this picture of how much money we are spending,
she did not also use that ability to tell us
where the money is to come from and how
we are going to raise it. We expect from the
ladies a contribution that mere man is not
able to make. Every woman, married or
single, who is sensible and responsible, as my
good friend opposite is, always gives consideration not only to the good things-in the
case of a married woman, that a husband
provides-but to the question of whether
there is the money to pay for them, and she
will soon put her foot down to safeguard
extravagant expenditures. I regard this question very seriously, and I fear that the strong
impression the honourable lady senator has
made-and must make on the women and
men of Canada who are in sympathy with
this question-by much eloquence and cogent
emphasis on the getting of these benefits,
may have smothered the proper consideration
of where the money is coming from to provide those benefits.

Honourable senators, I have before me a
little book which someone gave me a few
years ago. It is a digest of all Mr. Diefenbaker's speeches in 1957 and 1958. I think
it would be important to take from it one or
two quotations-and since they are quotations
from the present Prime Minister of Canada,
I take it I am in order in doing so. First,
I will quote from a speech he made at Guelph
on May 13, 1957, as appeared in the London
Free Press on May 14, 1957.
Mr. Diefenbaker said that if the Liberals
were returned to power, Canadians would
find an ever-increasing tax burden in all
municipalities and all provinces. This
ultimately would reach the point of complete socialization. Taxation in Canada
now was deemed confiscatory and had
been so labelled by a former deputy
minister of National Revenue.
There could be a tax reduction in
Canada and at the same time an increase
in old age pensions and other security
benefits on the strength alone of the
Liberal Government's $500,000,000 surplus of last year.
On May 24 of the same year, speaking from
Vancouver on a C.B.C. radio election broadcast, he said:
We will put an end to excessive overtaxation. We will call a session of Parliament in September to reduce taxes,
and at that session, with five hundred
million dollars over-taxation last year we
will be able to increase the old age and
other pensions to fair and reasonable
amounts. The Liberals tell you it is not
possible to lower taxes and raise pensions
at the same time. Give us a chance...
we'll show you! Any party that cannot do
this with that surplus does not deserve
to be made responsible for public funds.
Honourable senators, I got off the track a
little to make these observations. It so happens that Mr. Diefenbaker was not even right
in his figures, but I think I am entitled to
take his figures as the basis of my argument,
whether they are right or not, because he
quoted them to the people, and he became
elected accordingly. In justification of that
$500 million, why in the world, when his
Government first took office, did he not give
to old age pensioners the increase they are
now promised? Never in the history of Canada
had a government so much money to spend
on old age pensions, as when the present
Government first took office.
A little later I shall quote figures from Mr.
Diefenbaker's speeches to show that this Government not only got rid of the $500 million

FEBRUARY 7, 1962
surplus, but that it has created a deficit of,
1 believe, between $800 million and $1 billion.
Hon. Mr. Raebuck: Is that just for one
year?
Hon. Mr. Farris: -I shafl give you more details of that in a minute. I think it is for one
year, but 1 get a littie confused with figures
as big as these. The point I wish to make
is that if the Government can increase the
old age pension by $10 a month above the
amount granted under the previous admiinistration, why in the world did it not do so
four years ago when it had ail that surplus?
Why wait four years and deprive the pensioners of the money which Mr. Diefenbaker
at that tine 'said was available to do these
things?
Hlonourable senators, I return to what I
was first talldng about, when I said how
much I regretted that the honourable lady
senator, with all her abllity for studying and
assembing these figures, did not also show
the other side of the picture and give us a
f ull understanding of where this money is
going ta come from. My honourable friend
from Toronto-Trinity '(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has
asked me about the deficits. I wish ta refer
ta some statements; which. have appeared in
the'Globe and Mail and also in the Montreal
Gazette, tWo great papers of Canada. I am
not at ail clear from. reading these papers
which side o! polltics they are on, but over
the years there has been no question about
it, they have been Conservative papers first,
and active supporters af the Government.
Now, the figures I wish to, quote are very
important. I know that somebody said -not
long ago that it is easy ta get quotations from,
sanie papers, with an accent and a sneer on
the word "some", but it is not easy to, get
quotations from papers like the Globe and
Mail and the Gazette and have their fairness
questioned, particularly when they are
against the present Government. I have before me an article froni the Globe and Mail
af January 25 last, written by Bruce Macdonald, under the heading, "Fleming Adds
$42 Million ta Deficit."1 May 1 read the concluding Paragraph, Mr. Speaker?

but there was a mighty big one even at that.
Now, if in 1958 he could flot use that surplus
for an increase in old age pensions, how in the
world is he going to be able to give an extra
$10 a month now when there is no surplus
and there is an $800 million deficit? There is
only one reason that I can figure-and I would
ask my honourable friend from Lisgar (Hon.
Mrs. Irvine) to mention this when she speaks
ta the ladies outside this chamber-and that
is that an election is in sight.
That is what the Globe and Mail has to say.
Now I would like ta turn to the opinion of
this other great Conservative paper. It sueaks
with authority.
I heard His Honour the Speaker say today
that members of the Senate should give their
own opinions, but I do not know any better
way for the good Conservative members of
this Senate to get their opinions than to go to
the greatest published newspapers on their
side of the fence and see what they think of
this expendîture question. I shall not read
very much of the article. I shail leave out
the first paragraph, although it is pertinent.
This will answer my honourable friend from.
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) a littie
better.
The Governinent in the current fiscal
year is running a deficit that amounts to
about $1.3 billion.
Mon. Mr. Dupuis: What is the date o! the
article?
Hon. Mr. Farris: January 23, 1962.
Hon. Mr. Ro.buck: That is just a f ew days
ago?
Hon. Mr. Farris: Just a f ew days ago.
I say with great deference ta you, Mr.
Speaker, and ta ýail honourable senators, that
we find this outstanding paper-a. paper
friendly ta this Governinent--on the eve o!
an election warning Canadians as strongly
as its conscience wiil permit. It is, warning
us about new expenditures on these things
that my honourable friend the Leader o!
the Goverrnent (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) s0 eloquently and sa skilfully portrayed. I read:
The Government in the current fiscal
year is running a deficit that amounts
ta about $1.3 billion.

Th. Hon. the Speaker: Go ahead
Hon. Mr. Farris: It reads:
As a result of the failure af revenues ta
increase as expected and of expenditures
Hon. Mr. Assumie: They are just guessing.
ta remain within the prescribed bounds,
the minister already faced the possibillty
Hon. Mr. Farns: Has my honourable friend
that his deficit would came ta at least any better guess?
$800,000,000 for the year.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Certainly.
Now, honourable senators, get that picture:
Hon. Mr. Bruni: We do not guess.
$800 million for this year. Yet Mr. Diefenbaker told us in 1957-58 there was a $500
Hon. Mr. Farris: I have not heard in elther
million surplus. There was not, it sa happens, branch o! Parliament one Tory speaker who

SENATE
has any better guess than this from a friendly Queen's University. "In these days", said
Conservative newspaper. Are we running this Mr. Frost, "there are a great many things
country on guesses?
we would like to do."
Now it is all right for you, Mr. Speaker,
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It looks like it. You

appear to be guessing.
form your own opinions", but I am not a

Down at the bottom. you can see just a

You will see the toboggan slde representing
the different' countries as to their export percentages in this period of fine months. It
starts with Italy and includes Germany,
Sweden, Switzerland, Holland, ail the countries in black, Japan, the United Kingdom,
France, Belgium-and then Canada is down
at the bottom. It is just enough ta show above
a black lime. Apparently belowr that is the
United States, but make, no mistake, honourable senators, in camparing Canadian and
United States exports. I believe everyane in
this chamber agrees that export trade is far
more essential ta the growth and prosperity
af Canada than it is ta the United States.
If I arn allowed ta continue my remarks,
I shall in a moment invite hanourable semators ta cansider the European Common

Hon. Mr. Croil: 220 million.

Hon. Mr. Farris: I understand that in the
European Camman Market there is a population af less than 200 million-about
100,700,000. It is anticipated that other cauntries will join, and they will represent another
100 million. Then. the Common Market will
be greater than that af the United States.
However, today the United States has a common. market of its own, with a population
af over 200 million, and they are not in the
same position as Canada. Sa they do not seek,
and do flot need a great export market for
their mamufactured goods, comparable ta
those that are showm' in this chart. Of al
those members mentioned in the chart-Italy,
Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Holland, al

I have in my notes a legal story that is
somewhat generally in legal circulation, but
I think that a change in one word would
give it application to this discussion. An accused was tried before a judge, was found
guilty, and was sentenced ta twenty years in
the penitentiary. The judge then said ta the
accused, "Have you anything ta say?" The
latter replied, "Yes, Judge, I want ta say yau
are very generous with other people's time."
Only one word need be changed ta make the
stary applicable here-"You are very generous with other people's money."

challenge ta that? I think that is correctly
stated. If that is the issue I have this ta say:
Mr. Diefenbaker has not yet told us which
side he is on. Is he a Toronto Tory or a Saskatchewan Socialist?

In my opinion the two outstanding issues
are: First, the preservation of the free nations framn destruction by communist Russia. Everybody knaws that we try flot ta

notes. But this is Sa important that I have
written it down. There is, in my subrnission
ta this bouse, only one defence, and that is
the prevention of war. Our experience in the
past has shown that so far as Russia is concerned this can neyer be accomplished by
friendly negotiations. Every turne we have
tried that method they have just made foals
of us. They have made the whole proceeding
foolisb.
You will recail the tragic occasion when
there was going to be a suminit conference
and, because sorne unfortunate Amierican aviator landed in Russia, Khrushchev used that
incident as an excuse for flot anly refusing to
hald the conference but to atternpt to politically destroy the President of the United
States in his attacks upon hirn.
We cannot negotiate with Russia. I agree
that we sbould neyer stop trying to negotiate,
but for heaven's sake let us recognize, when
we are doing it, that our experience bas been
that there is littie possibility o! accomplishing anything. Our only hope in these tbreatening conditions is to be s0 strong that
Khrushchev wiil know that if be starts
a war, or permits it ta be started, he and the
communist world wiil be destroyed. If the
tUrne ever cornes, wben he has not that fear,
then God belp us.
To accomplish this, honourable senato;rs,
destructive power is necessary, but destructive power alone is not enaugh. I arn reminded o! a story o! a man who wanted
to join the police force. He was a littie man
but he bad power in bis muscles and he was
a good figbter. He applied to the chie! of
police, who said ta birn, "I amn not going to
bire you. You are too small". He said, "Look
here, Chie!, I can lick any man on your
farce". The chie! o! police replied, «II amn not
disputing that, but that is not what I want.
I do not want a man wbo bas to fight ta demonstrate bis strength. I want a man who can
demonstrate it by bis appearance witbout
havmng ta flgbt". We have ta be in tbat situation with respect to Russia. We not only
have ta have the capacity, but we must
Show it ta Khrushcbev in such conclusive
terms that he will know that an atternpt on
bis part ta start a war will mean bis own
,destruction.
To do that there must, af course, be tbe
power, but there must also be that unquestioned show of strengtb wbich will keep Mr.
Khrusbchev i bis place, and discourage
hlm frorn trylng any extreme measures whicb
wiil produce a war.
I think that the. primary question that
every One of us, wbetber members of ParliaMent or flot, must think o! Is: How are we
going ta do that? Weil, honourable senators,
we bave got ta Show courage. We bave got

ta make Khrushchev understand that we bave
tbe reai guts ta flght if we have ta, and we
bave also got ta show hu-m that we--when I
say "we" I mean Canada, the United States,
Great Britain, France, Itaiy and ail the other
western nations-are a unit. and are cooperating tagether.
I do nat know, 'but it is my opinion that
Khrusbchev's policy is ta, avoid a war if passible. If that is flot possible then bis policy is
ta get us so divided that we cannot fight him
successfully. His policy is ta divide and conquer. Sa one a! the steps we must take at
tbis Urne i arder ta bead off canflict is ta see
ta it that there is unity and co-operation
between ail the nations, and, i particular, s0
far as we are cancerned, that there is unlty
an tbe North Arnerican continent.
Honourable senators, i the last war we
bad same experience fromn which we can learn.
We had Eisenhower-not President Eisenhower, but the saine man, wbo was then
General Eisenhower-in command a! aur
united forces. Our armies worked tagether as
a unit. Wbat applied ta aur armies and their
generals under Eisenhower-applied also ta
the statesmen. In earlier tirnes in another
war they applied. ta Sir Robert Barden. Tbey
applied during the last wai ta Mr. Mackenzie
King. Have you heard lately the staternent
that Canada's policy is gaing ta be declided in
Ottawa and not; in Washington? I wander
wbat size o! smile there is on -the face o!f
Khrushchev wben he bears that bombastic
statement. That statement, ta my mid, la utterlY ridiculaus. Sir Robert Borden was neyer

We are goig ta run aur own show". I neyer

SENATE
demonstrated that his co-operation and understanding with Washington is such that everything is working in harmony, and that there
is a common purpose in connection with those
Bomarc weapons? If there is, honourable senators, I have not been able to discover it.
That is all I want to say about that, but
I have more to say about this problem which
is now concerning Canada and the United
States, and which I regret to say is one of the
really serious problems, not only so far as it
concerns trade but so far as it concerns an
exhibition of courage on our part, and decision, and full co-operation and understanding
with the United States.
In the first place I would like to state that
this is where our safety lies. If the United
States with its great capacity and its population does not take the leadership, what then?
You know, it used to be Great Britain that
took the leadership, and those were wonderful days, but she has sacrificed so much in
manpower and financial strength that today
she is not the nation that can give the first
leadership, and that duty has passed on to the
United States. Has any honourable senator
here any doubt that if we do not work with
the United States, and if our co-operation
with her is not complete, our safety is gone?
What are the facts that face us in this connection? I am going to state the facts, as I
understand them, and I will ask you, honourable senators, to draw your own conclusions. It was not long ago that President
Kennedy came here and addressed Parliament.
At that time he urged the Canadian people to
join the union of the nations of North and
South America.
I was not here at the time and I do not
pretend to give any details. I am not for one
moment saying that for purely domestic reasons it was desirable that we join in that
organization, but I do say that when the
President of the United States, the greatest
power in the world today, comes and urges
that to be done in order to protect us from
Russia-for whom? the United States and
Canada, yes-and we do not do so, there must
be a mighty cogent reason to justify our
refusal to co-operate with this one nation
in the world which stands between us and
destruction.
Then we have been faced with a more recent problem, one which is getting more critical every day-Cuba. The facts are remarkable. Cuba is only a stone's throw from the
United States and in these modern times when
distances are relatively small, Cuba is mighty
close to Canada. In its communistic development it is just as big a danger to Canada as
it is to the United States. The small island
of Cuba is dominated by Fidel Castro who

boastfully admits to being an avowed communist in the closest relationship with Russia.
Cuba is receiving large supplies of ammunition from Russia, and in this connection I
shall provide the house with certain figures I
obtained from an article appearing in my old
standby, the Montreal Gazette. I gather from
the large headlines that the story appeared
on the front page. It is datelined February 5,
Washington, and I take it that whenever the
Montreal Gazette publishes a statement from
Washington it stands responsible for its accuracy. It reads:
Cuba now has 50 to 100 MiG jet fighters and may be receiving some Soviet
bombers and short-range rockets in new
communist-bloc arms shipments, U.S.
experts estimated Sunday.
Are we justified in being apprehensive, assuming that is right? Is the Canadian Government justified for one moment in saying it has
any information to the contrary? I do not
think so.
The total worth of communist military assistance to Fidel Castro has been
placed at some $100 million so far, with
most of the arms deliveries completed in
a 12-month period ended last August.
We are disposed not to think too much
about the dangers facing us because they interfere with our ordinary life. That is a good
thing in a way but it is not a good way for
the Government of this country to be dealing with public affairs. This article does not
tell us how much more communist military
assistance Cuba has had since last August,
but it goes on:
They believe a fresh flow of weapons
is starting after an arms-assimilation
period which began in Cuba last summer.
In this phase, Soviet bloc instructors remolded Castro forces along communist
lines.
There is a lot more to this article. I will not
go into it any further, but I do want to give
the house some more information.

LAND USE
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Arthur M. Pearson, Chairman of the
Special Committee on Land Use in Canada,
presented the first report of the committee,
as follows:
Your committee recommend:
1. That their quorum be reduced to
five members.
2. That they be 'authorized to print 800
copies in English and 300 copies in French
of their day-to-day proceedings.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Honourable senators, I
move, with leave, that the report be adopted
now, but before the motion is agreed to, I
would like to say a few words.
In presenting this report of the Special
Committee of the Senate on Land Use in

FEBRUARY 8, 1962
Canada, I feel I should say sornething of
what this committee has accomplished ta date.
In 1960 it was feit that although a great
rnany witnesses had appeared before the committee, it seemed that we were flot accomplishing anything except to draw attention to
the condition of the small farmers across
Canada.
Last year the Governmnent of Canada decided to do something to assist the farm
communities, to help each ta organize its
own conimunity, with a view ta bettering
living conditions and making greater use of
rural assets, in order ta raise the uneconomical farm unit ta a better plane. In due
course the Parliament of Canada cansidered
and passed a bill called the Agricuitural Rehabilitation and Development Act, more generally known in the farm. communities as
ARDA. Honourable senators will note that
this legislation resulted from the work of
the Senate Land Use Committee, and I might
say that the committee was given funl credit
for bringing this matter ta the attention of
the Government.
This does not mean that the matter should
be left there, either by the Senate Land. Use
Committee or the Gavernment itself. There
is a great deal of work ta be done now in
co-ordinating the effort of the provincial and
federal agricultural departments. One of the
recommendations of your committee was that
the federal and provincial Governments arrange for the building Up af a co-ordinated
staff to work with the present provincial
staffs-I arn referring ta the extension staff
and others-whose training should have particular emphasis on f armn management and
planning, rural development, and principles
and methods of cornmunity arganization and
development.
I arn pleased ta report at this time that a
chairman has been named by the federal
Governent ta assist in this work af coordinating the extension staff, etc. He hais
travelled acrass Canada visiting the various
provincial agricultural. departments and, I
presume, making arrangements ta carry out
the plans as enunciated in the act.
The fifth recommendation made by your
comniittee last year was that the Special
Committee af the Senate on Land Use in
Canada be a continuing committee, that it
be reconvened each session, and that it be
authorized ta engage a research team or
teams. On this latter point, may I say that
the steering conmittee gave me authority
this year ta approach on their behalf the
Department af Agriculture. This I have done,
and amn happy ta report that we shahl be able
ta obtain the services af a member of the

Some Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the reports of the Standing Committee on

On motion of Hon. Mr. Roebuck, chairman
of the committee, reports adopted.

In 1959, by chapter 14 of the statutes of
that year, section 10 was amended, and the
old age security tax was raised from 2 per
cent to 3 per cent.
In 1960 the act was again amended by
chapter 4 of the statutes of that year, and
it was section 5 that was again the subject
of the amendment. The amendment provided

towards his pension. He has paid taxes during

FEBRUARY 8, 1962
his working lifetime. He has made his contribution to the old age security fund through
the payment of taxes of various types that go
to make up that fund.
It should not be forgotten, honourable senators, that during his earning days he made
contributions to build what we call now the
social capital of this country, which capital
is now being enjoyed by the younger people.
The vast number of churches at which our
people worship were built, and built at great
sacrifice, by our senior citizens, as were
institutions for the provision of education and
institutions for the care of the sick. These
were all built by our older people. I say that
our senior citizens have made a very substantial contribution to the growth and development of this country, and it is now
our duty and our responsibility to see to it
that they be given some measure of economic
security, now that their earning days are
past.
I feel also, honourable senators, that the
younger people of Canada are glad to accept
their responsibility in this behalf, and to
fulfil it by the payment of any taxes which
might be necessary to achieve this purpose.
I know there are some who believe, and
who believe most sincerely, that a pension
which is payable to all over 70 years of age
regardless of need is not the best type of
pension. Perhaps some other type can be
worked out which would safeguard all of the
existing benefits of old age security and yet
meet this objection. Indeed, I understand
plans towards bringing this about are now
under study, but in any plan we must be
very careful to see that those who do need
the pension are not deprived of one cent of
the benefit they now receive, or will receive
if this amendment is passed.
Personally, I believe it was a tremendous
step forward when the so-called "means test"
was abolished. I hate means tests. I have
seen how they work. Yet, while I hate them,
I know and understand that they are necessary in some types of assistance. After all,
if a person over 70 years of age is in such a
happy financial position that this pension is
wholly unnecessary, then, if he receives it,
I would expect that a large part of it would
be returned to the Government in the form
of income tax payments. But, with respect to
those over the age of 70 years and to whom
the pension means the difference between
mere existence and an existence with some
comfort, then I say, let us give them that
comfort.
I feel, honourable senators, in this matter
we should not ask if all those who receive the
pension are actually in desperate need of it.
I do not think we should approach the matter by asking, can we afford to pay it to our

senior citizens, nor by asking, where the
money is coming from to pay it. I do not believe we should approach this matter with any
cautious or timid attitude of waiting until our
financial condition improves. I believe we
should approach it by asking ourselves just
one question: Is this bill needed to improve
the economic condition of our senior citizens?
If we answer that question in the affirmative,
as I do, then we will find the money to pay
for this increase, just as governments have
always found the money necessary to pay for
the services the people of Canada think necessary, and the people will be glad to make
any further contribution which may be necessary for this purpose.
Honourable senators, I believe this is a
good bill. I feel it will be of substantial benefit to those of 70 years of age and over. I commend it to the favourable consideration of
this house.
Hon. Lionel Choquette: Honourable senators, may I be permitted to ask a question?
I notice that the proposed new section 3(1)
reads:
Subject to the provisions of this Act
and the regulations, a monthly pension of
sixty-five dollars may be paid in respect
of every person whoAnd I notice that the present section 3(1)
also includes the words, "may be paid". I am
wondering why the words are "may be paid"
instead of "shall be paid". I have not a copy
of the act before me, and perhaps there is an
exception provided somewhere. Unless the
act says the pension is for those with certain
qualifications, then the words should be "shall
be paid", not "may be paid". I would like to
receive an explanation of that, if it is possible.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, may I, or shall I, answer that question?
If I may reply to the honourable senator I
shall say that this is something to be considered when the bill is in committee, and
I do hope that it will be referred to a committee.
The honourable senator from Cape Breton
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) who introduced this
bill gave an explanation of certain sections
of the act, a number of which are not affected
by this amendment. In fact, only one provision of the act is affected by the amendment,
and that is the one with respect to the amount
of the pension.
The honourable senator from Cape Breton
spoke highly of the elderly people of Canada
and of our obligations to them. I am sure
we are all in accord with what he said. In
fact, I believe that, with one exception, this
chamber has unanimously passed every piece
of old age pension legislation which has

SENATE
come before it. The first such legislation,
presented in 1925, did not receive Senate
approval but a similar bill was presented
and approved in 1926, and every piece of old
age pension legislation which bas come before
us since then has been approved. I have
no doubt that honourable senators will approve this bill. I certainly will support it.
Though I do not object to the bill itself,
I do object to the manner in which it has
been presented. As honourable senators are
aware, the usual procedure is for the Speech
from the Throne to be adopted in the House
of Commons, following which the estimates
are tabled, giving some idea of what the
expenses are going to be for the year upon
which we are entering. Then the Government
proposes certain legislation which bas been
forecast in the Speech from the Throne, and
such legislation is considered from time to
time. The next step is for the budget to be
presented, setting forth the manner in which
the money to be expended will be collected
by the Government. But today we are doing
everything in reverse. We are, as it were,
putting the cart before the horse. The debate
on the address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne has not been completed; the
estimates for the current year have not been
tabled and, although some legislation has been
presented, the budget certainly has not and
we have no idea when it will be. Therefore,
in passing this legislation and making this
increase in old age pensions we just don't
know what we are going to do with the
taxpayers' money. In other words, we are
buying a pig in a poke.
Where is the money coming from? I agree
with my honourable friend from Cape Breton
that we must provide for our citizens who
are not in a position to provide for themselves, but I think we all, including the aged,
must ask ourselves, where is the Government
going to get the money? At the present
time the money is being raised by taxation.
There is a 3 per cent charge on personal
income tax, 3 per cent on corporation income
tax, and 3 per cent on sales tax. That money
is segregated from the rest of the money
the Government receives, and is used to
make the payments under the Old Age
Security Act. But we know that at the
present time the revenue raised from those
three sources is insufficient to pay the old
age pensions at the present rate of $55, so
how can we hope that it will be sufficient
to pay benefits at the rate of $65?
The Government must know where it is
going to get the money: by taxation, or by
borrowing from the public, or by printing
more money. I surely hope the Government
will not resort to the printing presses, and I
certainly do not know how it would get the

necessary revenue by issuing new loans. Is
it the intention of the Government to raise
from 3 per cent to 4 per cent the amount to
be taken from income tax, corporation tax,
and sales tax, for this purpose? If this is not
the intention, then we should be told. Why is
the Government holding back and doing this
thing in reverse? It does not have to present
its budget early in order to introduce this
bill, which is necessary at this time, but it
could at least take us into its confidence and
let us know if the money is going to be raised
in one of the three ways I have mentioned.
We are placed in an invidious position in
being asked to support this legislation when
we do not know where the money is coming
from. However, in spite of all this I am
prepared to go along and support the bill.
Honourable senators, I hope we will soon
have a sound Old Age Security Act based on
direct contributions sufficient to meet the
objections raised by my honourable friend
from Cape Breton (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)
with respect to those who cannot contribute,
especially for the next 10 or 15 years. A
fund could be built up that would be sufficient not only to look after those who would
be contributing but also those who are not
in a position to contribute.
Without any doubt, many people across
Canada are not in a position to contribute to
certain available pension plans whereby their
contributions are exempt from income tax.
We do not want to deprive these people of
an old age pension, so we rnust have a system
which can take in everybody. We want a plan
which will assure that our people will not
want in their old age.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, I
simply rise to support the position taken by
the honourable leader on this side of the
house (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford). This
legislation is certainly being hurried through
Parliament. We shall have under consideration
next week the other bills that are collateral
ta it. However, as the honourable leader on
this side of the house pointed out, this all
means the expenditure of more money.
The Old Age Security Act was passed-in
1951, if my recollection is right-with high
expectations and with the general support of
Parliament. Forecasts were made of what
expenditures would arise from it. Well, as
almost invariably is the case, irrespective
of what party is in power, when a Government makes an estimate of expenditures, you
can be pretty safe in wagering that in the
end the estimate will be exceeded, and sometimes considerably exceeded. To finance the
pensions, we had the 2-2-2 formula, which I
need not dwell upon, and which in 1959 was
increased to the 3-3-3 formula. In other words,

FEBRUARY 8, 1962
the tax for old age security had increased
by 50 per cent. There were growing hopes
this would solve the financial difficulties of
the Old Age Security Fund. Well, it did, for
a time. Until last November there was a surplus from this newly increased revenue that
built up to the substantial amount of something like $20 million or $25 million. In the
month of November the fund went behind;
that is, for that month there were more payments made than there were receipts from
these increased taxes. The difference was $1
million.
I sent to the library and got the information
which I have before me now. The first deficit,
which commenced in November 1961, was
$1 million. In December it was $3,800,000. Bear
in mind that comes under the new 3-3-3
formula. The span of life has been lengthened.
Mortality tables of the life insurance companies provide clear evidence of that. This
works to the advantage of life insurance
companies, but works to the djsadvantage of
the Pension Fund and the taxpayers. On this
basis it is a safe assumption that before the
end of 1962 is reached, the fund will probably
be in the red, and will continue that way
unless it is bolstered again by fresh taxation,
or until something is done about it. But bear
in mind, honourable senators, that that does
not take into account the pension increase
of $10 a month which is proposed to be added
through this bill.
Some remarks I made in the house on the
address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne were misinterpreted in some parts of
Canada on account of newspaper headlines,
and I received some very interesting letters
from people who accused me of being against
old age pensions. I think they were quite
justified in being critical, if they read only
the headlines. However, I am not against old
age pensions, but I repeat what 1 said in my
earlier remarks, that I doubt the wisdom of
adding to the pension when our finances are
in such complete disarray as they are at the
present time.
Honourable senators opposite may not agree
and that of course is their privilege. The plain
fact is, however, that over the past four years
we have added over $2 billion to our debt.
The evidence is there, and it cannot be disputed, that the money supply has been increased very substantially over the commercial
needs of the country. This legislation, if
passed, will add at least $125 million to the
pension requirements. In that figure I am including the amount that will be required under
the other bills which will be coming forward.
If this legislation is passed, and there are no
proposals to add to the fund by further taxation, it is pretty nearly self-evident now, that

by the end of the fiscal year, March 31, 1963,
the fund will be in the red to the extent of
anywhere from $120 million to $140 million.
Honourable senators, is it responsible on our
part to pass legislation like this until we have
some idea where the money is coming from to
meet it? What would we think of a businessman who operated his financial affairs in that
way? I do think this is a matter of tremendous importance, because if we proceed
in this way with unbalanced budgets, make
no mistake about it, sooner or later the people
of this country are going to suffer from it
-it cannot be avoided. That has been the
experience of every other country that has
tried it. Are we, as responsible members of
this house, simply to say, "Well, it will please
a great many people, therefore we will pass
it"? I have no doubt it would please a great
many people, and I have no doubt whatever
that it would bring in tens of thousands of
votes for the Government candidates in the
next election.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is the idea.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: In fact, when we look at
the array of favours based on the distribution
of largesse we are experiencing at the present
time, one wonders what Parliament is coming
to. I say to the Government, and to the leader
of the Senate (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)-I do not
blame him, because perhaps he has as much
difficulty in getting information as some of the
rest of us have-that the Government bas no
moral right, or any other kind of right, to
place before Parliament these huge expenditures that will add to our debt, and in the
end bring hardship to every home in Canada,
without telling us how it proposes to raise the
money to pay the bills. So far the Government has refused to do so. I do not expect my
honourable friend who is leading the Government forces here (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) to give
us this information, but I do say to him, as I
say to this house, that we are entitled to that
information.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: As far as I am concerned,
I cannot take any other position. I am not
opposed to old age pensions, but I cannot see
the sense of digging into the treasury for
another $125 million per year when we are
running further into debt every day of the
week in our public finances. It is not only an
irresponsible policy, but an irrational policy.
I trust I have made my position clear.
At the moment I am opposed to this legislation. If our finances get into good order in
the future I would have a different view of
it. Unless the Government can give us the
information we are entitled to have as to
how it proposes to finance these increased

SENATE
expenditures, I cannot, for the life of me,
see how in good faith and honour this house
can support it.
Motion agreed to and bill read second

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday, consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Méthot,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Hollett, for an address
in reply thereto.
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable senators, I am sorry that the royal assent interrupted my speech yesterday afternoon because I was going full steam at that point,
and after listening to some of the doleful
predictions made today I have somewhat
cooled down. However, that does not mean
I am not in sympathy with what I have
heard today.
You will recall, honourable senators, that
yesterday I had divided my speech into two
parts, the first being how we are best to
protect ourselves against a threatened war
with Russia, and I had pretty well concluded
that.
I had before me the problem that Canada
is facing with regard to Cuba, and I had
quoted figures showing that Russia had supplied to Cuba large amounts of war munitions. I was about to supplement that with a
statement as to the value of goods we sold

to Cuba in the first nine months of 1961 in
contrast with the same period in 1960. I now
give those figures.
In the first nine months of 1961 Canada
exported $21,500,000 worth of goods to Cuba,
an increase of $14 million over the corresponding nine months of 1960; that is to say, the
exports jumped from $7,500,000 to $21,500,000
in a nine-month period. I want to point out,
honourable senators, to that extent Canada
was destroying the effect of the American
policy to bring pressure on Cuba to protect
us all, Canada just as much as the United
States.
Now, honourable senators, that amount of
money, some $14 million, standing alone in
trade in these days would not be so important,
but the thing that makes the greatest importance in connection with it is how much
it is affecting our relationship with the United
States and how much in connection with that
effect on our relationship with the United
States is it giving the ha! ha! to Mr. Khrushchev. That is the serious matter.
Now, honourable senators, in that connection only this morning I received one of the
Soviet news bulletins. I suppose practically
every senator in the house receives these
except my good friend from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid).
Hon. Mr. Reid: I stopped them coming to
me some time ago.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Senator Reid at one time
spoke right out in church and criticized these
things coming through the mails, and I understand he did not get them any more.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Well, you have not missed
much.
But this morning, honourable ladies and
gentlemen, I got mine. I always get them in
Vancouver but this one came to me here in
Ottawa today. It is dated February 6, and is
headed Soviet News Bulletin. It is signed,
"With fraternal greetings, N. Khrushchev".
It is directed to the Second General National
Assembly of the Cuban People. I read:
To Prime Minister of the Republic of
Cuba Fidel Castro Ruz,
Dear Friends,
Now, honourable senators, I shall not bother
littering the record with all that is in this
bulletin, but let me read one paragraph. And
mark you, this was dated the sixth day of
this month. I read:
Cuba is not alone. The militant movement of solidarity with Cuba which keeps
mounting in Latin American countries ...
And I stop to ask, what is the explanation
of it mounting? Is it not the fact that Cuba,

FEBRUARY 8, 1962
with the assistance of Russia, is poisoning
the minds of these people as far as it can
go, and isn't their policy helping to achieve
that? Let me read on:
The militant movement of solidarity
with Cuba which keeps mounting in
Latin American countries and in all parts
of the globe, will help the Cuban people
to frustrate the evil plans of the American
imperialists and their servitors. Just as
it is impossible to bring back the yesterday, so it is impossible to stop the
movement of the peoples to independence
and liberation ...
This is coming from Khrushchev.
. .. liberation from the imperialist yoke

and slavery.
The movement .

..

of what is the Cuban

Revolution, the heroic battle of the courageous Cuban people for the freedom
and independence of their country-is
near and understandable to us, Soviet
people, who gained independence in a
fierce struggle and who are now building
a communist society. The peoples of the
Soviet Union are always with you, dear
Cuban brothers.
And what are we told by the Prime Minister
of this country?-that he proposes to continue carrying on normal trade with Cuba.
It is inevitable, honourable senators, that the
gravest friction is threatened by that conduct.
To my mind, it is comparable to the situation which arises during a strike and the element of labour that tries to break it. By
means of a strike a union seeks to better the
conditions of its members, and in order to do
that it is prepared to sacrifice their wages,
for the time being. Then, sometimes, other
workmen cross the picket line and they are
called "scabs" or "scab labour".
To apply the comparison in this case, the
United States-the greatest nation standing
for freedom on this continent, the one nation
without whose help and sacrifices we in Canada would never have a chance in the world
-has decided, not for selfish reasons, not for
spite, but as one step towards the protection
of the free world, to put the heat on Cuba
by the complete denial of trade with Cuba,
as I understand it, except with regard to
medicines and incidentals that are absolutely
essential.
That being the policy of the United States
Government, what is the policy of the Canadian Government? Is our Government cooperating with the United States? The Prime
Minister says that our policy will not be
dictated by Washington, but will be decided
at Ottawa. Nobody has any objection to that
declaration, standing alone; nobody objects
26211-3-8

to our policy being decided in Ottawa. Of
course it will be done here. What I personally
object to is the kind of policy that the present
Government decides in Ottawa. That is where
the shoe pinches, and that is where they are
wrong. When the Canadian Government
makes that kind of jury argument and expects
us to follow it, it is not giving due regard
to the serious menace with which we are
faced at this time.
I have no hesitation in making this comparison, and just as honest labour will resent
to the limit the attempts of scab labourHon. Mr. Pearson: I object to the honourable senator comparing the Prime Minister
to scab labour.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I did not compare the
Prime Minister to scab labour.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: You are saying that the
United States Government is comparable to
union labour, and that the Canadian Government and Mr. Diefenbaker are comparable
to scab labour.
Hon. Mr. Farris: If you think that is where
the cap fits, you can put it on and wear it.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: That is what you are
saying.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Speaking of scab labour
and what is happening here in Canada, I say
that by increasing threefold our exports to
Cuba we are attempting to defeat the basic
principle by which the United States is trying to bring pressure to bear on Cuba. It
is not merely a question of trade; they are
bringing this pressure to bear to help maintain the safety of the North American continent and the whole of the free world. If
my honourable friend wishes to draw his
own conclusions, he is welcome to do so.
Honourable senators, is there no irritation
arising from this situation? Is it not aggravated by Mr. Diefenbaker's statements?
I have before me an article written by Mr.
Arthur Blakely in today's Gazette. His articles
frequently appear in that newspaper, and I
take it that that newspaper stands sponsor
for what he writes. This article deals with
the resentment that is being felt in the United
States as a result of Canada's trade policy
towards Cuba. I wish to read only one paragraph:
U.S. irritation over Canadian trade
with Cuba is as real as it is deep. Many
Americans resent the fact that, as a
result of the U.S. embargo, Canada bas
managed to occupy, in part at least, a
trading position once held exclusively by
the United States. Canada's own restrictions on exports to Cuba are neither

SENATE
known nor understood. Canada is portrayed as a sharp trader less interested
in the maintenance of democratic principles and the free world than in a trading advantage.
I am not here to say that is correct, but I
am here to say that it is obviously just what
you would expect people in the United States
to feel about Canada's conduct in this matter.
I said yesterday that Khrushchev's policy
was to divide and conquer. Can you imagine
anything more pleasing to Mr. Khrushchev,
in carrying out that policy, than the creation
of this situation right now?
Mr. Schlesinger, who is an adviser to the
President of the United States, was in Vancouver the other day and he offered criticisms
of this situation. Mr. Howard Green bas also
dealt with this subject, but I am sorry he
dealt with it in the manner in which he did.
I think a great deal of Mr. Howard Green; I
think he is about the best minister they have
in the present Cabinet. I would have expected
him to justify what Canada is doing, but in
reply to the criticisms of Mr. Schlesinger he
merely said it was very wrong of that gentleman to make such statements in Canada.
That may be right, but what a trifling answer
that is concerning the grave situation which
impelled Mr. Schlesinger to make those statements. Mr. Green said not a word to justify
the Government's policy. I ask the honourable Leader of the Government, has there
been any word of explanation offered as to
why Canada is refusing to co-operate with
the United States in connection with this
grave problem?
The United States has now gone even
further; it has declared almost total exclusion of exports to and imports from Cuba.
And what do we hear Mr. Diefenbaker say?
-that we are not exporting munitions of
war. What justification of policy is that? Who
can imagine the Prime Minister of Canada
ever allowing munitions of war to be exported to a country like Cuba?
Honourable senators, do not forget the fact
that Cuba is now a communist country.
Castro has declared himself a colleague of
Khrushchev, and we have this slobbering
statement of Khrushchev which came in the
mail today.
I predict that even this Government of
ours will see the folly of its policy and mend
its ways. If it does not, it will create a lot
more trouble. That is all I wish to say on
that point.
Hon. Mr. Holleti: Would the honourable
senator allow a question?
Hon. Mr. Farris: If it is more pertinent
than the one you asked yesterday.

Hon. Mr. Holleti: Am I allowed to ask a
question of the honourable senator?
The Hon. the Speaker: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Hollett: The honourable senator
says that he is predicting something concerning the present policy of the Canadian Government and that of the United States. I
wonder if he made any prediction concerning the abortive invasion of Cuba which the
United States attempted a short time ago.
Did he think that was the right policy?
Hon. Mr. Farris: What has that to do with
the present discussion?
Hon. Mr. Hollet: It has a lot to do with
it.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Does my honourable
friend say that Canada is adopting this
policy today in retaliation for that fiasco
which happened some months ago? If he
does not, then I do not know what he is talking about.
That is all I have to say on Cuba, and I
invite this house to watch with the gravest
apprehension the development of this situation which has been so needlessly created by
the folly of the present Government.
The second topic I mentioned yesterday is
Canada's trade and industrial relations with
the United Kingdom, and other countries in
and outside the Commonwealth. These matters are, of course, very closely related. The
question of our independence in relation to
Russia, the question of our success in heading
off a war with Russia, and the question of
our own trade relations within the Commonwealth and with other countries are very
closely related.
To me the greatest problem at the present
time is the proposal of the United Kingdom
to enter the European Common Market. I
assume there may be honourable senators
here who are not any more familiar with the
details of the Common Market than I was
until, for the preparation of this speech, I
made some special efforts to get to the bottom
of it. I found that the policy was formulated
on January 1, 1958 by the Treaty of Rome,
the parties to which were France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and
Luxembourg. The total population of this
group of six countries is 171 million people,
and the authorities I have read estimate it
is likely, by the joining of other nations, that
another 100 million will be added, so that
there will be 271 million people in this
Common Market. The policy-and I am
speaking very generally on this-is a combined political and trade union, and its aim
is free trade within the area and a common
tariff against other countries.
If any honourable senator here wishes to
turn to a convenient place to obtain much

FEBRUARY 8, 1962
more detailed information on the European
Common Market I commend to him the source
of my information, namely, Mr. Christian
Herter's writings in the Saturday Evening
Post. A full discussion of the whole question
can be found in an article in the issue of that
journal of January 6 last. I commend it to
anybody who wants to read it, because the
Saturday Evening Post is a widely read paper
with a new policy, and it has assumed the
responsibility of selecting Mr. Christian Herter as the best authority in the United States
to write about the Common Market. His
article is well worth reading.
I have not the exact quotation, but from
my general reading months ago I say there
is no doubt that the Prime Minister of the
United Kingdom decided to seek entry into
the Common Market for just one reason, that
of dire necessity arising from trade and financial conditions in his country. I do not think
anybody can deny that that is so. Naturally,
that poses a grave problem for Canada. I note
from a speech made by Mr. Hees in Vancouver, and reported in the Gazette of January 29 last, that 20 per cent of our exports
go to the United Kingdom, and of that
amount 95 per cent goes in free, and that
50 per cent of that free entry is under Commonwealth preference.
Those are very important matters, honourable senators, and, rightly or wrongly, Canada
has to decide just what her policy must be.
To my mind-this is my opinion obtained
from my study, and I give it to you for what
it is worth-it is impossible for the United
Kingdom to enter that Common Market and
preserve intact these preferences it now
gives to Canada and other countries of the
Commonwealth. I believe, and I cannot find
any argument of a substantial nature to the
contrary, that Britain will have to decide
whether to abandon the preferences and join
the European Common Market, or abandon
joining the Common Market in order to
preserve her preferences to the Commonwealth nations.
The first thing I think we ought to consider
is what course will serve Britain best. I submit, and I do so with confidence, that Britain,
after the study she has made of this whole
question and after all the comments which
have been made are considered-and I shall
give you some of them-will be better served
in the cold-blooded financial situation by
going into the Common Market than by trying to preserve her preferences to the Commonwealth.
Well, what about Canada? Canada has to
look at those same two alternatives. She has
to look at them from the cold-blooded financial
standpoint and consider which is best for her.
26211-3-81

She has to consider whether she should forego
these preferences and seek other markets, and
a competitive market in a prosperous Britain,
or to hold Britain out and let her suffer the
financial destitution which may come to her
by ignoring the Common Market.
Now, if I were to offer you my opinion on
that His Honour the Speaker would be very
right in warning you that it would not amount
to very much, but I think every honourable
senator present, including His Honour, will
agree that the best source of information as
to what is going to happen te Canada if there
is an impoverished Britain hanging on to our
preferences, or if there is a prosperous Britain
giving us an opportunity in the field in fair
competition, is one of the great leaders of
industry in Canada who fortunately made a
speech on this subject the other day, namely,
Mr. Robert M. Fowler, the President of the
Pulp and Paper Association.
My good friend the Gazette-I say "my
friend" because I am falling back on it so
much-has in its issue of January 27 of this
year a full page report on Mr. Fowler's
speech. I obtained a copy of the speech-as
perhaps other honourable senators did-from
the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association,
but this is what the Gazette says at the
beginning of its report, which is published
together with a picture of Mr. Fowler:
The leader of Canada's vital pulp and
paper industry-whose exports are a
major factor in the country's balance
of trade-came down solidly in favour of
Britain's entry into the Common Market
yesterday.
President of the Canadian Pulp and
Paper Association, R. M. Fowler, predicted great things for Canada from
Europe, when he addressed a closing
luncheon of the Association's -convention
in Montreal.
But there was a big "if" in his optimism.
"My concern at the moment," he
warned, "is whether we really know
where we want to go and have any sufficient road-maps to get us there. It is
a choice.

.I

This is not a political speech, honourable
senators; this is a speech by the president of an
association which is one of Canada's greatest
exporters and which is affected by the
preference, perhaps more than any other industry in Canada. The presiýdent is not talking to these men about politics; he is talking
to them about the fate of their business. He
said:
It is a choice between exciting opportunities for growth; and stagnation. And
the world will not wait for us to make
up our minds.

SENATE
I read further from these quotations, because
they shorten what I might have to say as to
Mr. Fowler's speech.
Britain's position in the economie situation was summed up simply-"the plain
fact is that the British economy is carrying too heavy a load."
That is a mild way of saying what the Prime
Minister of the United Kingdom said when
be first announced that Britain was seeking
entry. I think others will agree with me that
Britain's financial and industrial difficulties
seem to be desperate, and that Mr. Macmillan's determination to seek entry into the
Common Market indicates that be was driven
by grim necessity caused by the downward
trend of British industry and trade. Mr. Fow1er puts it this way:
... the plain fact is that the British

economy is carrying too heavy a load.
Either the economy must be expanded
or the load reduced.
Whether Britain fails or succeeds in
present entry negotiations, the British
market of the last few years will not
continue."
He is saying this to all the men in this
business across Canada, who were assembled
at a luncheon.
Britain's position in the economic situation was summed up simply-"the
plain fact is that the British economy is
carrying to heavy a load".
"Either the economy must be expanded
or the load reduced."
"Whether Britain fails or suceeds in
present entry negotiations, the British
market of the last few years will not
continue."
This is what he is telling his associates
whose whole stake in business is involved.
He says:
"We will face something new whether
we like it or not. Canada is likely ta do
better with a growing prosperous Britain
than with a stagnant one."
Mr. Fowler told his audience that he had
anticipated this question and had sent two
commission experts to Europe to study this
whole question, and his own studies and the
reports of those commissioners resulted in
this statement. I want to repeat that last
quotation because it is the key to the whole
problem we have to face:
Canada is likely to do better with a
growing prosperous Britain than with a
stagnant one.
If I should read his whole speech, which
time will not permit-

Hon. Mr. Aselitine: We have all read it.
Hon. Mr. Farris: If that is the case, it is
too bad the Government has not taken the
honourable leader into the Cabinet, for he
could give them some mighty good advice.
What should Canada's policy be in this
connection? I put this problem to the house
in two ways: first, fram a grim cold-blooded
economic consideration and, secondly, from
a sentimental consideration that Canada is
part of-I often say the empire because that
is what I was brought up to think-the
Commonwealth today.
I see clear evidence that Canada bas overlooked the essentials and has allowed itself
to be unduly carried away with a concern
about a preference, one that businessmen
like Fowler say we cannot hope to continue
anyway. Let us see what bas been the policy
of these members of the Government of
Canada. I should like to quote from an editorial by Mr. Christopher Young appearing in
a good Ottawa newspaper, the Citizen, on
January 27.
In this editorial Mr. Young discusses certain attacks made on his reporting of the
policies of Mr. Hees and Mr. Fleming at the
Commonwealth Economic Conference at Accra
in September. I understand that Mr. Young
is now the editor of the Citizen, and those
of you who read his article will recall that
Mr. Fleming accused him of slanting his reports on the grounds that he was related to
Mr. Lester Pearson's wife. That seemed to
get Mr. Young's goat, and I do not blame
him. He says:
For the past four months, I have sai
still while Finance Minister Donald
Fleming informed the country that the
news reports from Accra had been distorted, misrepresented or false.
He gives an accurate statement of his report
and names the other reporters and what the3
said. I propose, with the consent of the house
to read what they said because it is nicely
assembled here.
Let's examine the actual news reports
from Accra.
Actually, Mr. Young was in Ghana. It wili
be recalled that that is where Mr. Macmillan
was and it was also there that the reporters
received their news on policy from the Canadian authorities. Mr. Young goes on:
Mr. Fleming took particular exception
to a dispatch of mine which began: "The
nations of the Commonwealth, led by
Canada, have ganged up on Britain and
formally declared their opposition to
British membership in the European
Common Market."

FEBRUARY 8, 1962
I do not think there were any denials of
the accuracy of that dispatch at the time. Mr.
Young continues:
Clark Davey, correspondent for a
Conservative Toronto newspaper, the
Globe and Mail, began one of his dispatches with these words:
"Commonwealth members, with Canada's Trade Minister George Hees making
the keynote speech, emphatically told
Britain today that she must choose between the European Common Market
and the Commonwealth."
I am sure that most of us remember seeing
that in the papers. The article goes on:
Alan Donnelly, the correspondent of a
carefully non-partisan news agency, the
Canadian Press, began a dispatch thus:
"Trade Minister George Hees of Canada
led a concerted attack by a number of
Commonwealth countries today on Britain's move toward the Common Market."
Fraser Wighton, of the British news
agency, Reuters, wrote: "The finance ministers of all Commonwealth nations except
Britain expressed grave apprebension and
concern tonight over Britain's bid for
membership in the European Common
Market."
Mr. Christopher Young goes on to say:
These reports all said the same thing
in different words: that Britain's plan to
seek membership in the Common Market
was opposed by the other nations of the
Commonwealth. The three dispatches
written by Canadians added the information that Canada was leading the
opposition to the British plan.
There is a lot more here I could read with
interest but, to save time, I will skip it.
Further on he writes:
Personally, I was incredulous about
the tone of the Canadian speeches, as
relayed through official channels.
They received them from the ministers'
secretaries. He goes on:
To double-check on the attitude of the
ministers, I sought an interview with Mr.
Fleming on the final evening of the conference. I talked to both Mr. Fleming and
Mr. Hees. They left no possible doubt
about their stand. As a result of this interview, I wrote a further dispatch, which
began: "Canada has launched an allout campaign to keep Britain out of the
European Common Market."
There has been somewhat of a change of
front since then. Why? It is simply because
the Government began to realize the people
of Canada are not in sympathy with that

attitude, and I say that the electors, who are
likely to have a chance to express their views
before long, are satisfied that in consideration of these matters Canada must take the
view that businessmen are taking, that Britain,
even under a preference, will not be of much
use to us if she is shut out of the European
Common Market and denied a share in the
great prosperity those countries are enjoying,
and becomes instead a more decadent financial country than she is today.
Honourable senators, I have quoted from
these statements to show this wrong attitude.
In all this talk I never heard anything from
Mr. Fleming, Mr. Hees, or even Mr. Diefenbaker about wanting to stay with Britain in
order to help Britain's financial position-it
has all been for Canada. Well, if they can
satisfy themselves that the decadent British
market is better than a prosperous market
in competition with the rest of the world,
all right. But I say that is wrong.
Then there is the sentimental side to this
question, and it is a mighty important one.
Why is Britain in ber present position? It is
because she carried the burden of the Commonwealth more than did any other of its
members. Of course, Canada contributed
financially but she did not suffer financially
by reason of that contribution; in fact, at
times she prospered from it. Britain, of course,
sacrificed her young men. I would like to hear
from the Government an expression of
consciousness of the duty of the Canadian
people in regard to the great step Britain feels
she must take. I would like to hear some
sentiment expressed, not overlooking our
own interest in the Canadian economy, that
we will go a long way to back up Britain, so
she will not be obliged to sacrifice the opportunities she believes lie ahead by joining
with Europe in a great international free
trade area. I would like to hear the Government say, as Mr. R. M. Fowler said, that not
only would we be meeting our sentimental
obligations, but we would be better off
in the long run, and would develop just as
the pulp and paper industry in Canada has
developed.
Honourable senators, I have only outlined
my views which I would like the authorities
to support. I invite the Government, and my
honourable friend the Leader of the Government in this house (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) to consider these matters in a way that bas not
been done before.
I want to conclude with this observation,
that thinking over all these different matters
-the question my colleague from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) raised, the financial position this country is in today compared with
1958, and all the predictions that have been
made-one of the serious problems as I see

SENATE
it is the fact that Mr. Diefenbaker is a
strong believer that everything he has done is
right, and therefore if the people re-elect him
on his assurances they will get very good
government for the next four years-the same
kind of government they have had in the
past. If that is what the people want, that is
what they deserve.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: Why attack the Prime
Minister all the time?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I do not understand.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: You are attacking the
Prime Minister.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I am attacking his
policies.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It does not go over
with me.
Hon. Mr. Farris: It doesn't?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Well, that is too bad, and
I am sorry, because my friend is a very
sensible gentleman. I am not attacking Mr.
Diefenbaker, I am attacking his policies. That
is a proper thing to do in this house, and it
is especially proper when we find at this
time that bills are being rushed in, as the
honourable senator from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) has pointed out, before the
budget has come down, before the estimates
have come in, and before we know where the
money is coming from. There can be only one
reason why that is done-to get them in
before the coming election. As far as Mr.
Diefenbaker is concerned, if he were to come
before the people at this time with a recognition of the shortcomings of his Government
in the past, with a frank confession of its
inexperience, and confessing its shortcomings
in dealing with unemployment and other
problems-if he came in sackcloth and ashes
and said, "We have done the best we could,
we have fallen far short of what could be
done, but give us another chance and we will
try to improve"-that might justify people in
giving him the vote. But when he comes
before us and assures us that he has given
good government and we cannot expect anything better in the future, then I say I may
even be moved to depart from my usual
custom and say something on the hustings
about it. I think it is time for a change.
Hon. Donald Smith: Honourable senators,
let me say at the outset that I shall be very
brief. I did have some thoughts closely allied
to some of the remarks made so well by
the distinguished senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris). This is not the

first time that I have had the misfortune to
follow such a distinguished orator, and the
experience is not a comforting one.
I wish briefly to extend my congratulations
to the mover, (Hon. Mr. Méthot) and the
seconder (Hon. Mr. Hollett) of the address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne.
Perhaps I should first mention the senator
from Burin (Hon. Mr. Hollett), because he
is one of our new members. I was pleased
to hear him speak in this chamber of his
pride in his own native province. I agree
with him that Newfoundland has certainly
brought into Confederation more than a
troubled fishing industry. It seems to me
that a great many people in the mainland
part of Canada have a misconception of the
contribution Newfoundland is making today,
and will make ever increasingly in the future,
to the economy and the cultural and social
life of Canada. She has great resources, particularly those human resources which many
of us have become acquainted with over the
years, in all the fields I have mentioned.
She has material resources, some developed
to some extent and many others yet undevelopen. She has great possibilities for the development of hydro-electric power, perhaps the
greatest in Canada; she has huge forest
stands and wealthy mineral resources. Honourable senators, we look to the time when
Canadians without exception will, through
a new understanding, appreciate that it was
a great event when Newfoundland came into
Confederation.
I congratulate the senator from Shawinigan
(Hon. Mr. Méthot) on the honour of being
chosen to move the address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne. I regret that he
is not in the chamber at the moment. As
we expected, he performed his duty in a
very able way. I also congratulate him in
finding in the Speech from the Throne some
particular reference to his own province.
I am sure it must have made him happy
to find a little package of goodies wrapped
up in that speech. I join in his happiness
and that of his people in the pleasure they
may derive in the future by being able
to get a free ride over the Victoria and
Jacques Cartier bridges, and I rejoice that
he will be able to use his parliamentary
pass on the new railway to be built in the
Gaspé peninsula.
Honourable senators, of course it is rather
a matter of regret that there was no mention
in the Speech from the Throne of some of
those positive steps we might have expected
in an attempt to solve the chronic problems
of the Atlantic provinces. In fact, I recall
no special mention of the Atlantic provinces'
problems in any Speech from the Throne

FEBRUARY 8, 1962
since the one just previous to the 1958 election. This may be an indication that there
will be another session of Parliament before
this Government goes to the people and
that those important steps we had been
looking for during the past four years may
be mentioned in the next Speech from the
Throne.
A blueprint for the economic progress of
our provinces down by the sea was certainly
available to the present Government in the
Gordon Commission Report which was published in November, 1957. Some of the proposals made by Mr. Gordon and his commissioners had been put out to the public
in a rather distorted form, and I think many
people, not only in the Atlantic provinces
but in some other parts of Canada, lost sight
of the particular attention that he and his
co-workers paid to our problems and to the
suggestions he made to future governments
as to what they might do to get at the
root of some of our economic problems.
Many of us in Nova Scotia are wondering
what has happened to the comprehensive
study of transportation problems in the Atlantic region. A special committee was established four or five years ago to make a
detailed study of freight rates and transportation problems in our provinces, and when
the Royal Commission on Transportation was
appointed, its scope was to include a study
of our particular regional problems. The work
of the special committee apparently was more
or less abandoned-at least, we have heard
nothing more about it. We are disappointed
that the royal commission report, now known
as the MacPherson Report, made no suggestions helpful to the provinces in the Atlantic region. As a matter of fact those who have
made a serious study of such problems have
stated publicly to the effect that the recommendation for the removal of some of the
benefits which we now receive under the
Maritime Freight Rates Assistance Act cannot
help but have a very adverse effect on our
transportation problems.
Mr. Gordon in his commission report recommended a capital project commission for
the Atlantic provinces, a centralization of
Government purchasing policies, and that
other equally important matters be dealt
with. I am rather confident that this Government, or one that may in due course succeed
it in office, will eventually pay more attention
to and implement some of the recomendations of the Gordon Commission upon which
some of us based high hopes for rapid improvement in economic and social welfare
of our region of Canada.

I might add, that all the special studies made
by the Atlantic provinces economic council
have confirmed the soundness of Walter Gordon's recommendations.
I do not intend to go any further with this
subject at this time because my time is short
and I have spoken on it in great detail in
the past.
I now turn to a subject which is closely allied to some of the remarks made by the distinguished senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) in his speech of yesterday,
and which I think is of the greatest importance to Canada, to the Atlantic region and,
perhaps, through the knowledge I have of the
local situation, particularly to my own province of Nova Scotia.
The history of the commerce of Nova Scotia until Confederation in 1867 was recorded
in an economic climate in which the fair
winds of free trade filled our sails and sent
our products out over the sea to foreign markets; and, as I have said in this chamber on
previous occasions, with Confederation came
the necessity of changing our pattern of trade
from one carried in Nova Scotian ships, built
and manned by Nova Sceotians, to an expensive
land-transported and artificial east-west pattern, dictated by our obligations in becoming
part of an economy whose growth was to be
influenced by the national protective policy
of the day. This was our price for Confederation.
It was almost a half century after Confederation that the first opportunity presented
itself for a return to a policy which would
have restored our national free trade pattern.
Some of you will remember the details of
what I am about to say a great deal clearer
than I, but let me remind you of the situation that existed then.
The election of 1911 was tagged as the
"reciprocity election", but other matters were
introduced in that campaign which diverted
attention from the real issue. Because of these
diversions, the producers in Nova Scotia were
evenly divided in their political choices, as
were the farmers of the western provinces.
The result, of course, was the defeat of Sir
Wilfrid Laurier and the destruction of hopes
for reciprocity.
Another half century has now elapsed. With
the closing of this fifty-year period, the greatest economic opportunity that Nova Scotia
ever had, or perhaps ever will have, is beginning to form up. This time the opportunity
presents itself in a much expanded form
which, if steps are taken at once, can be the
means of rescuing the whole Canadian economy from what now appears to be an uncertain future of economic stagnation.

SENATE

This new opportunity began to take shape
in Europe with the formation of the two trading blocs known as the European Economic
Community and the European Free Trade Association, to which reference has been made
from time to time in this chamber. I believe
it must have been as a result of the tremendous success attained by all members of the
European Common Market-otherwise known
as the EEC-that nations outside this bloc
soon showed a real interest in becoming associated with it.
We are all familiar with the attempts now
being made by Britain to become a member
of the Common Market. That subject was
covered very well indeed in the remarks of
the honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris).
The early rays which dimly lighted the
dawn of a new day of trading opportunities
for this country emanated from the British
offer of several years ago to join with Canada
in an agreement for freer trade. This candlelight of hope for a change of policy was,
however, snuffed out by the quick rejection
of the proposal by the Canadian Government.
Honourable senators, the year is now 1962,
and the shape of things to come is being
brightly illuminated by the dynamic and forward-looking President of the United States.
In his recent message to Congress you will
recall that President Kennedy asked for unprecedented new tariff-cutting powers which
he and his advisers, with complete endorsation of some members of the previous Republican administration, believe are needed
quickly to deal with Europe's emerging
economic giant, the Common Market, of which
most people believe Britain will soon be a
member.
This startling request to Congress is for
the power to gradually and completely wipe
out tariffs on some classes of manufactured
goods and to slash all other duties by 50 per
cent. The legisaltion which the President has
submitted to Congress, known as the Trade
Expansion Act, contains peril point and escape
clauses, but they are made much more difficult
to employ and are not the usual props of
the protectionists, as someone bas put it. The
legislation I believe is well balanced by the
inclusion of safeguards in the form of special
benefits for both workers and employers in
those particular industries which may be affected by imports. I think this is something
that our Government could give close attention
to indeed.
It is nothing less than exciting for us Nova
Scotians to visualize what our economic future
could be if right now we were able to take
advantage of this new opportunity for the
eventual establishment of new trading patterns. But if history continues to repeat itself,

another half century will elapse before such
opportunities as we appear to have at this
very time will be presented to us again.
Nova Scotians, especially, cannot afford
to let this opportunity pass without pointing out and clarifying as best they can
what we believe to be the direct long-term
benefits to our economy. Canada's joint participation is needed now in this bold new
approach to trade which eventually should
lead to a prosperous future for those countries
of the free world which choose to join in
these efforts. We cannot afford to wait too
long or we may find ourselves in an inferior bargaining position.
Honourable senators, I should now like to
deal for just a few minutes with the importance and direct implication to the people
of the Atlantic provinces of this new opportunity for freer trade.
It bas been agreed by, I think, all thoughtful students of our Nova Scotian economy
that the soundest basis for the expansion of
our employment opportunities lies in the development of industries based on our natural
resources. In line with this viewpoint may
I point out that this new approach to trade
provides the greatest opportunity the fishing
industry has had for many, many years to
expand its market in the United States. Not
since 1939 bas the Canadian Government
been able to secure an agreement with the
United States for a reduction of the tariff on
groundfish fillets. On a number of occasions
in the past the United States Tariff Commission has recommended an increase in this
tariff of one cent per pound but, fortunately,
the proposed increases were vetoed by the
President after consultations with Canadian
representatives. Now for the first time in
many years, the administration of the United
States is asking Congress for authority to
slash all tariffs by 50 per cent. It is reasonable to assume that this reduction in the tariff
will include our fillets, some of which are
now liable to a duty of 2J cents per pound.
It would include our blocks of frozen fillets,
presently dutiable at one cent per pound,
and our pre-cooked fillets, now dutiable at a
rate of 30 per cent. Such reductions should
at least remove these exports from their
present marginal position and provide an
incentive to expand the fishing industry.
Based on the quantities of such exports a
few years ago, the industry would benefit
from the proposed tariff reduction by an estimated $11 million on fillets alone. Based on
the expected increase in exports of all three
classes of fish, this amount would indeed
be a great deal larger.
One can reasonably conclude that the
future for the fishermen, fish handlers, and
employers would be brighter if there were

FEBRUARY 8, 1962
no further delay in stating Canada's willingness to join with our American friends in
taking a new look at our present trade barriers
and doing something about them.
Honourable senators, there is one segment
of our Atlantic economy which, without doubt,
it is agreed by al, would benefit the greatest
in the long run from Canada's association
in these new international trading agreements which are being explored, and that is
the pulp and paper industry. Although the
present market for pulp and paper manufactured in my home province, Nova Scotia, is
principally in the United States, our industry
clearly realizes that it is the world demand
for these products which determines the
future health of the industry. It has been
agreed that it is the Common Market, as
well as the United States, from which future
demands for pulp and paper will come.
Sir Eric Bowater, perhaps the greatest
world figure today in the pulp and paper
industry, is the chairman of the board of the
Bowater mills which are located in my home
town and in that of the honourable senator
from the west coast. Almost a year ago Sir
Eric stated that at this time of transition
Canada had to come to terms with Europe,
and that in the long run it would be to
Canada's advantage-and, he added, particularly the Atlantic provinces. He regards the
Common Market area as one of the most
dynamic centres in the world, with a population of 170 million educated people. He is
certain that Europe is a growing market for
newsprint and, since it is as far behind
Britain in packaging as Britain is behind
North America, it will soon demand much
larger quantities of other pulp and paper
products.
Reference has already been made to some
of the remarks passed just last month by
Mr. Robert M. Fowler, President of the
Canadian Pulp and Paper Association. To
keep my flow of thought, may I just reiterate
what bas already been said this afternoon in
that regard?
Mr. Fowler regards the European Common
Market as our long-range chance, and has
said that the answers we give to the urgent
questions of commercial policy will determine
the trend of Canada's future prosperity. These
words may have been quoted earlier, but I
believe they bear repetition. During the
course of an address which he delivered in
Montreal last month he said:
We have a choice between exciting
opportunities for growth, and stagnation.
He also said:
The world will not wait long for us
to make up our minds.

If Nova Scotians want their pulp and paper
industry to be healthy and to expand in
the future they should certainly press their
case for the immediate adoption by Canada
of a freer trade policy, and one stated in
definite terms.
There are other segments in the Atlantic
economy which would benefit greatly from
an association with freer trade arrangements.
It is understood there is a scramble for
wood today in Europe, and the demand is
rising. It is therefore obvious that lumbering
would benefit, as would the other forest
products I have mentioned, from the European
long-term demand.
Nova Scotia has had a recent and quite
important expansion in its food-processing
industry, and certainly the availability of
export markets in the future, through new
trade arrangements, would influence further
development. The growth of exports from
all parts of Canada would, of course, be
accompanied by increased port activity, especially in Saint John and Halifax. Those great
ice-free, all-year-round ports would have
much to gain from the benefits which would
flow from a freer trade policy.
I feel sure that the honourable senator
from Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor),
who has not been able to be present these
last few days, would agree with that statement, and I would not be at all surprised
if he had something to say by way of enlargement on it.
Honourable senators, there is a classification to which all of us belong, and whose
interests often seem to become lost in the
constant scramble for positions of preference
and protection. A freer trade policy, stated
by a spokesman for Canada in the same definite and positive language as was used by
the leaders of the European countries, and
more recently by President Kennedy, would
give hope to the two million consumers of
the Atlantic provinces.
It seems reasonable that as stiffer competition from foreign goods is met by cooperative and realistic attitudes towards
taxes, wages, profit and efficiency in Canadian
industry, the consumer of those goods is
most certainly bound to benefit.
Honourable senators, in closing I want to
say that a new look for Canada's position in
a rapidly changing world economy is being
urged by responsible businessmen, and even
labour leaders, wherever and whenever they
have an opportunity to express their views
in public. I have already referred to one
Canadian, Mr. Fowler, whose name, by the
way, should be familiar to all as the Chairman of the Royal Commission on Broadcasting, and whose reputation for possessing a

SENATE

keen grasp of all facets of Canadian life has
been enhanced by his important and helpful
contributions to the Senate's studies on inflation and unemployment. Many others who
have established national reputations in the
business world have for some time been
pointing out the necessity of Canada accepting the fact of a changing pattern of world
trade, and have been urging the political
leaders of our country to lose no time in
declaring a positive policy in relation to this
change.
Such views were the central theme of the
recent annual meeting in Halifax of the
Canadian Chamber of Commerce. Nova Scotians should rejoice that at last the time has
arrived when the need for a positive approach
to freer trade is being so widely considered
as a national need. We emphasize that need
with particular reference to the prospects for

our long-term access to the European Common Market, as well as to the future expansion of our trading opportunities with, for us,
the greatest common market of all, that federation of states just across the border where
there are today nearly 200 million potential
customers.
Honourable senators, I am sure there would
be cause for enthusiastic rejoicing and celebration in my home province, at least-and,
I believe, all over Canada-in 1967, the centennial year of Confederation, if before that
time there were evidence that Canada's
leaders recognized the need for positive action
to join the crusade for freer trade, which has
as its ultimate aim the establishment of
peace through prosperity for all free people.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Pratt, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until Monday, February 12, at 8 p.m.

OLD AGE ASSISTANCE ACT
BILL TO AMEND-FIRST READING
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-55, to amend
the Old Age Assistance Act.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shal this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. John M. Macdonald: With leave of
the Senate, I move second reading of the
bill now.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: May I be permitted ta ask if there is any urgency about
this matter, and why the rules are not being
followed?
Hon. Walter M. Aseltine: Honourable senators will remember that the Old Age Security
Bill was given second reading, and was referred ta the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce. The three bills which passed
third reading in the other place, two last
Friday and one today, are sister bills, so ta
speak, ta the Old Age Security Bill. It is
hoped ta have a meeting of the Banking and
Commerce Committee tomorrow and ta consider all three bills at that time. I also hope
that the minister will be able ta be present
at that meeting. For that reason I would
consider it a favaur on the part of the house
ta be allowed ta proceed with the second
reading of the Old Age Assistance Bill this
evening.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): That request might apply ta the Old Age Assistance
Bill and ta the Disabled Persons Bill, but is
there still another bill?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No. One bill, the Old
Age Security Bill, has already received
second reading here, and there are three
other bills ta be considered. They are, the
Old Age Assistance Bill, the Blind Persons
Bill, and the Disabled Persons Bill. I am
hopeful that the three bills, together with
the Old Age Security Bill, can go ta the
Banking and Commerce Committee when it
meets tomorrow.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): It has
been mentioned ta me that the committee
might not meet until tomorrow evening. If
that is so, there would be no urgency. However, I do not intend ta hold up the bills
in view of what the honourable leader has
said. However, with respect ta the bill ta
provide war pensions to certain persons who
served as civilians, that measure was not
passed by the other house on Friday, and I
have not seen it yet. Therefore, I would like
consideration of that bill ta stand over until
tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I think we could agree
on that, honourable senators. The Disabled
Persons Bill was given second reading in
the other house on Friday and it received
third reading today. There are copies of the
bill now in the Senate, but the final printed
copies have not arrived. However, there were
no amendments made ta the bill. I was rather
hoping we might proceed with the three
bills tonight and see how we get along.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Do I
understand that the Old Age Assistance Bill
has been passed by the other house?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It has been passed.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): That is,
it has not been passed by this house-but
it was passed in the other place.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes, on Friday last.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): What
about the Blind Persons Bill?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That also was passed in
the other place last Friday.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): There is
another bill, one entitled the Disabled Persons Bill.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That bill was given third
reading in the other place today. Copies of
it are available. If there is any objection
ta our proceeding with it tonight we could
defer it until tomorrow.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is moved by the Honourable Senator
Macdonald (Cape Breton) seconded by the
Honourable Senator Beaubien (Bedford) that
Bill C-55, ta amend the Old Age Assistance
Act, be now read a second time.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): Honourable senators, I propose ta give a very
brief explanation of this bill.
As honourable senators know, the Old
Age Assistance Act, contains the provision
that the Government of Canada may make
an agreement with a province whereby it
will pay one-half the cost of assistance

SENATE

granted by the province to persons between
the ages of 65 and 70 years, under certain
conditions.
Under the present act the maximum amount
that the Government of Canada contributes
is one-half of $55, and the amendment proposed by this bill would raise the maximum
to one-half of $65.
The amendment also deals with the maximum permissible income allowed a recipient of old age assistance. Under the present
act an unmarried person is allowed to have
an income, including the pension, of $960 a
year; a married person is allowed an income
of $1,620 a year, and if the spouse of a married person is blind, the allowable income is
$1,980 per year. Under this amendment the
allowable incomes are raised so that an unmarried person would be allowed an income,
including this pension or allowance, of $1,140
a year, a married person $1,980, and a married person whose spouse is blind, $2,340.
This, very briefly, is the purpose of the
proposed amendment, and I commend it to
your favourable consideration.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Honourable senators, as I understand this bill it will
allow persons of over 65 and under 70 years of
age, and who are in need, to receive the same
allowance as is paid to all persons who are
70 years of age and over, provided the provinces co-operate.
I also understand from what the honourable sponsor of the bill has said, that for a
province to co-operate, regarding those who
are in need and who are 65 years of age and
over, it is necessary for that province to
provide half of the monthly allowance of $65.
Would the honourable sponsor of the bill
inform the house whether or not it is necessary for all ten provinces to enter into an
agreement with the Government before this
bill can be put into effect in any one province? If not, could it be that in some provinces
in Canada needy persons of over 65 and
under 70 years of age would still receive an
allowance of $55 a month, while in other provinces such persons would be getting $65 a
month?
Would the honourable sponsor of the bill
also inform the house as to what provinces, if
any, have already agreed to enter into this
new arrangement, and if any provinces have
intimated that they will not enter into it?
He might also be good enough to inform
the house as to the cost of this proposed increase to the federal Government, and how
the Government proposes to raise the money.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): Honour-

able senators, as I understand the first question of the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.

Macdonald, Brantford) it was as to whether all
ten provinces need to come into the agreement before this arrangement would come
into effect. My understanding is that if a
province does not wish to come into the arrangement it does not have to. That would,
consequently, answer the second question. If
a province does come into the arrangement
then the recipients of old age assistance in
that province will receive the increased allowance up to $65, whereas those in the provinces
which do not come into the arrangement will
still receive $55.
I cannot give any definite answer as to
whether any provinces have agreed to come
into the arrangement, but I do know that my
own province of Nova Scotia bas intimated,
in a statement by the Premier, that it will
come into this arrangement. As to the other
nine provinces, I have no information.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): May I
interrupt the honourable senator to ask him
if this proposal was put to the provinces last
September?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): I cannot give an answer to that question. I think
we will have to wait until we get into committee for an answer.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): I understood you to say that your province intimated
last September that it would come into the
arrangement.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): That
intimation was given after this bill was first
mentioned in the Speech from the Throne.
I understand, honourable senators, that the
cost to the federal treasury for the first
twelve months is estimated at $7,200,000.
That would be half the total cost.
Hon. Mr. Farris: That is, if all the provinces come in.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald

(Cape Breton): Yes,

that is if they all come in.
That brings us, I think, to the final part
of the question which is as to how this
money is to be raised. I do think, honourable
senators, that we are paying too much attention to the method by which this money is
to be raised. I believe it would be more
fitting on my part if I were to let the Minister of Finance answer that question.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
this proposal to amend the Old Age Assistance Act does two things. It increases the
assistance from $55 a month to $65. That is,
of course, contingent upon the provinces
joining in the scheme on what is popularly
known as a fifty-fifty basis.
The second thing it does is that it enlarges
the area in which this assistance will apply

FEBRUARY 12, 1962
Under the act as it is at the present time the
assistance will be given ta an unmarried
person whose income, inclusive of assistance,
is not more than $960 a year. Under this
legislation the limit of $960 a year is raised
ta $1,140 a year. In other words, the limit is
being raised by $15 per month.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is, including the
old age assistance.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Of course-no. Let me
get this correctly.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: That is right, it is including the old age assistance.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes, that is right. Will
this increase nat produce a new flock of
people wanting ta come under the Old Age
Assistance Act?
The total limit, with the assistance heretofore, bas been $960 per annum. As I say,
we are raising that ta $1,140. If I understand the situation aright, this will open
a new door sa that those who are now
denied assistance because they do not qualify
under the $960 limit will be able ta apply
for assistance if their income is less than
$1,140 per annum.
I would suggest that it is impossible ta
estimate what the additional cost will be.
There has been very little increase in the
cost of living, so why enlarge the amount
ta be paid recipients? I know the increase
will be welcomed by those who receive it,
but if they are entitled ta it now they were
entitled ta it before. It is a rather interesting
speculation as ta why this legislation is
being brought down at this particular time.
Hon. Mr. Farris: There is no doubt at all.

this allowance, or is it the Government which
is in need of votes which I understand are
to be polled very shortly?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: That is a fair question.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes. Who is in need,
the Government or the people who receive
old age assistance?
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, since the honourable senator fron
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has
asked that fair question I shall try to answer
it to the best of my ability.
Those who are in need are, for example, in
the case of single persons, those who receive
$960 a year. That is a pretty small amount,
and it will still be small when it is raised
to $1,140. I take the stand that in this type
of legislation we must not be satisfied when
we increase benefits, but we must continually
strive to improve the legislation for those
who really need assistance. I am happy to be
able to assure the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity that the Government is not
in need of any votes which may follow from
this legislation.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

SENATE
As I mentioned before, it will require the
agreement of the provinces and territories to
give effect to the higher maximum benefits
and higher income ceilings. As far as the
federal Government is concerned the effective
date of these changes will be February 1,
1962. Copies of this bill have been sent to
each province, and the Government hopes that
all provinces and territories will agree to the
changes so that new draft agreements embodying the present proposals will be drawn
up without delay. Benefits for this group of
society are peculiar to themselves. They
are problems for which we all have the
greatest sympathy, problems that go far beyond simply providing financial assistance.
People who are blind are cut off from more
of the good things of life than are any other
persons. They need jobs and opportunities in
order to participate in the various activities.
Subsection (1) of section 3 of the Blind Persons Act is repealed in order to increase from
$55 monthly to $65 monthly the maximum
amount of allowance in respect of which contributions may be made under the act.
Paragraph (c) of subsection (2) of section 3
of the said act is repealed and the following
proposals are substituted therefor:
(1) With respect to an unmarried person
without a dependent child or children, the bill
proposes to raise the allowable income inclusive of allowances to not more than $1,380 a
year, an increase of $180 a year.
(2) With respect to an unmarried person
with a dependent child or children, whose income inclusive of allowances is not more than
$1,860 a year, there is a proposed increase of
$180 a year.
(3) In the case of a married couple where
one is blind and the total income inclusive of
allowance of the couple is not more than
$2,340 a year, an increase of $360 per year
will be granted.
I may say that these new income ceilings
are higher than would be necessary to permit
recipients to receive the full benefit of the
higher maximum pension. The aim of this
amendment is to encourage initiative in many
by allowing recipients to have greater outside
earnings, where possible, without reduction
of assistance.

(4) In the case of a blind recipient living
with his wife who is also blind, where the
total income inclusive of allowance of the
recipient and his spouse is not more than
$2,460 a year, there is a proposed increase of
$360 a year.
Honourable senators, I for one heartily endorse this legislation as being the best available to date. The two amendments contained
in Bill C-56, which includes the four subsections to which I have referred, will be most

helpful in at least partly overcoming many
cases of hardship which exist today.
If this bill receives second reading, I intend
to move that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, the sponsor of this bill (Hon. Mrs.
Irvine) has explained it as fully as did
the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Aseltine),
who explained the Old Age Assistance Bill.
I do not rise to oppose this bill, but rather
to support it. If there is anything we can do
to make the way easier in this world of one
who is afflicted with blindness, I am sure we
are all anxious to do so. I am sure that all
honourable senators share the feeling of the
sponsors with respect to both these bills.
However, I regret that under the bill now
before us it is possible that some unfortunate
blind people who happen to live in one province might receive $55 a month whereas,
in some other province where an agreement
has been entered into, they will receive
$65 a month. I think that is possible under
this bill. Under the Old Age Assistance Bill
the honourable sponsor informed the house
that it would be possible for one province to
enter into an agreement with the federal
Government and the needy of that province
would get the advantage of $65 a month,
whereas in another province, which did not
enter into an agreement, the old provision
of $55 a month would stand. I take it that
result could follow in connection with pensions for the blind. I think that is most unfortunate. I feel that the Government should
have tried to bring in legislation which would
give to all blind persons from the Atlantic
to the Pacifie the sum of $65 a month; that
is the least they could have done. I think the
Government could have devised some plan,
as it did in connection with the Old Age
Security Act, whereby everybody throughout
Canada would receive the same amount, but
it did not do so in this instance. I hope that
even at this late date-and it may be the
last minute of this session, for all I knowthe Government can devise a plan whereby
all these unfortunate blind persons across
Canada will receive the same amount, namely
$65 a month.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I gather from the explanation of the honourable lady (Hon. Mrs. Irvine), and from reading the bill, that what is proposed is this:
At the present time, the federal Government
contributes 75 per cent of a monthly pension
of $55 a month, and under this amendment
it proposes to contribute 75 per cent of an
increased pension of $65 a month. How much
is it anticipated this will cost the Government?

FEBRUARY 12, 1962
Hon. Mrs. Irvine: It is anticipated that in
a twelve-month period it will be an increase
of $1.1 million.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): May I
ask one more question? Would that be if all
the provinces entered into the agreement?
Hon. Mrs. Irvine: I think so.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): If the
Government could throw in a quarter of a
million, it could apply to all the provinces.
Hon. William M. Wall: Honourable senators, I realize that this bill is going to be
referred to the Banking and Commerce committee, but it did not strike me until today
when I read Bill C-62, dealing with disabled
persons, and Bill C-56, dealing with persons
disabled by blindness, that there are interesting anomalies, if you wish, which I hope can
be explained. For example, in Bill C-62, by
section 2, paragraph (g)(ii), a disabled person
married and living with his spouse, is allowed a total income of $1,980 a year. In Bill
C-56, an unmarried person with a dependent
child or children is allowed a total income
of only $1,860. And this person, remember,
is blind. Furthermore, I do not see anything
in the bill that tells me what happens to a
married person who may have a child or
children. Both parts of the bill deal with
unmarried persons with or without dependent
children.
Hon. Arthur W. Hoebuck: Honourable senators, I wish to join with others in complimenting the senator who presented this bill (Hon.
Mrs. Irvine), as I also complimented her on
her remarks on the address in reply to
the Speech from the Throne. I compliment
her now, as I did then, on the clarity of her
statements and the force with which she
expressed them, and I should like her to
understand that I am all for this bill, so far
as assistance to these disabled persons is
concerned. Certainly we have not done as
much as we could for them in the past.
I am rather concerned about this matter.
Is this a handout to the blind persons in
those provinces which feel they have sufficient
funds to match the Dominion, dollar for
dollar, and not to the blind persons in those
provinces which think they have not the
money? Is this an assistance to the needy
in the provinces which are rich, and the
withholding of assistance to the needy in
the provinces that are poor? Is it based
upon the need of the individuals who will
receive these benefits, or is it merely the
intention to help out those provinces that
are well-to-do? That is the effect of the
bill, or it may be so.

,I would like to ask another question, which
I think the sponsor can probably answer
quite as well as the sponsor of the previous
bill attempted to do. I would like to know
whether the blind are more blind, and
whether the people who come within the
benefits of this bill, are in greater need on
the eve of a general election than at any
other time in the life of this Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Choquefie: By the way, how do
the blind vote?
An Hon. Senator: A for you.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If they have any sight
at all, they will not vote for the people you
support.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: We will see about that
afterwards.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I appreciate this bill
is a fishing expedition on the part of your
party for votes; but I doubt very much, since
you want my view on it, that you will purchase many by this measure. I would like it to
be thoroughly understood that this bill is for
that purpose.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Are you scraping the
bottom of the barrel?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Am I scraping the bottom of the barrel?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, but I think that
the barrel on your side-the barrel of the
Minister of Finance-has been pretty well
scraped, not at the bottom, but right straight
through the bottom.
The question that was asked, as to where
the money is to come from, is a pertinent
question when by this bill you are increasing
expenditures by more than $1 million. I
am not opposed to the granting of this
money; but when the finances of our Dominion are in the horrible condition I find them,
I think it is still a pertinent question to ask
where the money is coming from, and what
taxes you propose to increase in order to
balance the budget-or are you going to
continue borrowing money as you have done
in the past? Are you going to issue bonds
and buy them yourselves through your agent,
the Bank of Canada? Or will you increase
the amount of money in circulation? What
is the scheme proposed in order to keep the
finances of this country on a decent and
sound basis, while increases of this kind are
being made continually? It is a proper question, a most pertinent question to be asked
by senators who are responsible for the welfare of this Dominion. Not that we shall vote
against the bill; we shal not. I shall vote for
it, of course, but at the same time I have a

voting against it.

FEBRUARY 12, 1962
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable senators, there are just one or two observations
I might make. I might say how relieved I am
to have such an assurance from our new
senator (Hon. Mr. Hollett) as to how everything is going to be all right, even though we
had a $500 million surplus in 1957 and have
a deficit of almost a billion dollars at the
present time. However, that is not the point
I want to make.
This is the point I want to make: As I follow this bill, the increased payments to each
province by the federal Government depend
on the province itself contributing its share of
the increase, and if the province does not
contribute its share of the increase the
Government refuses the increase. I would
like to ask any honourable senator here if the
need of a blind man is any greater or any
less because the province will not do its
share. Whether the province concerned pays
its share or not, surely the share that is
needed from the federal Government is just
as great whether the blind man is in Ontario
or New Brunswick or some other province.
Hon. Mr. Holleft: Honourable senators, I
would like to answer the point made by the
honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris). The honourable senator
spoke of the deficits of today compared to the
so-called surpluses prior to 1957. I wonder if
in his calculations the honourable senator has
taken the time to compare the amounts which
today are being paid out to the ten provinces
with those which were paid out prior to 1958.
May I assure the honourable senator that if he
takes the trouble to look up the figures be will
find that more money is being paid over by
way of grants, conditional and otherwise, to
the ten provinces than the amount of the
deficit at the present time.
Hon. Mr. Farris: What good is that going to
do a blind man if he doesn't get the increase?
Hon. Mr. Holleti: It will be an incentive
for the provinces to pay their proportion. The
present Government has paid out more money
to the ten provinces by way of grants than
the amount of the deficit which the Government is accused of handing to us today. I
think all that has to be taken into consideration.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: May I ask the honourable senator, does be know how much the
federal Government collected on tax rental
agreements from those provinces in that
period.
The Hon. the Speaker: To whom is the
question directed?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: To the senator who has
just spoken.

Hon. Mr. Holleit: What is the question
again?
Hon. Mr. McKeen: How much has the federal Government collected from those provincial Governments under tax rental agreements
in the same period in which you say it paid
so much to the provinces?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: More than the Liberals
paid.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: It collected more.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, if I may be permitted I will come
to the assistance of the honourable senator
for Burin (Hon. Mr. Hollett). I know that he
is in earnest and that be is a new senator.
He bas told us what to do, and in a very
interesting manner, but he has touched on
very dangerous ground. If during the coming
election-when it will take place no one
knows-he says to the blind, the Canadian
Government, which I support, has passed
legislation to give so much money to the
blind-that is, if the legislation passes, as we
expect it will-up to that point there will be
no contradiction because his statement will be
correct. But, honourable senators, there is
something else. This piece of legislation is
conditional: it depends on the agreement of
the individual province to pay its share. Does
the honourable gentleman agree to that?
This is very interesting. Let us suppose that
the honourable senator opposite addresses a
meeting anywhere in Newfoundland, or in
any province which has not agreed to pay its
share, and be says that the federal Government, the Parliament of Canada, has passed
legislation to give so much more to the blind.
The blind will say, "Where is the money? We
have got nothing, because the province has
not agreed to pay its share." That would be
very em'barrassing for the honourable senator.
Perhaps the governments of the provinces
have in mind the same question that was put
by the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and the honourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris) as to where the money will come
from. No one has ever questioned the
legitimacy of that question. It is pertinent,
and for that reason the provinces may ask
the same question as my honourable colleagues have asked. Then they will say, "We
will see what the revenues of the province
are, and whether we are able to pay our
share."
Here I am coming to the rescue of the
honourable gentleman. I do not want him to
be criticized by the audiences whom he will
address; I do not want him to give the impression that his speeches are full of untruths. I want him to be respected by those

SENATE
to whom he will speak; and I want him to be
very careful in his statements, because if he
says to the blind or to the relatives of the
blind, you will have so much more, and they
do not get it, then the position will be very
bad for him. I say that in all earnestness and
in all kindness, for he may receive snowballs
in the winter or stones in the summer, and I
do not want him to suffer. I do not want him
to be the victim of either stones or snowballs.

DISABLED PERSONS ACT
BILL TO AMEND-FIRST

READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-62, to amend
the Disabled Persons Act.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING
Hon. John M. Macdonald, with leave of the

Senate, moved the second reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, as in the case
of the two previous bills discussed, under
the Disabled Persons Act the Government
of Canada can enter into an agreement with
a province whereby it will contribute up to
50 per cent, or half, of the amount paid by
the province to disabled persons. Under the
present act the maximum amount which can
be paid to a recipient under this arrangement is $55 per month. This amendment
would raise that sum to $65 a month; that is,
the Government of Canada would pay up to
one-half of $65 per month.
As in the case of the two previous bills
discussed, payment under this bill also depends upon a means test. The permissible
income under the present act, which includes
the payment of this pension, is $960 a year
for a single person, $1,620 for a married
person, and $1,980 for a married person whose
spouse is blind. The amendment would
increase this ceiling, so that a single person
could have a permissible income of $1,140
a year, a married person an income of $1,980
and a married person whose spouse is blind,
$2,340.
This act is somewhat different from the
others in that before receiving a disabled
persons pension the prospective recipient
must actually pass two tests. Firstly, there is
the means test whereby his income is determined. This is difficult enough, because under

this test if a person has managed to accumulate something through saving, or if he has
a home, or has managed to make a little
income, all of these factors are taken into
consideration before it is decided whether or
not he is eligible for this pension. Secondly,
there is a medical test, and the question then
is whether or not he is within the definition
of being totally and permanently disabled.
I must say that to a layman it is often very
difficult to understand some of the decisions
which are rendered by the various medical
boards.
Honourable senators, I do not think there
is anything I can usefully add, although
perhaps I should say that the estimated cost
to the federal treasury in the first 12 months
is $3,300,000.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): How
much?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): The
federal share is $3,300,000.
I might also anticipate another question
by saying that this is also one of those cases
where an agreement must be arrived at
with the individual province. If a province
does not agree to co-operate, the increase
does not come into effect. However, I think
this was always the case under this act.
There is certainly nothing in the original
act which says that all provinces must agree
before the federal Government will pay its
contribution. Consequently, even under the
original act, which was passed in 1954, it
was quite possible for one province to be
paying and for another not to be. As I
understand it, all the provinces paid. The
same provision applies under the act: it was
possible under the original act and it would
still be possible under the amendment.
Since this further test is a medical one,
it may well be that some honourable senators
might wish to obtain more particular and
detailed information. It is for that reason
I shall move that this bill also be referred
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Prati: Does the honourable senator know if there has been any discussion

or understanding with any of the provinces
with regard to this bill?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): I only
know that they were informed. Whether or
not there was any discussion with them, I
cannot say.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, as with the other bills, I do not rise
to oppose this one but to support it. However,

I regret, as I regretted with respect to the
other bills, that it does not apply to all the
provinces

of Canada.

FEBRUARY 12, 1962
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: Are not all of the provinces in on it on the present basis?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): On the
present basisHon. Mr. Aseltine: What is there ta show
that they will not come in under this amendment?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I do not
say they will not come in, but it is ta be
regretted that they are not being brought in.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: You are trying to drag
them in.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: They were not in
before.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): They are
going ta be dragged in. I am not so sure,
strong as this Government is, that it can
drag them in. Imagine my friend suggesting that the Government is going ta drag
them in.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: I did not suggest that.
You are suggesting the provinces should be
forced in or dragged in.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I made
no such suggestion. It was my friend who
made the suggestion that the Goverrnment
was going ta drag them in. It makes no difference.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: I deny that statement.
I did not make that statement.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): You made
a statement about dragging something in. I
do not know what it was.
The Hon. the Speaker: The honourable
senator has denied making that statement.
He should be believed. Please let us not be
"dragged" into a long discussion over this.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Mr.
Speaker, I am not disbelieving the honourable
senator, but -I cannot disbelieve my ears,
and I do not think he will deny that he used
the word "drag".
Hon. Mr. Aselline: He said you would drag
them in.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Now, the
honourable leader is speaking for the Government.
As the honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) and the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) have stated, it might be possible for
disabled persans in some of the wealthy
provinces ta receive a greater allowance
than those in the poorer provinces. I am sure,
honourable senators, no matter on which side
of the house you sit, you do not think that
would be a very desirable condition in Canada. It would be most undesirable.

The honourable senator who introduced
this bill (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Cape Breton)
referred ta the necessity of obtaining a
medical certificate, but I do not know what
standards have been established ta determine whether or not a persan is totally and
permanently disabled. I know there have
been a large number of lawsuits in connection with insurance polices which have
turned on the question of whether a persan
was totally and permanently disabled. I
would like ta know if there is a regulation
under which a determination can be made,
and which specifies the condition ta which
a persan must sink in order ta be totally and
permanently disabled.
I think, honourable senators, that in many
instances there has been too strict an interpretation given ta those words, and that
people who are just on the borderline have
not been getting the benefit of the doubt.
Surely, that is the wrong attitude ta take.
My honourable friend from Burin (Hon. Mr.
Hollett) talked about how generous we should
be ta the blind, and we all agree with him,
but why should there not be similar generosity extended ta those who are disabled?
If there is any question as ta whether or not
they are permanently and totally disabled
then why not give them the benefit of that
doubt. That, along with the additional $10
would be of great help.
I was very glad ta hear my honourable
friend from Burin (Hon. Mr. Hollett) say that
the money was going ta be raised by taxation. If the Government is going ta do that
then it is turning over a new leaf. Last year
it did not raise all the money it needed by
taxation. It raised much of it by borrowing
on short-term bonds, and when it could not
get enough in that way it turned over the
printing presses, and as my friend knows
a billion dollars was raised in that way.
Hon. Mr. Holleti: It will have ta be paid
back some day.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I am
talking about how the Government is going
ta raise this money, not how future generations are going ta pay it back. We want ta
know how the Government is going ta raise
this money today. My friend has no assurance, and I am sure the honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) will
not give us any assurance, as ta how this
money is ta be raised.
I join with the honourable senators who
have spoken tonight and say that although
I am fully in support of this legislation we,
at the same time, as business people, as
sensible people, as people who are running
the affairs of this country, should have some
idea of how the money is ta be raised. At

SENATE
the moment we have no idea. All we know is
that it will be raised by borrowing, turning
over the printing presses, or by taxation.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, may I ask the honourable
sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Cape
Breton) a question, and if he has not the information available now perhaps it might
be made available for the committee? Can
he find out how much the provincial contributions by provinces will be for this measure,
and, indeed, for the other two measures, if
the provinces implement the schemes?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): Does
the honourable senator mean by provinces?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes, by
provinces.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): I will
endeavour to obtain an answer to that question.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Honourable senators, would
the sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr. Macdonald,
Cape Breton), when he is obtaining that information with respect to these three bills
for the committee which will sit tomorrow,
also find out how many of the provinces
have already agreed to each one of these
pieces of legislation, and how many have
not yet been heard from?
Motion agreed to and bill read second

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS

IN REPLY-DEBATE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, February 8, consideration of His Excellency the
Governor General's speech at the opening of
the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr.
Méthot, seconded by Hon. Mr. Hollett, for
an address in reply thereto.
Hon. Calvert C. Prati: Honourable senators,
I wish at the opening of my remarks to congratulate the mover (Hon. Mr. Méthot) and
seconder (Hon. Mr. Hollett) of the address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne for their
very informative review of the subjects mentioned in the speech.

I also wish to take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to my honourable friend
from Burin (Hon. Mr. Hollett). His very
wide experience in Newfoundland affairs,
gathered through the years in his professional
work, as well as in the provincial Legislature,
will make him most helpful to all of us here.
His experience as Leader of the Opposition
in the Newfoundland Legislature leaves no
doubt in our minds as to his usefulness in this
chamber for, being on this side of the bouse,
we of course know the true value of opposition. Those of us from Newfoundland who sit
on this side of the bouse are well aware that
we now have two Rhodes Scholars from Newfoundland sitting on the other side of the
chamber, so we have to be more on our guard
than in previous times. I need hardly comment, of course, that I refer to the scholastic
ability of their speeches. Across-the-floor arguments on present day public issues are, of
course, another matter.
The Speech from the Throne contained
statements about Canada's foreign trade, but
nothing of a positive policy-making nature
that our changing times require. A definite
and progressive foreign trade policy is of
paramount importance at this particular time,
when we are in the midst of world-wide
changes in trade relationships. I was glad to
hear the forthright manner in which some of
the speakers who have preceded me gave their
views on this subject. Canada must adopt,
without delay, more clearly defined national
objectives for trade advancement than prevail at present. There must be a definite willingness on the part of government, industry
and labour to achieve these national objectives.
The recent movement towards the grouping of countries for the mutual benefit of
broader trading is not idealistic; it is already
proving to be most practical. We certainly
must join up with that movement whenever
practical. We have had our reciprocal trading
and tariff-adjusting agreements for years, but
something broader and more comprehensive
than that is shaping up in economic unions of
countries.
The great resurgence of European industrial life comes from national policy of freer
trade, of which the people over there are not
afraid. Unfortunately, we in Canada are too
afraid of coming out from under the shelter
of tariff walls and protective ceilings. Recent
announcements in the United States by both
government and leading industries are far
more definite in setting forth policy on international trade expansion than we find here.

SENATE
Industry, labour and Government in this
country have not stepped up to the progressive national objectives that are now in evidence in European countries, and which are
spreading to other areas of the world. My
experience in attending several international
trading conferences in Europe, as well as in
Africa, has brought that before me most
forcefully. I have been glad to have had the
privilege of relating some of those experiences in this chamber on other occasions.
We all realize, of course, that tied in with
a policy affecting our world trade is the fundamental issue of employment for our people.
It must never be overlooked that the only way
to relieve unemployment problems in a permanent and lasting manner is by the creation
of more production through industry for the
effective distribution of goods throughout the
world as well as in Canada. A national policy
in that direction has to be creative in a fearless
manner, and it certainly must be continuous
or it fails.
It is appropriate on this occasion to refer
to matters of importance to one's own province. What I have to say in this debate will
be chiefiy related to the province of Newfoundland. I wish to thank the honourable
senator from Queens-Shelburne (Hon. Mr.
Smith) for the helpful reference be made to
the problems of my province.
The Royal Commission on Transportation,
known as the MacPherson Commission, has
brought out some well-considered and useful
recommendations regarding the transportation
problems in Newfoundland, particularly the
need for adequate road facilities. No reasonable appraisal of Newfoundland's needs, nor
indeed of its just claims, can be made without considering the facts which create a
special case for that new province. I emphasize that term "special case" because the
ciýrcumstances of the economy of my province
are entirely different in many respects from
those of any other province. The chief factor
from the point of view of economics lies in
the fact that we are almost entirely an exporting province.
As the honourable senator from Burin
(Hon. Mr. Hollett) pointed out in his speech,
before union with Canada practically all of
our imports came from the United States,
England and other countries overseas, and
all articles produced in Newfoundland, except those which were sold for local consumption, were exported overseas. That situation
has changed in one respect only. We now sell
oractically nothing to the other provinces, but
nearly all our purchases, at least 90 per cent
of the total, come from the various other
provinces.

I am sorry that the honourable senator
from Burin, in his otherwise fine speech,
made reference to Newfoundland as being
a liability province. I know he modified his
remark by saying that other provinces were
also liabilities. When do provinces, whose
creative assets are tied into the economy of
the nation, become a liability or an asset?
I cannot figure it out. If a precise formula
were worked out and applied, this country
would shape up to be a land of ten nations
and not a nation of ten provinces. I can say
that Newfoundlanders, being relatively new
citizens of Canada, are very sensitive to this
"liability" talk. Nothing caused more wrath
among our people than when a federal minister, in the early period of Union, came to
Newfoundland, and in a public speech
stressed how great was our financial indebtedness to the federal Government. His
phrases are still quoted as intolerable.
With the varied circumstances and the
interlocking relations in every field of material and social life, there is no logical and
conclusive analysis that can be made of the
relative asset and liability position of any of
the provinces. In relation to that theme, however, I intend to make reference to certain
aspects of my province's position in Canada.
Newfoundland, with its area of 150,000
square miles, has tremendous and varied
mineral resources which are being developed,
with certainly greater development ta follow.
A tremendous pulp and paper industry is
already established. Also there are great areas
of unused and high-class pulpwood, particularly in Labrador. An important extension
of the newsprint industry is in prospect for
the very near future. One of the most prolific
fishing waters in the world is right by our
coast.
There are many other existing and
potential industries, which I need not enumerate. The sum total can be counted as a
most important factor in the over-all development of this nation. The greatest undeveloped
hydro power potential in the whole of Canada
is in Labrador, adjacent to the most outstanding iron ore area of this country.
We find that the significance of our recent
developments and the definite prospects of
further industrial growth of national importance are not widely recognized throughout
Canada.
I might emphasize particularly, for your
information, some facts about the great iron
ore development which is going on in
Labrador.
Some years ago-in fact, before the time of
Union with Canada-Canadian
interests
obtained mineral exploration and development rights in Labrador. After a great financial outlay to determine the iron ore mining

FEBRUARY 12, 1962
prospects, development operations started.
Capital was raised, the greater part of it in
the United States. With the leadership given
at the start by Mr. Jules Timmins and his associates, and continuing through the years,
the Iron Ore Company, with affiliated companies, came into being. Those interests set
up the only long-distance railway-360 miles
-that has been built in Canada in this
century, which was not financed by public
funds. The railway operation is unique in
some aspects of its modernization. Single
trains of 100 cars carry the amazing volume
of 10,000 tons of ore.
Improvements in means of pelletizing iron
ore and many other scientific developments
give emphasis to the leadership in Canada of
this operation.
As a result of this development, the steamer
shipping port, Seven Islands, in the province
of Quebec, formerly a village of about 1,500,
has already grown to a population of about
20,000. A total of $500 million has been invested by that one previously mentioned
business organization and its affiliates, which
has the active participation of five of the outstanding steel interests in the United States.
Canadian financial interest has not been insignificant; it is about 25 per cent of the total,
which is a lot of money.
There is another big mining development in
the adjacent area being set up by the Wabush
Lake Mining Company, which will add $300
million or more to the Labrador mining
program. The mines already in operation are
scheduled to produce this year about six million tons of iron ore, which is equal to 50 per
cent of the total produced in Canada. With
the program for further expansion laid out, it
is anticipated that production in the Labrador
area will, in the near future, be running up
to around 10 million tons annually. Most of
this iron ore is exported and brings money
into Canada. It is only fair to say that this
expansion of the mining industry has been
helped to a great extent by the dynamic promotional effort given by the Premier of Newfoundland. By the way, during the month of
May of this year the "Smailwood" mine is
expected to get into production, and in conjunction with that new mine the first completely automatic railway in the world will
be in operation.
I am giving these facts because I am sure
honourable senators will be interested in them.
At the same time, I want to use the information to illustrate the extent of the assets
brought into Canada by Newfoundland,
and which are not placed in the public income
and expenditure accounts of the federal
treasury.

Now, where are the statements of the
accounts as to deficits or excesses in federalprovincial financing? I get back again to
that point of liability. The true position is
certainly not set out in the official records.
From the point of view of debit and credit
in Government accounts, I will admit that
the Newfoundland position looks terribly
unbalanced, with so much more coming in
than going out. That, however, is not the
story. Figures can often be misleading
when just taken from the accounts books of
the Government. Do not misunderstand me.
They are not placed there to mislead; they
are factual, but factual only in one direction.
That direction is correct accounting for the
Government, but the correct interpretation is
another matter. For instance, Newfoundland's
biggest financial contribution is not found
in the Public Accounts and is not expected
to be found there. I shall refer to that contribution as indirect payments, and under
two major headings. The first is the portion
of the sales and excise taxes on the trade
of Newfoundland which was paid to the federal Government at the manufacturers' level,
but paid outside of our province. In the year
1960-61, the total federal collections throughout Canada under that heading amounted to
$1,356 million.
Incidentally, about 80 per cent of the nationally collected sales and excise taxes are
paid by industry in the provinces of Quebec
and Ontario. Industry within those provinces
and elsewhere naturally collect those payments from buyers of all provinces in relation
to sales made, plus the gross profit margin
charged on that cost outlay.
The province of Newfoundland makes no
shipments of manufactured goods of any consequence to other provinces. By reason of
the fact that 90 per cent of its total requirements are bought within Canada, by a
very moderate calculation I submit that
Newfoundland's portion of those taxes paid
in the past year can be placed at $24,500,000.
I should explain that in stating that amount
I have taken into consideration that the
population of our province is 2.6 per cent of
that of all Canada, and I have deducted
30 per cent as being a possible lower level
of purchasing power than that of the average
of all other provinces.
Under the heading of indirect payment to
federal revenue, the second item I would
mention in this connection is the increased
prices in Canada by reason of the protection
of industry by customs tariffs.
The Gordon Commission report of 1957
makes reference to this matter and says it
is most difficult to estimate the true cost of
the Canadian tariff in economic terms. It
also states that members of the commission's

128

SENATE

staff made a calculation which showed that
the differences in price of goods attributable
to the tariff would perhaps amount to 3j
per cent of the gross national expenditure.
On the basis of the gross national expenditure officially recorded for 1960 at $36 billion, the estimate would be $1,250 million
added to the consumers' cost of goods in
Canada. It must be recognized, of course,
that the imposition of the tariff has varied
implications in different areas of the country. Where, however, the customs tariff has
given very little benefit to industry, such
as in Newfoundland, then the contribution
made by paying the higher prices for goods
made in Canada has no direct compensating
factor in the province. There are of course
indirect factors. To take one factor would require about five hours of reading from reports
like the Gordon Report. Anyway, there is no
direct compensating factor recorded in figures published in Government or treasury
financial reports. Again, by deducting the 30
per cent referred to on a per capita basis,
the result is that Newfoundland people pay
$22,750,000 under that heading alone. This
is a basis of calculation set forth in the
Gordon Report.
If we put together those two contributions,
that is under the headings of sales and excise taxes, and customs tariff, the result is
that the estimated contribution of our province to the national finance and the economy
of Canada runs to about $47 million. We are
the only province that can put it so completely that way, because, as I have said, we
have very little reciprocal trade. The money
from exports is our greatest source of means
for the payment of our domestic purchases.
Of that $47 million to which I refer, all we
get credit for in the federal official returns is
$10,300,000 collected as federal revenue within
the province by way of sales and excise
taxes and import duties. A considerable
portion of that is on tobacco and liquor.
Of course, our average payments under
those two headings would not be any
greater than the average for Canada. I hope
I make that quite clear. I should point out
here that in the 1960-61 statements of federal
income tax collections within the province, there are recorded payments amounting to $30,900,000 under the headings of income and old age security taxes, corporation
and estate taxes. The estimated contributions to the federal revenue directly and indirectly were about $78 million in the past
year. As you will see, the amount is running up and, as I have stated, is already
about $37 million more than we get credit
for in Government accounts.
Other financial and economie factors also
enter into Newfoundland's case for special

consideration. There is the amount of corporation tax and income tax to the federal
treasury by reason of the profit and employment given in the production of $250 million
to $300 million worth of one-way trade. I
know of no way to calculate the amount,
but one can only guess the many thousands
employed and millions of dollars from that
source contributed to the treasury. It makes
me actually boil over when I hear of Newfoundland being talked of as a liability, an
extraordinary liability, to the federal Government of Canada, or being regarded as
different from other provinces in the ordinary
normal process of revenue and expenditure
in Canada.
Apart from what I have mentioned, there
are many other reasons for Newfoundland's
needs receiving special consideration. An outstanding one which I shall mention now is
the need for more economic transportation
facilities and more complete road service.
The second report of the MacPherson
Royal Commission on Transportation, which
has just been circulated, outlines a strong
case for a progressive transportation policy
in Canada. The facility of roads is of most
outstanding importance today by reason of
the terrific change-over to motor traffic in
very recent years. The report points out that
the changing and improved transportation
facilities throughout the years called for
imagination and courage which led to national
development. Those facilities were set up to
meet the adverse development conditions
caused by rugged terrain, sparse population,
scattered resource location, dependence on
export markets and so forth.
While the report is, of course, written to
summarize and make recommendations on a
national scale, it makes particular reference
to the needs of Newfoundland, by reason of
it being a new province and not having the
benefit of previous years' development as
had the other provinces.
In referring to Newfoundland's transportation needs, the report states:
The oldest settled part of Canada has
special problems not faced by any other
province.
It goes on to say:
The lack of adequate inland transportation has seriously retarded resource development. Because of its geographical
position and the stage of economic development, Newfoundland has peculiar
transportation needs unlike other settled
parts of Canada.
The portion of the population which has
to use the fisheries, forests and mines as their
chief source of income is scattered around
the six thousand miles of coastline. The report

FEBRUARY 12. 1962
points out that only a good system of roads
can provide for that imminent human need
of educational and social communications, as
well as for industrial participation. Local
roads are required to connect the fishing
settlements with the areas where the increasing number of processing plants are in operation. Without road communications fishermen
in hundreds of places are deprived of the opportunity of selling their fish in perfectly fresh
condition to these modern plants, which are
so essential for a sound and progressive
development of the industry.
Newfoundland has outstanding tourist attractions, but without the Trans-Canada
Highway we have to pass up the financial
benefits that should accrue to us from that
source.
I quote from the MacPherson Report:
Public works to stimulate the economy
of a province or an area have been a
continuing part of national policy in
Canada.
The report cites as an illustration of that:
What canals and locks did for the
economy of the Central Provinces, what
the trans-continental railways did for
the Prairies, highways can do for Newfoundland.
The report further states:
We are convinced that such a program
is in the national interest.
As we know, until recent times roads were
simply a provincial matter. I might say
in that connection that the Government of
Newfoundland has been devoting a bigger
percentage of its income to the building
of roads, principally local roads, than any
other province in Canada. In fact, during
the past twelve years about 1,500 miles of
local roads have been constructed. Still more
are required to meet the needs arising from

26211-3-9

the opening of mines and primary industries
in various areas. The greatest need, as outlined in the MacPherson Report, is the completion of the Trans-Canada Highway.
While that project has nearly been finished
throughout Canada, a recent report stated that
of about 600 miles of Trans-Canada Highway
planned for Newfoundland only one-half
of it has been built and only about onethird is paved. It is estimated that on the fiftyfifty basis, to complete it Newfoundland would
be required to put up about $45 million. Such
an expenditure simply is not within the means
of the province. As I said, the need for local
road construction in Newfoundland has been
of such a pressing nature that in recent years
that province has surpassed all other provinces in the percentage of its income spent
on roads. In the case of Newfoundland the
fifty-fifty basis of federal and provincial expenditure was never practical, and with the
most imaginative outlook it would take at
least ten years for the province to complete
and pay for its share. It must also be remembered that the province has the expense of
linking up many hundreds of communities
to the highway, as well as the many new industrial centres that are being established.
Honourable senators, I hope that the submission of the MacPherson Royal Commission will result in quick action being taken
to complete at federal cost that most essential
service to Newfoundland. I repeat that the
report points out that public works to stimulate the economy of the province or area has
been a Canadian national policy, and that
should be extended to include a Trans-Canada
Highway in Newfoundland.

ATTENDANCE IN SENATE
NEWSPAPER CLIPPING-PRIVILEGE

Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I rise on a question of privilege.
Many false things are said about the Senate,
and I hold in my hand a clipping which deserves to be answered. It refers in the first
place to the House of Lords, and reads as
follows:
With another eight peers ineligible because they are minors, there are 632 who
have a right to take up seats in the
upper chamber. But, in keeping with the
practice over the years, the average daily
attendance runs around a mere 125about 20 per cent of the eligibles.
This is the sentence that needs to be
answered:
In this respect Canada's Senate and
Britain's House of Lords have much in
common.
That is utterly untrue. I have taken the
trouble to check the attendance list on the
front of the Minutes of the Proceedings, for
every sitting day, and I find that the average
attendance in the Senate this session, including yesterday, is sixty-nine, which is more
than two-thirds of the total number of senators, a record that is many times better than
the House of Lords, and much better than the
other place.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday, consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Méthot, seconded
by Hon. Mr. Hollett, for an address in reply
thereto.

Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
in rising to take part in this debate may I
first say to each and every honourable senator how pleased I am to be back in my place
once again and to be able to take part in the
proceedings of the Senate. When one is ill it
is gratifying to receive so many letters, flowers and good wishes; but much as one appreciates such kindnesses, it is better to be up
and about, taking an active part in life.
My chief reason for speaking this afternoon is that certain honourable senators have
asked me if I would be good enough to speak
on the Columbia River. That is to be the
subject of my address, in the course of which
I intend to give information as to the river
and the difficulties standing in the way of a
treaty being signed between the federal
authorities and the provincial Government.
The Columbia River, which starts in British
Columbia, is 1,210 miles in length, of which
745 miles are in the United States and 465
miles in Canada. In Canada the river drains
an average of 15 per cent of the province of
British Columbia. The head waters of the
river are located in the glacial region of the
mountains. There is a continental cap of ice,
most of which has remained permanent all
through the years. Over one-third of the
volume of the river rises in Canada.
The reason that United States interests are
so keen to obtain the advantage of water
from the Columbia is that they have some 10
or 11 dams that depend on it for water supply.
Those dams operate fully only six months in
the year, because for three months the river
in British Columbia is frozen over, and the
following three months it floods; and most of
the water from the Columbia during that
flood period flows over the dams and drowns
out portions of land down in the United

FEBRUARY 13, 1962
States, hence, the great interest on the part
of that country in the development of the
Columbia River.
The elevation of the Columbia River is
worth noting. It is 1,294 feet at the boundary.
The drainage basin embraces six of the states,
namely, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, western
Montana and the corners of Wyoming and
Utah.
To make a comparison, and to demonstrate
the power potential of the Columbia River, I
point out that the elevation of the St.
Lawrence River is 603 feet with a power
development of some seven million kilowatts.
The elevation of the Columbia River is 2,652
feet at its source, and is capable of developing
more than 34 million kilowatts.
The agreement between the province of
British Columbia and the federal Government,
which was signed almost a year ago, has been
long in coming before the public, for engineering on the Columbia River has been going
on since before 1943. In 1945 a bill was introduced in Parliament to, in a way, curtail
the objectives of the provincial Government
of that day, which was done for the Kaiser
interests by the proposal of a dam on a site
not far from the boundary. The Government
of that day saw fit to have a bill passed which
resulted in the Kaiser interests not getting
their dam. I might say that quite a bit of
politics was mixed up in that, but I am not
going into it this afternoon because I do
not intend to make what might be called a
political speech.
United States interests have long visualized
the power possibilities of the Columbia River,
and because of the huge increase in population and the great expansion in industry they
have done everything possible to bring this
project to a head, their efforts culminating
last year in the treaty which is now being
held up because the provincial Government
and the federal Government have not yet
come to terms.
Estimates have been made of the cost of
the dams and the amount of power which will
be developed by both countries. However, I
might say, in all frankness, that when one
starts to examine that treaty he soon realizes
that he has to be a competent engineer in
order to thoroughly understand all of its
clauses and ramifications. So all I will be able
to do is try to interpret it, based on my knowledge and information from the treaty.
The United States has been most eager to
obtain Canada's co-operation, with the result
that the treaty contains a proposal to build
three flood control dams, with the United
State agreeing to pay $64 million of the cost
over the years. Estimates of the total cost
to Canada range from $344 million to $350
million, with an additional expenditure of
26211-3-9k

$100 million for the construction of power
lines to the border. It is proposed to dam the
Columbia River in British Columbia to control
the water so that at certain seasons its flow
through United States dams wil provide that
country with electric power for a twelvemonth period instead of a six-month period.
Under the treaty Canada is to receive 1,118,000
kilowatts of the newly-developed power and,
as I have said, $64 million towards the construction of the three flood control dams.
The controversy that has arisen concerns
a new proposal by the Premier of British
Columbia to develop the Peace River in
northern British Columbia, a river which is
estimated to be capable of producing anywhere from four million to eight million
kilowatts per year. The Premier envisages
a great industrial development in that northern part of British Columbia, which will attract many people.
Realizing the high cost of the dams under
the treaty, and not having reached an agreement with Ottawa, the Premier has already
made a start on the Peace River project.
He particularly wants to sell this power to
the United States and, while he is confident
that that country will buy the power, there
is no guarantee of it because two interests
in the State of Washington have developed
hydro power over the past 25 to 30 years,
one under government support and the other
under private enterprise. Some of the private
interests are declaring they will not accept
power over a Government line or system.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Would the
honourable gentleman explain just which
power the Premier of British Columbia wants
to sell?
Hon. Mr. Reid: The power which will be
developed at the damsHon. Mr. Farris: From which river, the
Peace River?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No. He wants to sell in
Canada power from the Peace River itself,
but of the increased firm power developed in
the United States from the waters of the
Columbia River, British Columbia's portion
will be 50 per cent-that is what he wants
to sell.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): There is
no suggestion at the present time for the
sale of power developed on the Peace River
to the United States?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No. It would be difficult
to sell that power to the United States because the Peace River is in the far north of
British Columbia and it would be too costly,
I believe, to transmit the power down to the
border and on through the United States.

SENATE
I do not think any estimate has ever been
made as to selling power frorm the Peace
River to the United States. It bas been stated
that it will develop more power than any
other river in British Columbia, including the
Columbia.
At one time the United States offered to
build one of the main dams on the Columbia
free of cost and to hand it over to British
Columbia, if that province would install
generators at the dam, for power to be
used by Canada. The United States authority said, "We will give you the dam".
That proposal fell through and the dam
never materialized. The people of British
Columbia, generally speaking, are at a loss
to know why there is so much objection
in Ottawa to the selling of power which
Canada does not seem to require at the
moment. As a matter of fact, many of our
citizens have been brainwashed in regard
to electric power. They talk about the scarcity
of electricity and the need for it.
May I point out that the B.C. Electricnow operated by the provincial Government
of the day-has two plants, one in my district
and one in Vancouver, which can make up
to l1 million kilowatt hours. These plants
have been lying idle since they were installed. They would be fed by gas from
Alberta. If there was really a shortage of
power these plants would be in operation
now, but they have never operated since
they were constructed by the B.C. Electric
Company.
The people of British Columbia feel a
little put out about the attitude of the federal
Government, and they reason it this way:
We have no sale for the power in British
Columbia at present, even if it is brought
to the boundary line. Why were we not
being treated in a manner similar to the
other provinces, is the cry of the ordinary
citizen. The federal Government thought
nothing of deepening the St. Lawrence at a
cost of, I believe, some $300 million to $500
million, from which British Columbia does
not gain one cent. I think I can make that
statement without fear of successful contradiction. Also, it hands $75 million to Saskatchewan for the building of a dam, which
a commission set up by a former Government said should not be built. But when
it comes to British Columbia, the Government
says, "Well, we will loan you one-half of
the cost of the dams, but we want part of
the profits that you get from them later on."
British Columbia just does not feel like
accepting that kind of offer, especially in
the light of what has been done for other
provinces. They are not levelling carping

criticism at the other provinces about it, but
they want a satisfactory answer from the
federal Government.
There are two other matters which somewhat irk the people of my province, and
which I think should be mentioned. Honourable senators will remember that some two
years ago we had a bill before the Senate,
and at the committee stage we discussed
that part of the bill which had to do with
offshore rights. I do not think any member
of the committee objected to the federal
Government taking the offshore rights for
all the land and islands in the northern
part of Canada, but they wanted to put into
the bill that the rights would also apply
to British Columbia. That was thrown out
by our committee.
Honourable senators, this is rather a serious matter and I strongly advise the Government to do something about it. My
information is that a licence has been issued
by British Columbia to a certain company
to bore for oil off the Charlotte Islands, 8, or
10 or 12 miles offshore, and the federal Government has issued a licence to the same
company for the same locality. I am warning
the Government that if it is not careful this
will lead to trouble. I suggest that if there is
any doubt about it, the matter should be
taken to the highest court of the land to
decide who owns these rights, the province or
the dominion.
When I first came to the Senate, I was told
that one of the duties of a senator was to
defend the rights of the provinces. Well, I
am on the side of the province, and I think
I am taking my rightful place in the Senate
when I do so. These rights belonged to the
province before Confederation, and when we
joined Confederation we did not give away
any of those rights. I would therefore suggest
that the question be taken to the highest
court of the land for a decision before serious friction arises between the provinces and
the Dominion.
There is another matter that I believe
British Columbia bas a right to complain
about. I was surprised when I picked up this
bit of information the other day. It has to
do with the premier of a province giving an
order for the building of three new ferryboats. Many may not be aware of it, but the
provincial Government of British Columbia
has now gone into the ferryboat business and
all told has, I believe, some 17 vessels. As a
matter of fact, some of thern are paying so
well that it has had to build extra boats to
carry passenger cars and trucks from the
nearest point on the mainland to the nearest
point near Victoria. There was a call for

FEBRUARY 13, 1962
tenders for the building of two new steamers.
In that connection I have before me an
article, which says:
When Chairman Watson of the Canadian Maritime Commission threatened to
withdraw the $450,000 federal subsidy
from B.C.'s new ferry projects if Victoria
doesn't buy Canadian engines, he was
dealing in a glaring inconsistency.
If you did not hear the remainder of this
article you might wonder what is wrong with
that. Well, we in British Columbia think we
know what is wrong with it. The article asks
this question:
Did Mr. Walker spend all of this $3.5
million in Canada?
That refers to the building of a boat named
Fort Langley by the Burrard Dry Dock Company, a company which also bid on the
three ferryboats requested by Mr. Watson.
The article goes on to say:
No, he didn't. He spent more thn half
of it in Holland, buying the dredging
equipment for the vessel.
Now, we maintain that it is most unfair
of the federai Government to go out and
buy engines in Holland, and then when the
provincial Government gets a lower bid from
a company outside Canada, and a British
flrm at that, to threaten to take away
$450,000 from us. I think we should show
some annoyance in this matter.
It is incidents of this kind, and many others,
which is bringing about a great deal of friction between the people of the province of
British Columbia and the federal Government. I am one of those who believe that a
more reasonable and peaceful approach
should be made by the federal Government
to the province, with the following suggestions in mind. The federal Government
has announced that it wants to control the
Columbia project and the Premier of the
province takes the view that as toll-bearers
this should be at the provincial level, and
that it should be their duty and right under
the British North America Act to control
this project.
Another suggestion that has been made is
to appoint so many members of the provincial
Government and the provincial board to the
federal board. To this we were flatly told,
"No. We, the Dominion, are going to control
this whole project, after you agree to the
Treaty." British Columbia, I believe, should
be given some provincial control over the
project.
Also, some consideration should be given
to the proposal to allow British Columbia to
sell some power. So I am now appealing to
the dominion Government to allow this

power to be sold for short periods. One of
the things that is annoying our people out
there, and which they cannot understand, is
why the Governnent allows oil and gas to
flow across the line, when these are resources
that will die out some day; these resources,
shall I say, form a diminishing heritage.
However, when it comes to the export of
electricity they say, "Nothing doing; we are
not going to allow it."
I have a list here giving the names of
companies that are exporting electric power
from Canada to the United States. This is
nothing new at the moment. A strong stand
has been taken in the past with regard to
power exportation. It is true that these exporters are licensed to export for only a
short term, not over five years. Surely the
same conditions should be granted to British
Columbia as have been granted to, I think,
twelve places in Canada for the exportation
of electric power. But when it comes to our
province they tell us, "Nothing doing; we
are not going to allow you to export." Can
you wonder at the people of my province
being very annoyed at what is being done
at Ottawa, and what is being done to that
province as compared to the favourable
treatment being given by this Government
to other provinces?
I would say to the Minister of Justice, who
has taken a very active part in this proposed
development, "Calm down a little, and be
reasonable". I know it is difficult to get along
with men like Premier Bennett in Victoria,
but after all he might approach the matter
in a better frame of mind, rather than have
a hidden mallet behind his back to knock his
opponent on the head. That kind of co-operation will never solve the problem or get us
anywhere. The big thing is to let this surplus
power be sold for short terns to the United
States.
Now I am going to propose to the Government that the treaty be given another serious
look. There are certain things in the treaty
which have been overlooked and which in my
opinion are too valuable to overlook.
There is a scarcity of water in California.
At the same time, due to the flooding which
takes place every year in the State of Washington because of the increased flow of the
Columbia River-which I mentioned in the
early part of my remarks-they are only able
to cultivate certain sections of land at extremely high cost, and yet no one has made
any inquiry as to what is the cost or the
value of the damming necessary to prevent
flooding and make provision for irrigation and
water for domestic purposes. My information
is that if these projects go through in their
present form the State of Washington will
irrigate to the extent of 100,000 acres of land.

SENATE
I am going to ask the honourable senators
here what effect they think the irrigation of
100,000 acres of agricultural land will have
on the sale of products that we sell to that
country. No one has ever mentioned the value
of the water. No; all eyes have been looking
towards the hydro-electrie power to be developed. But the water which the United
States will get, and which they are looking
forward to getting, to be piped to California
and as well to irrigate 100,000 acres of land
in the State of Washington, has never been
evaluated by this Government. I say that is a
great oversight on the part of the Government, and I for one would say that the treaty
should not be passed until a new meeting is
held.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Would not the United
States get that water in any case, even if we
did not build the dams?
Hon. Mr. Reid: You must understand that
at one period of the year there is flooding
and at other periods there is a dearth of
water. Well, the flooding cannot be handled
by them as well as we could handle it by
building the dams. A dam would regulate the
flow of water as it is needed, but at the
moment the water runs wild for some three
months in the summertime and in winter the
continental ice cap dries up the flow.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: They cannot dam the
river themselves for irrigation purposes?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No, they cannot. They have
done their best by the building of dikes to
prevent flooding, but it is such a problem
that they are hoping that Canada will accept
the treaty and they will then have British
Columbia control the water flow in flood time.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The control has to be
at the headwaters, I believe?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes, the control will all be
at the headwaters.
Now, it is interesting to speculate on what
the benefit will be to the United States in
actual cash, and these figures are only
calculated roughly. We are going to be out
the cost of the two dams, about $340 million
to $350 million; and that is for the dams alone,
to say nothing of the cost of transmission
lines which is expected to run to $100 million.
These transmission lines are to be built to
carry the power from its source at the dams
in the United States up to the international
boundary line between the U.S. and Canada.
I have some figures, and I would like to
give the full benefit of them. If the United
States were not to receive this benefit, and
endeavoured to create those benefits which
will accrue to that country once this dam is
built, it would cost them in interest alone
more than $900 million. Tncer the treaty all
they are going to put up is $150 million. Is

it any wonder that we in British Columbia,
who have looked into this matter, believe
that the treaty should be re-examined in the
light of these facts that are now coming out?
I may say that there are three dams to be
built. One of these is called the High Arrow
dam. Now, in spite of the fact that in times
past I have uttered harsh words about
General McNaughton, I have nevertheless
always given him praise for his ability and
intelligence as an engineer. He is one of the
top engineers of Canada. As to the High
Arrow dam, he says it should not be built.
I do not know about the truth of the matter,
but it is common gossip in British Columbia
that the High Arrow dam is one which the
provincial Government is very keen to build.
As a matter of fact, it is going to be the first
one of the three to be built.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Where is that High Arrow
dam located?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Just at the end of the
Arrow Lakes, close to the boundary.
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I ask the honourable
senator if that dam would not store the
largest body of water of all?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No. According to General
McNaughton and according to the treaty, it
would hold back 70 per cent of the Columbia
River flow.
In the matter of building the High
Arrow dam a lot of the blame can be laid
at the door of the provincial Government in
wanting to go ahead with it. It means that
one of British Columbia's five major valleys
will be wiped out for ever. Civilization will
be extinguished throughout the 150-mile long
valley of the Arrow Lakes, says General
McNaughton of the International Joint Commission. Six thousand inhabitants of 18 contented and self-contained communities will
have their lives and homes disrupted because
this project is going to flood them out. Future
generations will be unable to move to and
use this lovely valley because the mountain
sides are so steep. Some 100,000 acres of good,
habitable land, in an ideal climate, and priceless recreational and forest facilities will be
lost forever, besides the serious losses of fish
and wild life.
Honourable senators will understand the
anxiety of these people, and those of us who
have been in that part of the province realize
that we have not unlimited land available,
as have the Prairie and other provinces;
most of our agricultural land lies between the
mountains. The extent of good land which
will be wiped out by the High Arrow dam
is greater than the entire fruit-growing district of the Okanagan.
Nothing has been said or done regarding
compensation, or who should pay for the

FEBRUARY 13, 1982
loss. If the United States wants the High
Arrow dlam built first, surely they should
be willîng ta pay something? It has been
estimated that it will cost anywhere from $35
million ta $50 million ta remove these people
framn the vailey and relocate them. Who is
going ta pay? There is not a word in the
treaty about that. Do honourable senatars
nat f eel, as I do, that it; is an extremely ûinportant and serious matter for those 6,000 citizens presently living in that area ta be ejected
and told ta go and locate somewhere else?
Some of thern have lived there for 50 to 70
years.
Honourable senators, I have naw concluded what I wanted ta, say. Perhaps I could
have deait with the subi ect at greater length,
but I thought that by canflning my speech
ta the highlights of the treaty it would affard a better understanding of the situation.
Han. Mr. Crerar: Might; I ask the honourable senator, is the High Arraw dam provided for in the treaty?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes, and it is one of the
first.
Hon. Josie D. Quart: Honourable senatars,
may I associate myseif with the many honourable senators who have paid such giawing
tributes ta the memories of the three distinguished senatars who have recently passed
ta their eternal reward. I refer, of course,
ta the passing of the Hanaurable Senatars
Léger and Golding, and the mare recent and
tragic death of the Honaurable Senator
Barbaur. Ta their familles I off er my deepest
sympathy.
Naw for a mare jayful change of mood,
ta, aur honourable and distinguished Speaker,

I wish hlm health and happiness in presiding over the deliberations of this chamber.
I hope that his duties this session will nat
be too arduous in calling us ta order.
I wish ta share with my colleagues in congratulating the esteemed Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) upon his appointment as a member of the Queen's Privy
Council for Canada, and particularly as this
great honour was conferred upan him at
La Citadelle de Quebec in aur old, histaric
City of Quebec. I was overjoyed ta hear the
tributes paid him by the honourable senators of both sides of this chamber. Also

in the Speech froin the Throne. It was a

I cannot at ail times concur with his criticism of Government policy and legisiation,
nevertheless may I say it is a pleasure toi
see him sitting across from us, loaking sa

colours in fulfilling the important task entrusted ta them.
And who could fail to, be impressed by the
dignified and eloquent manner in which
Canada's great hero of two world wars, His
Excellency, Governor General Vanier, read
the Speech from the Throne, his perfect
bilingualismn symbolizing the two great cultures of Canada?
(Translation):
Now, I would like ta congratulate most
sincerely another honourable colleague from
Quebec, the honourable senator from Shawinigan (Hon. Mr. Méthot); I consider hlm.
a very good friend. I will always remember
the many political campaigns we carried out
together; and as you can see, we have
managed ta survive.
(Text):
Honourable senators, it appeared ta me
that I detected a particular note of pride
in Senator Méthot's voice, a significant smile
on his lips, and a twinle in his eye, when
hie congratulated the Government for taking
an interest in the construction of a railway
in the Gaspé peninsula, from Matane ta
Ste. Anne des Monts. As far back as 1923
the late Monsieur Ross pleaded with Sir
Henry Tharnton for better transportation
facîlities in the Gaspé peninsula. He ended
his remarks by saying:
The fate of Gaspé is in your hands.
That sentence became a slogan in Gaspé.
In 1932 the then Premier of Quebec, Honourable L. A. Taschereau, repeated this slogan
in one of his speeches. In 1944 articles in
the newspapers Le Soleil of Quebec, La Tribune of Sherbrooke, and Le Nouvelliste of
Trois Rivières recommended this project, and
their recommendations were ably supported
by La Chambre de Commerce of Matane
and Gaspé.
In the 1950 Hansard of the other place,
at page 1690, Monsieur Langlois, M.P., supported by Monsieur Philias Côté, M.P., bath
Liberal members, asked Monsieur Lionel
Chevrier, the then Minister of Transport,

SENATE
to give serious consideration to their request
for railway communications in that area of
Gaspé.
The late Mr. Gordon Graydon, Conservative M.P., said at one point:
You will have to put the Conservative
party in power to get that.
-meaning of course the railway from Matane
to Ste. Anne des Monts.
Well, the Conservative party is in power,
and Gordon Graydon's prophecy will now
come true. After years of disappointments the
citizens of the Gaspé peninsula must be
elated, for they know what it will mean for
their industries and for the future development of that wonderful corner of our province
of Quebec.
As to the seconder of the Speech from the
Throne, the Honourable Senator Hollett, it is
obvious that he is no novice in parliamentary
debates, and will be a great acquisition and a
tower of strength to our small group of Conservative senators; and Newfoundland will
have a strong and influential voice to plead
her cause in parliamentary circles.
I was particularly interested to hear the
honourable senator from Burin (Hon. Mr.
Hollett) mention that a large percentage of
the people of Newfoundland depend entirely
upon the fishing industry and the sea. While
he was speaking my mind went back to Canada's participation in the Law of the Sea Conference at Geneva, which met at the same
time as the United Nations Status of Women
Commission on which I had the honour to represent Canada. The Honourable George Drew
was chairman of the Canadian delegation to
that conference, and he advanced arguments
and proposed resolutions for the adoption by
international convention of a territorial sea
of six miles and a further six-mile area. Canada's delegation further proposed that countries which have territorial fishing rights between the three and the six-mile limits would
retain these rights for ten years. Since 1957
Canada bas gone on record in an endeavour
to have this international convention adopted,
and Canada's resolution at the last conference
was defeated by only a one-half vote. The
Canadian delegation to the Law of the Sea
Conference will continue to work for this
international agreement which will mean so
much to our Canadian fishermen.
Honourable senators, I admit I was somewhat hesitant about taking part in this debate on the address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne, for it has been said that
middle age is that perplexing time of life
when we hear within us two voices calling
out-the lazy laisser-faire voice telling us:

"Why bother?", and the lively, more aggressive one with the challenge: "Why not?" However, I decided to heed the "Why not?" voice
because my sense of fair play and justice
compels me to participate in this debate, and
to sound a note of warning. I hope, honourable senators, to get across some beliefs which
I hold dearly as a result of friendly conversations and impressions gleaned from delegates of many countries during my four year's
dip into the international pool of the United
Nations.
It is true that every generation has its own
problems, but no generation has faced the
extent and rapidity of change which results
from the challenges of the world today. Our
very survival requires that the countries of
the world must learn to live together in peace
-"learn" is the key word. Is it not a fact that
mutual respect, understanding and sympathy
are qualities that are frequently destroyed by
unjust criticism? And, with our world becoming, in a sense, smaller and smaller, is it
not obvious that all these nebulous statements
made by Canadian politicians and others, detri.mental to Canada's position in world affairs,
cculd react very unfavourably?
Canada is rapidly facing new and heavy responsibilities in the diplomatic circles of the
world. 'It is certain that in the future these
responsibilities will further increase rather
than decrease. Present world conditions are
enough to shake us out of our complacency,
and all Canadians cannot but be concerned
about international affairs.
Canadians are part of the flow of history
and cannot remain indifferent. We do not
live in Utopia, and hence Canada's position
in world affairs must be built upon a solid
foundation. Great hurdles have to be overcome, and respect for the democratic ideals
we believe in must be upheld at the international level by all political parties in Canada.
For, as prosperous and privileged as this
country may be, there are clouds on our
horizon. We must be alert to the fact that
there are communistic forces within our midst
willing and ready to turn these criticisms,
and any state of confusion, to their own advantage.
What will Canada's destiny be? The future
of Canada staggers the imagination and its
development is a challenge which demands
vision, courage and wisdom. But, much will
depend upon the loyalty and co-operation between the leaders of political parties during
these difficult years on issues which should be
considered above party politics, and particularly at this crucial time of psychological war
between two ideologies-democracy versus
communism.

bridge of understanding" between East and
West. This opinion has been voiced many
times during the last few years, and I am sure
that the honourable senators who have served
on Canadian delegations to the General
Assembly or on United Nations commissions
share this opinion, and that the chief hope
for the success of the United Nations lies in
the influence of the middle powers. For this
very reason there is a serious obligation on
Canada to assist and establish good relations
with these new African and Asian countries.
If we can prove to these countries that we
deserve their friendship, they may help the
great powers of the West to come to the right
decision, to resist the dictators wherever they
may be, and to stand for and maintain free
institutions. However, many individuals, even
in Canada, in a frantic peace-at-any-price
type of reasoning that shows little or no
understanding of what the communists are
striving for, would have the Western powers
surrender even honour in order to pacify the
Russians.
When we talk to delegates from these new
countries we are filled with pride in hearing
their appreciation of Canada and of our
Prime Minister's magnificent efforts to
strengthen and support this great world
forum, the United Nations. What Canadian
could be so biased as not to admit that Mr.
Diefenbaker was the first Western spokesman
to address the General Assembly following
Mr. Khrushchev's sledge-hammer onslaught
of words aimed at destroying the United
Nations secretariat and all that is effective in
that organization. In that tense and dramatic
atmosphere our Prime Minister delivered a
speech constructive, straightforward and
powerful, without being inflammatory. Mr.
Diefenbaker, aware of the needs and developments in the African continent, set the mood
which was needed at that crucial hour. It
was the all-time greatest demonstration of
Canadian leadership in world affairs.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Quart: Thank you. In just a
moment, in order to prove my point, I propose to quote from some newspapers that are
not always favourable to the Conservative
party.
Our country's Prime Minister was acclaimed
as an articulate, courageous and fearless
champion of the free world, by newspaper
writers, radio and TV commentators, as well
as by international statesmen from all over
the world.
And now may I quote just a few excerpts
from newspapers to further prove my point.
From the Sherbrooke daily Record, September
27, 1960:

Canadian diplomacy took on new
prestige yesterday when Prime Minister
John Diefenbaker addressed the United
Nations General Assembly.
From the Newmarket Era and Express of
September 29, 1960:
Not since the United Nations was
formed years ago have there been many
more stimulating speeches than that by
our own Prime Minister this morning.
From the Regina Leader-Post:
Canada's Prime Minister did himself
and his nation proud in his address to
the United Nations General Assembly.
From the daily Gleaner of Fredericton, New
Brunswick, of September 27, 1960:
Prime Minister Diefenbaker's speech in
the United Nations yesterday rose to the
heights of oratory and statesmanship.
From Le Devoir, Montreal:
Mr. Diefenbaker made a solid contribution to the United Nations.
From the Windsor daily Star of September
27, 1960:
Canadians can be proud of Mr.
Diefenbaker's speech and the effect it
had on the world assembly.
From Clyde Blackburn, in Toronto Telegram, of October 1, 1960:
Perhaps no Canadian Prime Minister
has ever spoken so freely about such an
important and delicate matter as did Mr.
Diefenbaker when he took Mr. Khrushchev apart.
Canadian prestige has never been higher.
I quote Patrick Nicholson, writing from the
United Nations in New York during the last
session:
I find that Canada's prestige, on this,
the world's diplomatic stage, stands
higher today than ever before. And
Canada's performance on this stage is
deservedly winning louder applause from
more foreign nations than ever before.
Further evidence of great leadership during
the last few years has been given by our
own Secretary of State for External Affairs,
the Honourable Howard Green. His patient,
calm but skilful manner of negotiating on
many almost hopeless issues won for him an
enviable position at the United Nations, for
together with the members of the Canadian
delegation he has on many occasions won support for Canadian policy and resolutions.
The present session of the General Assembly opened on September 19, the most critical
time since the United Nations was formed in
1945. Many observers expressed pessimism

FEBRUARY 13, 1962
even about the prospects for world peace and
for the future of the United Nations. The
tragic death of its most effective adviser,
Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold, cast a
dark shadow on that great world organization,
and the situation and atmosphere at the
assembly could hardly have been gloomier.
Here let us pause and look back to 1945
when Canada was one of the 51 nations which
met at San Francisco and helped charter the
United Nations as a living spirit of voluntary
co-operation and good will in a shaken world,
badly scarred from two world wars.
Our Prime Minister the Right Honourable
John Diefenbaker, the Right Honourable Louis
St. Laurent, and the late Right Honourable
Mackenzie King were members of that Canadian delegation that signed the official charter.
Since the birth of this organization, the
world has witnessed many changes. The
world's population has steadily increased, and
continues to grow at an unprecedented rate.
Colonial and dependent peoples, such as on
the continents of Africa and Asia, have
brought new nations into being and have
assumed a very significant role in world
affairs.
In 1945 the Western powers stood at the
helm, but today it is a very different story51 nations then, 104 today.
Since 1945 technological advances have
further reduced the gaps of time and distance between countries. Science has enlisted
the atom, and radioactivity has become a new
tool for research; and now man reaches out
to the unexplored dimension of outer space,
and it seems but a question of time before a
man, or maybe a woman for that matter, will
reach the moon. Who knows, maybe the next
generation, or perhaps ours, will be spending
its increased old age pensions sent out on
bilingual cheques-thanks to a good Government-or again, maybe some honourable senators will be spending some sort of Senate
pension on the moon, on Mars or some other
planet.
So, while our feet are still planted on this
good old earth it seems appropriate to try,
by better understanding of each other's problems, to enjoy some of that peaceful coexistence the Russians are always talking about,
which promises Paradise on earth, but their
international ugliness and cold-war tactics
are actions in reverse.
This reminds me of a story. A Russian
peasant who visited a zoo in Moscow for the
first time was surprised to find a big bear
in the same cage with a tiny white lamb.
"What's that?" the peasant asked. "That", said
the Russian guide boastfully, "explains Russian peaceful coexistence". The peasant still
looked puzzled. "Of course", added the guide
confidentially, "we have to put a new lamb
in the cage every morning."
26211-3-IOJ

At this session of the General Assembly the sentiment about colonial issues and
racial discrimination ran rampant; and the
attitude and influence of the newly-emerged
African states, now the largest single group
in the assembly, must be considered as an
unpredictable factor.
Through all these difficult days Mr. Green
was a tower of strength, and was ably supported by our own Senator Brooks, as vicechairman, and as well by other members of
Canada's delegation. Our delegation played a
leading role among the delegates from the
African countries to win their support, and
their reactions were prompt and favourable.
And these new nations deserve credit for their
evaluation of the problems confronting the
United Nations.
Here, may I bring to your attention a few
highlights of this sixteenth session of the
United Nations.
Early in the session, the Canadian delegation sought energetically to crystallize the
concern of the great majority of member
states about the potential hazards for the
people of the world which could result from
the increased radiation discharged into the
earth's environment, following the resumption
of atmospheric nuclear tests by the Soviet
Union. This was consistent with Canada's
role in this field. At this session, 24 other
states joined with Canada in submitting a
draft resolution which was adopted by a vote
of 74 in favour, none against, with 17 abstentions, designed, on the one hand, to focus the
attention of all nations on the consequences
of increased fallout and, on the other hand, to
put forward concrete proposals for accelerating research on the effects of radiation.
Then again, Canada joined with seven
other states in co-sponsoring a resolution
calling on the Soviet Union not to carry out
its intention to explode a 50-megaton bomb.
Although this resolution was supported by
87 delegations and opposed only by the Soviet
bloc and Cuba, the Soviet Union later went
ahead with two very large explosions in
deflance of the General Assembly appeal and
world opinion.
Also at this session Canada was able to
carry forward the proposal which Mr. Diefenbaker launched in 1960 to establish a "food
bank" for the world's suffering and starving
people. At this session Canada was joined by
seven other countries and secured approval in
the General Assembly for a world food
program which will run for an initial experimental period of three years. Canada has
offered up to $5 million worth in commodities
and cash. Surely, honourable senators, Canada's surplus of wheat would be difficult to
justify when more than l billion human

SENATE

beings suffer from lack of food. I quote Dr.
Sen, the Director General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization:
These starving people subsist on a diet
that would quickly reduce a westerner
to skin and bones.
These are just a few of Canada's humanitarian proposals at this session. I shall reserve further comments about Canada's important contribution this year, as I am sure
the honourable senator from Royal (Hon. Mr.
Brooks) upon his return will be rendering
an account of his stewardship as vice-chairman of the Canadian delegation.
In concluding, far be it for me to miss an
opportunity to get a word in about women.
The women of Canada, and of our Conservative party in particular, are most fortunate in
having a Prime Minister who is conscious of
the role which women should play in the life
of Canada.
It is very easy for any Opposition group to
pay lip service and make promises to women,
if and when their party will be elected to
power. But Mr. Diefenbaker has demonstrated
in a tangible way his faith in women by the
numerous appointments he has made since his
Government has been in office. Apart from
appointing the first woman to Cabinet rank,
the Honourable Ellen Fairclough, he has appointed a woman ambassador for Canada,
Miss Meagher, two women senators, my deskmate and honourable colleague, Senator
Irvine, and myself. That is not a bad batting
average since 1957. We have four women
members of Parliament, one of whom, as I
have said, is a Cabinet minister.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): And one
is a Liberal.
Hon. Mrs. Quart: Is that a question?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: One is a Liberal.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): May I
draw to the honourable senator's attention that
one of the lady members of Parliament is a
Liberal?
Hon. Mrs. Quart: I correct myself by saying
that one of the four Conservative members is
a Cabinet minister.
I am sure some honourable senators of
the distaff element of the Senate will agree
that for years the national organizations have
presented briefs to the Government for the
appointment of a woman to the Parole Board.
The first woman to the Parole Board, Miss
Lynch, has been appointed. I could go on
and on, for today more women are members
of commissions and boards, and hold top
administrative positions than ever before.
Thank you, honourable senators, for your

kind attention.
Hon. A. B. Baird: Honourable senators-

Hon. Mr. White: Honourable senators, it was
arranged between the Whip on the other side
and myself that the senator from St. John's
East (Hon. Mr. Higgins) would, when the
senator from Victoria (Hon. Mrs. Quart)
flnished her address, adjourn the debate, and
I have had no information of any change in
that arrangement.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I under-

stand that the honourable senator from St.
John's East intends to make only a short
speech.
Hon. Mr. White: If he is to deliver only a
short speech, I have no objection.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: I have no objection to
deferring my remarks until tomorrow.
Hon. A. B. Baird: Honourable senators, I
wish to congratulate the mover (Hon. Mr.
Méthot) and the seconder (Hon. Mr. Hollett)
of the address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne for their very informative
speeches.
I extend to Senator Hollett a very warm
welcome to this chamber, and I congratulate
the Government which he supports for making such an able appointment.
Honourable senators, I should like to begin by directing your attention to one short
sentence from the Speech from the Throne.
It has been mentioned only briefly in this
chamber by other honourable senators, and
indeed, in itself perhaps it does not merit
undue attention. However, I choose it as symbolic of some very serious deficiencies in the
present Government's approach to its direction of this country's affairs. The statement
is this:
A measure relating to the Senate will
be placed before you.
Perhaps the honourable senator from Burin,
(Hon. Mr. Hollett) was voicing an informed
guess when he said,
Who knows, the measure spoken of in
the speech may have reference to our
indemnity and not at all to our demise.
But to me the important words in that sentence were "Who knows".
The honourable senator from Shawinigan
(Hon. Mr. Méthot) has already said quite
frankly,

I do not know what legislation relating
to the Senate will be brought forward
by the Government...
One is tempted to ask in the face of this
admitted lack of information, whether the
Government itself has exactly decided what
measures relating to the Senate proposes to
introduce. If something definite has been formulated, why was it not stated in so many

FEBRUARY 13, 1962
words? Can it be that members of the Government are still trying to reach a decision
acceptable to them ail on legislation regarding
this chamber? If so, judging by several recent
events, it would not be the first time such
a situation has arisen.
What do we see in this one sentence from
the speech? At the very least, concealment
certainly, vagueness to an almost ridiculous
degree. By inference there is indication of
indecision and of unwillingness to face issues which should be faced. Perhaps the
greatest problem in this country today with
its leadership, and with the great number
of those who are led, is the failure to face
issues.
There has been a great deal of grand talk
about minor improvements in the level of
employment which have recently been noted,
but there bas been no effective action to solve
the basic problem of a hard unemployment
core, a core which will remain until our economic progress is encouraged in farsighted
ways.
There has been rejoicing that our trade has
improved slightly, and some have attributed
this to the efforts of bands of Canadian trade
missionaries sent on safaris-they have also
been called circuses-around the world; but
there is no solid, effective move to solve the
long-range problems that the European Common Market and Britain's desire to join it,
and the willingness of the United States to
co-operate with it, are assuredly going to bring
Us.
There have been favourable comments about
our defence posture, which seem to be completely unrelated to the naked facts of today's
power-bloc world. It seems as if we have a
half-open window on this cold-war world;
it is not entirely closed to the idea of Canada
as a nuclear participant, nor open to a decision that we should be one. Meantime, the
international crisis deepens and we take a less
and less effective part in solving it.
In the fiscal sphere the Government has
revealed only further indecision, postponement and temporizing.
The year 1961 saw a considerable revival
of economic activity in this country, and it
continues into early 1962. But, already reliable press reports are telling us that the
level of economic activity in the United States
is expected to reach a peak in mid-1962, and
that continued expansion cannot be guaranteed after that time.
By trade, as well as geography, we are inevitably linked to what happens south of the
border, and it is most likely that what happens there will happen here, if we take most
past experiences as a good forecast.
The Speech from the Throne, however, contains nothing to make us believe that the

Government is facing issues of this magnitude.
Instead of dealing frankly with our industrial
employment problem, our trade problem, and
our economic development, and how these
problems might be solved, there is simply the
promise that more money will be spent.
Undoubtedly if one is to judge by the wording of the speech, the money will be spent
worthily. The aged will be assisted with more
ample funds, for example. No one could
argue with such noble motives.
But how is money for greater Government
welfare measures to be provided at this time?
The Canadian dollar is weakening to an
alarming degree on the world money markets.
The country's present level of economic activity is providing so many tax dollars, but
just so many and no more, and as industrial
activity slows, much fewer.
If welfare or other money-spending measures are carried out at this time without
adequate tax revenue to recoup their cost
the result can only be a further decline in
the internal and external purchasing power
of our dollar. I believe this fact needs real
emphasis. Not only will the internal purchasing power of the currency decline, increasing
the cost of living if an excessive amount of
money is put into circulation, but also, because of our precarious trade situation we
shall see a declining acceptance of the formerly hard Canadian dollar in foreign countries.
I would be presumptuous to say, no matter
who I may be, that Government policies today
have brought this country to the brink of
ruin. But I would be neglecting my duty as
a member of this chamber if I did not call attention to this general major issue of refusing to face facts.
We have on our hands major defence problems which have not been solved; major
problems in connection with unemployment
and economic development, which have not
been solved; major trade problems reaching
far into the future, for which no effective
solution has been suggested; and a considerable number of fiscal and monetary problems hinging on ail these.
The Speech from the Throne, honourable
senators, suggests no solution. It only presents
more problems, when one confronts it with the
basic facts of Canadian economic life.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Higgins, debate
adjourned.
FINANCE CHARGES (DISCLOSURE) BILL
MOTION

FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED

Hon. David A. Croll moved the second
reading of Bill S-2, to make provision for
the disclosure of information in respect of
finance charges.

SENATE
He said: Honourable senators, this is the
third time that I have moved second reading
of a bill similarly entitled. On the first occasion the bill received second reading and
was before the Banking and Commerce Committee when prorogation supervened. On the
next occasion the motion for second reading
was defeated in this chamber by the comparatively narrow-margin vote of 26 to 35.
The present bill, though similarly entitled,
has been considerably revised, renovated
and delimited in the light of the excellent
debates which took place in this house on
two previous occasions. Some honourable
members thought that the bill was all tooembracing in its scope and too simple in
its form to be entirely practical.
It was my own belief, and I perhaps was
somewhat naïve, that the bill did require
modification and refinement, but that the bill
could have been worked out in committee.
However, a good many senators disagreed
and felt that some modification and refinement should be made before and not after
the bill went to committee.
The sole purpose of the bill is to require
every person who carries on the business of
extending consumer credit to disclose in
writing to the consumer of such credit the
total cost thereof, expressed both as a lump
sum and in terms of simple annual interest.
The bill is restricted to the field of consumer credit and has no application to cash
loans, mortgages on real estate, etc.
Furthermore, no criminal liability would
fiow from non-compliance with the bill, but
in the face of non-disclosure, a credit financier
would be unable to recover or retain any
finance charges whatsoever on any unpaid
balance in respect of which he has extended
credit.
Frankly, I sought advice from many quarters about this bill, but more particularly
from the Consumers' Association of Canada,
the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, the
Canadian Congress of Labour, the Canadian
Welfare Council, credit unions, co-operatives,
and the Canadian Catholic Conference, as
well as others. But I wish to make it very
clear that this bill is my responsibility and
mine alone.
I think I have done some homework on
this bill, refining and restricting its application in the light of advice which I have
sought and received, while retaining the
underlying principles intact. I repeat, that
in so doing I have regard for the attitude
taken by the honourable senators who participated in previous debates.
If people were asked by a bank to pay 20
or 30 per cent on their borrowings they
would immediately cry "robber" and the
incident would be blown up to the national

scandal it would be. Yet, even now, the same
people are paying that and more on the
purchase of used cars, refrigerators, TV sets
and other consumer goods too numerous to
mention-although I shall mention some
before I complete what I have to say.
Some of the credit financiers, as defined by
the bill, do not like the use of the word
"interest": they speak of "finance charges",
and "service charges", and sometimes they
are even driven to speak of "legal charges".
Yet all of these are the cost of borrowing
money.
When we ask ourselves, and I am sure that
we often do, why people enter into such
contracts, the answer just does not come
easily. Yet we appreciate how easy it is to
say, "Charge it". It is so easy to sign a piece
of paper and walk away with the merchandise; it is so easy to avoid finding out what
the finance charges are, not immediately having to face up to them. Sometimes it is difficult to obtain the right answer.
Honourable senators, I repeat, the purpose
of the bill is to require the lenders and
vendors to tell the truth about interest rates
and finance charges. In too many instances
the borrower is deceived into paying a higher
cost for credit than he has been led to expect.
The consumer has every right to know what
he is getting into, and if he does not know
or care enough to protect himself it is our
duty to do something to protect him.
This bill does not attempt to control consumer credit or interest: it will protect the
innocent and unsuspecting. In this age of the
credit card mentality the consumer is being
sliced up like a piece of cheese, and he hardly
realizes it.
Honourable senators, I have said that this
bill has been somewhat changed. In the first
place I have limited it to consumer credit.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): What does
that mean?
Hon. Mr. Croll: I shall explain that in a
moment.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): It is not
in the interpretation clause.
Hon. Mr. Croll: It is.
As I was saying, I have limited the application of the bill to consumer credit, extended
to what the act defines as a "credit financier".
Without wishing to become too technical during the general debate, perhaps it would be
helpful at this time were I to read the definition, which is as follows:
(a) "credit financier" means any person who in the ordinary course of his
business, whether operated separately or
in conjunction with some other business,
enters into a transaction with another

FEBRUARY 13, 1962
person arising out of a sale or agreement
for the sale of personal property, or the
provision or agreement for the provision
of services, to such other person, either
for present or future delivery or performance, whereby the whole or part of
the price or remuneration therefor is to
become payable to such person after the
transaction is complete;
While I feel that the principle might well
go further than is provided for in this bill,
in my view the bill does constitute the first
important step towards the protection and
relief of consumer credit. The need for this
protection and relief arises partly from consumers' own ignorance and, perhaps, even
lack of concern; partly from the confusing
and misleading form in which credit terms
are explained; and partly from the failure,
in particular, of the credit financier to provide essential information to the unfortunate
consumer as to what he must pay for receiving the credit.
This bill will also ensure the provision
of common, compulsory and all-inclusive
standards whereby consumers of credit may
fairly compare the costs of credit as charged
by credit financiers of various kinds.
In this chamber we have recently seen
the solicitude with which the problems of
the producers are viewed by governments.
On the other hand, the consumer, and particularly the consumer of credit, is the forgotten man of contemporary politics. That is
very difficult to understand, but it is perhaps partly because consumers, being so numerous, are incapable of being able to put
up any kind of effective lobby in their own
interest. While we have other vocations and
avocations, nevertheless all Canadians are
consumers and, for that matter, the great
majority of Canadians are also consumers of
credit. Accordingly, legislation designed for
the protection and relief of consumers should
presumably be in the general interest of
Canada.
The Canadian consumer feels he is being
exploited, and he knows that there are
abuses in labelling and advertising credit
which today can be more adequately described as sophisticated huckstering. It is
not necessary to exaggerate in order to state
the case. We must stop pretending to one
another that everything is perfect. Everything
is not perfect; a lot needs to be done. We
must be realistic. A law such as I have proposed can help to get done what needs to
be done at this time. The veil of secrecy and
confusion which covers the entire field of
consumer credit must sooner or later be
lifted. The present bill reflects my feeling that
it should be sooner rather than later. I hope

that this house agrees with me and that we
will all be present at the unveiling.
Now, honourable senators, let us examine
some details. The Retail Merchants' Association has said that the legislation is unworkable, that it would entail too much work
to figure out the true interest rate on an
individual purchase because of the great
variety of retail prices and terms. It would entail some work. That association gives as an
example the case of a $20 battery on which
the carrying charge is $2. A man buys that
battery on Monday, and starts paying the following Friday, which is payday. He is paid
every two weeks, so he makes his four biweekly payments of $5 each, with a final payment of $2. Now he has repaid the $20, and
the $2 carrying charge. The Retail Merchants'
Association says that out of 25 replies to inquiries made in order to ascertain the interest
rate there were 25 different answers. That
may be true, but they would all be reasonably
close.
The facts are these: A man pays $2 carry.
ing charges for an item costing $20, and
he pays it in 60 days. Two dollars is 10
per cent of $20, so, he has paid 10 per cent
in 60 days. He has paid 10 per cent in
two months, which is 60 per cent annually.
Is it any wonder that they do not like
this bill?
Let me give honourable senators some
further support for my contention that the
need for this bill is overwhelming and urgent.
I have here a cutting from Maclean's magazine of December 3, 1960, in which the
writer says:
In a week of shopping in an assortment of Toronto stores, I found out how
confusing credit charges can be.
In the Chesterfield Shop, near Yonge
and College, I looked at a chesterfield
and chair on sale for $349.99-let's say
$350. A salesman told me I could have
it for $35 down and 24 monthly payments of $16.50. After some rapid calculation, I pointed out that this was a total
of $431-that I would be paying $81
interest. This interest, on my unpaid
balance of $315, was 25j% for two years.
Oh, no the salesman said, consulting a
finance company chart, the interest was
only 23%. How come? I said. That's what
it says, he said, looking again at the
chart. I reasoned that the extra charge
was some sort of insurance, or that the
finance company computed its interest
on the whole price of the chesterfield
and chair, and left.
At Simpson's, I priced a bedroom set
at $475. With 10% down and two years
of monthly payments, I would pay 15%
of my unpaid balance in interest. But

SENATE
the surprising thing was, no one mentioned interest. The 15% was described
only as a service charge.
At S & B Appliances on Yonge
Street, the owner quoted a $29 down
payment and 24 payments of $10.96 for
a hi-fi set listed at $229. Credit here
would cost me 311% of my unpaid
balance.
That was the catch, I discovered. With
the exception of the major department
stores, retailers "sell" the customer's note
to finance companies-in Toronto, mostly
to the Gibraltar Discount Company, Seaboard Finance, or the Industrial Acceptance Corporation. Most salesmen
simply read the payments from a chart,
and don't understand themselves exactly
what you're paying for.
At the head offices of IAC, an officer
who asked to remain anonymous told
me his company doesn't charge "interest"
at all. They just collect a "service
charge" that covers their own overhead
and profit.
"The public only understands the
number of dollars they pay anyway,"
he said.

payment, is net made the company to whom
the note is transferred has the right to sue
upon it?

I realize that many honourable senators
have had their own personal experience, but
these surveys were made by responsible
people and they appeared in the press without any denials being made.

Mr. Berton goes on:
The Operative price instalment payments over various periods in a borrowing range that varied between $220 and
$320. In only two instances out of more
than 40 did we find a rate that was less
than 20 per cent; A Moffat washer, of
which $289.95 was financed over six
months at Danforth Radio and a Maytag
washer financed over 12 months at Toronto Washing Machine. Both rates were
about 19.5 per cent. Both these companies
were at the low end of the scale with
rates averaging around 20 per cent.
At the high end of the scale we found

Hon. Mr. Croll: What you are saying is
that it comes into the hands of a third party.
I have made provision to cover that, in that
the Governor in Council may make regulations in the light of what is required to be
done, so that if it is passed on to a third
party it will be taken with notice. There can
be no difficulty in that respect.
I should like to give you some more instances, honourable senators, because these
are crucial. I did not personally dig them
up, but I have them here and I think that
honourable senators should be made aware
of them. I read next from the issue of the
Toronto Daily Star of January 9. These instances were collected by a very distinguished
and famous columnist whose name would not
be unfamiliar to you, namely, Pierre Berton:

Honourable senators, I have placed on
record some examples that have already been
published for all to see. It is my own view,
and I have said it before, that I have never
been able to envisage any material improvement over the political philosophy that the
object of government is to promote the
greatest good of the greatest number. In my
view, the present bill will do just that, and
it is my hope that it will commend itself to
a majority of Canadians and to the members
of the Senate.
I have here a cutting from the Winnipeg
Free Press of February 9 and one from the
Peterborough Examiner of February 5. I
would like first to read a short quotation from
the article appearing in the Winnipeg Free
Press, as follows:
Senator Croll now has on the Senate
Order Paper another bill with the same
objective, but in simpler terms. Where
the senator's previous bills would have
required all extenders of consumer credit,
loan companies and mortgage holders, etc.,
to reveal interest charges, the present bill
covers only credit offered on the purchase
of consumer goods. The bill, if passed,
would compel every person who carries
on the business of extending consumer
credit to disclose in writing to the consumer the cost of the credit, expressed
both in dollars and cents and in terms of
simple annual interest.
Some merchants and their associations
have expressed opposition to this idea.
One cannot but wonder why.
Most consumers, when they buy goods
on time, have but the vaguest idea of what
they are paying in credit charges, either
in dollars or in terms of interest. A
Toronto columnist recently investigated a
number of stores in that city and found
that in nearly every case the salespeople
concerned had no idea of the interest rate
or of the cost of credit.
Legislation such as that proposed by
Senator Croll would impose no penalty
on honest merchants. The consumer

would know what he was being charged
and would be free to act accordingly.
There is no suggestion that interest
rates be controlled. The eminent good
sense of this proposal makes it hard
indeed for the ordinary person to understand why so many merchants oppose it.
The editorial in the Peterborough Examiner is written in the same tenor and gives
expression to similar views. A member of
this house, who has long been interested in
the Examiner, supported this legislation the
last time it came before the Senate and he
may have something to say about this bill.
Honourable senators, this bill does not
cover cash loans, banking transactions, mortgages or real estate transactions. They are
dealt with federally by the Bank Act, the
Loan Companies Act, and the Small Loans
Act, and it is at least arguable that should
provision for disclosure be considered desirable in those fields, the specific acts themselves should be amended accordingly. At
any rate, the present bill deals exclusively
with the extension of credit in respect of
any unpaid balance arising out of any agreement for the sale of goods or for the provision of services. I need hardly remind this
bouse that consumer credit constitutes a very
considerable segment of our economy and
that it is not regulated federally.
I mentioned earlier that the main principles
of the former bills are incorporated in the
present one. They are:
(1) That the consumer of credit is entitled
to be informed of the total cost of the credit
being extended to him and also to be informed
of what this means in terms of simple annual interest;
(2) That the total cost of the credit, if
the legislation is to be at all effective or meaningful, must include all the charges therefor
whatever they may be called.
This latter principle is, of course, already
contained and implemented in the Small
Loans Act in respect to case loans and has
been accepted for a great many years.
Honourable senators, there is a good deal
more I could say about this legislation. However, I will have a further opportunity to do
so at the conclusion of this debate. My hope
is that in the form of the new bill I have,
while retaining the basic principles above
enunciated, eliminated most if not all of the
points in respect of which the earlier bills
were criticized. I invite honourable members
to study the bill, to talk about it to their
friends and constituents, and the people involved, and see what they have to say about
the need for some such legislation as this.
I shall of course, be looking forward to hearing the views of honourable senators

PRIVATE BILLS
THE MUTUAL LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY OF
CANADA-SECOND READING

Hon. L. P. Beaubien moved the second
reading of Bill S-3, respecting The Mutual
Life Assurance Company of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, The Mutual
Life Assurance Company of Canada is requesting that we pass this legislation in order
that it will be entitled to use a French version of its name. About one-sixth of the
company's business is done in the province
of Quebec, and in dealing with French-speaking people it carries on its transactions, prints
its policies and other material in the French
language. The company's agents have said
that it would be helpful to then if the company were allowed to use a French version
for its name.
In asking that it be allowed to use a French
version, the company has suggested that it
be permitted to use the name La Mutual Life,
compagnie d'assurance du Canada. In asking
for this name, which contains the English
words "Mutual Lifte", the company feels first
that as Mutual Life is a very well known
name throughout Canada, the retaining of
those two words would help them in their
business. Also, in the province of Quebec
there are six or seven companies doing business whose names incorporate the French
word "mutuelle", and this company did not
want to use the French word in its case.
Honourable senators, The Mutual Life
Assurance Company of Canada was incorporated as an Ontario company in 1868, and
ten years later was incorporated as a dominion company. The charter that was granted
to it in 1878 was further amended, and its
powers were enlarged by five other acts, the
acts of 1889, 1894, 1900, 1903 and 1925. In the
year 1900 it also changed its name from the
Ontario Mutual to the Mutual Life Assurance
Company of Canada. The Mutual Life has
since its inception been a mutual company,
and was the first mutual company in Canada.
Honourable senators, The Mutual Life is
asking for the passage of this bill because
it feels that a French version of its name
will make it easier for people in the province
of Quebec who speak French to do business
with the company. I therefore strongly recommend the adoption of the addition of the
French name for consideration.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

WESTMOUNT LIFE INSURANCE COMPANYSECOND READING

Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved the second
reading of Bill S-4, to incorporate Westmount
Life Insurance Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
bill to incorporate a new life insurance company under the name of Westmount Life
Insurance Company, with its head office in
that city, which is in the province of Quebec,
and with the ordinary powers which this
Parliament is accustomed to confer upon
companies carrying on the business of life
insurance. You may ask, of course, why a
new life insurance company should be required, as it may be considered that there
are already sufficient companies carrying on
in that field of business. In that connection,
I have been furnished with some rather
remarkable statistics as to the growth of life
insurance in this country during the period
1950-1960.
During that period of ten years, the life
insurance in force in this country has increased by 184 per cent. In 1950 there was
$15.7 billion of life insurance in force in
Canada, and by the end of 1960 this figure
had risen to $44.6 billion. So honourable
senators will see that there has been a very
large increase, and that would seem to indicate that there is room for another company carrying on this class of business.
The principal promoters of the bill are
the two men whose names appear as the
two first applicants for incorporation in
the bill itself, Messrs. Dickstein and Dennis.
They are residents of Westmount, comparatively young men, and have up till now
carried on an exceedingly successful business
as life insurance agents. There is to be an
American interest in this company if it is
incorporated, in the shape of the very well
known New York banking firm, Kidder, Peabody and Company, who apparently are
great experts in the insurance business;
but I am instructed that the control of
the company will at all times be Canadian.
As honourable senators will see from section
5 of the bill, it is proposed to start with a
paid up capital of $500,000 and with a surplus
of an additional $500,000, so that the company will commence its operations with $1
million. That will be represented by a majority
shareholding in the shares held by the Canadian promoters, and the minority holding will

SENATE
be that of Kidder, Peabody and Company. I
am informed that it is intended at all times
to maintain Canadian control of the company
in that manner.
I am advised that at all stages in connection
with the preparation and presentation of this
bill the promoters have been in closest touch
with the Superintendent of Insurance, and
that he has no objection at all to the bill.
If the bill receives second reading, I would
ask that it be referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, at which
the promoters can be heard, and at which
also, as is customary, honourable senators will
want to hear the Superintendent of Insurance,
whose views, as honourable senators know,
always carry great weight with that committee in insurance matters generally.

I notice by the Globe and Mail of today
that it is reported to the same effect. I quote,
from that paper:
Personally, I cannot sympathize with,
or understand, the philosophy of those
who, even for political reasons, would
degrade Canada at the United Nations
before the very eyes of the world.
'Now, seeing that that bas been publicized,
and a denial by the honourable senator appears in Hansard, I think it is up to her to
make it clear that she did make that statement, but that she did not mean it. In that
way it will be cleared up, and the press will
not be carrying comments that the statement made here referred to statements made
at the United Nations, which was the direct
inference taken from the statement as reported.
Hon. Josie D. Quart: Honourable senators,
may I refer to what I said. If yesterday I did
by any chance use the words, "would make
statements which could degrade Canada at
the United Nations before the very eyes
of the world", maybe my phrasing was ambiguous, but nowhere in that paragraph do
I say that this statement was in fact made at
the United Nations. I will repeat what I said:
Personally, I cannot sympathize with,
or understand, the philosophy of those
who, even for political reasons, would
make statements which could degrade
Canada at the United Nations before the
very eyes of the world.
I am not a lawyer but I have had
sufficient education to believe that my statement is clear. The statements to which I had
reference were not made at the United Nations, but could be repeated at the United
Nations, or in the press, or in some other
media of communication which could reach
the United Nations and the ears of other delegates to that body.
Does that satisfy the honourable senator?
I do not believe I have anything to withdraw.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: Honourable senators, I
must say that statement does not satisfy me
because in making this point I submit that
the reading is quite clear and also that the
inference is definitely there, that it was said
at the United Nations. I think this matter
should be publicized, and I am suggesting
that the honourable senator make it clear in
the press that what she said was contrary to
what she wished to be understood.
Hon. Mrs. Quart: Honourable senators, although I have no retraction to make in this
connection, I would be very happy to have
additional publicity, because I could also ask
the press to look at some statements made in

the Hansard of the other place, page 168,
second column, the middle of the fourteenth
line.
Some Hon. Senators: Order, order.
Hon. Mrs. Quart: I seem to be out of order,
in the view of some honourable senators, but
I should like to have an opportunity to discuss this with the press.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I gather that what the
honourable senator was really referring to
was the sort of foolish statement made by
the Associate Minister of National Defence,
which he had to withdraw.
Hon. Mrs. Quart: No, I was not. With regard to that statement, I would say I do not
think anybody on this earth is infallible, and
some honourable senators in this house have
admitted they have been wrong at times.
Also I believe that before my speech was
made the Associate Minister of National
Defence had retracted his statement, and I
think that should satisfy everybody. So it
was not at all necessary for me to take that
into consideration.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Honourable senators, may I be permitted to comment
that this all adds up to the fact that an
explanation never explains why an explanation is necessary?
Hon. Mr. Higgins: I thought I was recognized first.
Hon. Gustave Monette: Honourable senators,
may I say this, that I am not highly cultured
in the English language, but as I heard the
statement made by the honourable senator
for Victoria yesterday she did not suggest
that the statement, or any statement of the
like, had been made at the United Nations. It
was said that statements were made which
are not approved of, and which could create
some unfavourable discussion at the United
Nations. That could be said of any statement
made in the street, in newspapers or by any
person, whether in authority or not, and which
could be printed in some newspapers and thus
reach the United Nations. Such a statement
might reach someone who might say that it
was made at the United Nations, and thereby
create a false impression in that body.
Honourable senators, we have here persons
who are authorities on the English language.
I would like to ascertain whether the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald, Brantford), or any other honourable senator would contend that the declaration made by the honourable lady senator
yesterday conveys, either directly or indirectly, the firm impression that the statement
referred to was made at the United Nations.

FEBRUARY 14, 1962
Were the interpretation of the honourable
senator from St. John's West (Hon. Mr. Pratt)
correct, any statement, whether made in New
Brunswick or elsewhere, which might be offensive to the United Nations and imperil
the co-operation of that body with our allies,
could be interpreted as having been made at
the United Nations, whenever an honourable
senator or member of the other house spoke
of such a declaration. Were we to accept this
interpretation, in a similar case the individual
mentioning or adopting the words of another
would have to declare, "I must emphasize that
I do not say this statement was made at the
United Nations." It seems to me that this is
going too far, and I should abide by declarations made here by honourable senators.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: Honourable senators, I
think I have the floor. We have a point here.
I have one question to ask. Suppose that a
newspaper-

who, even for political reasons, would
make statements which could degrade
Canada at the United Nations before the
very eyes of the world.
There is no evidence there to show that
the honourable senator said these statements were made at the United Nations. She
speaks of downgrading Canada at home, and
suggests that that degrades Canada at the
United Nations before the very eyes of the
world.
Hon. Mr. Prait: Honourable senators, all
I have to say is that this statement when
read by the public would not be considered
as carefully by the individual reader as it
would by the honourable senator, with his
legal experience. What is important is the
impression conveyed to the general public.
The average person reading this would infer
that that statement was made at the United
Nations.

fine spirit of co-operation and an earnest desire on the part of all members to produce the
very best type of legislation with respect to
our veterans and their dependants.
Politics has never, in all the years I have
been interested in veterans affairs, entered
into legislation affecting our veterans, and I,
for one, hope that it never will.
This act, honourable senators, provided veterans and certain of their dependants with
war service gratuities and re-establishment
credits, the amounts of which varied, based
on the length of service and dependent upon
whether the service was in this country or
outside the western hemisphere. The act also
covers veterans who served in Korea.
In order to give honourable senators a brief
summary of what has taken place under this
act, I shall mention that as of December 31,
1961 the gratuities paid the veterans of
World War II amounted to $470,056,000, and
the amount paid to veterans of the campaign
in Korea totalled $6,695,000. For the fiscal
year 1960-61 gratuities paid to veterans of
World War II amounted to $10,000, and to
veterans of the Korean war, $900. I am advised
by the officials of the department that a large
number of veterans have not yet, even at this
late date, applied for their gratuities. At the
present time the deadline for making such
application is September 30, 1962.
So far as re-establishment credits are concerned, up to December 31, 1961 there has
been paid to veterans of World War II the
sum of $309,369,000, and to the veterans of
the Korean war $3,704,000. At the present
time 65,475 World War II veterans still have
not received all of their re-establishment
credits, and the balance owing to these veterans amounts to $10,264,000. There are still
2,098 veterans of the Korean war who have
not received all of their re-establishment
credits, and the total amount due them is
$314,000.
I might state that I am further advised
by the department that every effort is made
to trace and locate veterans to whom there
is owing re-establishment credits or gratuities. The department also attempts to trace
them through the various branches of the
Royal Canadian Legion.
It is interesting to note that in the nine
months ended December 31, 1961 there were
12,478 World War II credits approved, for
a total payment of $1,367,000. During that
same period there were 834 credits approved
for veterans of the Korean war for a total
of $67,000.
I think it is clear from this, honourable
senators, that unless the time in which application may be made for these credits is
extended, a great many veterans will not

have a suitable opportunity of using their
credits wisely, or, indeed, to make any use
of them at all.
There is one amendment here which is
of a technical nature, which allows veterans
who have had their re-establishment credits
frozen because of applications for benefits
under the Veterans Land Act, to have one
year after an application has been withdrawn
or their qualification cancelled in which to
apply for the use of their credits. There are
also two administrative amendments which
relate to the payment of premiums on veterans' insurance.
I repeat, honourable senators, that the
main purpose of this bill is to extend to
October 31, 1968 the time in which veterans
may apply for gratuities and re-establishment credits. I commend this bill to all
honourable senators.
Hon. Mr. Power: May I ask the honourable
sponsor of this bill (Hon. Mr. White) to
repeat the number of men who have not
applied for war service gratuities? The
number he gave seems to be very high. Did
the honourable senator say it was 65,000?
Hon. Mr. White: I cannot tell the honourable senator the number of veterans who have
not applied for gratuities, but the number
of world war veterans who have all of their
credits, or part of their credits, still owing
is 12,478, and the amount owing is $1,367,000.
The number of veterans of the Korean war
who have still all or part of their re-establishment credit owing is 834.
Hon. Mr. Power: I thought the honourable
senator said there were 65,000 who had not
applied for war service gratuities.
Hon. Mr. While: No. I think I said that
the amount still owing the veterans of the
Korean war is $67,000.
Hon. Mr. Croll: From where did I get the
idea that there was $10 million-odd still outstanding?
Hon.

Mr.

Macdonald

(Brantford):

$10,264,000.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Yes. Did not the honourable senator say there was $10,264,000 still
outstanding? Am I wrong in that?
Hon. Mr. White: The amount still owing
the veterans of World War II is $10,264,000,
and I would point out that there are veterans
who have applied for only a part, be it large
or small. of their re-establishment credits.
Some have only received a few dollars. The
individual amounts vary a great deal.

FEBRUARY 14, 1962
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I thought the honourable senator said that the total number of
veterans entitled to all or part of this credit
is 65,000.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No, 12,000.
Hon. Mr. White: I have mis-stated those
figures. What I said originally was that at
the present time there are 65,475 World War
II veterans who have not received all or
part of their credit, and the balance owing
then is $10,264,000. In the last nine months
ending December 31, 1961 there were 12,478
World War II credits approved for a total
payment of $1,367,000. That gives honourable
senators some idea of the amount still owing.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, may I make the comment that it is not
only the honourable senator from Victoria
(Hon. Mrs. Quart) who is sometimes misunderstood when speaking in this chamber.
With the general purpose of this bill I am
in accord, namely, the purpose of extending
the time in which veterans can claim money
and credits which are due them. But, what
I do not understand, honourable senators, is
why there should be any limit at all. The
proposed new section 12 of the act reads:
(1) All or any part of the re-establishment credit may, on or before the 31st
day of October, 1968 be made availableIt may be claimed.
Honourable senators, this money does not
belong to the Government. These gratuities
were granted to these men and women who
served overseas, or who served under certain
conditions, and who fought for our country.
This money is theirs; it is not ours. It does
not belong to us now. When this act was
originally passed there was an appropriation
made by Parliament to provide for these payments to these men and women. Are we now
going to say to them: "It is yours, but you
cannot have it unless you apply for it before
the 31st day of October, 1968"? I do not think
that is the right principle. If this money
belongs to them-if it is rightfully theirsthen in my opinion they should get it whenever they want it, and we should not force
them to take it before a certain time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is the limit October
31, 1968?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Yes, 1968,
Mr. Speaker. There are six years left in
which to make a claim, but some of these
men and women may feel that this money
is safer with the Government. That may be
hard to understand, but some veterans may
feel that the money is safer with the Government and, if so, why should they not be
allowed to leave it with the Government?

I do not think it is within the power of
the Senate to amend this bill by striking out
that clause, but the bill could be passed so
that section 12 of the act would read:
All or any part of the re-establishment
credit may be made available to or for
any member of the forces eligible therefor when it is shown to the satisfaction
of the Minister that such credit is to be
used for...
No date need be mentioned.
To amend this bill in that way might be
beyond the powers of the Senate, but I would
bring to the attention of the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) the fact that this money is not the
Government's money. It belongs to these
veterans and they should have the right to
obtain it whenever they want it.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: May I ask a question
based on the explanatory notes opposite page
1 of the bill? It says that the portion of subsection (1) of section 12 being amended at
present reads as follows:
12. (1) All or any part of the reestablishment credit may, within a period
of fifteen years from the 30th day of
September, 1947, or the date of his discharge, which ever is the later, be made
available to or for the memberDoes the legislation not limit to a period of
15 years the time in which a member of
the forces can apply for re-establishment
credit, and this amendment is now extending that time for a further period?
Hon. Mr. Croll: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: It was originally limited
to a 15-year period.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): That still
does not make it right.
Hon. Mr. White: What the honourable senator from Lumsden (Hon. Mr. Pearson) has
said is quite correct. The 15-year date set in
section 12 (1) will expire in September of
1962, and I understand the reason for extending the expiry date for another six years is
that it is the hope and expectation of the department that within that time it will be able
to trace all members of the forces who are
eligible for re-establishment credit and pay
the benefits to them.
I am sure no honourable senator would
think for one moment that any government,
no matter who it might be, would ever disqualify a veteran from receiving any benefit
to which he was entitled. If there are still

SENATE

credits on hand upon the expiration of this
six-year period I for one am perfectly satisfied that the government of the day will bring
in an amendment providing a further extension of this time limit. My honourable friend
the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) will recall that various
extensions were made to veterans' legislation
in the Veterans Affairs Committee of the
other house. For instance, in some cases the
marriage date was extended from time to time.
Hon. Mr. Power: And it should not have
been.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): It does
not make it right.
Hon. Mr. White: I am sure that if the necessity arises the expiry date will be further
extended.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators,
I am satisfied no government will ever do
anything to abolish these credits or in any way
infringe them. However, extending the expiry
date to 1968 seems to be a futility, for the
benefits will be available as long as there are
veterans alive to claim them.
But what troubles me, if I am correct in my
figures, is that 15 years after the setting up
of the re-establishment credit and gratuities we are told there are 65,000 lost souls
in this country, people whom we cannot locate.
I find this difficult to believe. We have this
money to give to veterans. We have their regimental numbers, and at least their former addresses and those of their relatives. We know
where they come from, but where have they
disappeared? We can assume that some have
left the country for the United States and
elsewhere, and others have died, but how
could we possibly have lost that number of
people in that length of time?
The honourable senator from HastingsFrontenac (Hon. Mr. White) says that we will
locate them in the next six years. That may
be, but why have we not found them up to
now? I wonder if they know this money is
coming to them. If somehow they knew the
money was coming to them they would be
making application for it because it is there
for the asking. I make no criticism of the
Department of Veterans Affairs, nor do I suggest that this bill go to committee. I am prepared to accept what the honourable senator
from Hastings-Frontenac has said, but something has to be done about this for the benefit
of veterans who have a considerable amount
of money still coming to them.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Could I
ask a couple of questions of the honourable
senator from Hastings-Frontenac (Hon. Mr.

White) so that be may answer later if he does
not have the information readily available.
Could he tell the house whether these gratuities are assets which would form part of the
estate of a veteran who might die without
drawing them and, secondly, whether or not
the executors of his estate, or his heirs, would
be able to claim the gratuities in the event
he should die without drawing such gratuities?
Hon. Mr. White: I will be glad to get the
information for the honourable senator.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Would a veteran living
outside this country be entitled to receive
these gratuities at any time?
Hon. Mr. White: As far as I know, he would
be so entitled.

I should like to point out to the honourable
senator from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr.
Croîl), in reference to something being done
about tracing these veterans, that in the nine
months ending December 1961, there were
12,478 credits dealt with, approved and paid
out. This shows that the department is making
some effort to catch up. I am further advised
by officials of the department that while the
figure of 65,475 appears to be large, many of
these veterans have received some part of
their re-establishment credit but, for reasons
best known to themselves, they have not up
to the present time wished to make further
application for the balance.
Hon. Mr. Power: Perhaps my memory is
not as good as it should be but I am under the
impression that with respect to war service
gratuities there can be no question but that
those gratuities belong to the men, and I
would believe that they would belong to their
estates.
Hon.
hear!

Mr.

Macdonald

(Braniford):

Hear,

Hon. Mr. Power: But with respect to reestablishment credits, that is another story
altogether. This was a project providing that
if an ex-soldier required certain assistance
to set himself up in a small business, to
establish a home, to purchase furniture or, in
other cases, to take advantage of provisions
under the Veterans Land Act, he was entitled
to a credit from the department. But I would
not think that under those circumstances his
estate would inherit the right to such credit,
because it would only belong to the ex-soldier
provided be fulfilled the conditions. Perhaps
that may account for the fact there is such
a large number who have not claimed their
credits under this legislation, although they
may have claimed their war service gratuities.
Some people may not have needed the credits
at all, not that they were of a wealthy class,

FEBRUARY 14, 1962
but there were some, certainly, who would not
need to go to the Government for assistance
to purchase furniture for their household, and
so on. Perhaps that may account for the very
large number who will never ask to be
granted these credits.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Honourable senators, recently I had occasion to write
to the Department of Veterans Affairs with
respect to a member of the armed forces
who had died and who had not received his
re-establishment credit. I agree with the
honourable senator from Gulf (Hon. Mr.
Power) that an estate, as a matter of right,
can claim gratuities, but my recollection is
that under certain circumstances the heirs
of the deceased can claim re-establishment
credits. The case which I had occasion to
write to the department about involved an
unmarried man whose parents, sisters or
brothers apparently could not claim the credit.
As I say, I am relying on memory but I think
if lie had been married and had left a wife
and/or children there is provision whereby
the re-establishment credits would be allowed
them.
Motion agreed to and bill read second
time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shal the bill be read the third
Uie?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Next sitting.
Hon. Mr. White: With leave of the Senate,
next sitting.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by Hon.
Mr. White, seconded by Hon. Mr. TurgeonHon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Before
the motion is put may I ask the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) whether there is likely to be royal assent today?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I am hoping that royal
assent will take place between now and tomorrow afternoon at 5.45-probably tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Well, it
occurred to me, honourable senators, that if
royal assent is not given today, probably the
honourable senator who introduced the bill
(Hon. Mr. White) could obtain the information which has been requested by several
honourable senators, and the bill could be
given third reading tomorrow. I do not want
to hold up the bill.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That would be agreeable. I am quite satisfied that royal assent will
not be given today.
Motion agreed to.

VETERANS INSURANCE ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND

READING

Hon. George S. White moved the second
reading of Bill C-37, to amend the Veterans
Insurance Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill, like
the preceding one, is simply for the purpose of
extending from September 30, 1962 to October 31, 1968, the time whereby veterans may
apply for contracts of insurance. This act,
which also forms part of the Veterans Charter, was passed in the session of 1945. Its
main purpose was to provide life insurance for
veterans who had a very low medical standard. Over the years it has proved of great
assistance to veterans of World War I who,
on account of war wounds, illness or other
disability from war service, were unable to
obtain insurance from an ordinary life insurance company The act also covers the veterans from Korea.
The total amount of insurance that a veteran can obtain under this act is $10,000, and
I am advised that premiums charged compare
very favourably with those of standard life
insurance companies. There is no cost to the
federal treasury, except administration costs.
On death, the proceeds of the policy up to
$2,000 are payable to the designated beneficiaries, and any balance owing under the
policy over and above $2,000 is paid over a
period of years under an annuity.
This act has been extended at various
times, and in view of the fairly large number
of applications now being received, which
run at about 125 a month, the Government
has decided that it would be beneficial to extend the benefit of this act to 1968.
Honourable senators may be interested in
knowing the number of policies in force, and
so on. At December 31, 196.1 there were in
force 30,848 policies for a total of $96,876,349.
Up to that date there had been 3,045 death
claims, and there had been paid $8,523,567.
It is rather interesting to note the method
by which a veteran pays the premiums:
36.2 per cent of the veterans have arranged
for payment of their premiums from reestablishment credits-that is why there are
some re-establishment credits on hand-34.7
per cent have arranged for payment from
their disability pension, and 26.4 pay the
premium in cash.
This extension will provide an opportunity
for veterans who have recently assumed
family responsibilities and obligations to
secure insurance protection, whose circumstances probably do not enable them to apply
before the expiry date in September 1962.
As I stated before, honourable senators, the

SENATE
sole purpose of this bill is to extend the
date for veterans to make application for
insurance to October 1968.
Motion agreed to and bill read second
time.
Hon. Mr. White moved that the bill be
placed on the Orders of the Day for third
reading at the next sitting.
Motion agreed to.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Méthot,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Hollett, for an Address
in reply thereto.
Hon. John G. Higgins: Honourable senators, at the outset I am going to avail myself
of this opportunity to congratulate my
revered friend, the Honourable the Leader of
the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine), on the high honour that has been
conferred on him, particularly because he
deserved it. What must be heartening to him
is the unanimity of approval shown by this
house. There is not the slightest doubt that
everyone here was delighted when the news
was received of his appointment to the Privy
Council.
Let me express the wish that the good
Lord will give him ad multos annos
length of days to enjoy the honour. And I
trust when his days are over, and he has
shuffled off this mortal coil, he will be
brought within the pearly gates and will be
led by Saint Peter, the fisherman, as a guide,
to the Elysian fields, where he will have
eternal opportunity of seeing lakes and babbling brooks full of trout and salmon. And
while I shall presume there will be no fishing allowed, yet he will be able to return at
times to regale his non-fishing friends of the
big whoppers he saw.
I must congratulate the mover (Hon. Mr.
Méthot) and the seconder (Hon. Mr. Hollett)
on their speeches on the motion on the address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne.
Senator Méthot is well known to us, and
from our experience of him we know he can
always give a first-class speech.
Senator Hollett is a newcomer, and though
born in a fishing settlement about 120 miles
from St. John's, he has been residing in that
city for some years. He was a Rhodes
scholar. He majored in mathematics at Mount
Allison University and took English at Oxford.
He was a Leader of the Opposition in the

Newfoundland Legislature for some time. I
think I am correct in saying that his speech
impressed all of us.
I do not like to speak of a gentleman when
he is not present, but I am going to do so,
because he will read what I say in Hansard
anyway, and if he has any objection to it he
can object when he does come back. On
Monday last the honourable senator from
St. John's West (Hon. Mr. Pratt) paid Senator
Hollett and myself a dubious compliment. He
said:
I need hardly comment, of course, that
I refer to the scholastic ability of their
speeches. Across-the-floor arguments on
present day public issues are, of course,
another matter.
What did he mean to say? To paraphrase the
words of Thomas Moore:
They are but as the wind
passing heedlessly over
And all of their arguments
nothing but words.
I see Senator Pratt has just returned to the
chamber, and I say to him, as one Newfoundlander to another-and we are very charitable
to one another-we shall accept what he said
as words of endearment.
The speech of the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) was worth while
hearing. It was amazing to see that tall form,
weathered by many storms of debate, raise
itself so athletically and pour forth such a
fluent and unfaltering flow of words without a note. According to his own estimate
he has passed, not only the scriptural period
of three score and ten, but the four score
mark. And there he was talking political
philosophy as easily as he did in the old days
when he was one of the leaders in the other
place.
It was equally amazing to watch the
honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris), with his big, broad frame
and wonderful silver mane, and to hear the
virile tongue uttering a speech for two and a
half hours with hardly a pause and without a
sign of weariness. Verily it may be said that
senators, like wine, improve with age.
When I hear irresponsible criticism of
the Senate I am reminded of what someone
said:
I divide the world into three classes.
The few who make things happen; the
many who watch things happen and the
majority who have no idea what is
happening.
I will say that things do happen here in
the Senate, but there are not too many
people interested enough to watch them
happen, and I have not the slightest doubt
that the vast majority of the people have no

FEBRUARY 14. 1962
idea what is happening here, and perhaps
because they have no idea that is why they
criticize.
I amn reminded of the littie flurry we had
last Monday in the passing of a bill. It started
with words and it ended with metaphorical
snowballs and stones. I arn glad that the
passing of the other bils was enshrouded
with peace and neutrallty.
Now, I have an antipathy of passing between stones on one side and snowbafls on
the other, whether metaphorical or real, for
the real stones hurt physically but the metaphorical stones hit you mentaily, and the
last stage is worse than the first.
Honourable senators, I would suggest that
when anyone is given a bil to sponsor he
should prepare hirnself to answer every
question that is put to him. in connection
with that bill. Af ter ail, the Senate is supposed to know before it refers a bil to
cornmittee what it is ail about, and it should
lçnow. I arn aware that sornetirnes when ful
information is not received the expert who is
advising the sponsor is the one who is usually responsible, because he is likely to say
there is no use worrying about that matter;
ail that wil corne out when the bill goes to
cornmittee.
I remember an occasion on which I had a
bill to produce. The expert saw me i rny
room, and he explained the bill and the
reason for it. I then asked him a couple
of questions and he said there was no need
to worry about this because that inforrnation
will be given when the bill is before the
comrnittee. I told him that that was not my
procedure. First of ail, I said, the bill rnay
not go to cornrittee because the Senate did
not get the information needed, and I want to
be in a position to give the Senate the information required. Secondly, I want to be able
to answer questions that the senators ask
rne and not appear stupid. Thirdly, as a
lawyer, these would be the first questions I
would ask if I were cross-examining anyone
on the bill; and, f ourthly, I arn the one to
decide what inforrnation I need. I got the
information, and when the bill came before
the Senate the first two questions I was asked
were the ones that I wanted him to answer.
I arn now going to touch on a subject
which was shortly deait with yesterday by
our lady senator from. Victoria (Hon. Mrs.
Quart) in a rnost interesting, effective and
provocative speech, and a very well-delivered one too. The subi ect is of great înterest
to me. Senator Quart was present at the Law
of the Sea Conference in Geneva when the
question of the twelve-mile lirait carne before
that body and was discussed.

A strong controversy has arisen over what
is known as the twelve-mile lirnit. The subject has often been discussed in Parliarnent,
in the press, and in many public bodies and
institutions. The terrn means the assertion by
any country ta the ownership of waters
around its coast within twelve miles o! its
coastline.
It has been a live issue for sorne tirne
among the Atlantic provinces and for rnany
years British Columbia has f elt its necessity.
A private mernber's bill to set this limiýt at
twelve miles was allowed to die in the other
place.
The principle that such a lirnit against
commercial fishing was reasonable was alrnost accepted last year, as Senator Quart
told us, when it carne up before the Law o!
the Sea Conference in Geneva, but was
defeated by one-haîf vote.
The reason given by its proponents is the
necessity for conservation. A country should
be allowed to have control to protect its
fisheries within a reasonable distance o! the
coastline, and it i5 contended that twelve
miles is such a reasonable distance. This
would give to natives and inhabitants of the
country whose shores are touched by the sea
the right to flsh within these waters. It would
prevent foreign ships coming in vast filmbers, or any numbers, into the waters and
thus depleting the fishery, or fishing in such
waters without caring as to the size or nurnber of fish caught or tearing Up the breeding
grounds by their draggers. For centuries,
large numbers of fishing vessels from France,
Italy, Spain and other European countries
have been coming to the Grand Banks of
Newfoundland, a vast plateau from 90 to
120 miles off the east coast o! Newfoundland,
and to the Green and other banks off the
south coast and sornewhat the same distance
from the south coast of Newfoundland.
In recent years Russia has joined in fishing on the Grand Banks, and their ships are
f ar more numerous than those from other
countries. No ships, except United States
ships, ever fished near Newfoundland until
recently. In the past two or three years
Russian vessels have been doing s0 just
outside the three-mile limit, and there is
clear evidence that they have corne at times
within the three-rnile lirnit. The Russians fish
with draggers, which. use nets dragged
between two vessels, scraping the bottom of
the sea and tearing Up the spawning beds.
Canada sets a himit for its own ships off
the Atlantic coast, preventing certain kinds
of' fishing within the twelve-rnile lirnit. But
that was nugatory. Foreign ships can fish
within that lirnit with irnpunity. This only
confers a disability on Canadian fishermen by
their own Governrnent, but not on others.

SENATE
If we are going to have the twelve-mile limit,
inshore fishing must be limited for all. Of
course Canada has been reluctant to try to
impose this twelve-mile limit on its own or,
as the term has been used, unilaterally. The
United States has no such limit, and many of
their ships have fished within twelve miles
of the Newfoundland coast for many years.
Canada of course does not want a rift with
her neighbour, the United States. I understand
that country is one that refused to vote for
the twelve-mile limit, and it was their action
that lost the motion for the twelve-mile limit
at Geneva.
I may say that the limit has been successfully enforced in at least one country. For instance, it is not so long ago that Iceland set
the limit to prevent English fishing vessels
from coming to within twelve miles of its
coast. So strong did Iceland assert the right,
arresting English ships, flaunting English
armed vessels, that, finally, English ships
ceased to fish there and apparently England
gave up the struggle quietly and let Iceland
carry out its own regulations regarding the
twelve-mile limit.
The matter has become serious, particularly
for Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Something
must be done to protect the fisheries and the
fishermen around the coast. Two choices are
open: To allow unlimited use of the fisheries
without regard to conservation; or, unilateral
action to decide a twelve-mile limit and preserve the fishing. The latter alternative will
have to be adopted some time or other. Of
course, if it is chosen, some strong steps
must be taken to see that the decree is enforced. How will this be done?
The Speaker in some House of Commons
once said, "It would be unreasonable not to
expect an occasional intrusion of politics in
this Assembly", and I must have my little
slight flutter of party politics now. It will not
be a very strong effort, I may say, but I
know that to say even the slightest word in
favour of the present Government is rank
heresy in the minds of some of the honourable senators opposite. To enforce the decree
of the twelve-mile limit a strong patrol of
the coast is necessary, and at last we learn
that a Canadian coastguard service is being
formed by the present Government.
The well-known newspaper writer, Mr.
Arthur Blakely, wrote:
To some, the most surprising thing
about Transport Minister Balcer's announcement of the formation of the Canadian Coastguard Service was that it
had been so long in coming. Others, however, were surprised that it had been made
at all.

For some decades, M.P.'s and other representatives of Canada's coastal areas
have been urging just such a move.
The U.S. Coastguard has a long and
distinguished history. In the United Kingdom, the coastguard tradition goes back
even further into history. The same is
true of France.
In the circumstances, it is scarcely surprising that Canadians living in the Maritime provinces and British Columbia, in
particular, should have reached the firm
conclusion long ago that the sooner
Canada had just such a service the better
it would be for their fishermen and others
who went to sea.
The Transport Department shared the
view that a Canadian service of this kind
was not only desirable but necessary. But
there was a strong feeling at the upper
levels that while this was so, the old
"coastguard" name and tradition should
be put resolutely to one side in favour
of a designation that could be described
as distinctively Canadian, deriving little
or nothing from the British, French or
American traditions.
We have all read at various times about
the great coastguard system in Britain, with
its wonderful tradition. In the olden days
when we were very young, did not our youthful minds absorb those wonderfully thrilling
stories of deeds of bravery and heroic rescues
by those who went out in stormy seas to
save some survivors from a vessel wrecked
on the rocks? And English tradition still survives. The United States has built up a great
coastguard system, one which has performed
meritorious service, particularly during the
war.
It is useless to make regulations regarding
the twelve-mile;limit or any matter concerning
the sea unless they can be enforced. We have
the police to look after our cities, towns,
villages and roads, for the protection of the
country and its citizens. Now it is time to
provide protection around the coastline. We
must have mobile police in the form of a
shipping patrol or coastguard system, and it
is good to learn that the present government
intends to provide such service.
Talking of this subject reminds us that
Canada may be divided into two parts-not
as Gaul was divided, into three parts-those
provinces which touch on the sea, and those
which do not. Although it may be claimed
that a part of the ocean touches Quebec, and
Quebec has a good sea fishery, yet the provinces on the east coast which are most intimately connected with the sea are Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island
and Newfoundland.

FEBRUARY 14, 182
Before Newfoundland entered Con federa..
tion in 19,49 they were regarded as «'The
Maritime provinces and Newfoundland." Up
to that time Newfoundland could flot be
referred to as a Maritime province, because
it was an independent country and flot a
part of Canada.
For generations Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island have been
cailed the Maritime provinces or, sometimes,
"The Maritimes". After Newfoundland entered Confederation in 1949 attempts were
made at different times to include it withln
that name-attempts not; by Newfoundlanders
but others who had spent a few years in
Newfoundland. Then it was suggested that
Newfoundland should be joined in the circle
by having a federation called "The Atlantic
Provinces". But let the Maritimes hold their
name, for they have a long and interesting
hlstory under that designation. Let us be
aflowed to retain our name because we
have a longer history, one that goes back
to the time before Canada was dlscovered
and populated.
The campaign to include Newfoundland
in the category of the Maritime provinces
was conducted with the intention of showing
that the four provinces on the Atlantic
seaboard have similar problems. After nine
years it seems to us Newfoundlanders that
we have by no means too much in common.
An editorial i one of the newspapers
published in St. John's has this to say:
To be fair, however, it must be said
that not too much of that propaganda
emanated from Newfoundland. But what
did originate here was a fiuim belief
among some groups that we should
refuse to accept that theory because of
practical considerations.
The moat practical was the thought
that Newfoundland was a special case.
They belleved that the Terms of Union
to the contrary notwithstanding, she
ought not to jeopardize any peculiar
aspects of her historical, geographical
or economic position by allowing herself to lose her distinctive colouring and
fade into the general background of
Atlantic grey.
That our problems are different from those
of the other provinces on the Atlantic seaboard is recognized by the second report of
the MacPherson. Royal Commission on Transportation, which lmplied that Newfoundland
is a special case. We have problems facing
us because we entered Confederation lateas I said, only in 1949-while the other
provinces on the Atlantic seaboard ail entered at the start of Confederation, or a
short while afterwards.
26211-3-11

I am flot going to enter into the details
of these problems, nor into a discussion that
the Terms of Confederation offered us were
inadequate. I said enough concerning that
when I spoke on the Newfoundland bill In
1957, and the Honourable Senator Pratt
explained our situation weil in his enlightening speech delivered last Monday.
Do not think I amn objecting to any alliance
with the Maritime provinces. Far from It.
The Maritimes are great provinces, and
Newfoundland may have many shortcomings. Newfoundland may flot be as up to
date as they are. I am not; as smug as the
gentleman who said:
The trouble with some people is that
they do flot want to admit their faults.
I would admit mine-if I had any.
We have our shortcomings. We have been a
struggling race. Throughout the years we have
had to surmnount aimost insurmoumtable obstacles. We were not allowed to put up permanent buildings until 1814. We have had a
speculative industry, the cod fishery,.which
for generations was our main industry and
concerned the majority of the people. When
the population of Newfoundland was 250,000,
or a littie more, there were over 30,000 people
engaged in the cod flshery. Today, with a
population of over 450,000, we have from
12,000 to 14,000 fishermen.
We did not have a railway until the 1890's.
Our first paper mill was established in 1910,
and the second, which is now the biggest ini
the world, was established in 1920. Our-revenue was neyer large enough to meet the
building of highways, local roads, public
buildings or bridges. It was not until the
beginning of the Second World War that we
started to enjoy prosperity. The American
bases were set up, and in doing so they spent
an enormous amnount of money in that province. The price of paper went soaring, and
that of fish became regulated, and it was not;
the speculative business it had been in the
past. We have a reasonable mileage of roads
now. Unfortunately we are cut off from the
mainland by the Strait of Cabot, which is 107
miles wide, and thus our freight rates are
higher than those of other provinces.
The Maritimes started to develop after Confederation. In fact, they started in 1763, after
the treaty of Paris, when land was given free
to the discharged soldiers and sailors, and
farms, towns and industries sprang up. Since
Confederation good roads have been established throughout the provinces. We came
into, Confederation in 1949, and immediately
took on a share of the costs of building Up
ail the provinces of Canada in the past.
More than once I have paid tribute to Halifax, one of the prettiest cities in Canada, with

SENATE
its old buildings and landmarks, most of which
were built more than 150 years ago. It speaks
well for the pride of the citizens of Halifax
that these have been preserved.
Newfoundland was independent for 450
years. We have had a long history, and mostly
a sad one. We were run by the adventurers
of the west country of England who regarded
the land as a fishing station to be used only
for fishing purposes. As a result, no permanent buildings, except those used for the
fisheries, were allowed, as I have already
mentioned, to be erected until the year 1814.
In the struggle between France and England for the possession of Canada we were, at
different periods, outside the region of the
struggle; but now and then the country was
invaded by the French and many settlers were
killed and settlements destroyed.
Throughout the Seven Years' War the
colony seems to have been peaceful, until the
end of 1761. After the defeat of the French
on the Plains of Abraham, France was anxious
for peace. To secure favourable terms, and
especially a share in the fishery, it was
desirable for the French to capture some
English possessions. The French intelligence
service informed the authorities of the defenceless plight of St. John's in Newfoundland, with its neglected military condition and
weakened garrison. While England was
spending millions of dollars on colonizing
Nova Scotia and defending it, St. John's was
left with less than a single company of soldiers, 63 in all, and all forts were in a bad
state of repair.
One historic event took place which should
be written up in the newspapers of today.
In September 1762 the last battle between
the French and English was fought in my
native city of St. John's.
Two hundred years ago, in June, 1762,
the French captured St. John's, and the
battle for its repossession was the last battle
between France and England for the possession of what was known as Canada. I am
sure this is surprising news to most Canadians, for they think, as those of the past
thought, that New France or French Canada
came to an end with the battle of the Plains
of Abraham in 1759 when Wolfe and Montcalm were killed. It was some years after
this battle before the British could feel that
the conquest was un fait accompli.
The Seven Years' War started in 1756 and
was ended by the Treaty of Paris in 1763,
four years after the battle of the Plains of
Abraham. It must not be forgotten that
Montreal remained in the hands of French
troops until 1760, a year after the battle
of the Plains of Abraham.
Early in the year 1762 Spain declared war
on England and, with another nation against

her, England had to get all the army she
could and keep the navy moving to protect
various places not only against the French
but also the Spaniards. With the intelligence
which had been given that Newfoundland
was practically unprotected, relying only
upon the British Navy for protection, France
saw its chance, and decided to capture the
country.
All other attacks on Newfoundland started
on this side of the world, either from Louisburg, Quebec, or Placentia where the French
had a stronghold for many years. This time
the expedition started in Europe. On July 8,
1762 a small fleet left Brest with a military
force of about 1,000 men and, going through
a dense fog, successfully eluded the British
Navy, and landed its troops at Bay Bulls, a
settlement 19 miles from St. John's, which
was burnt. The army marched overland to
St. John's, meeting with some resistance
from the inhabitants of St. John's near the
town, but the British garrison there surrendered on June 27. The French entrenched
themselves strongly on Signal Hill, a high
hill overlooking St. John's, and started to
repair the fort which was then in disrepair.
When the commander in charge of the
British in North America heard of the invasion he got together an army from the
garrisons of Louisbourg and Halifax, the command of which he gave to his brother, Colonel
William Amherst. This army of 1,500 men
was brought to Newfoundland in seven transports escorted by four men-of-war, the
flagship of which was commanded by the
famous navigator and cartographer, Captain
James Cook.
This force landed at Torbay, a fishing village seven miles from St. John's, and
marched to Quidi Vidi, one mile from St.
John's, which is near where the United States
built the large Pepperell air force base
during the Second World War. This was on
September 15, 1762. Two days later the fort
was stormed, and it surrendered on the 18th.
It is strange, honourable senators, that
there is in Canadian history hardly a mention of this important event. Anyone who
reads the little note about it would never
realize it marked an epoch in the history of
Canada.
It is heartening to know, honourable senators, that a health scheme is being promoted
throughout Canada. Athletics should be encouraged, but people should be taught to play
the game and not watch it. To have 30,000
people watch 30 men play a game of hockey
is no proof of a healthy race. It may be an
index of a shouting one. It is better to show
young and old that it is more worthwhile to
exercise either by running if you are young,
or by walking if you are old-by golf if you

FEBRUARY 14, 1962
are old, or by football and hockey if you are
young-rather than sitting down to see two
heavyweights commit mayhem and, particularly, when what is seen is an uneven fight
where one is battered almost to a pulp, as
happened in the recent Patterson-McNeeley
flght. That fight was really a reminder of the
bloody cireuses of ancient Rome at the beginning of the Christian era.
However, I trust that if some of the older
people-perhaps some of us here-feel the
urge to exercise in their own homes, obtaining instructions from, the radio in the early
hours of the morning, they will receive more
encouragement than the husband who, while
taking his early morning exercise, heard his
wife yawningly say: "Why can't you be unhealthy and lazy like other husbands?"
Let me digress for a moment, honourable
senators. We have been told that the Government has only spent money, and, has made
no attempt to save it. Now, is that true? Last
year-or was it the year before-there was
a debate here about the Arrow airpiane. In
the other place there was notice given, or it
was intimated, that the Government was
going to drop that project. We were given a
glo.wing account of the.woniders of that airplane, and what harm. would come to Canada
if it was dropped. We were told of is absolute necessity. The next day the Government
announced that it had no further interest in
it. Then we were told of the terrible wrong
done by dropping it. There would be 13,000
more men thrown, out of work, although the
speaker had stressed that, in his opinion,
700,000 were already unemployed. Although
it was estimated that the cost of the Arrow
would amount to a billion dollars and, as it
would be out of date within a short while,
a«billion dollars would be wasted 'if work on
its production continued, and that a billion
dollars. should be spent to keep the 13,000
workers employed. Why flot start on other
works to employ the 700,000, which may take
many billions?
Perhaps it was not as controversial a maâtter as, I seem to imply from the way 1 arn
talking, for immediately afterwards the late
lamented Senator Euler rose and told the
house that the Governent had acted properly, and that hie had written to the Prime
Minister complimenting him on the way he
had acted, congratulating' himr for his discretion and saying that, in his opinion, he
was right.
We have been told, in effect, honourable
senators, that the Conservative party has done
nothing for the welfare of Canada except to
spend money. The Ottawa Journal of January
31 last had this to say:
To score a point off Mr. Pearson and
his strange collection of advisers is less
26211-3-11j

important than, for example, the survey
of economic conditions given by Justice
Minister Fulton the other day. His statement that the gross national product this
year probably will be up 7j per cent
from 1961, after smaller gains in the last
four years, is more heartening to, Canadians generally than a debating triumph
in the Commons.
If the Conservatives get into the bog
with the Liberals, their achievements in
four years of administration will be
blurred in the exchange of abuse.
It is no empty boast of the Government
party that in most areas under federal
jurîsdiction they have done more in four
years than the Liberals did in 22.
0f course, it will be said that the Ottawa
Journal is a supporter of the present Government and is consequently biased. Surely,
you do flot think for one mad moment that
the Liberal party is over and above bias, and
that it could not possibly show any bias when
attacking the Conservative régime.
It is very easy to attack. It is difficuit, to
stifie a desire to answer. Anyone can use
harsh, bitter criticism. It requires strength
of character to refuse to answer in language
suitable for that meridian. There is necessarily two sides to the science of politics. It
is natural for each side to find fault with the
other's policles. That is necessary procedure.
Let me say only this of the Liberal party. It
bas been using poor criticism or, as one
paper referred. to, it, "bumbling criticism",
and flot concerning itself with useful policies.
It has been preaching pessimîsm.
One ch arge made against the Prime Minister
by a continuous attacker in the other place is
that the Prime Minister neyer carried out his
pledges. Yet, Maclean's magazine, as quoted
by Senator Irvine, wrote that out of 62 pledges
made by the Prime Minister during the 195758 campaign, 50 have already been kept or
are in the process of being kept.
Let us look at the overail economic and
financial1 position of Canada in 1961 and compare it with the economic and financial position of Canada*in 1956. This document which
I*have in hand was prepared by the Dominion
Bureau of Statistics. It shows the followlng
beadings: Indicator; 1956; 1961; Increase 1961
over 1956;- and Percentage Increase 1961 over
1956. Total'employment in 1956 was 5,703,000,
and in 1961, 6,155,000, which is an increase in
1961 over .1956 of 452,000. In 1956 the gross
national product was $30.6 billion and in 1961
it was $37.4 billion, an increase in 1961 over
1956, of $6.8.,billion.

SENATE
$640 million. The industrial production index
in 1956 was 155 and in 1961 it was 179, an
increase in 1961 over 1956 of 24. I hope nobody
asks me what that means.
Hon. Mr. Prait: Is the honourable senator
quoting billions or millions?
Hon. Mr. Higgins: Is the honourable senator referring to the Industrial Production Index? I shall attempt to tell him what it is. It
represents the level of production for all
manufacturing, mining, power and other industries, taking a certain formula as an index.
That is as far as I will go. In 1956 the total
personal savings were $1.3 billion, and in 1961
they were $1.7 billion, an increase of $400
million.
With the permission of honourable senators
I place this table on Hansard.

Hon. Mr. Wall: Honourable senators, may
I ask the honourable senator whether those
figures are in current dollars or constant
dollars?
Hon. Mr. Higgins: As we say in law,
res ipsa laquitur. This speaks for itself. I shall
place it on the record, and the honourable
senator can look at it and learn for himself.
Exports totalled $4.8 billion in 1956 and $5.7
billion in 1961, an increase in 1961 over 1956
of $900 million, or 19 per cent. Total personal
income in 1956 was $21.9 billion, and in 1961
it was $28.7 billion, an increase of $6.8 billion. Labour income in 1956 was $14.9 billion
and in 1961 it was $19.5 billion, an increase
of $4.-6 billion. Corporation profits in 1956
were $2.91 billion and in 1961 they were
$3.55 billion, an increase in 1961 over 1956 of

Honourable senators, I wish to speak for
a short time about forests because I think
it is a most important subject. I have spoken
on it before in the house but I will speak
about it now in a different way.
Trees are necessary for the well-being
of a nation for other purposes than providing
the material for houses, ships, fences, paper
and other modern necessities. Countries today
are faced with terrific problems caused by
the abuse of nature. Great floods are ravaging lands and erosion of the soil is turning
what were once rich woodlands or grassy
fields into arid deserts.
The cause of most of this flood damage
is inevitable when the balance of land and

water factors is disturbed by mistreatment
of the watersheds through the large scale
removal of forests and other soil-binding
vegetation. No one expects that forests or
forest soil can alone control floods. The
Mississippi River was in major flood stage
when first seen by white men in 1541, long
before there was any cutting of timber or
cultivation of soil; but there is the clearest
proof that floods have increased in number
and intensity since those early days. There
is an accumulation of evidence that goes to
show that good forests and range management will largely decrease the menace of
floods and the costly waste of erosion.

FEBRUARY 14, 1962
Trees formn the natural banks of rivers;
they bind the soil. Remove them. and the
river fiows along unrestricted, continually
wearing the banks away. The mistreatmnent
of watersheds inevitably causes most of the
floods. Through the wholesale tearing Up of
trees and grasses, the clay, no longer bound
together by nature, turns to dust.
Where the soil is flot washed away, there
remains nothing but a desert, flot alone
useless to man and beast but a menace to
ail forms of life ever moving to fertile
parts and, like a destructive army on the
march, destroying everything it touches. The
most striking instance is the west range
in the United States which lies west of an
irregular line through the plains states from
the Dakotas right down to Texas.
This has been the source of many dust
storms which have blackened the skies o!
the great plains for many years and has
affected even eastern towns like Boston,
which in 1929 was visited by a heavy dust
storm which weather experts say came from
the Middle West. What o! the terrible dust
storms, particuiarly in the 1920's in the
Canadian Middle West caused by the cutting of ail shubbery and brush and the
desertion of farms?
The greatest menace to our forests is fire
and the worst criminai in this destruction is
the firebug. Fire leaves in its wake almost absolute destruction, iaying waste vast stretches
of timber and turning a scene of beauty
into an abomination o! desolation. And the
sad part is that most of the fires in this
country are caused by carelessness, downrlght inexcusable criminal negigence. It
should be everybody's business to see that the
careless camper and the indifferent smoker,
is treated in the way he should be-as a
menace, against whom everybody's hand and
voice should be raised and who should be
condemned at the bar of! public opinion
as not fit for the privileges of citizenship.
The loss caused by such agency is incalculable., The timber industry, the trapping industry ail suifer. The hunting grounds
are destroyed, rivers lose their sources of
supply, and very o! ten private homes are
wiped out and villages and towns threatened
with destruction. It must be spread around
to ail and sundry that the very lifeblood
o! the country Is being sapped by this evil.
If devastating fires are allowed to continue,
the ruin o! the country is assured, from
which there wiil be no comeback, for Inanciai troubles may be cured but the loss
o! a f orest is irretrievabie.
There.is at present grave necessity for the
enforoemnent, of strong and effective laws,
which are nothing more than the means a

state must emplôy s0 that a few shail not be
allowed to waste and destroy what is meant
for the benefit o! the whole country.
We should be on our guard, for there have
been some terrible forest fires. One o! the
worst fires in North America occurred in New
Brunswick in 1825, and devastated four million acres. Only a few years ago a terrible
forest fire in Maine destroyed forests and
burned villages and sunimer resorts. Thtis past
year we had some devastating fires in Newfoundland where millions of acres of tîmberland were burned and millions o! cords o!
wood destroyed. Homes were burned down,
domestic animals perished, and wildlife was
wiped out by the thousands.
If we maintain the forests we have a place
for recreation for young and old. We have the
wood for the paper mills. We have the rivers
for the driving of logs and the creation of
electric power. We have the home for wild
animais o! alI kinds. And we find health there,
for nature effects perfect sanitation with the
trees and the leaves, clear air and dlean
water.
Now that I have brought you through the
forest and we have heard the brooks babbling
by and listened to the sweet songs of birds,
as the sunset has come at the end of a placid
day, let us gather around the campfire and
tell old stories and drink old wine, if we
have any, and sing old songs, but let us under
no cfrcumstances sing The Whiffenpoof Song.
Han. Mr. Vaillancourt: As Newfoundlanders
are expert fishermen, I should like to ask the
honourable senator from St. John's East (Hon.
Mr. Higgins) why we are building bigger
and bigger fishing vessels to go farther ont to
sea when apparently the catch is better near
our own shores and fishing fleets from other
countries are anxious to fish off our shores.
Could the honourable senator explain that
situation?
Hon. Mr. Higgins: It is sometimes difficuit
to change a man's way o! life. Most fishermen in Newfoundland are inshore fishermen
whose homes are on the shoreline. They go
out in the evening and lay their traps, and
they go out in the morning and haul the fish
in. The fishermen are in their homes most of
the time. In the earlier years there were
bankers in certain centres that used to f ollow
the fish. Sometimes the fish would be caught
in one place and not in another. One year
there might be wonderful fishing off the
southern shore and poor fisbing off the northern shore, and the next year it might be
just the opposite. These bankers would foilow
the fish for seven or eight days, catch a load
and bring theni back homne, but most of the
time they would be used for inshore fishing.

SENATE
It is a teriffic proposition to ask the fishermen to go off the Grand Banks. To begin
with, they would have to have expensive
boats. An inshore fisherman has a small boat
with a motor that costs him only a few
hundred dollars. He pays $1,500 or $2,000 for
his traps, but these last a long time and can
be repaired time and again until they are
almost like a new net. It is like the fellow
who said, "How old is your cricket bat?"
The reply was, "I have had it for 10 years
but I have had two new handles and three
new blades." As I say, it is asking a lot of a
fisherman to go out to the Grand Banks. What
would it cost to build a dragger for the Grand
Banks? Probably from $150,000 to $300,000.
Those are big boats for a fisherman to have;
impossible for him to buy. If the fishermen
have to go to the Grand Banks, they have to
go in some dragger or vessel owned by somebody else. They don't like that; they want
to have their own boats and live in their own
homes.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: But is the catch not
better in the deep sea than near the shore?
Hon. Mr. Higgins: I would not say that.
They get bigger catches on the Banks, and
they only get their share of it. I am a smalltown man and a small-town lawyer. I want
to practice in St. John's, and not in a larger
place. If you gave me an offer to practice in,
say, Toronto or Vancouver, I would refuse it.
The inshore fishermen like their work and
find more happiness in it. They can go back
to their beds at night, and they prefer that to
staying on the Grank Banks for weeks and
sleeping in bunks, and so on. Inshore fishing
is their business. If they go out in draggers
they can make more money, but they would
not be as happy. Happiness is not taken into
account at all nowadays. If people wanted to
be happy they would not be rushing around
for money, and dying of thrombosis at 60 years
of age, instead of living to be 80 years old,
as they should.
Hon. Mr. Prati: May I refer to the question which was asked? The honourable gentleman asked about the ships on the Grand Banks
coming in on the inland waters. The reason
is that there are prolific areas for fishing at
the Grand Banks. There is an inflow of fish
from the deep sea to the shores for two or
three or four weeks at certain times of the
year, particularly during the summer, and
these large deep-sea boats on the Grand
Banks will follow this flow of fish into the
shore sometimes. It is not their practice to
fish inshore constantly, but they just follow
the flow of fish.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Cameron, debate adjourned.

PRIVATE BILL
EVANGELICAL MENNONITE CONFERENCESECOND READING

Hon. Arthur L. Beaubien moved the second
reading of Bill S-5, to incorporate Evangelical Mennonite Mission Conference.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
is in the usual form of bills of this kind
which have been passed by this house for
many years. The object of the corporation,
as the bill states, is:
To promote, maintain, superintend and
carry on, in accordance with the Christian
faith, doctrines, constitution, acts and
rulings of the Corporation, any or all of
the work of that body.
This body is asking the right to purchase,
sell and hold property, if the Corporation
deems it advisable.
Paragraph 3 of the bill specifies that the
head office of the Corporation shall be in the
town of Altona, in the province of Manitoba.
The Corporation is seeking all the powers
that are being granted from time to time to
organizations of this kind.
Section 9, subsection (1), of the bill states:
The corporation may purchase, take,
have, hold, receive, possess, retain and
enjoy property, real and personal, corporeal and incorporeal, and any or every
estate or interest whatsoever, given,
granted, devised or bequeathed to it, or
appropriated, purchased or acquired by
it in any manner or way whatsoever, to,
for or in favour of the uses and purposes
of the corporation, or to, for or in favour
of any religious, educational, eleemosynary or other institution established or
intended to be established or assisted by,
under the management of, or in connection with the uses or purposes of the corporation.
In other words, the corporation is seeking
all those powers which other corporations of a
similar nature seek in similar bills which
come before this house for its consideration.

UKRAINIAN CATHOLICS
SEVENTIETH ANNIVERSARY 0F BIRTH 0F
DR. JOSEPH SLIPYJ
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. William M. Wall: Honourable senators,
with the consent of this honourable house,
1 should like to bring to the attention of my
colleagues the fact that Sunday, February 18,
wilI be a very solemin day for the Ukrainian
Catholic bishops, clergy and faithful in the
free world.
On that day, with divine liturgies, and
with prayers, and with special commemorative gatherings, ail Ukrainian Catholics will
be marking the seventieth annivemsary of the
birth o! a relativeiy unknown and unsung
but nonetheless a great and heroic martyr
for truth, for religious freedoin, and for
justice with national freedoin, the Metropoliton-Confessor, the Primate of the Ukrainian Catholie Church in what we know as
Western Ukraine and suxroundixig territories,
Archbishop-Metropolitan
Doctor
Joseph
Slipyj.
26211-3-12

By marking the seventieth birthday of this
modemn, religious and national martyr, Ukrain!an Catholics wish to honour a great religious leader and to draw attention of the world
to the fact that 17 years ago, on April 11,
1945, the Soviet régime began its systematie,
overt and active persecution andi destruction
of the Ukrainian Catholie Church, with the
imprisoument of the Metropolitan-Archbishop
Joseph Slipyj, and his Auxiliary Bishop
Nicetas Budka, a Canadian citizen and the
first Ukrainian Catholic Bishop in Canada;
Bishop George Khomyshyn and his Auxiliary
Bishop, Ivan Latyshevsky of Stanislaviv; and
Bishop Nicholas Chamnetsky, Apostolic Visitator of Volynia.
The Polish Comnmunist police armested the
Bishop of Peremyshi, Dr. Josaphat Kotsylovsky and his Auxiliary Bishop Gregory
Lakota. Both were handed over to the Soviet
Union. In East Germany, the Apostolic Visitator, Father Peter Verhun was imprisoned.
These were the fimst of the mamtyred bishops.
At the saine time hundreds of priests and
faithful were also armested.
A secret trial was held in Kiev to deal
with the -arrested bishops, and, all were
spirited away to Sibemian or other concentration camps and prisons to serve out lengthy
sentences of forced labour.
Fmom March 8 to 10, 1946, the Soviet Govermnent staged a fake, or pseudo-synod at
Lviw, the capital of the Western Ukraine. No
Ukrainian Catholic bishops participated, and
only a handful of temromized clemgy participated under duress and the scrutiny of the
dxeaded secret police. The outcome? This
pseudo-synod pmoclaimed what was essentially
a tyranically enforced and farcical so-called
meunion of the Ukrainian Catholic Church
with the Russian Orthodox Church under the
mule of the Patriarchate of Moscow. Henceforth, the existence of the Ukraînian Catholic
Church was to be illegal, and the Ukrainian
Catholic parishes were fomced to merge with
the Russian Orthodox Chureh, with new
Omihodox clergy munn.ing the parishes, under
the jurisdiction and control of newly-appointed Orthodox bishops who received their
instructions from the Patriarch at Moscow.
Thus, honoumable senators, at one fioul and
feil swoop, the Ukrainian Catholics weme dispossessed of a tmeasured spiritual hemitage
and of chemished possessions wbich they had
bu-ilt with meagme means-for they weme always a captive people-and with tremendous
sacrifices, over many centuries. The extent
of these staggering losses may be better undemstood when I remind you that some five
million Ukrainian Catholics in Western and
Carpatho-Ukraine, in Slovakia, and in
neighbouring lands, lost 10 bishops, 2,950

SENATE
diocesan priests, 520 priests in religious orders, 1,090 nuns, 3,040 parishes, 4,440 churches
and chapels, 195 religious houses, eight theological academies and seminaries, all their
schools, 38 Catholic publications and 35
Catholic printing establishments.
While this classic example of modern communist persecution and perfidy was going on,
the West remained mute, as if uninformed or
uninterested. Why? And why was the West
equally uninformed or disinterested, and
equally mute during the infamous 1930'sand Mr. Khrushchev has divulged a lot of
information of what was going on at that
time-when the Ukrainian Autocephalic Orthodox Church, which then had a hierarchy
of 80 bishops under Metropolitan Lypkiwsky,
was also brutally and similarly liquidated in
Eastern Ukraine?
And why was there no protest, no condemnation of this unjust and brutal suppression of the Ukrainian Catholic Church as
it unfolded after 1945-46?
After the death of Bishop Romzha as a
result of a mysterious automobile accident,
the Catholie Church of the Eastern Rite in
Carpatho-Ukraine was similarly persecuted;
and on August 28, 1949-that is only 13 years
ago-a communist ukase forbade Ukrainian
Catholics to be members of the Catholic
Church of the Eastern Rite.
The year 1950 saw the liquidation of the
Ukrainian Catholic Church in Eastern Czechoslovakia, with the arrest and sentencing
to life imprisonment of Bishop Paul Gojdych;
from information available to us he died in
prison on July 19, 1960. His Auxiliary Bishop,
Basil Hopko, was sent to a forced labour camp
where, according to our information, he
remains till the present day.
And during all this time the West remained
mute, as if tongue-tied. Why?
Thus, honourable senators, was the Ukrainian Catholic Church suppressed and formally
outlawed by the communist régimes. Membership in this church is forbidden-forbidden
in direct contravention of their constitutions
-and those of us who know something about
the role played by this church in the age-old
struggle of the Ukrainian people for individual
freedom and for national independence know
why the totalitarian communist masters felt
it necessary to weave a tissue of trumped-up
charges of supposed treasonable activities to
destroy this institution, an institution which
had made of Western and Carpatho-Ukraine
the Piedmont for the renaissance of modern
Ukrainian nationalism, a nationalism which
is democratically oriented, striving for national
self-determination and for the individual
fulfilment of free men in a free and democratic society.

What a contrast, honourable senators, to the
wonderful growth of this same Ukrainian
Catholic Church in the free democratic world.
There are in the free democratic world
roughly two million Ukrainians. Most of them
are Catholics, and it warms my heart to be
able to tell you that in Europe-in Italy and
in Yugoslavia-we have two archbishops; we
have a bishop in France, one in Britain, one
in Australia, one in Argentina, and one in
Brazil. In the United States we have a Metropolitan archbishop and two bishops; in Canada we have a Metropolitan archbishop and
three bishops.
This is the very same church, with the very
same teachings, the very same institutional
organizations, that has been so brutally and
forcibly liquidated behind the Iron Curtain.
Honourable senators, please understand
why I feel obliged to bring to your attention
the discussions and studies which have been
going on for several years at the United
Nations. I call the attention of the Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
to this particular aspect of my remarks. These
discussions now appear to be coming close
to a climax or decision-making point: I
refer to the work of the Human Rights Commission's "Sub-Commission on Prevention of
Discrimination and Protection of Minorities."
I hold in my hand the 1960 report of this
sub-commission which is entitled, "The Study
of Discrimination in the Matter of Religious
Rights and Practices."
This particular study deals with the problems of discrimination in the matter of
religious rights and practices, and without
going into an explanation of the previous
studies made by this sub-commission and
of the discussions held at the various sessions
are fascinatingly interesting, and
-those
some are almost fanciful-may I point out
that progress has been made and a set of
Basic Rules has been recommended to protect and to extend basic religious rights and
freedoms. Nothing is said there about returning to the people who have been deprived of these religious freedoms and treasures the heritage that is rightfully theirs.
These Basic Rules were incorporated into
what is officially called the "Draft Principles
on Religious Freedom and Non-Discrimination," which draft principles have already
been circulated among United Nations member governments for study and commentI have in my file the comments of the
Canadian Government vis-a-vis these draft
principles-and which draft principles-this,
I think, is going to be important-apparently
are to be discussed by the Human Rights
Commission this year, in fact next month,
from March 19 to April 13.

FEBRUARY 15, 1962
I further understand that these draft principles may be recommended to the Third
Committee, and then to the Assembly of the
United Nations as a declaration for the safeguarding and extension of religious rights
and freedoms, although one of the major
powers which has been playing a very solicitous and active role in the deliberations of
this sub-commission, in the drafting of the
Bacis Rules and draft principles, is pressing
that these draft principles form the basis
for a more binding legal convention. They
want to sew it right up. I leave honourable
senators to guess who this major power is,
and I shall desist from voicing the perfectly
valid protestations and questions which come
crowding to my lips.
There is a Ukrainian proverb which bas
some bearing on this whole problem, and it
runs something like this:
"Wonderful fellow-he locked the gates
after the horses were stolen."
Honourable senators, I was tempted to read
some of these Basic Rules. so that you might
better judge how binding and far-reaching
they are, but I shall desist from doing so
and merely tell you that their intent is very
honourable and their meaning is very comprehensive.
When these draft principles do reach the
decisional point at the Human Rights Commission, at the Third (ECOSOC) Committee,
and at the Assembly, I am sure you will
understand why Ukrainian Catholics will follow with great interest the stand that the
Western democracies will take. I repeat: we
shall be following with great interest the stand
that the Western democracies will take. We
shall be wondering what the diplomatic representatives-yea, and the Canadian toowill say as they jointly and severally address
themselves to this problem of religious liberties, rights, and privileges. Time will tell,
but I and other responsible Ukrainian Catholic
leaders will be watching and waiting, and
expecting something more than apathetic
muteness-and this at a time when the socalled western imperialists are being stridently and loudly challenged at the United
Nations to give up all their remaining colonies and to give to enslaved and underprivileged peoples complete national and individual rights and freedoms. What a strange
spectacle!
By reminding honourable senators of these
events that have taken place and that are
to transpire, I wish to pay tribute to these
heroic bishops of the suffering Ukrainian
Catholic church, to their clergy and to their
faithful, so many of whom become martyrs for
their faith.
26211-3-12j

And what of Archbishop-Metropolitan
Slipyj, who, two days from now, on Saturday, will be celebrating his seventieth birthday in prison, where he bas been for the past
17 years? As far as we know, only two of
these imprisoned Ukrainian Catholic bishops
are still living: one in Czechoslovakia, in
prison, and Metropolitan Slipyj, also in prison,
we believe in a place called Rozayiwka,
either in Kazakhstan or near Moscow, for
there are two places in the Soviet Union called
Rozayiwka. His last "seven-year sentence"
came in May, 1959, after he broke "the
law"-I use the words in quotation marksand wrote a pastoral letter to his faithful.
Lest the world forget and fail to act as its
conscience should dictate!
Thank you, honourable senators.
WAR SERVICE GRANTS ACT
BILL TO AMEND-THIRD

READING

Hon. George S. White moved the third
reading of Bill C-36, to amend the War
Service Grants Act.
He said: Honourable senators, there are
just a few remarks I would like to make
before this bill receives third reading.
I wish to make clear to honourable senators that there is a great difference between
gratuities and re-establishment credits. Gratuities are paid in cash; re-establishment
credits are available to the veteran if it is
shown to the satisfaction of the minister
that the credit is to be used in one of the
fourteen ways set out in section 12(1) of the
act.
Yesterday the honourable senator from
Ottawa West (Hon. Mr. Connolly) asked me
whether or not the gratuity or re-establishment credit would become part of the
veteran's estate.
Dealing first with the question of gratuity,
I would refer honourable senators to section 5 of the act which provides how payment of the amount owing may be made
when a member of the forces dies on service
or after discharge and before he has been
paid his gratuity. Paragraphs (a), (b) and
(c) set out the persons to whom payment
may be made, as follows:
(a) to a person who was in receipt of
or who, in the opinion of the Minister,
was eligible for dependants' allowance
on behalf of the deceased. member immediately prior to the member's death
or discharge;

the Minister, would have been eligible

I turn now to the charming and attractive

made a most excellent speech two days ago.
I listened with a great deal of interest to
her eulogy of the Prime Minister. I arn sure
that modest gentleman must have been
blushing but, nevertheless, gratified to know
that he has two charming ladies to carry the
torch for him in the red chamber.
Whether or not we agree with everything
the senator for Victoria said is not the important point, but I arn sure that she would
not wish to deny to those who may not agree
with everything the Prime Minister or bis
colleagues do, the rîght to occasionally and
mildiy criticize those actions. I would hope
that she would neyer, and I amn sure she
would not, intend to deny anyone that right;

a slight upon the Senate is corrected.
I should like at this time to support the
I was not present a few days ago when remarks made by the honourable senator
tributes were paid to our late friend, Senator from Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) some

SENATE
days ago when in speaking of the work of the
Land Use Committee, he said he felt that
this committee-and similar special committees of the Senate-should as part of its
responsibilities make the occasional on-thespot investigation of the subject under study.
I feel this is most important. I have seen
enough of the operations of Senate committees
to realize that while on each committee there
are men and women who are thoroughly
qualified and knowledgeable about the subject under discussion, there are others who
have not had the background of experience
nor the opportunity of examining the problem
at first hand, but who would be able to bring
much better judgment to the particular
problem if given the opportunity of examining it on the spot. I hope that it will not be
long until we leave no doubt as to special
committees of the Senate having authority to
make on-the-spot investigations.
I want to say something about a matter
which has been exercising the minds of
certain politicians, and more particularly the
press, for some considerable time. I have read
with keen interest various remarks about
Senate reform. These remarks and references
have been made with varying degrees of heat,
depending on the speaker and how concerned
he was about the matter. There are rumours
that the Prime Minister, in order to complete his roster of pre-election promises, may
do something about reforming this august
institution.
What I have to say in this matter will not
be of the nature that you might expect on
Senate reform, for the reason that I think
reform of this institution is something which
cannot and should not be done in a political
climate or in a spur-of-the-moment attempt
at expediency. I think the Senate is too important to the life and the Government of
this country to be treated in any cavalier
fashion, but it may not be inappropriate 95
years after Confederation to take a look at
the functions and responsibilities of the Senate, for circumstances are vastly different
today from what they were then. We happen
to be living at one of those turning points, or
growing points, in history when tremendous
changes are taking place at an accelerated
pace. But, as I said a moment ago, this matter affecting the Government and the lives of
the people is too important to be dealt with
in any haphazard or careless fashion, and I
am sure that will not be the case.
I should like to observe, too, that reform
of the Senate has been a favourite topic of
many politicians for a long time. Not long ago
I listened to my friend, the Honourable T. C.
Douglas, on a television program when he said
with a grin that if he were elected to power

he would abolish the Senate, and, as an afterthought, he added, if he could find a way
of doing it.
I do not think we need worry about that,
and I do not think Mr. Douglas would perform any differently than his distinguished
predecessors. The much-maligned Senate has
been a convenient whipping boy for politicians
ever since the later years of Sir John A. Macdonald, and the reason no prime minister has
done anything about Senate reform, when in
office and faced with the responsibility of government, is that each has found the Senate
to be extremely useful to him for a variety of
reasons, which I do not intend to develop at
this time.
First of all, the Senate is the one guarantee
that the rights of minorities will be protected,
and so long as Canada is a land of religious
and ethnic minorities no prime minister is
going to risk alienating these groups. Judging by the way the present Prime Minister is
cuddling up to some of these groups, he is
likely to be rather cautious about what he
does in this respect, just as his predecessors
have been.
Time and again since Confederation the
Senate has given that sober second look to
legislation, which is its right and responsibility, and the recent row over the Coyne dismissal and the amendment to the "class or
kind" tariff legislation of June, 1961, made
many more friends for the Senate than it
lost, regardless of what political views we
may hold. However, the Senate has made
notable contributions in its day-to-day work
through such outstanding committees as Banking and Commerce-one of the finest committees that sits anywhere in this country, and
under one of the ablest chairmen-Transport
and Communications, Natural Resources, Miscellaneous Private Bills, and particularly
through such special committees as those set
up in recent years to study inflation, land
use and manpower. These committees have
improved legislation and conducted studies
which have been of inestimable value to
Canada.
Many irresponsible people speak disparagingly of the Senate without knowing whereof
they speak. Saying this, however, does not
mean there is no room for any reform in
the Senate, as there is in any other human
institution.
The question of whether or not there
should be an age limit for senators is one
upon which there is a difference of opinion.
Some people suggest that if we approve an
age limit for judges we might do the same
for senators. I would suggest, as I said a
moment ago, that this matter is too important
to be a political football and it should be
handled with extreme care. It might even

FEBRUARY 15. 1992
be that the Senate itself would make a study
of this kind. Care must be taken to make
sure that the expectations of and comnitments
to members who are presently i the Senate
are carried out in full.
The kind of reform, and change I would
like to see ini the Senate is one which would
recognize that there are in this chamber xnany
highly quaified and able men and women who
are trained in the law, in bankung, ini science
and in public affairs. It is my conviction that
these men and womnen could do much of the
work that is now done by a multiplicity of
royal commissions. More of this later.
Another change that has been contemplated
or suggested from time to time is one with
which I find some sympathy. Politics and
politicians being what they are, it would
be too much to expect that the Senate would
ever become a completely non-partisan body.
As a member of a un.tversity faculty, and
for that reason somewhat restricted in political activities, I rather enjoy the political
discussions in this cham-ber. Perhaps I amn
in the wrong place. Nevertheless, I think
changes might be made to make the Senate
more representative than it is. For exaniple,
the ends of politics could be adequately served
if 80 of the 102 seats were filled much as
they are now by representatives of the two
major political parties, with the possible
modification that one-third of the nominations be made by provincial governiments. Ini
some cases this would flot change the political colouration of the nominees. In other
cases, such as in the provinces of Alberta,
British Columnbia and Saskatchewan-those
maverick western
provinces-opportunity
would be provided for the appointmnent of
people with other political views. More important, however, in my judgment is that
the remaining 22 seats should be filled
through collaboration 'by the federal and
provincial Governiments on a strictly nonpolitical basis, drawing on men and women
who have distinguished themselves ini the
arts, the professions, and in public aiffairs
apart from politics.
Let there be no misunderstanding here.
I do not disparage politics or politicians.
The country would be mucli the poorer were
it not for the public spirited people who
from time to time offer themselves as targets
for the use and abuse of many unthinking
people by taking an active part i the political life of our country.
There are many more suggestions that
could be made, but I would like especially
to develop the one with reference to the role
of Senate committees in place of royal commissions. Since the present Government took

office, 14 royal commissions have been estabJished. These have ail been under the leadership of distinguished and public-spirited Canadians, and no refiection is intended on
any of them when I say that the work of
many of these commissions could have been
discharged equally weil, or better, by referral
to a special committee of the Senate. Such
a coxnmittee could bring together a panel
of experts to do the necessary research
and background work, and the senators on
that conimittee could themselves function as
royal commissioners. They could do this at
a considerable saving to the public treasury,
for they would perform this function as
part of their regular duties without additional salary. Provision should be made for
such travel and holding of hearings as is
necessary.
As an illustration of just how valuable
the work of a Senate committee can be, I
have only to refer to the work of such
special conimittees as the Land Use Committee of 1956 to 1962, the Finance Committee of 1959 which studied inflation, and
particularly the Manpower and Employment
Committee of 1960 and 1961. There have
been many similar instances in the past, but
these are recent committees that have served
Canada well, and brought credit to the Senate
and to the Parliarnent of Canada.
One kind of Senate reform that 1 would
]ike to see is an extension of the use of
special committees of the Senate. Such committees could bring to their work the wisdom
and experience of men and women trained
i law, medicine, finance, education and administration. Many of these persons are today,
in their private capacities, administering some
of Canada's largest businesses i banking,
finance, industry and communications. Unfortunately, a few intemperate and irresponsible journalists who make snide remarks
about the Senate being a home for superannuated antediluvians, and who seek to create an
iaccurate and bumbling image of the Senate,
must be guilty either of gross ignorance or
m'alicious mischief, because such writers, if
they took the trouble to inquire, must know
that many of the senators are very active
in some of the country's most important
enterprises and in community affairs. If they
do not know this and they seek to create an
impression or an image at variance with the
truth, then they refiect neither credit on their
papers nor on themselves.
I suggested a moment ago that I feit the
Senate could increase its value and its service
to Canada if each year, or as required, it
set up one or more special committees to deal
with major problems affecting the national
life. 1 would like to see set up at the earliest

SENATE
opportune time a special committee on taxation. This is a study long overdue in Canada
and one which a Senate committee could do
very well.
A second special committee would be one
having to do with the development of a national culture in Canada. The very fact that we
are at a stage when Canadian nationalism
represents a growing force in shaping our
attitudes both to ourselves and to other countries would seem to be a good time to examine
whether or not there are things that can be
done to develop a greater measure of Canadian
unity, and to make sure that the cohesive
forces in our national life are strengthened
and the divisive ones denigrated. But, more
of that later.
To return to the idea of a Senate committee on taxation, I should like to spend a
little time to explain why it is necessary and
timely to consider such a development. I will
read from the Tax Memo of the Canadian
Tax Foundation, for January, 1962, which
says in part:
Red ink continued to dominate provincial Estimates in the fiscal year 1961-62.
On the basis of inter-provincially comparable figures, deficits totalling $348
million are due for nine out of ten
provinces this year. Preliminary figures
for the previous year indicate that the
provinces outspent revenues by $314 million with only one, Prince Edward Island,
ending up in the black. These facts emerge
from a recent compilation by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics of provincial
Estimates for 1961-62 and preliminary
figures for 1960-61. Because the Bureau
combines current and capital expenditures and rearranges some of the figures
given by the provincial treasurers in
their budgets to obtain inter-provincial
comparability, the DBS analysis does not
always present the same picture as the
treasurers. Those in Prince Edward
Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and
Manitoba predicted surpluses and the Saskatchewan treasurer announced a deficit,
but in the DBS analysis only for Saskatchewan is a surplus forecast for 196162 and it will be nominal.
The DBS study shows that the provinces
expect to take in nearly $2,749. million
and to spend almost $3,097 million in
1961-62. Compared with the preliminary
figures for the previous year, revenues
will be up by $195 million and expenditures by $229 million, about 8% in each
case. The excess of expenditures over
revenue will be $34 million greater than
in the previous year and will represent
close to 13% of revenue.

The article goes on to say:
Over the past five years, revenues of
provincial governments have increased by
about 54%, or by $959 million. Expenditures have climbed by 75%, or by $1,326
million. Among sources of revenue, taxes
are now relatively more important and
privileges, licences and permits and liquor
profits relatively less important than in
1956-57. On the expenditure side, outlays
for health and education now bulk larger
in the total than in 1956-57, while expenditures for transportation and natural resources have declined relatively.
Payments to local authorities in 1961-62
will approximate $785 million, about 25%
of all provincial outlays.
Direct debt of the provinces at March
31, 1960 totalled $3,323 million, a 35%
increase over March 31, 1955. Indirect
debt rose by 104% in the same period to
$3,081 million.
Similarly the leading editorial in yesterday
morning's Montreal Gazette refers to a warning sounded by Mr. George W. Bourke,
President of the Sun Life Assurance Company,
and may help to explain the psychology of
Government spending. Mark you, honourable
senators, I think a great deal of our expenditure is justified. Certainly a great deal of our
expenditure on welfare services is justified.
Perhaps those services should be extended in
some cases, but I feel that they should not
be extended without taking some precautions
to make sure that abuses are removed, and I
am sure that today there are already too
many abuses creeping into all forms of welfare legislation.
The editorial reads:
One of the dangers of our time is the
delusion that a government is somehow
a means of generating money, as well as
distributing it. A government may be
regarded as an independent source of
spendable income. What it gives is supposed to be free...

As Mr. Bourke pointed out, this delusion has been greatly encouraged by the
many ways in which tax-consciousness is
obscured.
I emphasize the words "in which taxconsciousness is obscured".
This is the operative part:
The deductions from income taxes
made "at source" was a scheme introduced to relieve people of the spectre
of unpaid taxation. But the painlessness
of the method has resulted in dulling the
awareness of most people of how much
of their income is actually being taken
from them. They are less likely to miss

FEBRUARY 15, 1962
what they were neyer allowed to have.
In fact rnany people receive a rebate at
tax-paying time, which carnies painlessness almost to the point of pleasure.
There are many other forms of taxation, even more completely hidden, such
as the taxes imposed by goverrnent
at the manufacturers' level. These taxes
appear in the price of the product, but
they are flot identified. The consumer
pays themn without being conscious of
how high they are, or perhaps that they
exist.
There may be many excellent reasons
why collecting taxes in these ways is
easier. But they combine to make taxes
seem, in large part, remote from everyday. The tax figures that appear in
government budgets become impersonal
totals. As Mr. Bourke well put it yesterday: "Thus we see people holding the
bizarre notion that government services
are either free, or, at least, are paid
for by somebody else.
1 arn sure this is an attitude that is all
too prevalent today. The editorial continues
as f ollows:
The idea that if governiments pay for
social services, the services become free
ignores another aspect. For what is
"regarded, as free is usually consurned
extravagantly and wastefully." Even
apart from whatever waste might develop,
there is the simple fact that the overhead costs of goverinent operations
loom large in the price.
"As a matter of fact," says Mr. Bourke,
"whenever the payment for a social
service is removed from the individual
to a governiment, it starts a chain reaction.
Different levels of government have
to meet the charges for the service and
when, to these, are added their several
overhead charges, the social service becornes a very expensive item indeed. Yet
a great many people think that if governments-instead of the people themselves-pay the bills, it must be a 'free
service'."
Somne Urne ago--and this gives sorne point
to the suggestion I make that the Senate
might establish a special comimittee to
examine taxation-the President of the Royal
Bank had this to say:
Perhaps it would be in order, as soon
as we can, to extend still further the
range of inquiry into the working of our
economy by setting up a Royal Commission on Taxation. I believe that such an
inquiry could lead to a re-examination
of existing taxing habits and to the

establishment of a tax systemn more in
keeping with Canada's problems and
responsibilities, and with her need to
meet both the challenges and the opportunities presented to her by the sometimes disconcerting trends inevitable in
a developing world economy.
Honourable senators, from the report of
the Dominion Bureau of Statistics on Principal Taxes and Rates, which is a review of
what happened last year in taxation in
Canada, I quote:
In Nova Scotia the tax on gasoline was
increased fromn 170 to 190 per gallon, the
3% sales tax was increased to, 5%.
In New Brunswick the tax on gasoline
was increased from 150 to 180 per gallon,
and on diesel fuel from 151o to 230 per
gallon.
In Quebec, the tax on corporation incorne was increased from, 10% to 12%.
The sales tax was increased from 2% to
4%.
The Province of Ontario has introduced
a 3 % retail sales tax to be effective
September 1, 1961.
And, honourable senators, that province
is trying to collect a tax on new automobiles
that are purchased in another province and
driven here in Ontario part of the year.
In Manitoba the tax on gasoline was
increased frorn lic to 14e per gallon, and
on other motive fuel frorn lic to 17e per
gallon.
In Saskatchewan a tax of 17c per gallon was imposed on diesel fuel and the
tax on gasoline was increased fromn 12e
to 14e per gallon.
And even in Alberta, where we have plenty
of oul,
*. .
he taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel
were increased from 10e and 12c to 12e
and 14c per gallon respectively.
In British Columbia the tax on gasoline was ralsed from 100 to -130 per
gallon, and on other motive fuels from
120 to 150 per gallon.
These are just samples of what is happening in the taxation field today, and it should
give us pause to take a new look at what
should be done.
Honourable senators, to retumn to the subject of setting Up a special Sena-te comnxittee
on taxation, such a comrnittee night find
answers to some, if not ail, of the following
problerns:
1. What are the precepts and principles
governing present taxation policy in Canada?
There is little authoritative literature on this

SENATE
subject apart from budget speeches announeing policy at a given time. A lot of our taxation structure seems to be based on the idea,
(a) we have got to have the money; and (b)
we will take it from where it is easiest to get
regardless of whether or not this is a logical
and consistent way of doing it.
2. What is the effect of this policy or lack
of policy on Canadian enterprise? What are
its effects on the corporate form of Canadian
enterprise?
3. What do we consider to be the role and
function of tax policy in a developing economy such as ours?
4. What should be the rale and function of
Canadian business executives in tax planning
and tax policy?
In the years since 1939 we have witnessed
a complete reversal of the sharing of the tax
dollar. Before World War II municipal revenues accounted for 41.7 per cent of the
total tax collected. During the war the
balance shifted to the point where the federal
Government collected most of the taxes, and
that is the position today. Provincial revenues are in second place, and the municipalities, as of the year ending 1961, account for
only 16.9 per cent of the revenues. The actual
figures for 1961 are:
Federal ............
61.8 per cent
Provincial ......... .21.3
per cent
Municipal ..........
16.9 per cent
This reversal alone suggests the need of a new
look at our tax structure.
Again, the acceptance by all parties of an
increasing of appropriations for the welfare
state means that inevitably we shall have to
find more money year by year. For example,
the welfare bills we have passed this week
will add $150 million a year to our taxes. The
other day a friend of mine, when commenting
on the competition among the political parties in bidding for votes through the extension of welfare payments, suggested to me
that he thought he would start a new party
in which the ideal situation would be brought
about whereby old age pensions would start
where the baby bonus leaves off. In any case,
the bills which we have passed in the last
few days suggest that we should be studying
very carefully the effects of tax policy on
Canadian enterprise under the following
headings:
(i) Has the corporate tax shifted?
(ii) What are the effects of shifted corporate income tax?
(iii) What are the effects of unshifted
corporation income tax?
(iv) What are the effects of tax treatment
accorded capital gains?
(v) What is the role of taxation on corporate financing?

Another major area is the role and function
of tax policy in a modern economy. In this
area there are usually two schools of thought:
(a) that tax policy is an economic tool; and
(b) that it is simply a revenue tool. In this
general area there is a need for a great deal
of research on the facts of taxation.
Some people have suggested that taxation
is a science. It is certainly far from that at
the present time. To anyone who has any
training in science today taxation and tax
policies are far from scientific in this or any
other country. Many tax programs today are
like Topsy, they have "just growed". This is
particularly true of the petroleum industry
where taxes have been applied on a basis of
expediency, and certainly with all too little
study of their possible long-term effects.
These are just a few of scores of questions
to which we must find answers in the very
near future.
To mention one area apart from the burgeoning welfare expenditures, let us look at
the area of education in the national economy.
One of the significant facts of life with respect to education in Canada today on the
basis of our population of 17,814,000 in 1960,
is that we were spending at the rate of $86
for every man, woman and child in Canada
for a 200-day school year. In other words, in
1960 it cost us $7,700,000 for each day the
classrooms were open. We should be spending more than that for education in Canada
if we are to retain our place in this highly
competitive world as we go on into the latter
part of the 1960's.
The significant part of this story about expenditures for education, however, is that
the expenditures for 1960, amounting to $1.5
billion, were more than twice what they were
six years earlier, in 1954, and the most conpetent authorities in Canada today estimate
that by 1970 those figures will have increased
twice again.
I cite the welfare costs and the educational
costs being carried by the Canadian people as
mere illustrations of the trend which makes
it inevitable that we must evolve some new
principles and new sources of taxation, all of
which should be designed to strengthen the
development of our productive resources and
our competitive position with other countries.
Now, honourable senators, before I leave
the subject of education may I just say that
the universities of Canada are gratefui for
the increase of 50 cents per capita in the
federal grant. They asked for a grant of $2.50
per capita, and I am sorry that this amount
could not have been paid this year because
our universities are in very difficult circumstances. The provision of educational training
today is a costly business. It is taking a longer

FEBRUARY 15, 1962
time to do the 'training; it takes more highly
trained instructors and much more complicated and expensive equipment, and yet we
must have these resources. This is an area
in which we cannot afford to be niggardly in
the future.
It is obvious to any student of the Canadian
scene that Canada is in a ferment today. The
'emergence of an economically and, possibly
later on, a politically unified Europe has implications of the most far-reaching portent
for Canada. Certainly its development must
give us cause to examine every facet of our
national life which may either strengthen or
weaken our effectiveness as a nation. For
example, a vociferous and articulate minority
in Quebec bas been talking about separatism
and setting up a republic of Quebec. This, of
course, is most arrant nonsense, but the fact
is that we should not overlook the possibility
that there may be some real justification for
the unsettlement in Quebec.
It seems to me that we, as Canadians,
should be concerned about the fact that we
have ten different systems of education rather
than one. We should be concerned over the
fact that because of the changing economy
we have in Canada today there is much
greater mobility of population. Companies and
business organizations are moving their executives and employees, with their families,
from province to province with increasing
frequency.
In studies I have had made in some schools
there has been as much as 25 to 40 per
cent turnover in the student population in as
little as two years. Of course, some of these
students are leaving school, and others are
moving to ýother schools within the province,
but many are going to other provinces in
Canada. They find that because of a narrow,
parochial provincialism in some provinces a
student is set back a grade merely because
he comes from another province. We seldom
hear of a student from another province being promoted to a higher grade. A lot of this
is sheer nonsense, but it does suggest that
without impinging on provincial independence
or autonomy we should have wisdom enough
in the administration of national policy with
regard to education to set out provincially
uniform standards of quality. This is where
the federal Government can play an important
role. Although under the terms of the B.N.A.
Act the federal Government has no responsibility for education, nevertheless, year by
year the federal treasury is making larger
and larger contributions to education, and,
in the national interest it will have to make
still larger contributions. Thus, the national
Government bas a great stake in making
sure that we evolve an educational system
which will make effective the sort of uni-

formly high iquality we need in this country,
and particularly uniformity of standards.
Something must be done about it. Something
might be done by encouraging the provinces
to get together, and the federal Government
could exercise a certain measure of veto by
saying, we shall not dictate what you should
do in a particular province, but moneys will
only be provided if you come up to certain
standards.
This does not mean taking away provincial
responsibility or autonomy in education. To
me, one of the exciting things taking place
in Canada today is the new look being taken
at education in Quebec. It is healthy; it is
good; and I venture to say that a great deal
of good will be derived from such an examination in that province. The commission
which is sitting there now may be the most
effective of the six or seven Royal Commissions on Education that have been established in Canada. The nation has a great
interest in, and responsibility for, encouraging
a uniformly high standard of education
throughout the country.
The fact that we have not been able to
agree on a national flag or a national anthem,
or whether or not we are a bi-cultural or
multi-cultural nation, are all factors to which
a special committee could devote its attention. I have simply used the committees on
taxation and cultural development as illustrations; and I am suggesting that special
committees of the Senate might give their
attention to such matters. This is the kind
of change and reform I would be concerned
with, and I think the people of Canada would
greatly appreciate such steps being taken.
Such conimittees would perform a signal
service for the country as a whole. It is
in the acceptance, nay, in the seeking out and
tackling of such problems that I see the kind
of Senate refori that would serve the interests of Canada best.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
first of all, may I congratulate the mover
(Hon. Mr. Méthot) and the seconder (Hon.
Mr. Hollett) of an address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne on their eloquence.
Also I should like sincerely to congratulate
the honourable Leader of the Government
in this house (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) on his wellearned honour and the recognition which he
has received.
In the Speech from the Throne the word
"welfare" is used, and I wish to confine
my remarks today entirely to national health
insurance. People everywhere talk about
sickness, disease and accidents. These are
common topics of conversation, and well

SENATE
they might be, because the ravages of disease
and the tragedy of broken health are never
very f ar from any of us.
Doctors, as well as others, recognize the
desirability of having the best medical care
that the age affords. This is not a subject
for debate: all are agreed upon that. However,
the point for careful examination and decision is, how can this best be realized? It
is a delicate subject; it is a subject of human
interest; it is a subject far above the consideration of dollars and cents. If the right
course is pursued it will evoke appreciation
and gratitude from the hearts of the people
of this country; whereas, if the wrong course
is pursued, it will bring discord, tears and
sometimes resentment.
We are not by any means pioneers in the
national insurance field. In the universal quest
for health and happiness many countries of
the world have adopted various types of
national health scheme. Some are compulsory,
some are voluntary, some are supported by
taxation, some are supported by premiums,
some have more coverage than others, and
the methods of administration differ. Full reports on the various plans in being in different countries have been published, and
Canadian doctors and others have gone to
distant countries to inquire into the benefits
which obtain, and to see which system would
be best suited to Canada.
On December 21 last the Prime Minister
announced the appointment of a royal commission on Canada's health needs and resources. That commission is holding investigations at the present time, and as a result of
their studies and the experience of other
countries, in the near future Canada will
have a great opportunity to mould its medical
practice as a model which will be a shining
example to the rest of the world, because
we shall then have the information necessary
in order to build up such a system.
It seems to me that there are certain immediate needs in this regard which should
be met. First of all, the advances in medical
science during the last 60 years exceed those
of previously recorded history. The results
of heart, lung, brain and nerve surgery are
outstanding. The dramatic changes that have
taken place in the prevention and treatment
of disease, as the result of research and the
discovery of new drugs, have been very
marked. Much has been accomplished, but
much remains to be done. These recent advances should be maintained, expanded and
improved upon. Therefore, one need at the
present time is more and more research. Another is more hospital accommodation. In the
cities of Canada it is impossible to gain

admittance to a hospital for a minor complaint unless one is prepared to wait for two
or three weeks. This is not desirable.
We need more trained nurses in Canada.
Some hospital wards cannot be opened because the nurses required to service them
are not available. In some cases nurses' aidesthat is, partly-trained personnel-have been
called in to assist in discharging nurses'
duties.
More doctors are needed. Medical associations all over the country are trying to encourage young men and women to enter the
profession of medicine. It is a fact that we
require about 800 newly qualified doctors
each year in order to maintain the efficiency
of the medical service, and yet we are only
graduating approximately 700. It is a wellknown fact that most doctors in practice are
booked up for days and days ahead and
cannot make house calls, and yet house calls
are a very important part of medical practice
because they afford the doctor an intimate
knowledge of his patients' living conditions.
Really great results have been obtained because the average length of life, which at the
beginning of this century was about 50 years,
is now about 70 years.
The last point I wish to make is that health
is a state of physical, mental and social wellbeing, and is not simply the absence of disease
or infirmity. So if we are to have maximum
health and happiness we must see that adequate nutrition, proper housing, and some
measure of education are made available to
the people.
There are three systems of medicine now
being practised in Canada. There is, first of
all, state medicine, secondly, there is prepaid
medical care, and thirdly, private practice.
State medicine, honourable senators, implies
the diversion of public funds for preventive or
curative medicine, and about 30 per cent of
the doctors in Canada are practising under
that plan in different departments of government such as the Department of Health and
Welfare, the Department of Citizenship and
Immigration, the Indian Affairs Branch, in
mental hospitals, in research, and so on.
Of the 18 million people in Canada about
half are under some form of prepaid insurance.
Indeed, everyone should have some calamity
insurance. The cost of scientific medicine has
advanced so much that it is beyond the reach
of a great many people, and insurance policies
would give them a great deal of protection.
Private practice is the free and easygoing
type of practice which has served well and
has stood the test of time. Under private
practice a patient can go to any doctor or
hospital he may wish. He can consult any
specialist who appeals to him. He can go to

SENATE
A floating exchange rate is unstable, and
makes a paradise for the speculator and the
scalper, and was strongly condemned by the
famous Radcliffe report to which I shall refer
later. Few speculators, if any, will take a
chance on speculating against a Government
controlled rate of exchange. It is my opinion,
also, that the Department of Trade and Commerce should be commended for the co-operation it has given the exporters of this country.
Much has been said during this debate
about the increase in the country's money
supply and in our national debt. I would like
to put some figures on the record in this
regard. At the end of December 1957 the
money in circulation amounted to $11.923
billion. At December 1961 it was $15.76 billion, an increase of $3.153 billion.
As we all know, the federal Government
has monetary reserves, or what might be
called a redemption fund, as security for our
money or debt that may be required for
redemption purposes. At the end of December
1957, these reserves amounted to $1,100,300,000
in gold and $728 million in United States
money. At the end of December 1961, our
gold reserves had fallen to $924,200,000 and
our United States funds amounted to
$1,109,600,000. This is rather a strange situation: whereas Canada produces gold, it does
not produce United States money. It is true
that at the present time United States money
is convertible abroad into gold, but that
situation can change overnight; whereas,
when any change takes place in the price of
gold, we know, going down through history
it has always moved upward in price. Gold
is gold, and paper is paper; subject to sudden changes when gold goes up, paper goes
down.
In the United States, they are required by
law at all times to keep a 25 per cent gold
reserve behind all their issued money supply.
Our federal gold reserves, including United
States dollars, do not amount to more than
about 15 per cent of our money in circulation and, taking gold alone as the United
States does, our reserve in gold amounts to
a little over 7 per cent of our money in
circulation. This reflects a very weak monetary situation in Canada, I think; and we
used to be the third largest gold producing
country in the world. It is regrettable that
our gold production has decreased from
$204,479,000 in 1950 to $156,851,000 in 1961,
but even the gold we are producing is not
finding its way into our federal national
reserves as it should be. It is being disposed
of elsewhere.
It is interesting to note that Great Britain
has strengthened her gold reserves by about

$1 billion during the last year, and the United
States is doing everything possible to conserve their gold.
There are two kinds of money circulating
throughout the world today which are being
used to carry on trade. There is global or

international money, and domestic money or

currency. Global money is readily redeemable, as it is convertible into gold and is
acceptable by ail nations. Domestic money
used within a country, and not convertible into
gold, is simply a promise to pay and is redeemable by the fiction of issuing new promises
to pay to take the place of old promises.
For some years now there has been a
scarcity of global money as compared to domestic money, or in other words, a shortage of
international money as compared to national
money. This situation is giving international
bankers and traders grave concern. When we
hear of countries being short of foreign exchange it simply means they are lacking in
global money, and they have to inaugurate an
austerity program which places restrictions
on imports and seriously affects exporting
countries. England, Australia, South Africa,
Japan and many smaller countries have recently been seriously affected in this way and
have had to use restrictions. It also means that
nations are often called upon to transfer gold
to other countries to make settlements of trade
balances, and it puts a heavy strain on them
to do so.

United States has been steadily losing gold
the last few years and this is causing that
country's Reserve Bank grave concern. The
reason for this state of affairs is simply that
there is not enough gold in the reserve banks
of the nations of the free world to carry on
world trade normally. I know one cannot use
gold to eat, wear or for shelter, but nevertheless it has intrinsic value the same as diamonds, pearls or works of art. It is rare,
almost non-perishable, and it can be coined
if necessary.
Down through the ages gold has established
itself as a medium of exchange acceptable by
all nations. The International Monetary Fund
recently called for more capital by assessing
the fifty-odd free nations that subscribe to
its funds, in order to have more cash on
hand to aid countries which encounter difficulties in making their international payments. However, this move on the part of the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund
does not really add one penny to the aggregate
cash of the free nations as a whole. It merely
spreads out more thinly what they already
have. Many nations of the free world are
bidding up interest rates against other nations
in order to attract outside deposits to their
central banks so as to strengthen their reserve

FEBRUARY 15, 1962

position adequately to meet outgoing payments.
This increases the interest rates for everybody-federal government, provincial governments, municipalities, etc., and this results in
increased taxation for us all.
As already stated, the United States has
been losing gold steadily each year until now
their gold reserves are at a 25-year low. If
the United States were suddenly called on to
pay off all their temporary foreign deposits,
they would require al the nation's gold reserve to do so.
West Germany is about the only nation that
has ample supplies of gold or gold money to
meet its international commitments, if called
on. This is rather amazing. It does not produce
gold in any quantity but, starting from little
or nothing a few years ago it now has an $8
billion gold reserve which it has accumulated
by trading with other nations. West Germany
is very prosperous, with no unemployment.
At the slow rate gold is being mined at
the present time, and with expanding trade,
the situation is bound to deteriorate and restrictions on trade become more acute. I am
sure we all agree that a world based entirely
on trade with a common unit of payment is
of prime importance. Since the end of World
War II, as Prime Minister Macmillan of
Great Britain has stated, trade in the free
world has increased fourfold, but the global
money supply has only doubled. The World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund
which were set up by the free nations after
the last war were supposed to use their best
efforts toward full convertibility of money
used in trade. They have, however, made
rather slow progress. The answer to the problem, as I see it, would be to substantially
increase the price of gold. The reasons for
such increase are self-evident to many of
those who have given the situation careful
study.
Such distinguished bankers and economists
as Sir Frederic Leith Ross, former Director
of the Bank of England, and Charles Ris-k of
France, a former Governor of the Bank of
France and a noted writer on monetary
subjects, have come forward strongly for
such action. Only recently the Chairman of
the Board of Imperial Chemical Limited of
England, one of the largest industrial trading
corporations of the world, stated as follows:
One of the necessary steps for the
revival of world trade is an increase in
the price of gold. Furthermore, such a
step would place the finances of England
on a much more liquid basis and we might
say that ail other free nations would benefit.
The famous Radcliffe report on the British
economic and monetary system, prepared for

the British Government, laid great stress on
nations keeping themselves in a liquid position.
The price of $35 per ounce for gold set
up 29 years ago is all out of accord with
the present price level of other commodities.
Since the early thirties we have fought a
second World War and the Korean War, and
both have had an important effect in raising
price levels throughout the world. At that
time the United States and Canada, with a
third of their populations unemployed, nearly
went bankrupt on paper-not in real wealth
or resources-and gold was scarce and being
hoarded. President Roosevelt, after a close
study by himself and in consultation with the
world's leading monetary economists, took the
situation in hand and increased the price of
gold substantially. This was the same action
that Sir Robert Peel, Prime Minister of England, took after the Napoleonic wars which
nearly forced Europe into bankruptcy.
The President called in all the private
bank bills or notes and made a new start
with what we will call a 100 per cent purchasing federal dollar which was issued and
backed by gold at $35 per ounce. When the
price of gold was raised this stabilized the
monetary situation in America and was the
start of a prosperous era once again. One
cannot keep placing new storeys on a building year after year without at times going
back and strengthening the foundation, and
in the last two decades nations have piled
up mountains of debt on the old gold foundations which now are in sore need of strengthening because the new gold being mined is
entirely inadequate to do so.
We often hear it stated that an increase
in the price of gold would devalue the
dollar. The answer, however, is that in the
circumstances such a devaluation cannot be
carried out a second time. The devaluation
of the dollar is an accomplished fact and
cannot be undone. A dollar is simply a unit
of purchasing power, and today it will purchase only one-half what it would purchase
in commodities at the time the present gold
price was set. The use that the dollar has
is its ability to purchase a certain quantity
of goods or services. The only alternative
would be to deflate the price level of commodities and wages back to the level of
decades past. This would be impossible as
it would, if undertaken, bring ruin and unemployment on a larger scale than we have
ever known. Gold is the only important
commodity that I know of which is still
selling at pre-war prices. It is on the bargain
counter, so is it any wonder outside countries
are anxious to take gold from those nations
which produce gold, or have it, when they
can deposit 50-cent dollars and demand gold

SENATE
at pre-war prices? The price is so low in
comparison with other commodities that
there is hardly any incentive for anyone
to invest capital in or to prospect for gold.
Take Canada, for instance. There have been
no new gold mines of importance opened up
since the last war, although many hundreds
of millions of dollars worth of gold ore are
lying dormant under the ground in our north
country. This seems a very unnatural situation when there is such a great need and
market demand for gold throughout the
world. I have no personal axe to grind, as I
am neither a director nor an investor in gold
mines.
If President Roosevelt was right in 1933 in
pricing gold at the rate of $35 per ounce for
100 per cent purchasing power dollars-and
we know from experience he was-then how
can we price gold at $35 per ounce for 50-cent
purchasing power dollars? This is what we
are doing, even in Canada, and it does not
make sense. I well remember a talk I had
with the late President just before the last
world war, when our conversation included
a reference to gold. He said to me, "The
price of gold will never go down in my time,
but I cannot say but that it might not go
up again."
I understand that the International Monetary Fund, with the O.K. of the United States
and Great Britain-and I do not think there
is any problem in getting assent from the
latter-has the power to change the price
of gold at any time. If the International
Monetary Fund fails to take action in the
near future, although I feel sure it will in
time to come, I think Canada should lead the
way now and raise the price of domestic gold
to an economic level where it would give
incentive and be profitable to capital and
prospectors to invest their money in the exploration and opening of new gold mines, and
also to mine marginal properties as well as
rich ones that are now being exploited. This
would do so much toward the development of
our north country. If this were done, tens
of thousands of our people could be put to
work in the gold mining industry. As conditions are today, a hard-rock miner, with
years of experience, earns hardly as much as
common labourers in some other parts of
Canada. Our increased production would be
placed in our federal gold reserves, where it
is sorely needed. It would be paid for in noninterest bearing currency, and have a far
larger gold reserve behind it than the money
we have circulating today. Therefore, there
would be no inflation. At present the federal
Government is paying quite large subsidies,
running into millions of dollars per annum,
to the older marginal mines, which are in the

majority, in order to keep them going; otherwise, they would have to close down. This
seems to me to be a haphazard and unstable
system for the mines to operate under, as they
never know exactly what they will receive
in aid, and it is no encouragement to the
opening up of new mines.
If an economic price were paid for domestic gold in accordance with the price level of
other commodities, these subsidies would be
eliminated. If Canada applied vision and courage to the gold situation it would be a most
constructive example of what can be done
by one of the smaller nations to impress the
world that Canada was one of the first to
see the light in solving a very serious problem, which seems not to be fully comprehended by several of the larger nations. Some
of these nations do not, of course, have the
great gold-bearing territories to explore and
develop that are possessed by Canada. Only
South Africa and the Soviet Union can compete with us in this regard.
Speaking of the latter, I understand northern Siberia has the same Cambrian Shield
that Canada has, and visitors to that territory state that there bas been very great
mining development in Siberia during the last
few years. Many new, large towns have
sprung up, dependent on the product of the
mines, both precious and ordinary metals, giving employment to tens of thousands of persons. The Soviet Union is carefully conserving
its gold until now it is reliably said to have a
central reserve of around $10 billion. It is
self-evident that its object is to make the
ruble a strong unit of currency for the communist world.
As stated, we, as a gold producing country,
have before us a great opportunity to take
constructive action with regard to the world
gold situation, at comparatively little cost. If
we pass up such an opportunity, I feel that
some other nation is bound to take our place
and get credit for seizing the opportunity for
constructive action of the kind I have mentioned, which is bound to take place in due
course. It is later than we think, and the time
to act is now; for, as stated, considering our
large increase of paper money in circulation
and the great increase in our federal debt, our
gold reserves are absolutely inadequate and
may lead us into serious monetary difficulties.

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
CONSTRUCTION OF LINE FROM WHITECOURT,
ALBERTA-FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-63, respecting
the construction of a line of railway in the
Province of Alberta by Canadian National
Railway Company from Whitecourt, Alberta,
in a westerly direction for a distance of approximately 23.2 miles to the property of Pan
American Petroleum Corporation.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. John A. Buchanan, with leave, moved
the second reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, the title of
Bill C-63 pretty well describes the location
and the extent of the proposed railway. It
reads as follows:
An Act respecting the construction of
a line of railway in the Province of Alberta by Canadian National Railway Company from Whitecourt, Alberta, in a
westerly direction for a distance of approximately 23.2 miles to the property of
Pan American Petroleum Corporation.
It is my pleasure and indeed a privilege
to move second reading of this bill, particularly so because it provides for the building
of yet another link by which an important
surplus product from our natural resources
can be moved for sale to the markets of the
world.
I am happy to recommend the expenditure of money on this project because it can
and will immediately create jobs and, while
doing so, will improve our economy generally.
It will create a self-liquidating transportation asset which will serve an industrial
plant that will in turn provide employment
for the next quarter century to quite a number of employees, and during that time the
whole project is calculated to pay a reasonable return on the capital invested.
The bill will authorize the Canadian National Railway to construct a railway line in
the province of Alberta, as an extension on its

Sangudo subdivision from Whitecourt, Alberta. The line will proceed in a westerly
direction to the property of Pan American
Corporation, in the Windfall gasfield area.
The distance will be about 23 miles. The total
cost of the line is estimated to be $2,300,000,
which includes the cost of a 650-foot steel
bridge over the McLeod River. This legislation will empower the spending of a sum
not exceeding $2,645,000, which total is made
up of the estimated cost, plus 15 per cent for
contingencies.
This bill is the result of a negotiated agreement between Canadian National Railway
Company and the Texas Gulf Sulphur Company, which is building a sulphur extracting
plant on the property of Pan American Petroleum Corporation for the purpose of extracting sulphur from the sour gas in this
field. When the sulphur and other hydrocarbons are removed, the remaining gas will go
in a dry-clean form into the Alberta Southern Pipeline and will eventually be burned in
California.
The plant, when completed, will produce
approximately 650 tons of sulphur per day,
and it is anticipated that within the next
five years it will triple its output. The life
of the gasfield, and therefore of the plant,
is now estimated to be twenty-five years.
The Texas Gulf Sulphur Company's plans
call for the initial shipments of sulphur
to be made by March 1963, and the Canadian National Railways have been advised
that direct rail service will be needed by that
date. The Texas Gulf Sulphur Company has
agreed to ship a minimum volume over the
proposed line for a period of twenty-five
years, and bas guaranteed that appropriate
penalties will be paid by them to the railway
if at any period during that term the shipments fall below the minimum volume agreed
to. In addition to all of these signed guarantees, they have agreed to make a very substantial cash contribution to the cost of
construction of the line. In my opinion, honourable senators, this cash contribution is
more than generous and I heartily congratulate the Canadian National officials for having
negotiated such a favourable and equitable
agreement.
Honourable senators, it would seem to me
that nothing further of value can be contributed at this time by referring this bill
to a committee for further consideration, for
the very good reason that the whole bill
is based on a confidential, negotiated agreement between the Canadian National Railways and the Texas Gulf Sulphur Company,
which has already been officially signed. Each
signatory is most anxious that the details of
the agreement be not divulged and made

FEBRUARY 20, 1962
available to their competitors. This is understandable, for the Texas Gulf Sulphur Company is one of the greatest producers and
sellers of sulphur in the world, under the
stiffest kind of competition, and they are
not anxious to furnish their competitors with
confidential information related to their production costs. Nor should the Canadian National Railway Company, merely because it
is a Government-owned railway, be obliged
to divulge to a competing railway its technique in negotiating and finalizing a very
desirable contract.
It is most urgent that this bill be given
third reading as quickly as possible, because
the piers and abutments of the proposed
McLeod River bridge should in fact be under
construction at once. These should be installed at the very low water level before
the spring run-off. Much loss of time and
money can be saved if these are proceeded
with without even one day's delay. There
are a number of construction personnel immediately available at Whitecourt. Let us put
them to work at once.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
senator if he is suggesting to the house
that we give this bill third reading and
pass it tonight? If that is what he has in
mind, I am certainly opposing it.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: Honourable senators,
I am not asking that the bill be given third
reading tonight.
Hon. Mr. Reid: You said so.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: I asked that third
reading be given as soon as possible. Personally, I would like to see the bill get
third reading tonight but I do not expect it.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Well, I want to know more
about it.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Did you suggest that the
bill be not referred to a committee?
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: I suggested that it
need not be referred because it seems to me
that a committee hearing would probably
further delay passing of the bill at this time.
However, if honourable senators prefer that
it go to committee, I would so move.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): It is a
private bill, and I understand that al private
bills must go to committee.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No, it is a Government
bill.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I should be very sorry were we to abandon
the principle which we have invariably followed during the years I have been in this
house of referring bills of this character to

the appropriate committee. I happen to be the
Chairman of the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications, and I am
quite willing to try to arrange a meeting of
that committee some time tomorrow, if the
honourable senator wishes to have the bill
explained.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: Thank you, honourable
senator. I would be glad to have it go to the
Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, and I should be grateful if it
could be put through as quickly as possible.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Were we to hold a
meeting tomorrow, would the officers and
those interested be available as witnesses?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I have already made
some arrangements, and I believe they will
be available should the bill go to committee.
Hon. Mr. Farris: There is no danger of
dissolution?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: You are the only one who
worries about that.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker (Hon. Mr.
Choquette): Honourable senators, I assume
there will be a debate on the motion for
second reading, and at the conclusion of that
debate I shall put the question on the motion,
after which I shall ask, "When shall this bill
be given third reading?". I presume it might
then be moved that it be referred to the appropriate committee.
Hon. J. Wesley Siambaugh: Honourable
senators, may I congratulate the honourable
senator from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Buchanan)
on his explanation of this fine bill. I think it
is a very good deal for the Canadian National
Railways, but I am not so sure it is such a
good deal for some of the people living on the
right of way. This is a very important feature,
and it is one reason why I think the bill
should be referred to the appropriate committee. Alternatively, were the honourable
senator from Edmonton prepared to delete
clause 8, then I would have no objection to
the bill being passed.
I should like to read clause 8 for the benefit
of those honourable senators who may not
have read it. It states:
Except as otherwise ordered by the
Board of Transport Commissioners for
Canada, the company is not required to
fence any part of the right of way of the
railway lineThe sting is in the tail.
-and is not liable in respect of any loss
or injury sustained by reason only of
the absence of fencing.
I realize that this is quite a wild part of
the country. I know something about it. for

SENATE
I have hunted and have done some fishing
in the area. Until recently it was quite heavily
timbered, but the timber has been almost
completely cut now, and in a very short time
there may be some settlers living along the
right of way. A large part of it is not what
one would call first-class agricultural land, but
some of it is quite good.
This particular line of railway from Edmonton to Whitecourt is between 100 and 110
miles long-I am not sure of its exact length.
It passes through land which is nearly all
good for agricultural purposes and' is well
settled. All the little towns along that line
have elevators, and some have three or four.
Blue Ridge, a little town just seven or eight
miles from the end of the line, has an elevator,
but I do not think Whitecourt itself has one.
I have not been up in that area for several
years, but it did not have an elevator the last
time I was there because, as I have already
said, the surrounding area was quite heavily
timbered.
I do think that in the near future there
will be settlers living along the proposed line.
Perhaps some are already there because I
know there is more agricultural land along
the line, and if it is necesary the railway
company should have to provide fencing. If
it is not necessary, then all the railway company has to do is apply to the Board of
Transport Commissioners to be relieved of
the responsibility. That, of course, would not
relieve them of any civil liability in respect of damage caused by the absence of
fencing. If a settler's cattle get onto the tracks
and are killed the Board of Transport Commissioners cannot absolve the railway company from civil liability, but they can relieve
it of the responsibility of building a fence.
My objection to this clause in the bill,
honourable senators, is that by it the Canadian National Railway Company is asking
to be relieved, by statute, of responsibility
with respect to non-performance of duty.
Under the Railway Act at the present time the
railway company is compelled to provide
fencing unless it applies to the Board of
Transport Commissioners for permission not
to do so. If it can prove to the board that
a fence is not necessary then the board will
exempt it.
Both railway companies have hundreds of
miles of line that are not fenced, some portions of which are on the main lines. Some
fencing is still not done between Bruce and
Edmonton on the main line, but with respect
to that the railway company is taking the responsibility. If any damage is caused because the line is not fenced, the railway
company assumes the risk. I do not think it

has applied to the Board of Transport Commissioners for permission not to build a
fence. It has just left the line unfenced.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: Even after the passage
of this bill the Board of Transport Commissioners still has the right to order the railway company to fence this line, has it not?
Hon. Mr. Stanibaugh: Yes. The board certainly can order the company to fence the
line, but do you think a little settler along
the right of way is able to make application
before the board and stand up against the
solicitors of the Canadian National Railway
Company? Such a man has no chance. I know
something about that matter.
The little town of Bruce from where I
come tried to get authority from the Board
of Transport Commissioners for a right of
way across the railway tracks in order to
build a road, and the C.N.R. opposed the
application. The Board of Trade wrote letters
to the railway company, but got nowhere.
However, after I was appointed to the Senate
I took up the matter before the Board of
Transport Commissioners and obtained permission for the town to build the road.
Those poor little settlers along the right of
way, honourable senators, are not likely to
be able to present their case, unless they can
find lawyers who will work for nothing. I
want the C.N.R. to have to appear before the
Board of Transport Commissioners and ask
for the right not to build a fence. The onus
should not be placed upon the settlers along
the right of way to force the railway company
to build it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Honourable senators, I wonder if the honourable
senator would be satisfied if the last two lines
of clause 8 of the bill were deleted? If that
were done the railway company would not be
required to build the fence, but it would still
be liable for any loss or damage caused by the
absence of the fence. May I ask the honourable senator for his comment on that?
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Honourable senators,
I would say that that would improve the
situation about 50 per cent. A half loaf would
be better than no bread.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: It only goes halfway.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Yes, it would go only
halfway because if the settlers along the right
of way decided they wanted a fence they
would then have to appear before the Board
of Transport Commissioners.
In any event, honourable senators, I can
tell you that it is pretty hard to collect from
the C.N.R. I once lost some horses because
of the company's negligence, and it would not

FEBRUARY 20, 1962
pay for them. I decided that by the time I
hired a good lawyer and went ta court my
loss would be even greater, and that I would
be better off ta suifer the loss. A neighbour of
mine had a similar case against the railway
company. He took his case before the courts,
and nearly three years passed before he
finally got a settiement of $650, but his costs
were over $1,000. That stopped me and ather
farmers from trying ta collect for any stock
run over by the C.N.R.
Han. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I see that
1 should flot have asked that question.

line of railway from Sipiwesk ta a point on

Bill read first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. Arthur M. Pearson. with leave, moved
the second reading of the bull.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Hanourable senators, 1 am not rising ta abject ta second
reading of the bill naw, but I would like ta
draw to the attention of the house that this
procedure cannat be accepted as a general
practice. The honourable sponsor of this bill
(Hon. Mr. Pearson) spoke as If it were just
a matter of his asking for second readlng
now. I repeat, this cannot be accepted as a
general practice. However, as Bull C-63 has
received second reading I cannot object ta
this bill being read a second time naw. I
expect it will be referred ta, the Standing
Commlttee on Transport and Communications
for consideration along with Bill C-163.
Han. Arthur M. Pearson: Honourable senators, on December 19, 1957 I spoke in the
Senate for the first time after my appointment. My remarks at that time were on
Bill C-196, respecting the construction of a

railway Une by the Canadian National Railway Company from Optic Lake ta Chisel
Lake, and the purchase by that company
from The International Nickel Company of
Canada, Limited, of a short lime af railway
from Sipiwesk ta a point on Burntwood River
near Mystery Lake, all in the province of
Manitoba. A Uine of railway some thirty miles
long was purchased at a cast ta the Canadian
National Railway Company of some $5,400,000.
The cost of construction of the other fiftytwo miles was estimated ta be $8,840,000.
This Uine runs in an easterly direction fram
Optic Lake, a point on the Lynn Lake branch,
for some thirty-six miles, and then runs
northeasterly through to Chisel Lake. When
this bill is bef ore the committee I shaîl show
hanourable senators a map on which they
wfll be able ta see that this railway Une
runs through a great deal of tundra or low
swamp land. These flfty-two miles have now
been completed, and copper and zinc are
have been gaing over the Uine ta the Flin
Flan smelter for the past three or four
months.
Honourable senators wiil be pleased to
know that this Uine was completed at a cast
of $6,400,000 or, in other words, $2,440,000
less than was estimated. Tis would indicate that the railway company had been
careful in holding the cost down to this
amount. It would alsa indicate ta me that the
terrain was not quite as formidable as had
been anticipated in the first location surveys.
They were also able to get some good low
tenders for the construction, and the weather
conditions were favourable at the time the
line was being bult.
The Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting
Company Limited, which asked that the line
be constructed, guaranteed to transport same
350,000 tons of ore per annurn from. Chisel
Lake to FUin Flan. It was estimated that the
freight revenue on this would pay for interest
charges and cast of maintenance and still
leave a fair surplus ta the railway. The
Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Company
has now discovered additional large are
'bodies of copper and zinc at two points
north and east of Chisel Lake, one at Stal
Lake, and another at Osborne Lake some
il miles nartheast of Stail Lake. Tis company is now requesting that the Canadian
National Railways extend the present Uine
from Chisel Lake to Stail Lake, a distance
of eight miles, at an estimated cost of
$1,090,000, making a total of 60 miles of
rail line all at a cost of $7,490,000. Tis
means that there may be a balance in the
original estimated cost of $1,350,000, s0 that
Bill C-48, being an amendment to the original statute, does not; anticipate a further
appropriation.

SENATE
The Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting
Company Limited expects to transport the
ore by truck from Osborne Lake to the end
of steel at Stall Lake. The company expects
that the total increase of tonnage from these
two additional properties will be something
like 182,000 tons per annum, which means
that each year 532,000 tons would be transported to Flin Flon. If the Canadian National
Railways get the green light to construct
the additional eight miles, they expect to
have it in operation by May 1, 1963.
This construction will mean employment
for the year of at least 75 men, and the
opening of these two ore bodies will give
initial employment to some 185 men. As its
properties expand, the company expects an
increase in the number employed.
Honourable senators, Bill C-48 is an
amendment to chapter 13 of the Statutes of
Canada, 1957-58. Section 1 of the bill provides
that all that portion of the schedule in the
act relating to the line of railway described
as "Branch Line Number 1", is repealed and
the following substituted therefor:
A line of railway from a point on the
Lynn Lake railway line at or near Optic
Lake extending in an easterly direction
to a point at or near Chisel Lake and
from that point to the property of Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Company
Limited at Stall Lake, all in the province of Manitoba . . .
The part underlined in the bill constitutes
the actual amendment to the original statute
and indicates the extension of the original
Optic Lake to Chisel Lake line. The mileage
has also been increased and will appear in the
new schedule as 60 instead of 52 as in the
schedule being amended.
It will bo observed in the schedule with
the explanatory notes that the estimated average cost per mile was $170,000, whereas the
actual cost was considerably less, being
$147,333, as indicated in the new schedule on
page 1 of the bill.
Honourable senators, before concluding my
remarks I would like to give a short story
about the development which is taking place
at Thompson Lake, at which point the line
purchased from The International Nickel
Company of Canada Limited terminates. There
is now a townsite with some 5,000 or 6,000
people at Thompson and it is estimated that
by 1966 the population will increase to about
17,500. There is a large shopping plaza about
600 by 200 feet in size, housing four large
chain stores which are well known throughout Canada. The town will have a population
of some 12,000 by next year. It is expanding
steadily and business people are moving into

the outskirts. From what I have read and
heard from people who have been to Thompson, the openings for business people and a
tourist trade are almost unlimited. There is,
however, a great need for social activities. The
Government of Manitoba is pushing the construction of a highway from Lake Winnipeg
to Lake Manitoba, and a bridge has been completed across the Saskatchewan River at
Grand Rapids, towards the northwest end of
Lake Winnipeg. This road will probably be
completed to the town of Thompson in another
year, and will result in additional business
opportunities. Every person I have spoken to
bas been enthusiastic about this northern area,
and I understand the need for workers is still
great. International Nickel has taken on men
with little or no experience and has promoted
them quickly if they showed an ability to
work. I have been told that if some of our
unemployed would make an effort to get into
that country they would soon find work, and
thus reduce the number of unemployed in
large centres.
Honourable senators, I would like to refer
to a news item whicb appeared in the Winnipeg Tribune on November 2 of last year. It
refers to the multi-million dollar Thompson
Plaza shopping centre, which, as I said before,
is 600 feet long and 200 feet wide, with stores
located around its perimeter. The article
speaks of the search for nickel in northern
Manitoba, and I read this one short extract:
This search culminated in the $175 million mining and smelting complex, with
associated hydro-electric development, at
Thompson-and the growth of the town
named after Inco executive Dr. John
Thompson.
A "model" town, carved out of a wooded
area laced with lakes and swift rivers,
400 air miles north of Winnipeg, is the
picture which greets visitors today.
The people of Manitoba consider that
Thompson is the fastest growing town in
the west and they are looking for great things
from that northern area.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I gather from the explanation of the honourable senator from Lumsden (Hon. Mr. Pearson) that the only reason this bill is required is to permit the construction of an
extension of eight miles of track to these new
developments, over and beyond the 52 miles
authorized by the statute of 1957, and that no
additional expense is involved for the reason
that the Canadian National Railway Company
managed to build the 52 miles very much more
cheaply than it had anticipated and now finds
that with the original appropriation it can

Hon. Mr. White: The first table gives the
total number of approved applications for
maies and females who have completed or
are stili taking university training. The second
table gives the number of students who have
completed or are still taking post-secondary
school training.
This act has thus proved to be a most useful
piece of veterans legislation, both for the
familles it was intended to help and for the
country as a whole.
The amendments in the present bill are
primarily intended to give effect to the
Government's wish to provide assistance on
the basis of the increased expenditures which
are now required, and to enable completion
of courses wbich are now cut short because
of the limits at present imposed on maximum
age and length of period of assistance.
The annual total cost as a resuit of this
amendment is estimated at $7 1,000.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): For how
many years hence?
Hon. Mr. White: 1 sbould say to the honourable leader that the age limit bas been extended to 30 years i certain courses.
At present the act provides for a maximum
period of assistance of 36 months or four
academic years. Further, that assistance may
not be granted beyond the academic year in
which the student attains age 25. A number
of cases have corne to attention ini which a
meritorîous student has embarked upon a
sound educational programi requiring university training exceeding four years, such
as a course in law or medicine. It does not
seem right that sucb a student shouid be cut
off from. assistance while hie is only part way
througb bis course and shows promise of
being able scholastically to complete it with
distinction. It is therefore proposed that the
minister have discretion to authorize the extension of the period during which assistance
may be granted, so that such a student may
continue to receive assistance until the completion of an approved course of study which
will lead to a definite goal.
There have also been a number of instances
in wbich, through a combination of circumstances, students have been unable to commence their courses, usually for health or
economic reasons, by age 21, as at present is
generally required. It is therefore proposed,
where circumstances warrant, to permit such
a student to be enrolled under this act. Where
a student has been delayed in comniencing or
continuing his higher education it is proposed
to permit himi to receive assistance, where the
special circumstances and his progress warrant it, Up to the end of the academic year
in wbich he attains the age of 30 years.
There are two or three clarifications proposed in the definition of a "student" in order
26211-3-13

to grant assistance to a number who seem to
faîl witbin the original intention of the legisiation but who through tecbnicalities in the
interpretation of the present definition are
excluded.
It is obvious from the figures I have given
that the Cbildren of War Dead Act, commonly
known as the Educational Assistance Act, has
been very successful.,I think that Parliamient,
and those members of the House of Commons
wbo were responsible for this measure, may
feel quite pleased that by this legislation
2,500 orphan children have been given the
means to pursue higher education which
would not have been normally available to
tbem.
When one considers the various courses
which these students have pursued, and the
fact that they do not receive their allowances
unless they prove tbey are capable of continuing the courses, honourable senators will appreciate that this has been a very useful piece
of legisiation. It is only fitting that orphan
children of those who have lost their lives in
defence of our country should receive this
type of help. It is only the type of help which,
had the fathers lived, the children would
perhaps have received tbrough parental resources; but, because tbey are handicapped
by the loss of a parent, they then become
wards of the state with respect to education.
I think it is highly creditable to Canada that
such provision bas been made for these
children.
Honourable senators, 1 commend very
heartily this amendment for your consideration.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Honourable senators, I would also conunend this bil
to the favourable consideration of the bouse.
This legisiation bas been of great belp to those
wbo bave been lef t witbout a father. I ask
the sponsor of the bill if it applies to, orphans
only? Does it apply to a 100 per cent pensioner
who is not in a position to give bis child an
education, or does it apply only to cbildren
of those who lost their lives in eitber of the
two world wars?
Han. Mr. White: Honourable senators, my
information is tbat it applies only to the
orpbans of veterans who lost their lives in
tbe war, or subsequent to the war and attrîbutable to war service.
Hon. Mr. Burchili: Honourable senators, the
sponsor of the bull indicated that students
were not permitted to continue their studies
unless they were worthy. Who makes the
decision as to the wortbiness of a student?
Hon. Mr. White: I do not think 1 indicated

SENATE

that. I may have indicated that that is so in
the case of students who are allowed to
continue their studies to age 30. Such cases
are in the discretion of the minister, and
those students have to attain a certain degree
of efficiency each year. But in ordinary circumstances I do not think students have to
come up to a certain standard. It is sufficient if they pass.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, when shall this bill be read a third
time?
Hon. Mr. White moved that the bill be
placed on the Orders of the Day for third
reading at the next sitting.
Motion agreed to.
CIVILIAN WAR PENSIONS
ALLOWANCES ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND

AND

READING

Leave having been given to proceed with
Order No. 4:
Hon. George S. White moved the second
reading of Bill C-64, to amend the Civilian
War Pensions and Allowances Act.
He said: Honourable senators, in moving
second reading of this bill may I say that
the bill does not seek to amend the present
act in any way, but it would add an entirely
new part.
The purpose of the new Part XI is to
make certain amendments to recognize certain groups which served during World War
II under difficult and dangerous conditions
but which have not received the same attention as veterans.
The intention of the amendment is to
bring persons in these categories, not under
the War Veterans Allowance Act, but ta
make available to them the assistance that is
provided to veterans under that act.
The Civilian War Pensions and Allowances
Act was passed in 1946 to provide pensions
to members of a number of civilian groups
who became disabled while furthering the
national war effort and to dependents of
those who lost their lives as a direct result of
enemy action.
The word "allowances" in the title has so
far referred to detention allowances which
were paid to merchant seamen if they were
detained or imprisoned by another country.
The allowances compensated for the loss of
wages suffered because of detention.
The present act is administered by the
Canadian Pension Commission. The Act as
amended will be administered by the War
Veterans Allowance Board.

The groups to whom it is proposed that
allowances be made available are:
(1) World War I. The Canadian Merchant
Marine and those Canadians who served in
the merchant services of the allies.
There were 39 merchant ships of Canadian
registry during World War I, and a number
of Newfoundland registry. A small number
of Canadians served in British and allied
merchant shipping. It is estimated that about
5,000 merchant seamen served in all these
ships. Most seamen served in dangerous
waters. We cannot determine accurately the
number of these who survive, but a careful
estimate indicates that only a few hundred
seamen and their widows are now alive. The
annual cost is estimated at about $105,000.
As this group is decreasing because of advanced age, the cost will drop quickly.
(2) World War II. Canadian Merchant
Marine and those Canadians who served with
Canada's allies on certified non-Canadian
ships.
There were 194 merchant ships of Canadian
registry and a number of Newfoundland
registry. Canadian seamen served in many
certified non-Canadian ships, including a
number who served under an agreement with
the British Admiralty, known as the T-124
agreement, which applied to service on such
ships as armed merchant cruisers and rescue
tugs. It is estimated that there are about
20,000 survivors of all these groups, including widows and orphan children, and that
about 400 would now qualify for allowances
on the basis of service eligibility consisting of
at least six months spent at sea during the
war and including at least one voyage through
dangerous waters, or the award of a pension
or detention allowance under this act. The
estimated present annual cost of allowances
to this group is $500,000.
(3) World War II. Corps of (civilian) Canadian Fire Fighters for Service in the United
Kingdom.
This corps was organized in Canada for
service in Britain, to assist the National Fire
Service in combatting fires caused by enemy
air raids. Members were required to serve
for the duration of the war, or as long thereafter as necessary. Of the 422 fire fighters
who enrolled in the corps, 408 served in
Britain and had all arrived there by December 1942. Complete service records of this
corps are available. It is proposed that service
eligibility for allowances will require a continuous period of at least six months spent
in Britain prior to May 9, 1945, or the award
of -a pension under this act, and that the
widows and orphan children of deceased
members who saw such service be also
eligible. The estimated annual cost is $12,000.

FEBRUARY 20. 1962
(4) World War I. Voluntary Aid Detachment.
This detachment was selected by the St.
John Ambulance Brigade and sent to Britain
to assist the Women's V.A.D. of the British
Red Cross. They served in Imperial hospitals
in Britain and on the continent, having proceeded overseas between September 1916 and
September 1918. 0f the total of 360 who
proceeded overseas, 54, including 12 from.
Newfoundland, served on the continent of
Europe. Nominal rails are available. The bull
provides that members of titis detachment
and the orphan children of deceased members
be eligible for ailowances provided that before November 12, 1918 they served on the
continent or at least 365 days in Britain, including sailing time from, Canada and on
return during the period of hostilities or,
alternatively, were pensioned under titis act.
(5) World War IL. Overseas welfare workers.
This was a group o! women who served
overseas under the auspices of the Canadian
Red Cross Society, the St. John Ambulance
Brigade and the Scottish Ministry o! Health.
There were 861 workers who left Canada
for service overseas. It is proposed that, as
these workers served in Britain and on the
continent under hazardous conditions, they
and the orphan children of deceased workers
be eligible for allowances, provided they
served averseas for a continuous period of
at least six months, or are pensioned under
this act. The annual cost would be very small.
(6) World War II. Canadian civilian air
crew of the Royal Air Force Transport Command.
These men were first employed in 1940 as
civilians ta fiy bombers and other aircraft
acrass the Atlantic. In 1941 the organization
was taken over by the R.A.F. Transport
Command. At the conclusion of hostilities
there were 269 Canadian survivors of titis
group. Complete records are available. The
members suffered a fatal casualty rate of 20
per cent. It is proposed that those who served
as air crew for at least six months during
the war and who made at least one ocean
crossing, and the widows and orphan children
of deceased members, be eligible for allowances. The annual cost would be very small.
(7) World War II. Newfoundland Overseas
Forestry 'Unit.
Titis group was recruited in Newfoundland
at the request of the British Government.
The earlier contracts were for six months
only, but subsequent contracts were for the
duration of the war. They were engaged ini
the cutting of pit props for coal ntines, an
activity vital ta the war economy. They
served mostly in Scotland. Of the total of
26211-3-13J

3,680 who went overseas, about 3,100 remained as civilians, as some of the ftrst group
joined the forces. The group suffered about
30 fatal accidents and 335 were repatriated on
medical grounds. Records are virtuaily complete. It is proposed that the members of this
unit who contracted to serve with the unit
for the duration of the war and who served
in Britain for at least six months, and the
widows and orphan children of deceased members with this service, be eligible for allowances. The present annual cost is estimated
at $60,000.
Honourable senators, I would commend this
bill to your earnest consideration. I feel you
will ail agree that these men, their dependants, widows and orphans, are entitled to
the benefits which we now propose making
available to them.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, as usual the honourable senator
from Hastings-Frontenac (Hon. Mr. White) has
given a clear and concise explanation of legislation that he has presented to titis house;
and, once again, I join with him in commending it to your favourable consideration.
I must say, however, I regret that the bull
does not go much further, especially with
regard to one group of those who served their
country well during the Second Worid War.
I refer ta the Corps of Fire Fighters.
Honourable senators will recail that in the
early days of the war, especially in 1941 and
1942, there was great destruction in many
cities throughout England and Scotland, fires
raged almost every night in many cities
in those two heroic lands, and thousands of
people were killed.
As a resuit of those fires the British Government asked Canada to raise a Corps of Fire
Fighters. After Canada had agreed to take
this step a pamphlet concerning the matter was
distributed among the armed forces in Canada
and those who had had previous experience
as firemen were asked to volunteer for this
new corps. In the first place, I would point
out that these men had volunteered for overseas service in the armed forces, but when the
call came and the great need arose for fire
fighters ta save, in many instances, the lives
of British people, these men gladly answered
that cail. I shouid remind honourable senators
that at that time the Canadian armed forces
were not engaged in battle, although they
were prepared for it, and indeed, some were
overseas. As I say, there was this cail to themn
to go over ta Britain iminediately, to be ini
the firing lime, as it were, right away; and
they responded.
Over 400 volunteered for this service. They
transferred from the arrned forces to another
branch, they thought, of the armed forces.
When serving with the fire figliters I do not

SENATE
think there was one of those men who did not
feel he was serving his country just as well
and in just as dangerous a position as if he
were serving in the regular armed forces.
Such men were going immediately into the
line of battle. Al the men who joined that
force say they received the impression that
when they returned they were to get every
consideration given to a returned veteran.
They have made statements that upon leaving
Canada they were addressed by Canadian
generals who assured them that they would
receive every consideration.
They arrived in England when the bombs
were fauing upon the city of London. What
did they do? They went immediately into
action because they had been trained in fire
fighting. The rest of us who happened to be
there-I was there for a short time-ran for
cover when the bombs fell, but not so the
members of the fire fighting corps. They had
to stay where there was danger and fight the
fires, with the result that a number were
killed and many wounded.
Honourable senators, do you not think that
they should be considered as veterans in the
same way as those who served in the line
in the First and Second World Wars? But
no; these men came home and were not
considered veterans. They were treated as
civilians. They were not civilians, of course,
because they had special uniforms. They were
under the command of an officer, under strict
discipline, and they received the same pay
as did the men in the armed forces, but for
some reason or other they were not considered
veterans.
These men have been accepted into the
membership of the Royal Canadian Legion,
but when the veterans' charter was drawn up
they were not included, and did not get the
benefits of the charter. You will be surprised,
honourable senators, when I inform you that
they did not get the benefit of the Supervisors
War Service Benefits Act. Under that act
every supervisor, as defined, was deemed to
be a veteran within the meaning of the
Veterans' Land Act, the Veterans Insurance
Act, the Veterans Rehabilitation Act, the War
Veterans' Alowance Act, the Unemployment
Insurance Act, and the Veterans' Business
and Professional Loans Act.
Who were considered veterans under that
act? The fire fighters who went through the
bombing of the city of London were not
considered veterans, but those who served in
the Canadian Legion War Services Incorporated, the National Council of the Young Men's
Christian Associations of Canada, the Knights
of Columbus Canadian Army Huts, and the
Salvation Army Canadian War Services were
considered veterans.

I do not speak disparagingly, honourable
senators, of anyone who served in those
auxiliary services, but I do wonder if persons
who served in those services are considered
veterans, how we can leave out the fire
fighters.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Would the honourable
leader mind telling me when that act was
passed?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): It was
passed in 1946. It has been in effect since the
close of the last war. I commend the Government for making some improvement in it, but
it is very difficult for me to understand why
that was not done earlier. I do not understand
why the Government which I supported did
not improve the act, and why this Government
has taken five years to do it. What is more
difficult to understand is why, when the
present administration saw that some injustice
had been done, it has not gone all the way.
I would also point out to honourable senators that the men who served in the Corps of
Canadian Fire Fighters are not entitled to
wear the Canadian Volunteer Service Medal,
although those who served in the Canadian
Legion War Services Incorporated, the National Council of the Young Men's Christian
Associations of Canada, the Knights of Columbus Canadian Army Huts and the Salvation
Army Canadian War Services are entitled to
wear that medal.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Do you know if they wear
a special medal?
Hon. Mr. Baird: Honourable senators, what
about the conscientious objectors?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: There's a bombshell.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): I think
the honourable senator from St. John's (Hon.
Mr. Baird) might ask that question later. I
am sure he will support me in my contention
that these benefits should be given to those
who fought as fire fighters and who volunteered to serve during the war. These men
would have gone to France to put out fires.
They would have gone anywhere. They were
not conscientious objectors-oh, no; far from
it. I ask honourable senators why they should
not receive the Canadian Volunteer Service
Medal when others who were in no greater
danger did receive it.
Of course, honourable senators, it is impossible for this house to go any further. To
give the full benefits of a veteran to the fire
fighters would require the expenditure of
money, so our hands are tied. I do trust,
however, now that the Government has gone
this far that it will go all the way and will
give these men who risked their lives, who
volunteered to serve anywhere, at least the

same rights as those who served in less
dangerous positions and who never volunteered for active service.

UNIVERSAL COPYRIGHT CONVENTION
MOTION FOR APPROVAL-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson, pursuant to
notice, moved:
That it is expedient that the Houses of
Parliament do approve the Universal
Copyright Convention signed by Canada
in Geneva in 1952 and Protocol 3 thereto,
and that this house do approve the same.
He said:
Honourable senators, the Universal Copyright Convention was signed in Geneva on
September 6, 1952, by eighty-six countries,
including Canada.
It came into being under the auspices of
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization--UNESCO. It has now
been ratified by thirty-nine countries, including the United Kingdom, the United
States, France and the Federal Republic of
Germany.
The introduction indicates the conviction of
the contracting states that the proposed
system of copyright protection is one which
is "appropriate to all nations of the world" and
which should be "additional to, and without
impairing international systems already in
force".

Article I sets forth the types of works which
will be covered by the convention. These are,
literary, scientific and artistic works, including
writings, musical, dramatic and cinematographic works, and paintings, engravings and
sculpture.
Article II sets forth the requirement that
published and unpublished works of nationals
of any contracting state, and works first
published in that state, shall enjoy domestic
protection in each other contracting state, and
permits contracting states, for purposes of the
convention, to assimilate to its own nationals
any person domiciled in that state.
Article III provides that any contracting
state which, under its domestic law, requires
compliance with certain formalities as a condition of copyright shall regard these requirements as satisfied with respect to all works
protected by the convention and first published outside its territory and the author of
which is not one of its nationals, if from
the time of first publication all the copies of
the work bear the symbol "C" in a circle
accompanied by the name of the copyright
proprietor and the year of first publication,
in a reasonably prominent manner.
Since 1896 Canada has been a member of
the organization known as the Berne Unionthe International Union for the Protection of
Intellectual Property-and under the Canadian Copyright Act we have several bilateral
arrangements including a treaty with the
United States, as well as some other countries.
The United States never was, and is not now,
a member of the Berne Union.
Membership in the Berne Union, and under
the provisions of these bilateral arrangements means that works of Canadian origin
receive copyright protection in the member
countries and in the countries with whom the
arrangements exist, in return for reciprocal
protection in Canada.
Tre question that arises is: If Canada is a
member of the Berne Union, and is a party to
these other bilateral arrangements, why
should we become partners in the Universal
Copyright Convention? The reason is to be
found mainly in the fact that, especially in regard to our bilateral arrangements with the
United States, there exist certain disabilities
which are disagreeable to Canada but which
will become nullified upon ratification of this
convention.
First, however, let me summarize the effect
of the Universal Copyright Convention.
The Universal Copyright Convention, in
general terms, assures to an author who is a
national of a member state, or who first
publishes in that state, national treatment in
each other member state. By "national treatment", I mean such treatment as is accorded

FEBRUARY 20, 1962
nationals of the state concerned under the domestic law of that state. The convention sets
forth the types of works to which member
states will guarantee protection, and stipulates the minimum periods for which such
protection will be granted, that is, the "term"
of protection. The convention provides that
any member state which, under its domestic
law, requires certain formalities, including
printing in that state, registration, deposit,
etc., as a condition of copyright, will regard
such requirements satisfied with respect to the
works protected by the convention first published outside its territory, and the author
of which is not one of its nationals, if a
specified simple formality is observed, namely,
as I said a moment ago, that all copies bear
a symbol-the letter "C" in a circle-and
carry the name of the copyright owner and
the year of first publication of the work.
I come now to the main reason for Canada's
ratification. The principal advantage to Canada
bears on the effect of such ratification on
Canada's copyright relations with the United
States. There are also some minor advantages, namely, in the wider international copyright affiliations which Canada will acquire,
resulting in the protection of Canadian works
in those member states to which Canada is not
already bound by treaty or arrangement, and,
of course, a reciprocal obligation on the
part of Canada to grant protection to the
works of authors of those states; also in the
easing of formal requirements in those states
whose domestic laws may contain more stringent demands in this respect.
Since 1891 the United States has had
certain printing or, as they are alternatively
called, "manufacturing" provisions in its act,
and from 1909 its law provided that the owner
of the copyright in a book or periodical first
published outside the United States in the
English language could obtain copyright
protection in the United States for five years
from first publication, but that if there was
imported into the United States more than
1,500 copies of the work during that period
the United States copyright ceased.
Honourable senators will observe that the
United States "manufacturing" clause is a
mandatory requirement of the United States
law. It abolishes copyright protection on
non-compliance, namely, if more than 1,500
copies of the work are imported into the
United States during the five-year period, and
and it has resulted in compelling the owner
of copyright works in English to print them
in the United States as a condition of enjoying
copyright protection in that country.
The effect of these requirements of United
States law on the Canadian printing and
publishing industry is readily apparent. Any
Canadian author writing in the English

language, who anticipates an appreciable sale
of his work in the United States, bas his work
published in that country to assure his copyright protection there. The Canadian printing
and publishing industry is thus denied this
business. Canadian authors, for their part,
must compete with American authors for the
attention and favour of American publishers;
they may be required to accept contracts on
less favourable terms than they might secure
from a Canadian publishing industry, and are
indeed in some danger of losing their Canadian identity.
It would appear, therefore, that it is very
much in the interests of Canadian literature,
of Canadian authors, and of the Canadian
printing and publishing industry, that this
measure be taken to make the manufacturing
clauses of the United States copyright law
inoperative so far as Canadian authors are
concerned.
As honourable senators are no doubt aware,
a few years ago there was appointed by the
government of that day the royal commission on Copyright, the head of which was
the Honourable Mr. Justice J. L. Ilsley, former
Minister of Finance. That commission had the
following to say in its report on this subject:
The so-called "manufacturing clause"
in the United States copyright law is
another difnculty for Canadian printers
and publishers. Under the terms of this
clause, a book, periodical, or newspaper
must be printed in the United States to
enjoy full copyright protection there.
Copies printed outside the United States
are granted only "ad interim" copyright
protection for a period of five years from
first publication.
And this only on condition that not more
than 1,500 copies are imported. And even
if a work under ad interim protection is not
printed in the United States within the five
years, copyright protection ceases.
Quoting further from the Commission's
report:
The situation could be rectified immediately if Canada would ratify the
Universal Copyright Convention, of which
the United States is a member-and, indeed, to an extent the sponsoring nation.
Immediate ratification would free Canadian authors, printers and publishers from
the requirement to print in the United
States within the five-year period, and
wouid also permit them to export over
1,500 copies. Moreover, they would be
relieved of certain other requirements
respecting United States registration and
notice.
It may be rather surprising that Canada
should not have taken some steps prior to
this time in regard to this obvious disability

SENATE
of Canadian authors under United States law.
However, it should be said that in 1923 we
amended our Copyright Act by inserting
therein certain manufacturing or printing
clauses of our own, presumably to compensate
for those in the United States law; but due
to the limitations in taking such action, which
were represented by Canada's membership
in the Berne Union, the Canadian clauses
were operative only at the discretion of the
minister, and indeed these provisions, I am
informed, were resorted to on only two occasions, and have not been generally applied.
Conequently, they have been quite abortive
as far as any attempt is concerned to deal
with Canadian authors or their works in a
manner similar to the method adopted in the
United States in this regard.
There are three protocols attached to the
convention, and the question arises as to the
ratification of these as well.
Without going into detail as to the content
of these protocols, I just wish to remark that
only one of them, namely, the third one, is
to be ratified at this time. The reason for the
non-ratification of the first two is that they
cannot be implemented without amendment
to our legislation. Presumably, therefore,
these will be ratified when a new Canadian
copyright act is enacted.
In that regard, may I say that the Ilsley
Royal Commission reported on the subject
of copyright in various ways, as a result of
which it is expected that a completely new
copyright act will be introduced in Parliament in due course.
Consequently, it is proposed that protocol
3 of the convention be ratified now.
Honourable senators, I submit that it is in
the interests of Canada to ratify this convention.
Hon. Mr. Wall: May I point out to the honourable sponsor of the bill that I do not recall receiving a copy of the Universal Copyright Convention, although I may have a copy
somewhere in my file.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: As far as I know,
copies have been distributed to all senators.
Hon. Mr. Wall: Then I apologize. Could the
honourable senator tell us when the United
States ratified this convention?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: My honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Davies) says 1954. It was
signed in 1952.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Davies, debate adjourned.
PRIVATE BILL
COCHIN PIPE LINES LTD.-SECOND READING

Hon. John A. Buchanan moved second reading of Bill S-6, to incorporate Cochin Pipe
Lines Ltd.

He said: Honourable senators, Bill S-6 is to
incorporate Cochin Pipe Lines Ltd. The original petition was made by five residents of
the city of Edmonton, all Canadians, the first
three named being Ronald Banister, Jack
Cressey and Olaf Johanson, who are all connected with Banister Pipe Line Construction
Company. Ronald Banister is president and the
other two are vice-presidents. The remaining
two petitioners, Mackenzie Downey and John
Prowse are both lawyers of the city of Edmonton and with others do the legal work
for the Banister Construction Company.
The proposed company will be capitalized
at four million shares of no par value, and it
is believed that they will be offered at $1 per
share.
The pipe line will be wholly owned and
financed by Canadians and will be constructed for the purpose of carrying oil and
oil products between the provinces of Alberta
and Saskatchewan, initially. With an eye to
the future, the company seeks powers that
would enable it to construct a pipe line in
the United States, if at some future time
this should be required.
At the present moment the petitioners are
preparing for a capacity demand in the
exchange of oil products between the two
provinces, which will replace some trucking
of the products now being done, and they
anticipate continued growth and demand
which will justify a pipe line connecting the
two provinces.
Honourable senators, I am not too familiar
with all the details of this project, and I
would prefer to have any information honourable senators may require given in committee, where the solicitors for the Cochin
Pipe Lines Ltd. will be present to answer all
of your questions.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Will the honourable senator tell us the point of origin and the point
of destination of the pipe line?
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: That is one piece of
information I do not have.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Have you any information on the capacity of the pipe line?
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: No, I have not that
information either.
Motion agreed to and bill read second

AUTHORIZATION FOR CONSTRUCTION OF LINE
FROM WHITECOURT, ALBERTA-REPORT
OF COMMITTEE ADOPTED
Hon. Mr. Hugessen reported that the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications had considered Bill C-63, respecting the
construction of a line of railway in the province of Alberta by Canadian National Railway
Company from Whitecourt, Alberta, in a
westerly direction for a distance of approximately 23.2 miles to the property of Pan
American Petroleum Corporation, and had
directed him to report the same to the Senate
with the following amendment:
Page 3, lines 16 to 20 both inclusive:
Strike out clause 8.
The Hon. ihe Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen moved that the repoirt
be adopted.
He said: Honourable senators, I think perhaps the Senate should be given a short explanation of the amendment which the committee adopted this morning.
The amendment had relation to the matter
which was discussed at some length in the
Senate yesterday evening with respect to
section 8 of this bill, which, as honourable
senators will recall, exempted the Canadian
National Railway Company from the requirement to fence any part of the right of way.
In several past instances provisions of this
kind have been inserted in bills relating to
railways to be constructed in completely unpopulated areas of the country, but the question was raised before the committee as to
whether or not this particular railway goes
through unpopulated areas of the country. The
committee was advised that if section 8 was
struck out of the bill the effect would be that,
because the Railway Act requires railway
companies to build fences and cattle guards

along their prospective rights of way, it would
become necessary for the company to apply
to the Board of Transport Commissioners
for permission not to do that. The board will
give the company that permission if it finds
that fencing is unnecessary. That, really,
would be the only effect of striking this section out of the bill. The burden of proof that
fences are unnecessary on this particular line
of railway will be placed where the majority
of the committee seemed to think it should
be placed, namely, upon the Canadian National Railways. If there is, in fact, no settlement along the line then it will be quite easy
for the railway company to obtain the necessary order from the Board of Transport Commissioners exempting it from the necessity
of building fences.
I should add, perhaps, for the benefit of
honourable senators who were not present at
the meeting of the Committee on Transport
and Communications this morning, that we
were delighted to have the Minister of Transport present. He was very helpful to us, and
he did not indicate any particular objection
to the striking out of this section of the bill.
Report adopted.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: Honourable senators,
in view of the fact that there is some urgency
with respect to this measure, and because the
bill must now go back to the other place, I
move, with leave of the Senate, that it be
read a third time now.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is not often that an
amended bill is read the third time on the
same day it is reported out of committee.
What is the urgency?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Perhaps I may be
allowed to indicate to honourable senators
the urgency in this matter-that is, unless
my honourable friend from Edmonton (Hon.
Mr. Buchanan) wishes to do so.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is moved by the Honourable Senator
Buchanan, seconded by the Honourable Senator Blois, that this bill as amended be read
the third time now. Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: Honourable senators,
the explanation of the urgency is that if
this line is to be built the company must
start work on the construction of certain
piers, and so forth, before the spring, and
the sooner this bill is passed the better
it will be for all concerned.

FEBRUARY 21, 1962
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Perhaps I can support
what the honourable senator from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Buchanan) has said.
The officers of the Canadian National
Railways told the committee this morning
that they, and the company which is going
to use this line, are anxious to have it completed within a year. An important part of
the building of this railway is the construction of a bridge across a river, the foundations for which have to be laid before the
river thaws, and there is a very short time
in which to do that. If the bill is delayed
and those foundations cannot be built before
the spring thaw the company will have to
wait another year. That seemed to the committee to be a reasonable explanation of
the urgency.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Is the precedent for this
Mr. Howe's famous bill?
Hon. Mr. S±ambaugh: Honourable senators,
perhaps I have been more responsible than
anyone for holding up the passage of this
bill. I now wish to support my honourable
colleague from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) and agree to third reading now.
Motion agreed to and bill, as amended,
read third time and passed.

EXPORT CREDITS INSURANCE ACT
BILL TO AMEND-MOTION FOR SECOND
READING-DEBATE CONTINUED

Hon. Fred. M. Blois moved the second reading of Bill C-68, to amend the Export Credits
Insurance Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to amend the Export Credits
Insurance Act. The original act was given
royal assent in 1944 and was first used in 1945.
I do not think it is necessary for me at this
time to go into the details of the original act,
for it has been before this honourable house
on several occasions and was amended during
the sessions of 1953-54, 1957, 1957-58, 1959.
and 1960-61.
The first proposed amendment in Bill C-68
is to subsection (1) of section 5, which at
present reads:
The corporation shall be under the
management of a board of directors composed of the members of the corporation
26211-3-14J

and not more than five other directors
appointed from time to time by the Governor in Council, one of whom shall be
appointed by the Governor in Council to
be president and general manager of the
corporation.
This subsection (1) is repealed and a new
subsection substituted therefor, as follows:
The corporation shall be under the
management of a board of directors composed of the members of the corporation
and not more than six other directors
appointed from time to time by the Governor in Council, one of whom small be
appointed by the Governor in Council to
be president and general manager of the
corporation.
The purpose of the amendment is to provide for an increase in the total number of
directors from five to six. I am informed that
the reason the Government is asking for an
additional director is to make it easier for the
board of directors to operate. As honourable
senators no doubt are aware, the directors
are all men holding key positions in various
branches of the Government service, and from
time to time it is necessary for them to travel
throughout Canada and elsewhere.
At the present time the quorum of the board
is four and for this reason the members often
find it difficult to hold a meeting. As I have
said, the Government feels that an additional
director would help to ease the situation,
hence this request for an additional director.
So that honourable members may be acquainted with the persons who head this
corporation, and why they have to be away
from time to time, I thought I should name
the present members. The chairman is Mr.
James A. Roberts, Deputy Minister of Trade
and Commerce, and Mr. K. W. Taylor, C.B.E.,
Deputy Minister of Finance is a member.
The directors are, Mr. H. I. Aitken, President
and General Manager; Mr. A. F. W. Plumptre,
C.B.E., Assistant Deputy Minister of Finance;
Mr. L. C. Audette, Q.C., Chairman of the Tariff Board; Mr. Denis Harvey, Assistant Deputy
Minister of Trade and Commerce; and Mr.
A. E. Ritchie, Assistant Under-Secretary -of
State for External Affairs.
In addition, the board has an advisory
council at the present time of 13 membersthere could be 15 according to the act-representing industry from various sections of
Canada.
It might be of interest to honourable senators to know just how this act has worked
in practice. The Export Credits Insurance
Corporation operates in two main fields.
First it provides export credits insurance to

SENATE
protect Canadian exporters against non-payment by foreign buyers and, secondly, it provides funds for long-term financing.
By the operation of section 14, there is
provided a maximum liability of $200 million
under which the corporation may take on
risks for its own account.
Under section 21, there is an additional
$200 million under which the Governor in
Council may specifically instruct the corporation to provide insurance in cases where the
board of directors is of the opinion that the
contract would impose on the corporation
a liability for a term or an amount in excess
of that which the corporation would normally
undertake. The risk involved in any policy
issued under this section is carried by the
Consolidated Revenue Fund.
Under section 14 of the act, during 1961
the board insured contracts of $65.6 million
and, in addition, there was outstanding from
preceding years, $66.3 million. The total
amount of contracts insured from 1945 until
December 31, 1961, was $640 million. Claims
paid to date on these insured contracts
amounted to $10.5 million. However, to offset this amount, more than $8 million of
claim loss has been recovered and it is expected more will be collected. The total insurance premium collected on the $640 million
insured contracts was $6.2 million. The operating expenses in this connection amounted
to $1.8 million.
Under section 21 of the act, during 1961,
the board insured $66.4 million, and the outstanding insured accounts from previous years
amounted to $165 million. The total amount
of contracts insured under this section to
December 31, 1961, amounted to $415 million
and the corporation has not paid one single
claim.
It is not the intention of the corporation to
subsidize exports, but neither is it trying to
make a profit. In the long run the premiums
should just about cover the operating expenses
and net losses.
In June of 1961 the Export Credits Insurance Act was amended to provide a fund
of $200 million under which long-term export
financing would be provided to help Canadian
exporters of capital goods compete on credit
terms equivalent to those available from other
capital goods exporting countries.
Canadian capital goods exporters, with this
support, have been encouraged to seek orders
abroad. To date, contracts involving exports
of $41 million are in process of manufacture
and shipping. This covers four purchase orders
and, it is estimated, will provide over 5.7
million man-hours of work. In addition, $31
million of contracts have been guaranteed and
are, or soon will be, in production. In addition

to the $41 million of contracts in production
or shipped and the $31 million which have
been guaranteed and are now in process of
production, $114 million of contracts have
been approved in principle. That is, the Government is willing to guarantee these contracts
if and when the exporter comes along with
properly signed export orders. Thus we see
that out of $200 million available a total of
$186 million has been committed, leaving an
uncommitted balance of only $14 million.
It should, I think, be noted that Government
export financing for capital goods sold on
extended term credit is available to help exporters compete for foreign business requiring
credit terms longer than five years. Such longterm financing for exports is not usually available from banks or other commercial sources.
The Export Credits Insurance Corporation,
under section 21-A of the act, deals directly
with the Canadian exporter. It is the exporter
himself who develops the foreign business and
negotiates the financing arrangements with
the corporation. Payments for the equipment
are made direct by the corporation to the
exporter just as if the foreign buyer had made
a cash purchase. The Canadian exporter has
no finance charges to absorb. The foreign
buyer is the effective recipient of a Canadian
credit and liable for repayment plus interest.
The rate of interest applying will conform
closely to the prevailing rates charged by international lenders such as the World Bank.
The present rate, I understand, is approximately six per cent.
It is my understanding that Canadian exporters of capital goods have under consideration at the present time further export
orders of more than $100 million for longterm financing under section 21-A, provided
funds for this purpose are made available. I
understand the negotiations have advanced
to quite an extent and that a number of exporters have gone as far as they can until
they can be assured that the money would
be made available to them. It is now proposed
by this bill to amend the Export Credits Insurance Act, that the $200 million ceiling for
long-term export financing under section 21-A
be increased by $100 million to $300 million.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators,
I have no objection to the bill for what it appears to do. The increase in the number of
directors is an acceptable and, I assume, a
necessary addition. The additional funds, as
the sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr. Blois) has
indicated, is necessary at this time, so of
course I have no intention of objecting to it.
As a matter of fact, the Export Credits Insurance Act is a good one. It was passed in
1944 by a very good government. However,

Honour the Speaker-the Prime Minister.
May I at the same time remind honourI shall read from a report in the Globe and able senators of something that is on record,

SENATE

a statement not likely to be soon forgotten,
made by the Minister of Trade and Commerce, the Honourable Mr. Hees, when just
about the time I made my speech in this
house he said, "We cannot do business with
better businessmen anywhere."
Now, the United States is very disturbed
about this whole situation, but it is still
talking to us in diplomatie language. Mr.
Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Special Assistant to
the President of the United States, spoke
on Cuban trade in Vancouver just recently.
He did not mention Canada, but he did
say that any support of the Castro régime
is a threat to democracy. He was careful
to be both polite and gentlemanly, but he
indicated to this country-as I say, in diplomatic language-that there were more dangers than dividends involved in our present
policy. The Secretary of State, Dean Rusk,
in February, when asked about Canadian
trade with Cuba said, "That is something we
will take up."
I say to this house that this business
is creating friction with the United States.
Hon. Mr. Blois: If the honourable senator
is suggesting that the United States Government is not going to deal with Cuba, he
is wrong. It sold to Cuba more than three
times what Canada did. So I cannot follow
him.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I will get to that in a little
while. What I am saying is that in continuing
this present Canadian trade with Cuba policy
we are asking for trouble. As I read the
Canadian conscience, and I have had a little
practice at itHon. Mr. Thorvaldson: What policy is the
honourable senator speaking of?
Hon. Mr. Croll: You will find out in due
course.
I was about to say that I believe that
Canadians are troubled with the kind and
volume of our trade with Cuba.
It is a matter of public knowledge that we
have sent to Cuba 125 tons of dynamite-call
it blasting powder, if you will, but dynamite
is what it is. It is a matter of public knowledge that in the last year $2 million worth of
industrial commodities were sold to Cuba,
consisting in part of sheet and strip metal,
transformers, industrial chemicals, aircraft
engines and parts. And we say we do not sell
any strategic materials. WeU, as I read the
definition of strategic material, it is capable of
being used for military purposes. You can
call dynamite Cuban porridge but it is still
dynamite, and I do not know anything that
is more strategic than dynamite.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: They have to build roads
down there.

Hon. Mr. Croll: Of course.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: And they have to use
dynamite in building them.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Yes, but it can also be used
for other purposes.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Blasting powder is
not dynamite, surely.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Of course it is dynamite,
and the fact that we label it "Not to be used
except for blasting roads" does not mean that
that is the purpose for which they are going
to use it.
The increase in Canadian trade with Cuba,
I repeat, must bother most Canadians. With
the sole exception of Canada, general trade
between the NATO countries and the Castro
régime has been drastically curtailed since
1960. I give you these figures, and they are
available:
Imports from Cuba of the eastern members
of the Atlantic alliance declined from
$66,720,000 in 1960 to $24,920,000 last year.
Canada's imports from Cuba rose from
$7,440,000 to $8,828,000.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien (Bedford): What is one
million?
Hon. Mr. Croll: In the same period exports
to Cuba from European countries of the Alliance declined from $69,600,000 to $35,880,000.
Canada, on the other hand, has increased ber
exports from $13,800,000 in 1960 to $32,100,000
last year. In the first nine months of 1961
it was at $21,500,000-three times the figure
for the first nine months in 1960, which was
$7,502,000.
I for one, and I hope others share this view,
do not feel comfortable in having this country
linked with communist countries as Cuba's
principal suppliers. It is hard to deny that
we have profited at our neighbour's expense.
What is more, there is a moral position involved when a declared communist state in
this hemisphere is our beneficiary.
We too have a responsibility to prevent the
spirit of communism in this hemisphere, and
so I think the time bas come for us as a
country to re-examine our position. We must
have the courage and the honesty to change
our course. It takes courage to say no, but it
is time for the politics of courage. Everybody
cannot be out of step except Canada.
I know that I cannot prevent the Canadian
Government from making mistakes, but I can
try, and it is my duty to point them out. I
know that we will persevere as a nation despite these mistakes, but it would be a lot
easier if we did not make them.
I said earlier that the Honourable Mr. Hees,
Minister of Trade and Commerce, made
certain statements, one of which I quote:

FEBRUARY 21, 1962
They are wonderful customers. You
cannot do business with better businessmen anywhere.
Those are his words.
A further statement was made in this chamber subsequent to the time I made my speech,
and I quote the words of a member of this
bouse:
Canada bas no quarrel with Cuba. If
the foreign policy of our neighbours to
the south has landed them in the present
position with Cuba, then why should
we penalize a Canadian producer by preventing him from seeking a very convenient market?
I quote a further statement, one emanating
from the Department of Trade and Commerce:
It is time the Americans learn that they
cannot dictate Canadian Government
policy in Washington.
Well, honourable senators, let me say that
there are far more important issues at stake
than salesmanship and economic advantages
and anti-Americanism. It is clear that the
communists, through the Castro Government,
intend to try to spread their ideology to
other Latin American countries, by force if
necessary, and Castro bas said so. Should any
of these attempts succeed, Canada, as well
as the United States, may wake up some day
to fnd herself faced with one or more communist governments on her front steps. It
is not in our best interest to assist in building
up a communist régime from which may be
launched subversive activities against the
mainland of America. When our security is
involved surely trade takes a secondary position.
It is not a matter of pleasing or displeasing
Washington-I could not care less-it is simply
a question that we must ask ourselves, what
is best in our long-term interest. Cuba is not
our number one problem. The big problem is
in keeping communism from expanding from
its Cuban bridgehead, in student and other
movements, among the peasants, and in government bureaucracies where it can take
over the government.
It is a matter of public record that some
South American countries are in very precarious positions, and not being a Cabinet
minister I won't name them.
In the great fight against communism we
should do more than talk about being opposed
to it. We should be pulling our weight alongside our neighbour. Thus we must review our
trade relations with Cuba. Geographically,
Cuba is in the heart of the Americas; politically, it belongs in the Russian orbit, and
Castro's ideas are for export. I think the timé

has come when this Government should take
a good hard look and review its Cuban trade
policy before it leads us into real trouble.
Hon. Calvert C. Prati: Honourable senators, I should like to pass a few remarks on
this bill, with particular reference to the
general application of the export credits insurance, and not with respect to the proposed
amendments which are set up to provide for
special circumstances by way of governmentto-government transactions, and government
long-term financing of capital goods and so
forth. These matters have been clearly explained by the honourable senator who so
very ably moved second reading of this bill.
This corporation was set up in 1944 for the
particular purpose of assisting in the general
export trade of Canada. It bas continued
through the years in a moderate manner, not
taking a particularly prominent part in the
facilitating of the export business generally,
but nevertheless, it bas served a useful function. The funds that were available for this
corporation in the normal trend of its operation were not required in very large
amounts because, obviously, being an insurance corporation, while it bas to operate
with a fair equity and security for the insurance, .its premium income is designed to
balance out the losses under normal conditions.
I believe we need a much more active policy
with regard to export credits insurance as
applied to promotion of general trade. I am
not referring to this special financing that
bas evolved in recent times through intergovernmental transactions, and so forth, but
the need for more facilities for the expansion
of the export trade through insurance. I know
that the plan provides for industry to take
up 15 per cent of the exporting credit risk
while insurance takes up 85 per cent. In
England the coverage runs from 85 to 95
per cent of the risk. While our policy in
that respect is a little more conservative, I
do not think it is a very discouraging factor
in the general functions of the organization.
In other countries-and I shall refer particularly to England because in the past I
have been in touch with her operationthere is more flexibility in the national corporation accepting risks from industry than
there is here in Canada. To get this insurance
coverage here an export corporation has to
pass all its risks through the organization for
insurance. It is true that exceptions will
be made. Where particular circumstances
arise in one market or another the insurance
corporation will consider whether that rule
shall apply or not. But, as a general rule, an
exporter bas to submit the total value of his
exports to the corporation to obtain insurance

SENATE
coverage. In England they allow the insurance to be arranged as to separate markets
or groups of markets. That is, if an exporting
company is sending its products to ten different countries abroad, the company may say
that it has special terms and conditions relating to one country or another where it
does not wish the insurance to apply. In
England the arrangement has been more flexible than has been the general practice here.
Figures have been quoted as to the amount
that is outstanding and is involved in coverage. In Canada, while we recently had big
figures involved because of special dealsnot in the course of ordinary export tradethe sum total of insurance that is carried
on our normal commercial exports only
amounts to 2.6 per cent of the total of such
exports, and that is after eleminating exports
to the United States.
During 1960 the total value of Canadian
exports was $5,3'95 million, and of that amount
exports to the United States were valued at
$2,934 million. It is a matter of correct policy
that this insurance as applied to exports from
Canada does not apply to shipments going to
the United States, because they have their
own facilities which are of general application in industry, and the placing of credit
insurance here would be unnecessarily competitive.
Hon. Mr. Blois: I bow to the greater knowledge on this matter of the honourable senator from St. John's West (Hon. Mr. Pratt),
but I do not think that his last statement
is quite correct. I believe he said that we
did not give any insurance coverage on exports to the United States. I wish to correct
that statement by saying that during 1961 the
annual risk underwritten on sales to the
United States amounted to $1,438,540.
Hon. Mr. Prati: $1 million-odd?
Hon. Mr. Blois: Yes, $1,438,540.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: There may have been some
exceptions made, but I believe the general
policy is not to apply insurance coverage to
shipments to the United States.
Hon. Mr. Blois: I think it is available, if
asked for.
Hon. Mr. Prait: What I state has been
the general policy, and it will be found in
the reports that it is a policy that should not
apply in the general way.
Hon. Mr. Blois: Short-term credit can be
obtained from other sources. Exporters do
not ask for it but it is available to them.
Hon. Mr. Prait: Yes, they can get it from
other sources for that purpose.
With regard to the general application of
the organization in Canada, in 1957 there were

only 190 exporters who used the services of
this organization, and the directory of exporters showed a total of about 3,000 classed
as exporting firms in Canada. Of those 3,000,
only 190 used these facilities. The list of
countries contained in the report is impressive.
There are shipments insured to 91 countries,
but that figure is not quite as impressive as
it sounds because in the case of 44 of those
countries the amount insured for the year
is less than $100,000.
I should like to make a further comparison
between the use of the organization in Canada
and elsewhere, and I shall refer again particularly to the United Kingdom. In 1960 the
amount of insurance carried under the United
Kingdom plan, which is similar to this one,
amounted to £742 million. These are classified
as commercial risks. When making this comparison I am referring to commercial risks in
Canada.
The commercial risks sales from this country in 1960, which were insured, amounted
to $63,457,000. The United Kingdom's insured
amount represented about 20 per cent of
their total exports; with regard to Canada,
and eliminating what is exported to the
United States but taking into account worldwide figures, the figure is about 2.6 per cent.
This has some significance with regard to the
point I wish to make. In 1957 the percentage
of credit insurance to exports in the United
Kingdom was between 8 and 12 per cent. By
1960 that figure had increased to 20 per
cent, revealing that there is a very strong
trend in that direction. That trend is exhibited throughout the world in the development of export trade. It is most important
because credits are becoming more essential
than ever before in facilitating trade abroad.
At home no one even wants to defend the
constant increase in consumer credit buying,
and so on. That is a world trend, however,
and, whether we like it or not, we have
got to remember it is there. By limited use
of available export credit insurance our
exporters do not fit into that picture generally, and they fall behind the exporters
in the progressive exporting nations, who
are giving their customers longer terms of
payment, and so forth.
The businessman of a few years ago felt
he was conducting his business along good
sound lines when he had bankers' credits
and sight drafts against documents for all
export sales. I hope a good measure of that
policy will continue, but one thing we can
be sure of is that that policy is not growing.
It is decreasing. I would like to see-and
this is the only reference I shall make to it
this afternoon-more flexibility brought into
the application of export credits insurance
in Canada. I am not putting all the blame

FEBRUARY 21, 1962
for lack of flexibility on this corporation.
I place some of the responsibility upon the
exporters of Canada.
There is a lack of appreciation generaIly
on the part of the exporters of Canada of
a need for more development in this line,
and I think this corporation should publicize its services more. It should advertise
to the trade of Canada more than it seems
prepared to do. It should also consider
more forms of flexibility so that in the
future greater use will be made of its services
in financing world exports.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I should like to add a word of comment
in connection with what my deskmate Senator
Croll has said to the house this afternoon. I
congratulate him upon his statements, and for
having done what I think is a public service
in bringing this matter to our attention.
My mind goes back, honourable senators, a
number of years in this connection. What I
am going to say has no political significance
because what I shall refer to was done when
a Liberal government was in office.
I think back to the time when we
shipped scrap iron to Japan. It is a long time
ago now, but that scrap iron, honourable
senators, was shipped back to us. It was
shipped back to the Americans at Pearl Harbour, and it was shipped back to us at Hong
Kong. It was, of course, not dynamite. The
shipping of scrap iron was a purely commercial proposition. Apparently it had no military
significance at ail. However, we were shipping
it to possible enemies at that time, and we
knew they were. They are not enemies now,
but they were then; and we certainly sold to
them material which was later used against us
and our allies.
I say that the Government of today should
be exceedingly careful, and our Canadian
trading interests should not be too anxious to
make a quick profit in matters of this kind,
because it is possible that dynamite might
come back to us or, which is even worse, it
might go to the best neighbours any small
country ever had-our good neighbours to
the south.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson, debate
adjourned.

UNIVERSAL COPYRIGHT CONVENTION
MOTION FOR APPROVAI-REFERRED TO

COMMITTEE
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Thorvaldson:
That it is expedient that the Houses
of Parliament do approve the Universal
Copyright Convention signed by Canada
in Geneva in 1952 and Protocol 3 thereto,
and that this house do approve the same.
Hon. W. Rupert Davies: Honourable senators, as this is the first time I have spoken
this session I would like, first of ail, to welcome the new senator from Newfoundland
(Hon. Mr. Hollett) and compliment him, and
the mover of the motion for an address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne (Hon.
Mr. Méthot), on their excellent speeches. I
hope neither one of them was as nervous as
I was when I performed that function twenty
years ago.
I would like, also, to compliment the Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) on
his being appointed a Privy Councillor. It is
an honour which was well deserved, and one
that could not have been bestowed upon a
nicer man or a more popular member of the
Senate. My only regret is that that appointment did not carry with it a seat in the
Cabinet.
Honourable senators, I am strongly in favour of the ratification of the Universal Copyright Convention, and I believe that all members of the Liberal Opposition are also in
favour of its ratification. I am not quite sure
why I was chosen by the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) to
speak first for the Opposition on this question.
It might be because I am a newspaper publisher, or because I have an author in the
family or, on the other hand, it might be
because of the fact that the honourable Leader
of the Opposition lives in Brantford where I
have several relatives and the secret has
leaked out that I have written a book and
that he, therefore, looks upon me as an author.
The truth is, honourable senators, that I
have written a book. I have just finished it
after working on it for two years. I am happy
to say that it will not be affected by the
Copyright Act.
This book, I am afraid, will be of little

emigration in the 1890's of three inter-related

SENATE
families from Wales. In it I have set down
for my grandchildren and my great-grandchildren-I already have two-and for the
grandchildren and great-grandchildren of
other members of the family, all the reasons
why our family emigrated, the difficulties
which were encountered when we first arrived
in Canada, and the opportunities which opened
up to all of us as the years went by. I want
our descendants to know all about our coming, and I want to impress upon them that
success in Canada is not achieved by leaning
on social security but by working hard and
saving money. There is no better country in
the world than Canada in which young men
and women can succeed if they are prepared
to work hard.
I do not want to bore you, honourable
senators, but I would just like to say that
our families left Wales because the Welsh
agricultural depression of the 1890's had made
prospects for young people in the towns and
rural areas very poor. There were nineteen
boys and girls growing up in these three
families, and of the heads of the families one
was in the grain business, one was a farmer
and the other was in the clothing business.
They were al doing very badly, indeed. The
prospects were very bleak, so out we all came
to the land of promise.
Unfortunately, times were not too good in
Ontario when we arrived. It was hard for a
man to get work in the city of Brantford.
Men were working there for $4 or $5 a week.
However, the young people did not have much
difficulty in becoming absorbed into business.
Two days after I arrived in Canada I started
to work at a salary of $1.50 a week, and I
thought that was wonderful. I was delighted to
get such wages. During the first year, honourable senators, we had a very hard time but we
got along. I had always wanted to learn the
printing and newspaper business. Before we
left our old home town my father took me up
to the local newspaper office, and told the proprietor that I was anxious to learn the business and asked if there were any vacancies.
The proprietor told my father that he had a
vacancy for a young apprentice. My father
asked the terms and he was told that the
indenture was for seven years, and the cost
would be £7 per indenture. I listened to this,
and although I was only a boy I spoke up and
asked, "What wages will I get, Mr. Rowlands?" Mr. Rowlands said: "Wages?"-one
would have thought I had said a dirty word"We do not pay you any wages. We are
going to teach you the trade. There will be
no wages for the first six years, but if you
turn out to be a good printer after that time
we will give you a shilling a week".
I did not know anything about business, but
I certainly was not going to work for a shilling

a week after six years of learning, so I ran
away home. I knew I would receive a severe
reprimand when my father arrived back home.
I was brought up in a Wesleyan Methodist
home-not a Methodist home, but a Wesleyan
Methodist home-and I knew I would be
severely reprimanded for having dared to
interfere when two men were talking. I
should not have dared to interfere. However,
I ran home, and I did not go to work for
nothing for six years and one shilling a week
in the seventh year.
To come to the Universal Copyright Convention itself, this convention affects all Canadian authors, and I should like to say a
word or two about a few of them. The convention also affects book publishers, but newspapers not seriously.
As we all know, Canada has produced,
down through the years, a large number of
first-class authors. Unfortunately, however,
they have not all remained in this country.
The market for books is limited here, and the
copyright problem has up to now made
publication in the United States very difficult. Nevertheless, some of our able authors
have remained in Canada and have written
exceedingly well about our country. We have
had biographies of Canadian statesmen written by able Canadians. We have also had
some fine Canadian novels written by such
men as Ralph Connor, which is a pen name,
of course; Hugh Maclennan, and Thomas H.
Raddall of Nova Scotia.
I do not want to go too far back but I
should like to mention a few of our outstanding authors who left this country in the
early part of the last century. Sir Gilbert
Parker was one. He was born in Belleville,
Ontario. He gave us many fine novels. I recollect well reading as a boy his Pierre and
His People, short stories about the North
West Mounted Police. Next came When Valmond Came to Pontiac;then The Seats of the
Mighty, which many consider his greatest
novel; and later, that most interesting book,
The Power and the Glory, which I thought
was even finer than The Seats of the Mighty.
Sir Gilbert Parker first entered the Church
as a curate. He went to Australia but found
his way to England a few years later where
all his books were originally published. I had
the pleasure of meeting Sir Gilbert when he
came to Canada as one of the delegates from
Britain to the Empire Press Union Conference
in 1920, held in these Parliament Buildings
which were then not quite rebuilt following
the fire which destroyed the original building.
In the first decade of this century, too,
about a half-dozen Canadian authors formed
a little colony in New York. I cannot remember all the names but I recollect three of
them. They were Arthur Stringer, who came

FEBRUARY 21, 1962
from Kent County and had made a name for
hirnself with bis first novel, The Silver Poppy;
Norman Duncan of Brantford, and Arthur E.
McFarlane. When Mr. McFarlane's first story
was published in The Saturday Evening Post
the editor announced that it was the finest
short story that had ever been published in
that magazine. The city of Brantford, so ably
represented in this chamber by the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald), has given to Canada a number
of authors. In addition to Norman Duncan
there was Sara Jeanette Duncan, who wrote
a number of novels. So f ar as I know, these
two novellsts were not related but each made
a fine contribution to literature. Norman
Duncan published a number of books, the
best known of which. is Dr. Luke of the
Labrador. Sara Jeanette Duncan, after a brief
career in this country as a journalist, married
the curator of the Indian Museum in Calcutta,
India, and went to India to, reside. Many of
hier books were written and. published there.
Other authors who could cail Brantford
their home were Pauline Johnson, daughter
of an Indian chief who llved on the Grand
River, and T. B. Costain. Pauline Johnson
gave us a number of fine poems, her finest
being "The Song My Paddle Sings". She
published her first book while living at
"Chiefswood" on the Grand River just outside Brantford; and I arn proud of the fact
that as a young printer I helped set up the
type on some of those poems she published.
T. B. Costain, who was a boyhood schoolmate of Senator Taylor of Norfolk at the
Brantford Collegiate, later joined the Brantford Courier as a young reporter. I was working on the Courier at the time as a typesetting-machine operator, and he and I used
to write short stories and exchange thern and
appraise them. Mfter a journalistic career in
this country Mr. Costain went to the United
States and was for many years editor of
The Saturday Evening Post. Today, "Bert",
as he is known to bis old friends, is a writer
of best sellers in the United States. He lives
in New York in the winter and at his country
home in Connecticut in the summer. Mr.
Costain bas just published The Plantagenets,
the fourtb volume of a history of England
which. he is writing and which started with
the volume called The Con querors. It is a
well-known fact that when T. B. Costain,
the former Brantford boy, writes a book, the
sales are estimated at over 100,000 copies.
In speaking of Canadiýan authors, it is
very pleasing to note that today, in the opinion
of the Canadian literary world, our leading
poet is Dr. E. J. Pratt. Dr. Pratt is the
brother of Senator Pratt of St. John's West,
Newfoundland-

Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Davies: -and
he has made
quite a naine for himself ýby bis beautiful
poetry.
Now to corne back from. these digressions
to the Universal Copyright Convention, which
I arn supportmng. Last evening we had a
complete survey of the convention by the
honourable senator from Winnipeg South
(Hon. Mr. Tborvaldson). He explained it in
detail. At this time I would like to make a
few observations wîth regard to some features
of the convention, and I hope they will not
seriously overlap what was said by the
honourable senator frorn Winnipeg South but
rather serve to emphasize how important it is
that tbe Parliament of Canada should ratify
this convention. In addition to studying it,
I have talked to two or three publishers and
several authors about the rnatter.
The Universal Copyright Convention was
signed by Canada in 1954, as the honourable
senator frorn Winnipeg South bas told us,
but Up to the present time there bas been
no ratification.
In general, as I see it, tbe object of the
resolution is to provide full copyright protection for Canadian literary works entering
the United States, and this will be a departure from the situation now existing whereby
Canadian books and periodicals rnust be
printed in the United States in order to be
fully copyrîghted and protected in that
country.
This difficulty arises, in part, because of
section 16-usually referred to as the l'manufacturing clause"-of the United States Copyright Act of 1909.
In general, that clause in tbe United
States act requires that books and periodicals
in the Englisb language must bave their
type set and rnust be printed and bound in
the United States. If a Canadian, for instance,
does not fulfil the requirernents set out in
section 16 he obtains no protection in that
country, and it is undoubtedly true that by
joining the Universal Copyright Convention
Canada will relieve its authors and publishers of this liability.
There is, as the bonourable senator frorn
Winnipeg South bas told us, a qualifying
clause allowing 1,500 copies to be sold in
the United States under certain conditions.
The historical .background of the convention is very difficuit for a layrnan to clearly
understand. There was established at Berne,
Switzerland, in 1886 the Berne Union, or
'Iernational Copyright Union, open to ail
states of the world under Article 2 of the
Berne Union. The main principle set up
was that persons: in each country adhering

SENATE
to the union were to enjoy advantages conferred on nationals under local law. The
duration of protection, however, in any one
country could not exceed the term of protection provided in the country of origin.
The Berne Convention has been revised
several times as follows:
(a) The Berlin revision of 1908 defined literary and artistic works more carefully;
for instance, works of photography were
included. It was provided that the minimum
period for duration of copyright would be
the life of the author plus fifty years,
subject to such contrary regulations as each
country might enact.
(b) Another conference of revision was
held in Rome in 1928. Under this revision oral
literary works such as lectures, addresses,
etcetera, were included among the works
protected.
In general the consequences of the Rome
Convention were as follows:
1. No author of an unpublished work is
guaranteed convention rights in his own
country.
2. An author native of a country belonging
to the union who first publishes in a union
country other than his own receives national
treatment in that country and national treatment plus the benefit of convention rights
in other union countries including his own.
3. An author who is a national of a union
country and who first publishes in his own
country enjoys no convention rights in his
own country.
(c) The third revision was declared in 1948
at the so-called Brussels Convention. This
included cinemas in the definition of "literary
and artistic works". Canada signed this convention but did not accede to it.
The second general declaration is the Universal Copyright Convention propagated in
1952 pursuant to the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights.
The United States subscribes to the view
of the Universal Copyright Convention but it
is not a member of the Berne Union.
The Universal Copyright Convention has,
in general, a codification different from previous codes. Minimum standards are created.
The duration of the copyright under the convention was to be no less than the life of the
author plus twenty-five years or twentyfive years from the date of first publication. It will be remembered that under the
Berne Convention, life plus fifty years was
stipulated. Under Article 17 of the Universal Convention it is stated that the treaty
shall in no way affect provision of the Berne
Convention.
Now something as to Canada's position in
international copyright: The first Canadian

Copyright Act was enacted in 1875 and it provided for registration of copyright in favour
of persons domiciled in Canada, or in any
dominion, or who were citizens of a country
having a copyright treaty with the United
Kingdom, but the author had to print and
publish in Canada.
The 1875 Act was followed by the Copyright Act of 1921 wherein it was enacted that
Canada should join the Berne Union. In general, up to the present Canada has followed
the provisions of the Rome Convention of
1928 to which I have just referred.
As we have been told, in 1954 a royal commission, under the chairmanship of the Right
Honourable J. L. Ilsley, was appointed to
study legislative problems in the area of intellectual and industrial property. Copyright was
examined because, although Canada had
signed a Brussels revision of the Berne Convention in 1948 and Universal Copyright Convention of 1952, in 1954 ber adherence to
these treaties had been delayed pending the
recommendation of the royal commission.
The commissioners concluded that Canada
should not adhere to the Brussels Convention
for a number of reasons, and suggested that
Canada ratify the Universal Copyright Convention so that Canadian authors could secure
copyright in the United States without having
to comply with American formalities and
manufacturing requirements.
The commission recommended that the term
of copyright protection be changed from "life
plus 50 years" to "publication plus 56 years."
Coming to more recent developments, the
Royal Commission on Publications-known as
the O'Leary Commission-recently released,
comes out strongly for the ratification of the
Universal Copyright Convention, stating that
immediate ratification would "free Canadian
authors, printers, and publishers from the requirements to print in the United States
within the five-year period and would also
permit them to export over 1,500 copies."
As the honourable Senator from Winnipeg
South (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson) told us, these
references to the five-year period and the
1,500 copies are because of the existence of
the previously mentioned "manufacturing
clause" in the United States copyright law.
The Canadian Authors Association is
heartily in favour of ratification of this convention and has for some years made strong
and continued representations to the federal
government with respect to this matter.
The Canadian Authors Association also feels
that Canada should bring its domestic copyright
law up to date as soon as possible. In general,
the association is of the view that any new
copyright law should include the following
provisions:

FEBRUARY 21, 1962
(a) Canada should be able to adhere to the
Brussels revision of the Berne Convention in
1948, thus continuing the present fifty years
after death term of copyright.
(b) The new legislation should, in the
association's view, cover protection for such
recent mechanical developments as long-playing records, radio and television performances,
etc.
(c) In general, it should answer that Canadian authors would possess the fullest possible
world wide rights to their intellectual properties.
As every senator knows, the ratification of
the Universal Copyright Convention was recommended by the Ilsley Commission. It bas
been ratified by the United States and also by
the United Kingdom.
The ratification by Canada will, in my
opinion, be a definite step forward in the
interests of both authors and publishers. But
the Canadian publishers may still feel they
have a grievance, in that an American who
publishes a book in Canada cannot also
publish it in the United States unless it bas
the American edition put into type and
printed in that country. It may be that we are
progressing slowly in this matter of copyright. I do feel, however, that we should all
support the ratification of the Universal Copyright Convention at the present time. We have
been slow in doing so, but when it is ratified
the Government can then deal with other
copyright grievances which the authors and
publishers are urging.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable senator a question? I have listened with
keen interest to his description of the copyright situation. Am I to understand that if
we ratify this convention a book written,
published and printed in Canada could be
sold under protection in the United States?
Hon. Mr. Davies: A book written, published
and printed in Canada, could, if this convention is ratified, be published in the United
States; but an American could not have a
book printed and published in Canada and
also in the United States unless he had the
type set and the book bound and published
in the United States separately.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Both the
honourable senator from Winnipeg South
(Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson) and the honourable
senator from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies)
stated that this Universal Copyright Convention is a complicated document. In addition,
they have referred to the Berne Convention
and to the Brussels revision of the Berne
Convention; reference bas also been made
to our own Copyright Act, which must be
amended. I think most honourable senators

will agree with me that this is quite a complicated matter we are considering today.
In the ordinary course of events, a resolution of this kind would be sent to a committee. I do not know what provision there
is for doing so, but it might be useful if this
convention were referred for consideration to
the Standing Committee on External Relations.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I see no reason
why it could not be sent to a committee.
If it is the desire of the house to do so, I
would suggest that it be referred to the External Relations Committee.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): I intended to move the adjournment of the debate but, in view of the statement of the
senator from Winnipeg South (Hon. Mr.
Thorvaldson), I think it would be in the
interests of the Senate, before final approval
is given, to consider the convention in committee. If he would so move, I am sure the
house would agree.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson, convention referred to the Standing Committee
on External Relations.
Motion agreed to.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, February 15, consideration of His Excellency the
Governor General's speech at the opening of
the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr.
Méthot, seconded by Hon. Mr. Hollett, for an
address in reply thereto.
Hon. William M. Wall: Honourable senators, I am pleased to have this opportunity
to associate myself with my colleagues who
have deservedly complimented both the mover
of the address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne (Hon. Mr. Méthot), and the seconder (Hon. Mr. Hollett); and in welcoming
to our friendly ranks the latter, the honourable Senator Hollett, from Burin. I am pleased
to be able to offer my warm and sincere
congratulations to the honourable Leader of
the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) upon his appointment as a member
of Her Majesty's Privy Council of Canada,
and also to our ever-gracious and distinguished Monsieur le Président upon his election as Chairman of the Board of Governors
of the National Theatre School of Canada.
It was my privilege and responsibility to
have been included in the Canadian team of

SENATE

seven representatives to the Atlantic Convention of NATO nations, held in Paris
January 8-20, 1962. In this Canadian team of
seven representatives were Messrs. K. P.
Andras, Donald Gillis, Patrick Nicholson, John
Pallett, Stephen B. Roman, Allistair Stewart
and myself. I am pleased to report to you that
these seven Canadians worked conscientiously
and well as a team, and through their participation in the work of the convention made
a very valuable contribution to the debates
and to the formulation of the Declaration of
Paris, about which I shall comment later.
As a member of the Senate, I do feel a
sense of great satisfaction in reminding you
that such a convention was first proposed and
indeed approved by the Canadian Senate back
in 1950. The motion was proposed by the late
Senator Euler, and read as follows:
That the Senate of Canada do approve
of the calling by the United States of
America of a Convention of delegates
from the democracies which sponsored
the North Atlantic Treaty and representing the principal political parties of such
democracies, for the purpose of exploring
how for their peoples and the peoples of
such other democracies as the Convention
may invite to send delegates, can apply
among them within the framework of
the United Nations, the principles of
federal union.
It is well to remember also that the history
of the underlying concept for greater Atlantic
co-operation and unity really began with a
Canadian initiative in 1948, when Canada proposed and insisted that the North Atlantic
Treaty must provide for the co-operation of
the allies in the non-military fields as well
as in self-defence. This so-called "Canadian
clause" of the treaty has been a kind of
beacon light toward which much thought and
discussion has been directed, because it
seemed to offer the means through which we
might safeguard freedom and guarantee for our
peoples accelerated socio-economic progress by
economic and political means-that is, by
some form of Atlantic free trade area, and
by more direct democratic political control of
NATO.
The idea of convening a conference of
citizens of NATO countries interested in a
study of how to further co-operation and
unity of purposes and efforts in the Atlantic
Community was then discussed by the Third
NATO Parliamentarians' Conference in 1957
and a formal resolution was adopted. The
suggestion was in turn taken up by the
Atlantic Congress in June, 1959, which
adopted a resolution calling for a "special
conference" or convention of not more than
one hundred representative citizens. We find

mention of this convention again in the chairman's report to the Political Committee of the
Fifth NATO Parliamentarians' Conference, V
held in Washington in November, 1959. This
Fifth Conference did accept a resolution
setting out the scale of delegate representation, in which scale Canada was allotted
seven; United States, twenty; the United
Kingdom and the other great powers ten
each, and so on.
The whole idea became practicable after
September 7, 1960, when a congressional law
was passed by the United States Congress to
set up a United States Citizens' Commission on
NATO. In brief terms, this Public Law 86-719
provided for the appointment to the commission of not more than twenty United
States citizens by the President of the Senate
and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The United States administration approved the idea, and provided the necessary
public funds to the extent of some $350,000,
I believe, to have this citizens' commission
carry out its task.
Additional impetus to the calling of the
Atlantic Convention came from the Sixth
NATO Parliamentarians' Conference, held in
Paris, November, 1960, which passed unanimously a resolution noting United States congressional action and urging other governments to appoint similar citizens' commissions.
The Atlantic Convention did meet January
8-20, 1962, and its delegates did draft the
document which I have in my hand and which
is officially entitled the "Declaration of Paris".
Permit me to quote directly from this document, so that honourable members will have
some idea of the contents and will thus find
acceptable my suggestion that we print the
whole document as an Appendix to today's
Hansard.
Honourable senators, the document begins:
We, the citizen delegates to the Atlantic Convention of NATO nations, meeting
in Paris, January 8-20, 1962, are convinced that our survival as free men, and
the possibility of progress for all men,
demand the creation of a true Atlantic
Community within the next decade, and
therefore submit this declaration of our
convictions:
And then follows a preamble, and I want to
quote one or two parts of it.
But the time has now come when the
Atlantic countries must close their ranks,
if they wish to guarantee their security
against the Communist menace and ensure that their unlimited potentialities
shall develop to the advantage of all men
of good will.
A true Atlantic Community-

FEBRUARY 21, 1962
And this becomes more specific.
-must extend to the political, military,
economie, moral and cultural fields. The
evolution we contemplate will contribute
to the diversity of achievements and
aspirations which constitute the cultural
splendour, and intellectual wealth of our
peoples.
And then there follow twelve substantive
recommendations, of which I want to quote
just two or three.
The first is really an underlining of the importance of the instrument which is now in
effect and whose competency in operation
might be expanded, and that is the NATO
Council of Ministers. This is recommendation
No. 2:
To create, as an indispensable feature
of a true Atlantic Comrmunity, a permanent High Council at the highest political
level, to concert and plan, and in agreed
cases to decide policy on matters of concern to the community as a whole.
Recommendation No. 3 is very important, in
my estimation.
To develop the NATO Parliamentarians'
Conference into a consultative Assembly
which would review the work of all
Atlantic institutions and make recommendations to them.
Recommendation No. 4:
To establish an Atlantic High Court of
Justice, to decide specified legal controversies which may arise under the
Treaties.
And I shall quote the last one that is recommended, No. 12:
That the NATO Governments promptly
establish a Special Governmental Commission to draw up plans within two
years for the creation of a true Atlantic
Community, suitably organized to meet
the political, military and economic challenges of this era.
Honourable senators, I have chosen just
a few excerpts which are indicative of the
statements and recommendations to be found
in the Declaration of Paris, but I would
like to draw attention to what I feel to
be an important declaration of the basic
moral and spiritual principles upon which
the lives and acts of the nations forming the
Atlantic community are based. These will be
found in Part H of the document, which I
would now ask to have printed as an appendix to our Hansard. I hope that permission
will be granted.

Hon. Mr. Wall: For the convenience of honourable senators, I should like at this point
to give two references which they may wish
to follow up. The first is the Congressional
Record of the Senate of the United States of
America for February 6, 1962, in which is
reported a debate on the Declaration of Paris
and a complete listing of all the delegates who
attended this Atlantic Convention, together
with their home addresses. The second is
Hansard of the House of Lords for January
31, 1962, on which date there was an extended
debate on NATO, during which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Earl of
Home, made a statement on the Atlantic Convention and related subjects.
May I plead with honourable senators to
remember and to understand that the
Declaration of Paris is a consensus of
basic principles and recommendations which
were "hammered out" by individuals who met
for the first time, and for only two weeks, in
an honest attempt to do some forward thinking about difficult and highly complicated
problems that have been engaging the attention of our parliamentarians and diplomats
for many years. We were not assisted by a
battery of expert advisers, we were limited
by time, and we were delimited by the necessity to formulate principles and recommendations which would be acceptable to the
overwhelming majority, so that we could go
away secure in the knowledge that there
was more or less unanimous support for the
declaration.
May I emphasize, too, that pervading the
convention proceedings of these citizen representatives was a sense of imperativeness
and a sense of urgency. I think it would be
fair to say that all delegates to the convention
felt that this whole business of improving
our techniques and our instrumentalities for
achieving among the free democracies greater
unity of purpose, greater co-ordination and
co-operation-yes, and wise integration of our
political, our socio-economic and our other
efforts-was not a kind of "maybe" business,
"perhaps some day", and "if", but rather a
"must" business, and "the sooner the better"
for us and for all mankind.
There was much earnest discussion about
the kind of unity we must have between
and among the free democracies of the western world so that these free nations might
safeguard and extend their democratic and
national freedoms, and thus guarantee to
their own citizens the kind of accelerated
socio-economic progress which is now needed,
and needed so badly, to meet effectively
the challenges of a rapidly changing world.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
For we are living in a nuclear age, at a
For text of Declaration of Paris, see ap- precarious time, when we appear to have

a kind of rough balance of nuclear and other

SENATE
military power, with its precarious hairtrigger balance of apocalyptic nuclear terror;
and we are living in an increasingly competitive world in which the mounting threat
of Soviet expansionism and economic competition must never be discounted or left
out of our strategic equation. When the delegates spoke about the Atlantic community,
or Atlantic union, it was not with a view
to having the NATO countries band themselves together into an inward-looking and
inward-acting exclusive club of "have" nations, to protect the socio-economic privileges
they now enjoy, but rather to the end that
NATO countries, and others who may wish
to join, may be enabled to perform more
conscientiously and more nobly the role of
being their brothers' keepers and helpers
for the many millions whose freedoms, national and individual, have been effectively
denied and thwarted, and for the many
millions in the other underprivileged and
developing nations of the world who must
be helped, and helped more effectively, to
help themselves to greater freedom and to
a better way of life. In other words, the
delegates were seized by the imperativeness
and the urgency of doing much more, and
doing it more quickly, for those so-called
non-committed and developing nations in
Africa, Asia, and South America, to enable
them to deal more effectively with their
own far-reaching socio-economic and political problems, but as free men in free,
democratic nations.
We must recognize that we are now living
in that agonizing and historically most frustrating of periods in which the rough balance
of nuclear power and the cataclysmic dangers
of using all-out wars as instruments of national policy, obligate us to live dangerously
in a world that is divided as it has not
been since the religious wars in the 17th
century, in a world which is not in peace
and not in war, but between peace and war,
during which in-between period, which may
last for many years, our communist opponent,
speaking to us about his version of so-called
peaceful co-existence, is doing in terms
of the integration and enforced co-ordination
of the work of the peoples and the nations
what is now found in the Sino-Soviet bloc.
It is here that we find the basic reasons
for the imperativeness and the urgency which
I mentioned earlier, for there appeared to
be general agreement among these citizen
representatives that the long struggle ahead
of this divided world would revolve around
what we may term a "competition" between
the two societies, the democratic and the
communist, to see which society has the
greater capacity to progress-that is, to become the leader in science and technology,

to become rich in material goods and services,
to distribute these goods and services with
greater effectiveness and justice, to see that
their respective peoples are healthy, wellhoused, well-fed, well-educated and wellcultured, and to give them-and this I do
not believe the Communist society can givecollectively and individually the satisfaction
and the happiness which comes from knowing
that they are able and free to work for
their best-shared aims and aspirations.
If other things are equal, honourable senators, we believe that free men can and will
outstrip enslaved men in any fair and competitive endeavour, but we must, through the
co-operation and the co-ordination of our joint
efforts, make certain that the conditions for
this competitive endeavour are equal. It is
well to remember the potential dynamics of
the large and effective measure of co-operation, of integration, of economic political and
other activities between and among the various members of the Soviet bloc. Whether this
unification or integration is the product of
consent or duress is beside the point. The
fact remains that the economies of all parts
of the U.S.S.R. and its satellites are being
treated more and more as one economy, with
"one-party rule" making it that much oasier
to undertake major industrial enterprises, to
request certain areas to specialize in this or
in that, to reallocate materials and human
resources, and so on. The fact remains that
the leaders of the Communist society are thus
able to formulate their five-, seven- or twentyyear plans for economic activity, and to take
the necessary administrative action, even
though under duress, to attempt to reach their
planned figures.
Honourable senators, writing in the newspaper Pravda Ukrainy-and that means "The
truth about Ukrainy"-of December 13, 1961,
the Deputy Minister of the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR gives these interesting and, I believe, significant target
figures for the economic development of this
highly industrialized, so-called independent
Republic of the U.S.S.R.
Honourable senators, I want you to ponder
upon these target figures. They are for 1980,
and they could be compared with our own
target figures for Canada for the same year
as estimated by the Royal Commission on
Canada's Economic Prospects. Just listen to
this:
The general volume of industrial production to increase by a factor of six;
The production of electric power to
increase from 54 billion kilowatt hours
to over 500 billion kilowatt hours;

FEBRUARY 21, 1962
The production of natural gas to rise
from 14.3 billion cubie meters to 120
billion cubie meters.
And so it goes on.
Are these figures realistic? Perhaps the
warning of the United States Ambassador
just lately that the Soviet bloc may indeed
soon have the economic and other means
to "bury" us is pertinent to the sense of
urgency and imperativeness which I found
so often expressed by the delegates to the
Atlantic Convention. Perhaps it is important
to remember, too, that the whole machinery
of government, the whole propaganda and
organizational machinery of the Communist
Party, of the Komsomol, of the so-called
labour unions, with their literally hundreds
of thousands of trained agitators and explicator-persuaders, is directed at the working
population, so that each individual, each industrial or agricultural establishment or
region tries not merely to fulfil, but overfulfil, the plan. Soviet newspapers are full
of praises for those who fulfilled or overfulfilled, and indignant criticism of those
who were idlers-and really traitors-because they failed to meet the target figures.
Judge for yourselves the dynamics of this
loaded situation.
I subscribe to this pervading feeling of
urgent imperativeness in the sense that I
returned to Canada strengthened in my previous conviction that our first task is to go
further and faster in the desperately urgent
task of bringing together into one liberal
and progressive economic community all the
trading partners of the free democratic world
which do not belong to the communist society.
I returned to Canada reassured about the
probabilities of success in any further negotiations which would involve free men facing
honestly and courageously whatever implications such greater co-operation, co-ordination, integration or union might logically
entail, if these free men know what the
score really is and if their leaders call them
to a new burst of moral commitment to high
purposes and to high ideals.
I believe that the Declaration of Paris
should be given careful consideration by al]
the NATO governments, including the Canadian Government, because it contains valuable
recommendations concerning the sequential
extension to the political, the military, the
economic, and the moral and cultural fields of
the basic concept of the Atlantic Community
in what many of us hope may eventually
become the focal point for the establishment
of a grand union or alliance of free nations
for peace, for justice, and for progress.

Honourable senators, I should like now to
tell you that while I was in Paris for the
Atlantic Convention I was fortunate to be
able to accompany another member of the
Canadian delegation on a visit to No. 2 Fighter
Wing Base at Grostenquin, France. I should
like to pay tribute to Group Captain MeBride
and to his senior staff officers for their very
comprehensive briefing and effective arrangements of a tour which enabled us to see
something of the high level of morale and
operational efficiency of this particular fighter
wing base. I say a very special word of
thanks to the officers and to the other personnel who permitted us to see them at their
duties, and who answered our many questions
in such a frank and helpful manner.
Naturally, like a homing pigeon, I made
a beeline for the school which is actually
located on the base. I was unable, because
of a lack of time, to visit the junior school
which is located at the permanent married
quarters site some distance away, and which
contains some 533 pupils, under the educational jurisdiction of a principal and 17 teachers. I was told that the school at the permanent married quarters site was reasonably
adequate-I am now talking about physical
accommodation and equipment which are up
to the so-called normal "French standards".
I should like, however, to comment briefly
about the senior school with some 600
children enrolled in grades 4 to 13. These
children are housed in 21 small classrooms,
which are found in converted barrack blocks.
I visited some of these classrooms and was
very disturbed by the overcrowding, which I
am told exists in grades 4 to 12. I was disturbed by the substandard level of physical
accommodation generally, and by the fact that
inadequate plant and equipment facilities deprived these children of anything more than
a purely academic or matriculation program
of curricular offerings. Despite the fact that I
was reassured that the morale of the children,
their parents, and their teachers remains
high, I must make the candid comment that
these very fine Canadian children, living far
away from our native soil because their
fathers are performing a very important duty
not only for Canada but for the freedom of
mankind, deserve from the Canadian Government-from us-in terms of physical facilities, educational equipment and supplies, and
in terms of the extent of curricular offerings,
at least something equivalent to normal
Canadian standards-by that I mean at least
a good Canadian average.
In my judgment, this is not now the case,
and I wish to bring this fact to the attention
of my honourable colleagues with the hope
that this may reach the ears of the Government.

SENATE
Honourable senators, I shall need another
thirty-five minutes to complete my remarks.
At this point I move the adjournment of the
debate.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Wall, debate adjourned.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
MEETING OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Walter M. Aseltine: I would like to
remind honourable senators that the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce adjourned its meeting this morning until
after the bouse rises this afternoon for the
purpose of considering the bill to amend the
Civilian War Pensions and Allowances Act.

The Deputy Minister of Veterans Affairs,
Colonel Lalonde, and his associates have been
waiting patiently and are willing to attend
the meeting of the committee between
this hour and six o'clock, or a little longer if
necessary. I would also point out that Senator White, the sponsor of the bill, may not
be able to be present later on this evening.
Having regard to these facts, I ask honourable senators who are members of the Banking and Commerce Committee to attend in the
committee room immediately after adjournment for the purpose of dealing with
Bill C-64.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

ATLANTIC

CONVENTION

OF NATO

NATIONS

DECLARATION OF PARIS
We, the citizen delegates to the Atlantic
Convention of NATO nations, meeting in
Paris, January 8-10, 1962, are convinced that
our survival as free men, and the possibility
of progress for all men, demand the creation
of a true Atlantic Community within the
next decade, and therefore submit this declaration of our convictions:
PREAMBLE

The Atlantic peoples are heir to a magnificent civilisation whose origins include the
early achievements of the Near East, the
classical beauty of Greece, the juridical
sagacity of Rome, the spiritual power of our
religious traditions and the humanism of the
Renaissance. Its latest flowering, the discoveries of modern science, allow an extraordinary mastery of the forces of nature.
While our history has too many pages of
tragedy and error, it has also evolved principles transcending the vicissitudes of history,
such as the supremacy of law, respect for individual rights, social justice and the duty of
generosity.
Thanks to that civilization and to the common characteristics with which it stamps the
development of the peoples participating in
it, the nations of the West do in fact constitute a powerful cultural and moral community.
But the time has now come when the
Atlantic countries must close their ranks, if
they wish to guarantee their security against
the communist menace and ensure that their
unlimited potentialities shall develop to the
advantage of all men of good will.
A true Atlantic Community must extend to
the political, military, economic, moral and
cultural fields. The evolution we contemplate
will contribute to the diversity of achievements and aspirations which constitute the
cultural splendour and intellectual wealth of
our peoples.
The Atlantic Convention, keeping this ideal
constantly in view, recommends the following
measures which, in its opinion, would foster
the necessary cohesion of the West, would
bring the final objective closer and should be
adopted forthwith by the governments concerned.

SUMMARY

OF RECOMMENDATIONS

1. To define the principles on which our
common civilization is based and to consult
about ways of ensuring respect for these
principles.
2. To create, as an indispensable feature of
a true Atlantic Community, a permanent
high council at the highest political level, to
concert and plan, and in agreed cases to
decide policy on matters of concern to the
community as a whole. Pending the establishment of the council, the convention recommends that the North Atlantic Council be
strengthened through the delegation of additional responsibilities.
3. To develop the NATO Parliamentarians'
Conference into a consultative assembly which
would review the work of all Atlantic institutions and make recommendations to them.
4. To establish an Atlantic High Court of
Justice, to decide specified legal controversies
which may arise under the Treaties.
5. To harmonize political, military and
economic policy on matters affecting the community as a whole.
6. That the North Atlantic Council treat the
development of an agreed NATO policy with
respect to nuclear weapons as a matter of
urgency.
7. That it welcomes the development, progress and prospective expansion of the
European economic institutions, and the spirit
of President Kennedy's statement that a trade
partnership be formed between the United
States and the European Economic Community, the basis of an Atlantic Economic Community, open to other nations of the free
world.
8. That the Atlantic nations, acknowledging
the right of every people to freedom, independence and pursuit of happiness, co-operate
on a larger scale with the developing nations
in their economic programs, through direct
and multilateral action; through the acceleration of investments; and especially through
measures which would increase both the
volume and value of their exports, including
special tariff concessions for their exports.
9. That the Atlantic Community take steps
to help improve all their economies, so that
the proportionate economic and social potential of all will be less unequal.

SENATE
10. That the Atlantic nations, noting the
destruction of the national independence and
the human rights of many peoples in Eastern
and Central Europe, reaffirm their belief that
the problem of these captive nations should
be resolved in accordance with the principles
of both individual liberty and national selfdetermination.
11. To create an Atlantic Council for youth,
education and culture in order to draw up
Atlantic plans for exchanges of young people,
stud'ents and teachers and for the purposes
2f scientific and cultural collaboration.
12. That the NATO Governments promptly
establish a special governmental commission to
draw up plans within two years for the creation of a true Atlantic community, suitably
organized to meet the political, military and
economic challenges of this era.

on matters of concern to the community. All
members of the community would be represented on the council.
Whether this high council be a new institution or a development of the North Atlantic
Council should be a matter of recommendation by the Special Governmental Commission. In any event, however, pending the establishment of the Atlantic community, the
members of the convention urgently request
their governments to reinforce and develop
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a
political centre. To this end, the convention
recommends that the North Atlantic Council
be strengthened through the delegation of
additional jurisdiction. Where authority for
decision is delegated to the North Atlantic
Council by governments, it should employ a
weighted majority vote.
2. Propose that the NATO Parliamentarians'

FEBRUARY 21, 1962
Closer and more effective action in the
field should flot await the growth of community institutions (see Paragraph 2, above);
the development of an agreed NATO policy
with respect to nuclear weapons should,
among other imrnmediate problems, be treated
as a matter of urgency by the North Atlantic
Council.
2. A second cardinal policy objective is to
realize the opportunities for economic progress
available through the creation and development of the Atlantic community. The expanding European Economie Conimunity is an
economic advantage not only for its members,
but for North America and the free world as
well. The convention welcomes the spirit of
President Kennedy's recent statement that a
trade partnership be formed between the
United States and the European Economic
Community. We hope that the negotiations
envisaged by President Kennedy succeed ini
establishing a relationship which. would constitute the nucleus of an Atlantic Economic
Cornmunity within the framework o! community institutions, and open to ail other
qualified countries. Such a development would
be of advantage to ail countries, and particularly to those which participate directly
in it. Among the fruits of titis expanding
community would be its stimulus to competition, investment and more rapid growth
in the mass markets appropriate to the
modern technological age, with progressive
reductions in tariffs and other 'barriers to
trade.
3. Another important goal of the Atlantic
nations is to co-operate with those developing nations which wish to do so in their
efforts to overcome the burden of poverty,
which may well be that o! a falling per
capita income in some countries. The convention recommends that the Atlantic community
increase its already considerable participation
in development programs o! this kind,
through direct financial. and teclinical measures; through increased shares in United
Nations programs, O.E.C.D. programs and
other multilateral efforts; and above ail
through policies which f avour commnerce with
and investment in the development countries,
such as the abolition of tariff s on tropical and
primary products, and the reduction and,
under agreed circumstances, even the eventual
abolition of tariffs on their other products.
The convention also recoxnmends the development of equitable and agreed programs for
the acceleration o! investments, and for the
protection of investors against political risks.
4. An important goal of the Atlantic community's economic policies should be to
help raise the standard of living and the level
of economic activity o! the different segments

of the Atlantic community, so that the proportional economic and social potential of ail the
members will be relatively less unequal.
5. In view of the hundreds of millions of
hungry people alive today, and the prospect
that, if the present trends continue, there
will be three th-ousand million more people
added to the population in the next generation, the convention recommends that the
Atlantic community should address itself
forthwith to the population problem.
6. Since Soviet expansion has destroyed the
effective national independence of many
peoples in Eastern and Central Europe, denying to their individual members the free
exercise of their relilous rights and democratic liberties-with ail the attendant injurious effects upon the general dlimate of
European security and progress, the convention affirnis its recognition of the inalienable
rights of ail nations to assume freely the
responsibilities of seif-determination and selfgovernment, and expresses its firm belief that
the problem of the captive nations of Eastern
and Central Europe should be resolved in
accordance with the rights and principles of
both individual liberty and national selfdetermination.
7. As most governments of the Atlantic
community countries have accepted the ohligatory clause of the Statute of the International Court of Justice at The Hague, the
convention recommends that ail members of
the Atlantic community accept this obligatory
clause.
PART Il-MORAL AND

CULTURAL QUESTIONS

A. The Atlantic Convention o! NATO nations declares that the basic moral and
spiritual principles upon which the lives and
acts of the nations forming the Atlantic community are based are as follows:
1. The purpose of political and economic
institutions is the protection and promotion
of the rights, liberties and duties which. enable every human being to fulfil his or her
spiritual vocation;
2. Liberty is inseparable from responsibulity, which implies recognition of a moral
iaw to which. men, as individuals and in
groups, are subi ect;
3. Liberty is inseparable from the duties of
men toward one another, which implies the
obligation to ensure that ail men graduaily
attain physical and moral well-being;
4. Liberty is inseparable from tolerance,
which recognizes the right to free discussion
of ail opinions which are not in violation of
the very principles of civilization;
5. There can be no freedom without vaniety, the natural resuit of the different origins

B. The Atlantic Convention of NATO nations:

ministers for scientific affairs, cultural and
educational authorities and representatives
of universities and scientific research organizations, with a view to:
1. Determining the comprehensive aims of
an education iikely to pronote the ideals and

career of the student concerned but rather
confer advantages upon him in the form of
either a degree valid in his own country or
a new type of degree specially created for
the purpose of enabling hlm, for instance, to
exercise his profession either in his own
country or in that where hie has completed
one or more years of study, always providing
that his knowledge of the two languages is
sufficient.
b. Lt is to be hoped that, in the future,
those who have pursued such a course of
training, which would subsequently be suppiemented by exchanges of civil servants between Atlantic nations, will be given priority
in selection for posts as officiais required to
take part in international negotiations.
c. Lt should be made possible for teachers,
and particulariy university teachers, research
workers and curators of museums and art galleries, either to be seconded periodically to

FEBRUARY 21, 1962
equivalent foreign organizations, or to establish close contacts with them. Although it may
not be immediately possible for all Atlantic
Community countries, the introduction of the
system of the "sabbatical year" for professors
and research workers would be generally desirable.
d. In the field of scientific documentation
and co-operation, it would be necessary to
supplement existing organs by setting up a
scientific documentation centre responsible,
among other things, for the translation and
distribution of the principal articles, reports
and other publications appearing throughout
the world, and which have not yet been distributed by other agencies. The committee
considers this a most urgent matter.
e. The "pairing-off" of universities and other
advanced educational establishments of dif-.
ferent languages within the community should
be encouraged and intensified.

f. The establishment and exchange of comparable statistics on education and research
in the Atlantic community countries should
be assured.
C. Recommends that these proposals be
studied further by the Atlantic Institute to
assist in the accomplishment of these tasks in
co-operation with existing agencies, such as
the Council for Cultural Co-operation of the
Council of Europe to avoid duplication of
effort.
GENERAL

ADOPTED
Hon. Paul H. Bouffard, Acting Chairman
of the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, reported that the committee had
considered Bill C-64, to amend the Civilian
War Pensions and Allowances Act, and had
directed that the bill be reported without
amendment.
Report adopted.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Whiie moved that the bill be
placed on the Orders of the Day for third
reading at the next sitting.
Motion agreed to.
INTERNAL ECONOMY
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ADOPTED

Hon. William R. Bruni, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Internal Economy
and Contingent Accounts, presented the committee's first report.
Report read by the Clerk Assistant:
1. Your committee have in obedience
to the order of reference of February 14,
1962, considered the following report
of the Civil Service Commission:
To the Honourable The Members of
The Senate.
The Civil Service Commission has the
honour to submit the following report.
A recent competition conducted to fill a
position of Parliamentary Reporter, Senate, produced only one successful candidate, Mr. Lorcan OhUiginn. He is employed at present, under authority of the

Speaker of the House of Commons, as
Assistant Parliamentary Reporter at $6,900
per annum. He has indicated that he will
not accept appointment as Parliamentary
Reporter at a salary less than $7,500 per
annum, the third rate in the class range.
Pursuant to the provisions of Sections
60 and 62 of the Civil Service Act, the
Civil Service Commission recommends for
approval the exclusion of position SCA-140 from the operation of Section 12
of the Act, in order to provide for the
appointment of Mr. Lorcan OhUiginn as
Parliamentary Reporter at a salary rate
of $7500 per annum, effective from the
date he reports for duty. It is considered
that in all other respects this position
should be subject to the provisions of the
Civil Service Act.
Speaker of the House of Commons, as
Respectfully submitted,
Ruth E. Addison
Commissioner
Sam Hughes
Chairman
Mark R. Drouin
Speaker of the Senate
2. Your committee recommend that
the said report be approved.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Honourable senators, with
leave, I move that it be taken into consideration now.
Hon. Senalors: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Honourable senators, perhaps I should offer a word of explanation with
regard to this matter. I should point out that
a vacancy presently exists on the reporting
staff of the Senate, and the appointment of
the present applicant would bring the staff
up to strength.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): What is
his name?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I shall come to that in
a moment.
A full complement of reporters is essential to
ensure the daily publication of Hansard in
both French and English. As honourable
senators know, the English and French editions of the Senate debates are now being
published simultaneously.
I am sure all honourable senators will
realize it is difficult to obtain good reporters,
capable of taking down and transcribing accurately the debates of the Senate. In this
case, I understand that a competition was held

FEBRUARY 22, 1962
at which there was no successful candidate.
After a lengthy canvass of the situation,
Lorcan OhUiginn was examined and found
to be well qualified for the position.
Mr. OhUiginn comes from that country
which I think is the greatest in the world,
Ireland.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: Hear, hear!
Hon. Mr. Bruni: He is an Irishman, and we
all love the Irish, despite the fact that the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) shakes his head
and probably would prefer that the candidate
came from Scotland.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otiawa West): No politics now!
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Mr. OhUiginn has studied
law for three years and is a very capable
reporter. I feel that the Senate is fortunate
indeed to obtain his services.
Honourable senators will note that his starting salary is to be $7,500 per annum. I understand that with the exception of one reporter,
who will shortly be eligible for advancement
to this amount, it is the minimum salary being
paid to reporters presently on our staff.
Hon. Mr. Reid: What is the top salary?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The maximum is $7,860.
I know that Mr. OhUiginn will do a good
job for us, and I am anxious to have the
report adopted so that the matter can be
proceeded with expeditiously.
Report adopted.
PORTRAITS OF PRIME MINISTERSCOMMONS COLLECTION
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Jean-François Poulioi: Honourable
senators, with reference to a front page news

been stolen from the collection at the Experimental Farm, I wonder if among those
lepidoptera there is the missing portrait of the
late Prime Minister Bennett.

bill that was amended here and returned to
the other place yesterday will not be considered there until tomorrow morning. If the
other place concurs in the amendment, it is
essential that there be royal assent at 5.45
p.m. tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Honourable senators, may I ask another question? Is
it possible that the honourable Leader of the
Government will have definite information as
to adjournment later in the sitting today?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: What I have said is
definite, unless something completely unforeseen arises.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Yes, but
it never does.

yesterday.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Roebuck, chairman
of the committee, reports adopted.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY ADOPTED

The Senate resumed from yesterday, consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Méthot, seconded
by Hon. Mr. Hollett for an address in reply
thereto.
Hon. William M. Wall: Honourable senators, yesterday afternoon I was able to bring
to your attention the work of the Atlantic
Convention of NATO Nations, during which
presentation I received your kind permission
to have the Declaration of Paris printed as an
appendix to Hansard.
You will remember that I tried to share
with you some of my own thoughts concerning the imperativeness and the urgency
which is involved in making additional governmental moves and taking additional diplomatic steps to improve and to expand the
effectiveness of our existing instruments for
the co-ordination and the integration of the
political, the military, and the socio-economic
activities of the free nations of the democratie world; and/or to create new instrumentalities where and when needed.
This afternoon I wish to speak about the
domestic scene. There is a relationship between what I said yesterday and what I
intend to discuss today, and I shall refer to
it at the conclusion of my presentation this
afternoon. I shall confine my remarks to the
overriding problem of continued economic
growth, in the light of the performance of
our Canadian economy during the preceding
four or five years, leaving to another time
such interesting and important problems as
the increased federal contributions to our
universities and colleges, or the need for
federal participation in getting under way a
comprehensive program urgently needed in
educational research, or an overview of what
has been happening to our net immigration
figures-running now at somewhat. over
10,000 per year, a reduction of some 1700 per
cent from the 1957 figure.
Since a variety of statistical data has been
used during the present debate to prove this
or that point, I should like to introduce a
few figures, too, in an attempt to focus our
attention upon what I think are indicative
yardsticks which tell us something about the
overall performance of the Canadian economy in real terms, that is, in constant dollars

on a per capita basis. I shall give you answers
which I have worked out, after making the
necessary correction for two key factors,
namely, the increase in our population, and
the increase in prices. I refer you to the
remarks of the honourable the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), found on
page 37 of Senate Hansard, in which he indicates that there has been a rise of 7.3 points
in our prices between 1957 and 1961, which
is roughly a rise of six per cent. I shall begin
with things as they were back in June 1957,
and I shall end with whatever data is available as close as possible to January 1962.
Now, before I discuss what appear to me
to be very basic economic facts of life, I
wish to explain that what I am trying to
do is to find some meaningful yardsticks to
understand better what economic gains we
have made during the past four and a half
years, and these are to be regarded as an
addendum to the data which has already
been introduced during this debate. If these
yardsticks show that not too much progress
has been made, or indeed, that we have been
losing some economic ground, then it avails
us little to replay that well-known and shopworn tune about gloom and gloomsters, about
doom and doomsters, and about degrading
and degraders. I would hate to think that
by some strange kind of logic and by some
specious kind of philosophizing an honest
appraisal of the basic economic facts of
Canada's progress in some areas, and lack
of progress in others, might be construed
to be an attack upon Canada and Canadians
in general. This is not so. I do believe that
thoughtful Canadians are looking for honest
appraisals, with discussion hinging on the
proving or disproving of facts.
The Leader of the Government in the
Senate (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) discussed at great
length the improvements we have made
lately in expanding our merchandise or commodity trade, and he ventured the guess
that we may have an export surplus in
1961 of around $100 million. This is gratifying to all of us, and we all hope that this
trend continues. During this comprehensive
discussion, the Leader of the Government
in the Senate described the Government
measures which have assisted in our achieving a surplus position, in so far as the
tangible goods we buy and sell are concerned,
and he made reference to the readjustment
of the exchange value of the Canadian dollar
in these terms:
Certainly a most significant oneAnd that relates to one of the causes of
this upturn.

FEBRUARY 22, 1962
-was the readjustment of the value of
the Canadian dollar following the budget
of December 1960.
I could not help but wonder, honourable
senators, why this most significant measure
which had such a direct influence on our export trade, and which has apparently proved
to be so beneficial, was not taken earlier, with
what kind of additional beneficial results.
Our widespread satisfaction with changes
in our commodity trade must not push into
the background of public interest another substantial part of our international accounts. I
am referring to the so-called invisibles, where
our deficits are very large, very important,
and growing. As a matter of fact, during the
past decade the deficits on these invisibles
have nearly trebled, increasing from a deficit
of $370 million in 1951 to $1,072 million in
1960. For the first nine months of 1961-and
these are all the figures we have so farour deficit on non-merchandise transactions
was $829 million, apparently running close to,
if not actually above, the 1960 deficit. In 1960
our total current international deficit was
$1,217 million. This past year, with our small
merchandise trade surplus, our total current
international trade deficit will be somewhere
in the order of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. In

proportionate terms, this $1 billion deficit
would be about $14 billion in the United
States. Honourable senators are well aware
of the serious concern in the United States,
when their 1960 international payments deficit
reached something like $2.5 billion.
But what will happen to our international
payments deficit if our imports continue to
rise, as they apparently have been doing during the preceding four months, from October
to January? In October and November we
imported nearly 28 per cent more, by value,
than in the same two months of 1960, and
preliminary indications are that the imports
during December and January have been
running unusually high.
Is careful study needed of this international
payments deficit problem? How are we doing
in relation to our Gross National Product?
Which non-merchandise deficits are increasing, and why? And can anything be done
to help with what appears to me to be a very
difficut and serious national problem?
Honourable senators, I should like permission to include at this point a table entitled
Per Capita Production Output for the years
1956 to 1960, being excerpts from a table
presented by the Government in answer to
a question in the House of Commons.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

Hon. Mr. Wall: Honourable senators will
note that the table gives the following information: Gross National Product for these
years in current dollars; Gross National Product in constant 1957 dollars-the per capita
Gross National Product, and that is the one
that counts-in constant 1957 dollars; and
the percentage change in constant 1957 dollars. I should like honourable senators to
note these few figures. I shall quote only
the Gross National Product per person, that
is, per man, woman and child.in Canada, in
26211-3-15J

constant dollars. In 1956 the figure was $1,959.
I skip the in-between figures and go on to
1960, when the per capita Gross National
Product was $1,898 or roughly $61 less than
it was in 1956.
What is happening to our economy from
year to year in constant dollars on a per
capita basis and the percentage changes are
very interesting. Between 1955 and 1956 we
had an increase in Gross National Product
per person of 5.9 per cent, but between 1956

SENATE

and 1957 we dropped by 1.8 per cent: between 1957 and 1958 we dropped by 2.1 per
cent; between 1958 and 1959 we went up by
1.1 per cent, and then we took another drop
between 1959 and 1960. The cumulative decrease over those years has been 2.1 per
cent in the per capita constant dollars of
Gross National Product.
Using the average of seasonally adjusted
to annual rates Gross National Product figures in constant 1957 dollars for the first
two quarters of 1957, and for the first two
quarters of 1961, the last available, I have
calculated the per capita Gross National
Product in real terms, that is in constant
dollars, as follows:
1957 ..................
$1,945
1961 ..................
$1,863
This means a relative loss in Gross National
Product of $82 per man, woman and child,
and a loss of $328 per theoretical family of
four.
The total relative loss in our annual Canadian 1961 Gross National Product based upon
these two quarters but adjusted to annual
rates, in real terms or in constant dollars,
is $1,482,970,000. This relative loss is hypothesized upon the per capita Gross National
Product remaining at its first half 1957 level;
that is, upon our standing still all this time,
despite technological and other changes in
our per capita productivity potential.
I agree, honourable senators, that much
data may be marshalled to prove that there
are what I would call short-term signs that
the Canadian economy is beginning to grow
again in real terms, in line with and perhaps also as a result of the upswing in the
economic activity in the United States.
Thoughtful Canadians rejoice at this welcome
change, but they are disturbed when they
note that competent observers are warning
us more and more frequently that this cyclical
upturn will be relatively short-lived, that it
will not do much to solve the complex and
stubborn hard core of our unemployment
difficulties, and that we are still not courageously facing the issues involved in the
changing pattern of the world's business because of Europe's economic revolution and
because of the impending future threat of
very active trade competition from the nations
in the Soviet bloc.
The yardsticks which I am discussing deal
with what appear to me to be the basic
facts of our economic life, and one of these
basic facts can be summarized thus: Between 1947 and the first half of 1957 we had
in Canada an annual rate of unemployment
averaging about 3.3 per cent, and since that

time the rate of annual average unemployment has been about 6.1 per cent, resulting in
a rate of real growth of less than one-half
of what we had in the pre-1957 decade.
I find that the simple annual growth rate
in real terms, that is in constant dollars,
averaged 2.4 per cent between 1957 and the
third quarter of 1961, but it was 6 per cent
in the pre-1957 era.
Our gap in the per capita G.N.P. is partly
explained by the fact that our annual population increase is around 2.8 per cent or a bit
more, depending upon immigration and so on.
Had our post-1957 growth rate continued
at the previous 6 per cent rate-and there is
a refinement that we could use in the form
of a cumulative rate of 4.6 per cent-and
using a permissible level of unemployment
of 3 per cent, we can calculate what we
might term to be a cumulative loss or a
cumulative gap in our G.N.P., this time in
current dollars for the last two quarters of
1957, then of all 1958, all of 1959 through to
the end of 1961. True, the estimate I shall
give you is a very rough one and it could
be called theoretical, but it does tell us
something about basic trends.
This cumulative gap in goods and services,
honourable senators, has been assessed in the
neighbourhood of $14 billion, and when we
think of the annual growth rates in countries
of Western Europe or in Japan we can understand why some observers have termed our
last four years as years of wasted opportunities.
In a very blunt article entitled "Work
Smarter" and printed in the September 1961
issue of Merit News, a publication of the
Industrial Acceptance Corporation, Mr. H. G.
DeYoung, President of Atlas Steels Ltd. and
Chairman of Canada's Productivity Council,
gives this interesting table to demonstrate in
terms of Gross National Product-per person
in constant dollars, and using 1950 as 100
per cent-and says, "Canada shows itself as
the losing team, limping sadly behind the
competitive pack." I shall read from this
table and then I shall ask that it be printed in
Hansard for your further examination. I may
say that the appended note is my own calculation.

(Prel.). U.S. index figures would be respectively: 100, 114, and 117.
I quote Mr. DeYoung's comments:
The results, too, are plain to see.
Abroad, Canada has already become noncompetitive in many world markets and
is getting more so; at home, a disturbing level of unemployment is being aggravated each year by the increase in
the number of people joining the labour
force and not finding the economic
growth to absorb them.
The reasons for the relative stagnation
of our rate of growth lies both outside
and inside Canada. One principal cause
has been the sheer economic force of
direct, concentrated and highly organized
effort by almost every other nation and
bloc of nations to improve the economic
status of its people.
During this four-year period of relative
economic slowdown the per capita costs of
running our national governmental machinery
have been growing, and it is little wonder that
many honourable senators have been asking
in this chamber, over and over again, where
is the money coming from, when faced with
legislation necessitating additional expenditures for what one might term the day-to-day
or current governmental expenditures. Government spokesmen have tended to request us
to focus our attention on the benefits of this
new legislation, and have actually said that
somehow and from somewhere the money
will come. Of course it will come-from the
taxpayers. It will either be raised now from
current taxes of all kinds, or tomorrow and
after tomorrow fron postponed taxes, to
service and to repay our new indebtedness,
together, perhaps, with a little bit from a
dilution of our currency, to which problern I
shall refer later.
According to information from the Public
Accounts of Canada, 1957, the total current
costs of government-that is budgetary expenditures, to which I am adding the old age
security fund payments, because those are
day-to-day living expenses-amounted to
$5,228 million for the year ending March 31,
1957. This worked out, honourable senators,
to $318 per man, woman and child. This was
the year when the former Liberal Government
was accused of "suffering, in expenditure,
1950

1956

from elephantiasis". For 1961-62 I work this
per capita figure out as $384-that is the
budgetary expenditures plus the old age security payments-which is $66 more than in
1957. It is $264 more annually for that hypothetical Canadian family of four. This $384
figure per man, woman and child does not
provide for still another further supplementary estimate, which I think we are going
to get this year.
Other things being equal, using the main
estimates for 1962-63, plus a five-year average
of supplementary estimates of $335 million,
and adding to this total the main estimate
for old age security payments, plus the additional $125 million we added in legislation we passed just last week, and estimating Canada's population to reach 18,890,000,
the per capita figure for the current cost of
government for 1962-63 works out to $390
per man, woman and child. This is the result,
honourable senators, despite the offset in
taxation at the federal level of roughtly $279
million, which is roughly equivalent to the
reduction in subsidies and in special payments
to the provinces-which really means a shifting to the provinces of an additional per
capita tax load of somewhere between $14
and $15.
Now let us deal with budgetary deficits.
Our actual 1960-61 budgetary deficit was
$340.4 million. Our 1961-62 budgetary deficit
has been roughly estimated as being in the
neighbourhood of $800 million.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: By whom?
Hon. Mr. Wall: By many competent students
of economics and politics.
Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): Including yourself?
Hon. Mr. Wall: Yes, including myself.
What about 1962-63? Our main estimates
for 1962-63 are $6,276 million. To that figure
I have to add the $279 million offset which
I have already mentioned, the reduction in
tax collections to offset the reduction in payments to provinces, to which I add $335 million, which is an average figure for the last
five years of supplementary estimates. That
gives me a total of $6,890 million, as compared, honourable senators, to $6,282 million
so far for 1961-62. That is roughly $600 million more. I do not know how the additional
$125 million for old age security, and so on,
is to be financed.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It is $114.3 million.

FEBRUARY 22, 1962
But, is this the whole story? Suppose we
examine what has happened to the amount
of Government of Canada direct and outstanding secarities from which I have subtracted the holdings of Government accounts
and Government bank balances. On June
30, 1957, the total of these outstanding
securities was $13,310 million. On January 31,
1962, the total was $17,193 million. This is an
increase of $3,883 million, or about 29 per
cent.
On a per capita basis this overall debt
load increased from $802 to $951 or, roughly,
by 18 per cent. For a family of four the
increase was $796. On a per employed worker
basis this overall debt load increased from
$2,307 to $2,827 or, roughly, by 22 per cent.
That is an interesting start, but let us
look at what happened to the debt charges.
Ah! there's the rub, the debt charges! The
annual interest on unmatured debt, including
treasury bills of Canada, can be summarized
thus: for the year ending March 31, 1957 the
debt was $14,368 million, the annual interestthis is the critical point-was $438,232,692; for
the year ending March 31, 1961 the unmatured
debt was already $16,067,914,914, but the
annual interest was $628,338,354. The increase
in the debt was $1,699,499,461, or 12 per cent,
which is not too bad.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Branford): This is
for how many years?
Hon. Mr. Wall: From March 31, 1957 to
March 31, 1961.
The increase in the annual interest was
$190,105,622, or 43 per cent. The interest
charge increase per man, woman and child
was about $10, or $40 per family of four.
There is another way of calculating these
total public debt charges, and that is to take
these same points of time, begin with the
total interest on public debt, subtract from
it the returns on investments, and add the
amortization discounts and commissions and
other departmental charges. This calculation
gives us net public debt charges which we
can also show on a per capita basis and
on a per employed worker basis. I did this
calculation and I obtained these figures: In
1957 the net public debt charge was $327.5
million, which is $20 per capita and $57
per employed person; in 1961 the net public
debt charge was $513.8 million-on a per
capita basis it is $28.50 which is about 40 per
cent more per person, and on a per employed
worker basis it is $85, or 49 per cent more.
Honourable senators, I have dealt at some
length with key economic indicators, which
some say are the outward symptoms of a
national economic malaise. That may be too
gloomy a view, but it is something about
which thoughtful Canadians are confused

and deeply troubled for, quite correctly,
and apart from the danger of world war
and our attendant national security, they
regard the problem of economic growth to
be the basic problem of overriding national
concern.
Quite correctly, they are concerned with
real and continual growth rather than with
short-term spurts arising from brief cyclical
upswings. Quite correctly, they regard real
and continual growth as the key to other
very important but sequential or auxiliary
issues-such as the financing of desirable
social services, the location and financing of
public works, the expansion of financial aid
to universities and colleges, the solving of
the Columbia River Treaty problem, and
so on.
I respectfully submit that the yardsticks
which I have presented, and the continuing
scourge of heavy unemployment and our
latest immigration figures-which, as I said
earlier, are running at just slightly over
10,000 per year which is a drop of about
1,700 per cent since 1957-all bear witness
to the need for other policies, together with
new trade policies, to help resume our pre1957 economic growth index, with all that
this will mean in our ability and willingness
to undertake pressing national improvement
projects, be they slum clearance or other
needed municipal works, be they national
health insurance plans or richer opportunities
in education, or be they increased contributions to help the developing countries to
help themselves to a better life in freedom.
If you look at the main estimates for this
year you will notice, honourable senators,
that we have made no significant progress
in contributing more to help other countries.
Naturally, thoughtful Canadians are aware
that there are other important issues upon
which there have been no indications of
any clear-cut, tangible and positive Government policies. Two very perturbing questions
come to mind, as examples.
(1) Should Canada become a nuclear
power, really as an adjunct to the United
States?
(2) How can our bicultural national structure be strengthened and made more wholesome so that our pluralistic society will feel
more secure and happy with and in Confederation? Will the adoption of a national
flag help? What else is needed?
Yet, honourable senators, these same
thoughtful Canadians, disturbed by what one
Canadian publication describes as "Canada's
growing isolation from its friends and allies,
in trade and defence"-and I give the reference so that honourable senators can follow
it up if they wish; Canada Month, February
1962, page 19-deeply concerned about the

SENATE
fact that Canada is apparently being sidelined while other nations are making very
significant economie strides-and I refer you
to the index figures which Mr. DeYoung so
thoughtfully
contributed-and,
convinced
that the sovereign issue is the resumption of
our economic growth, these Canadians believe
that Canada now needs to take clear-cut and
positive action to seize new and exciting
opportunities at a time when the whole North
American community is altering its character, economie and political. They believe
that waiting for the outcome of the developing United States debate on trade policies,
and then merely tagging along after the
Americans, is not adequate for our present
circumstances and is not adequate in. terms
of the unfolding international situation. They
ask themselves this question: Does not the
immediate issue revolve around a clear-cut
and positive answer as to whether Canada
should seize the initiative in seeking some
form of North Atlantic common market, or
is it better for Canada to wait or even to
resist the events which are revolutionizing
the affairs of the entire free world?
They answer this question in this fashion:
If Canadians are to co-operate with Europe,
with the United Kingdom and with the
United States in a courageous program of
expanding the trade, the wealth, and the
power of the free and democratic world by
further co-ordination and integration of the
free world's economy-about which I spoke
yesterday-then we cannot do this by merely
talking loudly about our worries or by hanging back. We cannot do this by protecting
our uneconomic industries from foreign
competition. We cannot do this simply by
trying to divide more equitably the "national
economic pie" which has not been growing
fast enough, thereby resulting in all the
symptoms of our economic malaise to which
I have referred.
Upon these vital issues, Canadians need
and expect clear-cut, understandable, positive and outward-looking policies. Perhaps it
was this conviction, which I share, that
prompted the Globe and Mail on January 20
to summarize its reaction to the Speech from
the Throne in these words:
Taken as a whole, this Speech from
the Throne, with its evasion of major issues in a time of crisis, is an inadequate
document for a government which has
been four years in office.

PRIVATE BILL
MUTTART DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION LTD.
-SECOND READING

Hon. William R. Bruni moved the second
reading of Bill S-7, respecting Muttart Development Corporation Ltd.

He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this particular bill is to convert a company known as Muttart Development Corporation Ltd., which was originally incorporated by letters patent issued by the Secretary
of State on or about August 21, 1958,
into a loan company so that the new company
will have all the powers and privileges
given by the provisions of the Loan Companies Act. It will, of course, be subject to
all of the limitations and liabilities set out in
that act.
In addition, the sponsors desire to change
the name of this company from Muttart
Development Corporation Ltd. to Muttart
Mortgage Corporation.
I think it would be in order if I were to
give a brief explanation why a change such
as this is considered necessary. At the time
the Muttart Development Corporation Ltd.
was incorporated it was given certain powers,
among others being the right to deal in real
estate and to loan money on the security of
real estate.
When the sponsors originally decided to
incorporate Muttart Development Corporation Ltd. they had long discussions with the
Insurance Department, under the Minister
of Finance, about the possibility of incorporating at that time a loan company. However, the requirement of paid-up capital was
such that the sponsors could not meet it
and for that reason they decided at that
time that they would not incorporate under
the Loan Companies Act.
The sponsors at that time were quite
satisfied if they could obtain the right to
buy mortgages, but not to make direct loans.
As a result, several consultations and conferences were held with the Director of the
Companies Branch of the Department of the
Secretary of State who, in turn, consulted the
Department of Justice and, after obtaining
an opinion from that department, it appeared
that a company could be incorporated by
letters patent and have the power only to
buy mortgages in existence but not to make
direct loans.
Accordingly, this company was incorporated
and commenced to do business. It purchased
mortgages from various building companies

operating from the province of Ontario, in
the east, to the west coast. This meant that
this particular company has been a source

FEBRUARY 22, 1962
of finance for various companies who manufacture and build houses, take back mortgages
on the same, and desire to sell and dispose
of their mortgages.
The company has thrived and is prosperous,
and the sponsors were quite willing to continue the company with its limited powers.
However, honourable senators will recall that
during the 1960-61 session of Parliament the
Loan Companies Act was amended-in fact, I
sponsored the amendments in this chamberand a change was made by amending the
definitive section of the act so that a loan company is now defined in section 2, paragraph

(f), as follows:
"the company" or "loan company"
means a company incorporated for the
purpose of
(i) lending money on the security of
freehold real estate, or investing in
mortgages or hypothecs upon freehold
real estate, either with or without other
objects or powers.
This change in the Loan Companies Act was
certainly not aimed at Muttart Development
Corporation Ltd. However, this company was
swept up in it, and now the Insurance Department, under the Minister of Finance, takes
the position that this company, from the effective date of the amendment to the Loan
Companies Act of 1961, has been exercising
powers which belong exclusively to a loan
company, and since it was not incorporated
under the provisions of the Loan Companies
Act, it must stop investing money in mortgages
unless the company is converted to a loan
company.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Will it be retroactive?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I doubt very much if it
will be retroactive. When I get to the bill,
senator, you will understand why I say that.
All persons connected with Muttart Development Corporation Ltd. are anxious to carry
on their business of purchasing first mortgages
in accordance with the law as it now exists,
and it is for that reason that this bill is being
introduced to convert this company into a loan
company.
I have been given to understand that the
matter has been discussed thoroughly with
Mr. K. R. MacGregor of the Insurance Department, and that he is content that this
should be done. I believe that he is satisfied
with the form of the bill which I am now
presenting.
With this explanation of the background
relating to this particular bill, I would crave
your further indulgence for a few minutes to
make a brief explanation with respect to the
bill itself.
Honourable senators will note that by clause
1 of -the bill the original company, now known
26211-3-16

as Muttart Development Corporation Ltd., is
deemed to become a loan company incorporated by special Act of Parliament, and
that it shall bear the new name, Muttart
Mortgage Corporation.
Clause 2 sets forth in detail all of the
directors of the new company, and I understand that each and every one of these
persons is at present a director of what I
shall refer to as the old company.
Under clause 3, subclause 1, honourable
senators will note that a change in the capital
stock of the company is proposed. The old
company was originally incorporated with
two million shares of capital stock, having
a par value of $1 each. Under this bill, these
shares will be converted into stock having
a par value of $10 each. As a result of this
the authorized capital will be reduced from
two million shares to 200,000 shares, so that
each shareholder in the old company will
receive one share of capital stock in the new
company for each ten shares held by hirn in
the old company.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): The
amount of the capital will remain the same?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Oh, yes, in dollars it
remains exactly the same. The par value has
been increased ten times. The number of
shares to be held by each shareholder will be
reduced to one-tenth of the number held in
the old company.
The sponsors are also asking that they be
given a right to increase the capitalization of
this company up to $6 million. By asking for
this, they believe they will save themselves
the necessity of coming back to Parliament
in the future in order to have their act
amended.
The head office of the new company will
be in Metropolitan Toronto, in the county of
York, which is the present location of the
head office of the old company.
By clause 6 of the bill, the powers which
were granted to the old company by letters
patent are cancelled, and clause 7 substitutes
the new powers, being those which are conferred on al companies incorporated under
the provisions of the Loan Companies Act.
Finally, honourable senators will note that
this bill shall not become law until a certificate has been issued by the Minister of
Finance pursuant to clause 13 of the Loan
Companies Act.
Clause 13 sets forth in detail all of the
requirements which have to be met before
such a certificate can be issued.
Honourable senators, if this bill receives
second reading, it is my intention to move to
refer it to the Banking and Commerce Committee, where Mr. K. R. MacGregor, the
Superintendent of Insurance the solicitor

SENATE
acting for the company, and officers of the
company will attend to give a much fuller
explanation than I have given this afternoon,
and, in addition, they will be prepared to
answer any questions which may be asked
by honourable senators. With respect to the
question of retroactivity raised by the honourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris), I think we will be able to
obtain an answer in committee.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I have in mind your suggestion that the company has been operating
in excess of its present powers.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is right. I cannot get
around it.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Then those operations are
void, are they not?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Well, I would rather not
express an opinion, if I may be excused from
doing so. They may not have purchased any
mortgages for this interim period. I would
think that all their operations up until the
time that the amendments to the Loan Companies Act passed last year became law would
be quite in order; but there is a question
as to those transactions which were entered
into by the company between that time and
the time that this bill becomes operative and
effective.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Did they do anything
else besides purchase mortgages?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I understand not. I have
here the statement of the company for the
year ending November 30, 1961, which shows
interest earned in excess of $300,000, discounts
earned-that is, on purchased mortgages in
excess of $200,000-and sundry income, $1,586,
making a total income of approximately
$528,000. The company had a net profit last
year of almost $126,000.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Does the
company accept deposits from the public?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No. The capital is provided
by the sale of shares. The company realized
from the sale of shares, $1,855,500. The surplus account shows a balance on hand in
excess of $144,000. So, the capital account and
surplus account now amount to almost $2
million.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): I notice
that under clause 7 the company will have all
the powers, privileges, etc., under the provisions of the Loan Companies Act.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Does that
not empower the company to accept deposits?

Hon. Mr. Bruni: No, I do not think it does.
If deposits are accepted, I think the Trust
Companies Act applies. I have never heard of
loan companies accepting deposits.
Motion agreed to and bill read second
time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Brunt, bill referred

Commerce.
PRIVATE BILL
SUN LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY OF CANADASECOND READING

Hon. Lionel Choquette moved, with leave,
the second reading of Bill S-8, respecting
Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, this is not
a complicated bill; it is merely an application by the Sun Life Assurance Company
to be given a French name. The first French
name of the company was "Compagnie
d'assurance sur la vie de Montréal, dite du
Soleil". The word "Sun" was translated by
the French word "Soleil". Subsequently, this
name was changed to "Compagnie Canadienne
d'assurance sur la vie, dite du Soleil".
Neither of these names was of any practical use to the company for obvious reasons. Now, the company, in order that its
name be recognizable to the public in the
French language, has requested what I would
consider to be a very sensible French version,
although not a precise translation in French
of the English version.
The proposed new name, as mentioned
in the explanatory note of Bill S-8, is "Sun
Life du Canada, compagnie d'assurance-vie".
I would like to clear up the misunderstanding, honourable senators, and I think
this is an appropriate occasion to do so,
which seems to be prevalent regarding French
names of various companies in Canada. In
a recent discussion on another measureand I did not offer an explanation at the
time because the bill did not concern me
directly-a remark was made that the translation of the name of a company was a
coarse translation or, at least not an accurate one, to put it mildly. I have looked
up that point of law, and I think I can
enlighten honourable senators on it. Parliament is absolutely competent with respect
to any company having extra-provincial
objects to give that company whatever name
it thinks fit, whether in English or in French,
or both, and whether or not either name is
in perfect English or perfect French. For
instance, we could authorize the use of the
word "throughway", spelled "t-h-r-u-w-a-y"
or the word "enough", spelled "e-n-u-f".

FEBRUARY 22, 1962
Hon. Mr. Higgins: Enough of that, now!
Hon. Mr. Choquette: The honourable senator to my right says, "Enough of that, now!"
He evidently does not want me to mutilate
the English language.
There is no constitutional or other requirement that a company must have as its French
name an exact or puristic equivalent translation of its English name.
I would hope that the misconception which
appears to continue, to the effect that English
and French names of companies must be exact
translations in each language, may be removed once and for ail. It is for Parliament to
say what the English name of the company
shall be and what the French name of the
company shall be; and, unless there is some
good reason to change the French name as

26211-3-16J

requested by the petitioner, other than that it
is not a precise translation of the English version, then the Senate should accept the French
version as suggested. The only problem that
Parliament has to consider from time to time
is whether a proposed new name might cause
the public to confuse the company with some
other company with a similar name or with
a Government agency.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

PRIVATE BILL
BROCK ACCEPTANCE LIMITED-SECOND
READING

Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson moved second
reading of Bill S-9, to incorporate Brock Acceptance Limited.
He said: Honourable senators, it will be observed that Bill S-9 is a very short bill. It
contains only seven clauses which are set out
on one page. It asks for the incorporation of
a company to be known as Brock Acceptance Limited. The petitioners for incorporation are three business people, all of whom
reside in the city of Winnipeg. They will become the first shareholders of the company,

SENATE
together with such other persons as may wish
to join with them. The capital stock of the
company is to be $250,000, of which $100,000
has to be subscribed before the provisional
directors may call a general meeting of the
shareholders. There is a further provision that
the company shall not commence business
until $250,000 of the capital stock has been
subscribed, and $100,000 paid in on it. The
head office of the company is to be in the city
of Winnipeg, in the province of Manitoba.
This company is to be incorporated pursuant to Part II of the Small Loans Act. This
is provided for by clause 7 which says that all
the provisions of the Small Loans Act shall
extend and apply to it. It is because incorporation is asked for pursuant to that act, that
this bill is in such a short form. It follows the
form set out in one of the schedules to the
Small Loans Act.
It will be noticed, honourable senators,
that the powers and disabilities of the company are not set forth in the bill. That is
because they are fully set out in the Small
Loans Act. In other words, the company
has the rights and the powers, and is subject
to the disabilities, set out in that act.
That is, perhaps, all that I need say at
this time with respect to this incorporation.
If this bill receives second reading, I shall
move that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, the honourable sponsor of this bill
(Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson) has explained its
provisions, but he has not told us very much
about the company. I understand that the
company will have all the powers given
to it by the Small Loans Act, but I am
wondering what type of business it proposes
to carry on. Is it going to make small loans
or, as one would judge from its name, is it
going to accept paper and discount it? I
wonder if the honourable gentleman would
give us some idea of the nature of the
business this company proposes to conduct.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Honourable senators, I shall be glad to indicate briefly the
business the company proposes to conduct.
It is asking for the powers given in the
Small Loans Act, and proposes to do business accordingly. Section 14 of that act sets
out some of the powers given a company
incorporated under that act.
The company may (a) buy, sell, deal
in and lend money on the security of,
conditional sale agreements, lien notes,
hire purchase agreements, chattel mortgages, trade paper, bills of lading, warehouse receipts, bills of exchange and
choses in action; and may receive and
accept from the makers, vendors or

transferors thereof guarantees or other
security for the performance and payment thereof and may enforce such guarantees and realize on such security.
That is simply the business of an ordinary acceptance company, as many of these
companies are called. They deal in commercial paper. They buy commercial obligations,
discount them and collect under them.
Section 14 (b) of the act sets out additional
powers extended to these companies, and
it is perhaps from these powers we get
the name "small loan companies". I shall
read only part of subsection (b) which indicates generally the powers of a company in
regard to loaning money.
The company may (b) lend money
in sums not exceeding five hundred dollars in amountThat is why such companies are called
small loan companies.
-and may change, exact or receive or
stipulate for the payment by the borrower of a sum of money as the cost
of a loan which shall not exceed an
amount equivalent to the amounts or
rates herein prescribed, namely, in the
case of a loan for a period of fifteen
months or less, two per cent per month
on the amount actually advanced to the
borrower and monthly balances thereof
from time to time outstanding, and in
the case of a loan for a period greater
than fifteen months, one per cent per
month on the amount actually advanced
to the borrowerI think the reading of these lines is sufficient to indicate the powers of the company in
regard to lending money. There is a limit of
$500 on the amount of the loans, and there
is a ceiling on the interest rate that can
be charged, namely, two per cent per month
for the first fifteen months, and if the loan
is for a longer period the maximum rate is
one per cent per month on outstanding
balances.
I might say there is a provision in this
act which is rather unusual in legislation
authorizing the incorporation of companies;
that is, if the company is found to deviate
from the terms of the act in respect to the
way it carries on business, its charter may
be taken away.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Halifax North): Are
there any penalties?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Yes, there is a
penalty section. Section 20 provides:
Every person who transacts the business
of a money-lender without a licence,

FEBRUARY 23, 1962
contrary to the provisions of this act, or
who in any other respect contravenes the
provisions of this act, is guilty of an
offence and if no other penalty is provided is liable on summary conviction to
a fine not exceding one thousand dollars.
That, of course, applies to persons who
transact the business of a money lender without a licence. However, section 18 of the act
gives the power of cancellation of the charter.
It reads:
If the company, in respect of any transaction of loan, directly or indirectly
charges, imposes upon, or demands or
receives from or through any borrower,
as the cost of any loan, an amount or
rate in excess of the amount or rate
authorized by this act, the company, in
addition to its liability to any other
penalty or to any other consequence
otherwise provided, is liable to be wound
up and to be dissolved if the Attorney
General of Canada, upon receipt of a
certificate of the minister setting forth
his opinion that the company has so
charged, imposed, demanded or received,
applies to a court of competent jurisdiction for an order that the company be
wound up under the provisions of the
Winding-Up Act, which provisions in such
case apply to the company, as nearly as
may be, as if it were an insolvent insurance company.
When I said that the company would lose
its charter, that is not strictly correct. The
company is subject to being wound up under
the provisions of section 18.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford):
charter is not much good after that.

Its

Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: No, its charter is

Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: No, they are different people entirely. At least, as far as I
know, they are not the same promoters.

PRIVATE BILL
GERAND ACCEPTANCE COMPANY-SECOND
READING
Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson moved the
second reading of Bill S-10, to incorporate
Gerand Acceptance Company.
He said: Honourable senators, as has been
said by the honourable senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), this bill is in
practically identical terms with the Bill S-9
which has just received second reading.
The applicants for incorporation are also
Winnipeg people. The persons named will
become the provisional directors of the company. The capital stock of the company is
to be $250,000. There is the requirement
that $100,000 must be subscribed before a
general meeting of the shareholders is called.
There is also the requirement that the company shall not commence business until
$250,000 of the capital stock has been subscribed and $100,000 paid in. The head office
of this company is also to be in the city
of Winnipeg.
Furthermore, the company is incorporated
pursuant to Part II of the Small Loans Act.
Everything about this incorporation is identical with the previous measure, except that
the name of the company is different and
the petition for incorporation is by different
people.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): One more

the name "Brock" has been used, and if there
is any significance to the name. Is there any

SENATE
EXPORT CREDITS INSURANCE
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND

ACT

READING

In this regard, I observe from the February
16 Dominion Bureau of Statistics Weekly
Bulletin that in the third quarter of 1961the months of July, August and Septembercommodity imports were at an all-time high
for the period, having a value of $1,417,300,000,
and being 9.4 per cent higher than a year
earlier.
From the D.B.S. bulletin of February 9
I observe that Canada's exports for the month
of November, 1961 were 13.6 per cent in
excess of the same month in 1960; and I say,
further, that this figure of between 13 and
14 per cent, is our present rate of increase of
exports over similar periods of 1960. Indeed,
the latest D.B.S. bulletin, dated February 23,
gives the estimated value of Canada's commodity imports for the whole year, 1961, at
$5,794,500,000-the highest value on recordup 5.5 per cent from the previous year's total
of $5,492,300,000.
But apart from the size of these figures as
to the greatly increased volume of foreign
trade, one other factor in our trading relationships that is of great importance, certainly in
so far as the strength of our economy is concerned, is the relative balance of merchandise
imports and exports. There are, of course,
some countries that have huge "invisible" exports such as the United States and the United
Kingdom, and which can, therefore, afford
large adverse imbalances in their commodity
trade. But that is not the case with Canada.
In view of our traditional position in regard
to these invisible items, namely, interest and
dividend payments abroad, travel costs, shipping charges, insurance etc., we must make
every reasonable endeavour to achieve a
favourable balance on our foreign commodity
trade. So, I think it is most gratifying that
1961 was the first year since 1952 that we
have exported more goods than we bought.
Until now, the last favourable trade balance
that we had was in the year 1952, when the
balance, to the nearest million, was $420
million.
The figures in this regard for the years 1953
to 1960 are as follows:

The Senate resumed from Wednesday, February 21, the adjourned debate on the motion
of Hon. Mr. Blois for the second reading of
Bill C-68, to amend the Export Credits Insurance Act.
Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson: Honourable
senators, I believe there is general agreement
that the Export Credits Insurance Act has
been a most useful and appropriate method of
assisting Canadian industry to enable its products to compete with those of other countries
in foreign markets. It is therefore quite consistent with our growing international trade
that it should become necessary from time to
time to place more capital at the disposal of
the Export Credits Insurance Corporation.
That is the purpose of this bill.
I am sure it is a matter of satisfaction to
all Canadians to know that during the past
few years Canada's external trade has been
growing at a very creditable rate. In the case
of some countries, such as the United States,
foreign trade is a small factor in their total
trading activities over any given year. Indeed, I recall figures I gave in this house one
or two sessions ago which showed that
whereas the total foreign trade of the United
States amounted to approximately 7 per cent
of its Gross National Product in any year, that
of Canada amounted to 31 per cent of its
Gross National Product. That indicates how
much more dependent our economy is upon
foreign trade than is that of the United
States. As I have said, our total foreign trade
is, on a percentage basis, several times that
of the United States; and, consequently there
has been common consent, I believe, for the
view that an expanding foreign trade is one
of our important means of maintaining steady
economic progress for Canada and, of course,
at the same time it is a large factor in meeting the problem of Canadian employment.
I have spoken of an expanding foreign
trade without saying how much it has grown
in the last few years. The fact is that in 1956
our total export of goods amounted to $4.8
billion, and in 1961 to $5.7 billion, an increase
of $900 million or a percentage increase of 19
per cent over this period. At the same time
our imports increased from $5.5 billion to
$5.7 billion, a percentage increase of 3.5 per
cent. By the way, these figures in regard to
imports are from October 1, 1960 to October
1, 1961, and are the latest available.
As is well known, there has been a most
gratifying increase in our foreign trade in
1961 over preceding years, which fact is, I am
sure, one of the key reasons for the very In the eleven months, January to November,.

FEBRUARY 27, 1962
These figures are taken from the Dominion
Bureau of Statisties publication "Review on
Foreign Trade" for the current year 1960;
and of course the latter figures are also from
D.B.S.
I think it is of great importance to our
economy that we do not relax in our drive
to sell our goods to the world. I believe the
Minister of Trade and Commerce and the
Minister of Agriculture are entitled to great
praise for their success in increasing Canada's
exports. I am sure that Canadians generally
who give thought to the more important
factors of our economic life, are well aware
of the sound and purposeful efforts of these
ministers and their associates.
Let me give you one case in point, namely,
the position of our grain-growing farmers of
western Canada. Up until 1961 our wheat
growers, especially, were fighting a grim and
losing battle. It is bad enough for farmers
to have to face the hazards of drought, insects and plant diseases, hail and other types
of catastrophe, without having to face the
everlasting prospect of not being able to sell
what is produced. There was utter discouragement in western Canada because of
this latter fact, but now the picture is completely changed. As a result of adopting
bold yet sensible policies in regard to the
sale of wheat to China and other countries
which previously were not customers, and
through sales financed by Canada by means
identical with the methods used by the Canadian Export Credits Insurance Corporation,
the outlook and attitude of the western Canadian farm community has changed from one
of despair to confidence. That confidence is
part of the reason for the general booming
prosperity in western Canada today.
Now, honourable senators, I am not blaming any previous government for the fact that
in Canada wheat became a drug on the
market, that it was running out of our ears.
But I might draw attention to the fact that
our friend and neighbour to the south of us,
by the policy of placing the United States
Treasury behind the wheat growers of that
country and thereby piling up enormous
artificial surpluses of wheat, and by adopting
giveaway wheat sale policies, represented by
sale of wheat for soft currencies and other
methods, brought our wheat-growing industry
in western Canada to a virtual standstill.
This is not necessarily a criticism of United
States policies-it is merely a re-statement of
facts that are well known.
However, coming back to our general trading position, I submit that the fact of our
present highest volume of foreign trade in
Canada's history, and the further fact that
our present trading position is now in balance and a little better, is a result of the

foundation that has been laid in recent years
by the application of sane and correct government policies, fiscal and otherwise, and
the carrying out of these policies with vigour,
enthusiasm and good sense.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): May I
ask the honourable gentleman one question
for information only? Was the wheat that
went to China sold under the credits provided by the Export Credits Insurance Act?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: No. I said it was
sold under principles that were really identical with the principle underlying the act.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): But not
under this act?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: No, not under this
act.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: Do the figures that you
gave as to the improvement in the balance
of trade include the figures on wheat sold
to China on the long-term basis?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I would think so.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: Have you any figures to
show what that amounted to over the past
two years?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: No, but they are
very considerable. Wheat sales have been
quite large, as we all know.
Honourable senators, by reason of various
discussions which have taken place recently
in regard to Canada's trading relationships
with Cuba, it might now be appropriate for
me to set out the position of this country
as I personally view it. I shall try to do
so in proper perspective, and without the
hysteria and appeals to passion and prejudice
that have characterized so many of the remarks on the subject, even in this chamber.
In the first place, let me say this: there
appear to be some people who-if they
mean what they say and are not speaking
merely in the hope of easy political gainsbelieve that Canada should adopt a trading
posture vis-à-vis Cuba which would be different from any country in the world except
presumably, the United States.
These people do not presume to disclose,
of course, what they think our policy ought
to be in this respect, but cloak their remarks
by appeals, not to reason but to unreasoning
prejudice, and getting newspaper headlines
by, for instance, referring to the export to
Cuba of dynamite-the export in question
being not dynamite, but blasting powder,
which is used in road building. Incidentally,
the honourable member for Toronto-Spadina
(Hon. Mr. Croll) did not disclose in his remarks that one of the articles sold by Canada
to Cuba was radioactive isotopes used in

SENATE
treating cancer. I would think in the honourable senator's view this should be a very
dangerous substance to send to Cubans.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask my honourable
friend a question? Are the exports to Cuba
guaranteed under the provisions of this act?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: No exports to any
country are guaranteed under the provisions
of this act unless they are sold on credit.
My information is that nothing is sold on
credit to Cuba-everything that is sold to
Cuba by Canada and I presume by every
other nation, is sold for cash.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If that is the case, what
bearing has this discussion of Cuba got to
do with whether or not we should amend
this act?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: The other day that point
was raised on the other side.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I would think that
those who were here a few days ago and
heard the speech then made by the honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr.
Croll) under this bill in regard to trade with
Cuba, would allow me to proceed to reply.
I will admit, however, that if during these
remarks some objection is taken, then strictly
speaking, I might be ruled out of order. I suggest it is only appropriate that I be allowed
to reply to the honourable gentleman's statement.

editorial is entitled, "Besmirching Canada's
Name." I quote from it because I desire to
adopt it completely as my own words, with
regard to this subject.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I hope it
is not too long.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I am adopting these
words as my own.

Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I adopt these words
as my own. They summarize very succinctly
the argument I wish to present to this house.
The article states, in part:

FEBRUARY 27, 1962
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I now wish to quote
the last paragraph of the editorial:
No doubt party strategists hope that
by beating the drums on this matter
they may gather votes in areas where
anti-communist feeling is strong. It is
very doubtful, however, if an election
can be won on so artificial an issue.
The main effect of the Liberal accusation can only be to besmirch Canada's
good name abroad by suggesting that we
are secretly violating international obligations.
Honourable senators, there seems to be a
lot of good common sense in the content of
this editorial. However, as we all know,
for prominent Canadians to besmirch Canada's name abroad is always good headline
material and, indeed, let us not overlook the
possibility that in some quarters it might be
useful political propaganda.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Mr.
Speaker, on a point of order, if the honourable gentleman is suggesting that any honourable member of this house has besmirched
Canada's name abroad, he should withdraw
such an accusation. He cannot accuse an
honourable senator of besmirching Canada's
name.
The Hon. the Speaker: Do you contend
that he has done so?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I do not
know that he has, but he has not made himself clear.
The Hon. the Speaker: Well, if you do not
so contend, there is no point in ruling on it.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I have not made any
accusation of that kind.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: It seems to me that
honourable senators on the other side are
a little touchy on this subject today.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I am not
at all touchy. I might say, with all due
respect to the Globe and Mail, that the honourable senator could have expressed much
better himself what is said in that editorial.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Honourable senators, I now want to say something about
our position vis-à-vis the rest of the world
in our trading relationships with Cuba. There
was a time many years ago, in our relationships with Great Britain, when many Canadians took the view described by the phrase
"Ready, Aye Ready", whenever Britain was
in trouble in any part of the world. That
attitude has, of course, been dead for a long
time.
It appears that there are some people in
Canada today who believe that our foreign

policy towards Cuba should be a servile one,
following the United States position. Surely,
that is not the view of the overwhelming
majority of Canadians.
In this discussion it should be unnecessary
to re-state our Government's attitude towards
Cuba. On two occasions recentlyHon. Mr. Crerar: May I interrupt? I protest, honourable senators, against the political
discussion of a bill that seeks to do two
things: firstly, to increase the board of directors of the corporation by one member;
and, secondly, to increase the amount of
guarantees by $100 million. If my honourable friend wants to make a political speech
-and he is evidently keenly bent on doing
so-I submit this is not the appropriate occasion. I should like him to tell us whether or
not he favours the amendments proposed in
the bill and, if be does, the justification for
them.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I might remind the
honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) that such a speech as he describes
was made just last week.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Might I ask the honourable senator from Churchill whether he
wants all the political speeches to emanate
from only one side of the house-his side?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: On two occasions
recently the Prime Minister has been outspoken in his firm denunciation of the criminal regime presently ruling Cuba. I would
hope that a similar attitude of disgust towards Cuba prevails in the United Kingdom,
France and other NATO countries, together
with some, but perhaps not all, of the nations
of South America.
Except for the NATO countries, of which
we are one, countries of the world generally
have done business freely in all types of
goods with communist countries. The NATO
countries have compiled a list of goods which
is an enumeration of various types of military supplies, machinery for the manufacture
of armaments and the like, which the member
countries have agreed not to export to communist countries. Needless to say, Canada has
never violated its agreement with its NATO
partners in this regard and, as far as I know,
no one has alleged that we have done so.
Reverting to the subject of blasting powder,
is there anyone who would suggest that if
Cuba could not have purchased this material
from Canada for its road building, or for
other domestic purposes, it would not have
purchased it from any other NATO country
excepting the United States or from scores
of other countries of the world?

FEBRUARY 27, 1962
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): What has
that got to do with Canada?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Very much. I am
just coming to that, if the honourable senator
would let me go on.
The request was made to the permanent
council of NATO by Walt W. Rostow,
director of the State Department's policy
planning council . . .
His visit was designed to win European
support for the sanctions decided against
the Castro regime by the Organization of
American States at a meeting last month
in Punta del Este, Uruguay.
Then, reading another paragraph:
While the U.S. appeal for general curbs
on trade with Cuba is likely to be treated
with reserve, the question of banning
arms, munitions and other strategic goods
from Cuba is not expected to cause much
trouble.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Who said
that?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: That is a news item
from the New York Times Service, in an
article written by W. Granger Blair.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): It is somebody else's opinion.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Oh no, that is not
an opinion at all; these are facts. I say to
the honourable senator: these are facts. Canada is the only country in the world which
bas assumed a voluntary ban against the shipment of strategic materials to Cuba-that
happened nearly two years ago. Our NATO
partners have been consistently shipping
strategic materials to Cuba until perhaps now
the United States is asking its NATO partners
to apply an embargo on those strategic materials.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): At the end
of my honourable friend's quotation he gives
somebody's opinion as to what the result
would be.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Well, yes; I think
there was an opinion in the news item. If
honourable senators will read the news item,
they will see it is fairly obvious that the
NATO nations are now going to agree to
place a ban on the export of strategic materials to Cuba. This is simply an opinion
which I believe has been borne out by fact
during the last week.
However, you will have noticed also newspaper reports that Great Britain has refused
to apply a ban in regard to its ordinary trade
with Cuba.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): I still do
not see what it has to do with Canada.

Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I think it all has
to do with the speech which was made the
other day by the honourable senator from
Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croll).
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): That is not
my recollection.
Hon. Mr. Croll: While the honourable senator is quoting the speech, and making statements that Great Britain will continue to
trade with Cuba, will he also give the reasons?
This newspaper article gives the reason why
Great Britain is continuing her trade with
Cuba. It says in the report of February 20
that Cuba has defaulted in her obligations,
and Great Britain is providing her with money
in order to meet her obligations.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Is that not quite
logical?
I would like to read now a London dispatch
which refers to cigars:
The British Government today rejected
a suggestion that British imports of cigars
from pro-communist Cuba should be cut
in favour of imports from Jamaica, a
member of the Commonwealth.
The suggestion was made in the House
of Commons by Nigel Fisher, a Conservative member of Parliament.
That is all that is said in this particular
dispatch, but quite recently there was an
article in, I think, the Gazette which contained the information that has just been
given.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): It is about
time we got back to the bill.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Cigars-that does not seem
to be very strategic material.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: You started it.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: On February 22 last
the Ottawa Journal, reporting a speech made
by the honourable senator from TorontoSpadina, said:
Senator David Croll charged that Canada is asking for trouble with the United
States by continuing to trade with Cuba.
Now, if that is an accurate report, does the
honourable senator aver that we should just
say, "Me, too" to the United States in regard to
all its Cuban policies? Does he imply that Canada is in deeper trouble with the United States
than, say, Mexico or Brazil, who have not
even banned the sale of arms or strategic
materials to Cuba? Does the honourable senator suggest that the United States will invade
us or just stop trading with us? And then, is
the United States also going to take the same
steps against Mexico, Brazil, Ecuador and
Chile, who abstained from the vote on the
Punta del Este resolution No. 8?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Is the
honourable senator posing these questions
himself?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Well, they follow
naturally from the speech of the honourable
senator from Toronto-Spadina.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I do not
know whether the honourable senator is still

of voluntary abstention from the sale of armaments and strategic materials to Cuba. At that
time we gave our solenn pledge to the United
States that we would take every precaution
to prevent trans-shipment of United States
goods to Cuba. We would have learned about
it very quickly if that pledge had not been
honoured.
So far as I know, at no time has the
United States officially complained to Canada
that our trading position vis-à-vis Cuba was
not correct; nor have they asked us to alter
our present policy in that regard, nor is that
country likely to do so, having regard to the
facts that I have given you. Furthermore, let
us recall that the United States has in the
past year supplied Cuba with fifteen times the
number of dollars that Canada has for the
purpose of purchasing goods in other parts
of the world.
Honourable senators, Cuba is a thorn in the
flesh to us all. That is certainly the view
of nearly all Canadians. I am sure it is the
view of our Government. But we, especially
in this body, are aware that world order
would soon vanish if nations ceased to be
governed by principles and, instead, determined their course by day-to-day expediency.
I submit to you, honourable senators, that no
government could have followed a more correct
or a more honourable course than has the
present administration in its recent trade relationships with Cuba.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, this
bill is comparatively simple. It is concerned
with two things.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators, I
would like to ask the honourable senator a
question. Was he present last week when the
honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina
(Hon. Mr. Croîl) devoted nearly all his speech
on this bill to Canada's trade with Cuba?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If my honourable friend
the Leader of the Government in this house
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) had restrained himself, as
he usually does, for a short time he would
have had no occasion to rise and ask the question he did. I am speaking of the bill. I support the bill. I support it because experience
has demonstrated that it is a useful measure.
This act has been on our statute books
quite a while; its principle was approved by
Parliament when the legislation was first introduced, and experience since has proven
that it is a sound principle. That bas to do
with the bill.
I come now to the other matter. I was not
in the house last week, as honourable senators
will recall, because I happened to be a bit
under the weather with an attack of flu. I
was quite unaware of the discussion that took
place last Wednesday, February 21.

I have glanced hastily over the debate
which took place at that time. The remarks
of the sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr. Blois) were
entirely appropriate, and they dealt with the
measure. It is my opinion that much that was
said by the honourable senator from TorontoSpadina (Hon. Mr. Croll) was distinctly out
of order, and should have been objected to by
the other side of the bouse. But, if he was
out of order then, because two wrongs do not
make a right, I submit that the honourable
senator from Winnipeg South (Hon. Mr.
Thorvaldson) is also out of order, and bas
not set us a good example. What he should
have done was to rise in his place and object
to a discussion of Cuba in a debate on a bill
which has nothing whatever to do with that
country. This bill has not the remotest relationship to Cuba. If we are to have orderly
debate in this house-and it applies to any
assembly-we must have regard for the rules
under which we are supposed to work. That
is all I wish to say.
When I challenged my honourable friend
from Winnipeg South (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson) I was not aware of the discussion that
had taken place last week. However, as I
say, two wrongs do not make a right, and if
my honourable friends on the other side of
the bouse had been on their toes, they would
have objected to Senator Croll's remarksHon. Mr. Choquette: He was so eloquent.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -and I am sure His
Honour the Speaker would have sustained
them.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, it is not my purpose tonight to continue
this debate to any great length. I am not going
to discuss trade with Cuba. I appreciated a
large portion of the speech made tonight by
the honourable senator from Winnipeg South
(Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson), who gave a clear
explanation of the attitude of his party in
most respects. I was, however, a little disappointed in that he did not explain more
clearly why dynamite and airplane engines
are not strategic materials.
The honourable senator made the broad
statement that dynamite is considered by no
one-I think he used words to this effect-as
being strategic material. I would think that
in time of war it would be most strategic
material. I cannot see how he can justify the
sending of airplane engines and parts to
Cuba, and say that they are not strategic
materials.
So far as I am concerned, those are two
points he did not clear up tonight.
Honourable senators, I did not rise to
prolong the argument but to point out that,

SENATE
except for the excellent address by the honourable senator from Colchester-Hants (Hon.
Mr. Blois) who introduced this bill, we have
not heard very much about its purpose. Therefore, I am going to suggest to the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
that when the bill is given second reading it
be referred to the appropriate standing committee.
Hon. Austin C. Taylor: I should like to ask
the honourable senator from Winnipeg South
(Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson) a question that has to
do with a statement he made, if I understood
him correctly, about how prosperous the
western grain growers have been this year
compared with last year.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I did not say the
western grain grower.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): I understood my honourable friend to refer to the
western farmer, at least.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I did not say that.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wesimorland): What did
you say?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I said the economy
of western Canada has been prosperous.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): The economy of western Canada, as I understand it,
is pretty well agriculture.
Hon. Mr. Hnalyshyn: That is not right.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): I should

like to make a reference to the agricultural
conditions of western Canada, if I may, because the honourable senator from Winnipeg
South indicated there was a great upsurge in
the economy of the western grain grower.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): I have in

my hand a copy of the Dominion Bureau of
Statistics Weekly Bulletin of February 23,
and at page 10 it gives the net cash income
of the three western provinces along with
all other provinces. The income of Alberta
amounted to $223,861,000 in 1961, as compared with $233,765,000 in 1960; the income
of Manitoba amounted to $53,338,000 in 1961,
compared with $110,040,000 in 1960; and
the income of Saskatchewan in 1961 was
$103,720,000, compared with $352,623,000 in
1960. If those figures indicate an increase in
prosperity in the three western provinces,
then I don't know anything about it.
Hon. Mr. Hna±yshyn: There was a drought
in western Canada in 1961, you know.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: We have had a most
serious crop failure.

Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wesimorland): Then how
can it be said that the economy of the western
provinces has been abundant?
Hon. Mr. Horner: I don't know where the
honourable senator from Westmorland (Hon.
Mr. Taylor) got his figures, but I dispute
their accuracy. I am positive Saskatchewan's.
income is larger than the figure he gave.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wesimorland): These figures were prepared and published by the
Dominion Bureau of Statistics, an official
organ of the Government itself.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The information is not
complete.
Hon. Malcolm Hollett: Honourable senators, as a junior member of this august
assembly may I say a few words at this
time. I want to make use of every oppor.
tunity I can to find my depth here.
I want to congratulate the sponsor of the
bill (Hon. Mr. Blois) and the Government
for bringing in this measure. At the same time
I want to sympathize with my honourable
friends opposite. Some remark made by the
honourable senator from Winnipeg South
(Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson) must have touched
a fester, because it seemed to hurt them. The
honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina
(Hon. Mr. Croll) talked about this same matter a few days ago, but it did not hurt anyone
on this side of the house, not one bit.
Honourable senators, I want to say a few
words in support of this legislation because
I come from Newfoundland, the youngest
province, and we in the province live by our
exports. Our fish, ore, lumber, and wood
products all have to be exported. I am not
aware of our exporters having to take advantage of this legislation whereby export
credits are insured; however, the possibility
is that they do, and I guess the probability
is that they may have to.
I should like to present a few figures to the
house for comparative purposes. Strangely
enough, the comparisons are made between
the years 1956 and 1961. I do not know
whether any honourable senator knows why
these particular years have been chosen for
comparative purposes but they show-and
they are correct-that in 1956 our Gross
National Product was $30.6 billion, whereas
in 1961 it was $37.4 billion, an increase of
$6.8 billion, or 22 per cent. Whether the
Export Credits Insurance Act has had anything to do with our Gross National Product
-and who says it hasn't, because it certainly
has to do with exports-our export picture
has been dealt with very thoroughly by the
honourable senator from Winnipeg South
(Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson).

FEBRUARY 27, 1962
He dealt exceedingly well with the conditions of our exports and imports and indicated the increases made in our export
trade. But in case this information did not
impress itself on all honourable members, I
should like to mention that in 1956 our exports amounted to $4.8 billion and in 1961 to
$5.7 billion, an increase of $900 million, or
19 per cent.
Undoubtedly our total personal income is
related to our total exports; in other words,
if we are not exporting, then our total personal income would certainly not be as high
as it is. The total personal income for the
whole of Canada in 1961 amounted to $28.7
billion, compared with $21.9 billion in 1956,
an increase of $6.8 billion, or 30 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Wall: May I ask my honourable
friend a question?
Hon. Mr. Holleti: Yes, you may.
Hon. Mr. Wall: Would the figures that the
honourable senator has given be in current
dollars, and could he give them to us on a
per capita basis in respect to constant dollars?
Hon. Mr. Holleti: I wonder if the honourable senator would repeat his question?
Hon. Mr. Wall: I am asking two questions.
Are the figures that the honourable senator
gave in current dollars? Secondly, could the
honourable senator give us the sarne set of
comparative figures on a per capita constant
dollar basis?
Hon. Mr. Holleti: I am afraid I would not
be able to answer the last question at the
moment. I take it the difference between
current dollars in 1956 and current dollars in
1961 is certainly not large. The honourable
senator from Winnipeg North (Hon. Mr. Wall)
used the term "constant dollar" quite frequently in a speech a few days ago. Well, I
have never been able to find a constant dollar;
at least, I have never been able to hold on
to one. I put a dollar in my pocket in the
morning and it disappears during the day;
it is not constant, at any rate.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If the honourable senator cannot answer the two questions asked of
him by the honourable senator from Winnipeg
North (Hon. Mr. Wall)-and I appreciate that
he does not carry a book of statistics around
with him even though these figures are most
applicable at the present moment-perhaps he
could give us the relative increase in population at the sarne time as he gives us the increase in external trade. Surely that information is cogent to the argument that trade is
being promoted and increased. The honourable senator from Winnipeg North asked for
this information in a somewhat different form
when he asked for the per capita increase.

Perhaps this has not been worked out by my
honourable friend from Burin (Hon. Mr.
Hollett), but he ought to be able to give us
the increase in population with the increase
in exports, otherwise the figures are meaningless.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: I do not know that I can
give the exact increase in population since
1956, and I doubt whether any honourable
senator could, because I don't believe the
compilation bas been completed. However,
I can give the total employment figures for
1956 and 1961. There you will find quite a
difference. Incidentally, this is constant employment and also very current at the present
time. The total employed persons in 1956 was
5,703,000, whereas in 1961 it was 6,155,000, or
an increase of 452,000. That means that 452,000
more men and women were employed in
Canada in 1961 than in 1956. I take it the
honourable senator will accept that as an
answer to his very important question; but I
cannot give him the increase in population.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is not an answer
to my question, my friend. There may be
greater employment, but was there a larger
population?
Hon. Mr. Holleit: There was a very much
larger population.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The percentage of unemployment was greater.
Hon. Mr. Holleti: But I would also point
out that even since 1956 there was a great
increase in the use of machines to turn out
products for export. I hope the honourable
senator will take that into consideration as
well as the increase in population. The increase in population from 1956 to 1961 would
probably be in the order of 90 per cent children
of perhaps five or six years old, and I am
sure they have not added to the amount of
goods which would be for export.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Were there as many
children in Canada in 1956 as in 1961?
Hon. Mr. Holleti: I said that about 90 per
cent of the increase in population resulted
from children who have come along since
1956 and they have not produced any goods
for export yet. I am sure the honourable
senator forgets that little point. Of course,
we allowed some immigrants to enter Canada.
Now, I pointed out that there was a 30 per
cent increase in total personal income throughout Canada during the five years since 1956.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: May I ask, without
truding too much in the debate, what
deficit or surplus in Canada was between
years 1956 to 1961, the period to which
honourable senator referred?

inthe
the
the

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is, the budget
deficit since 1956.
Hon. Mr. Hollet: I have that right in my
pocket. Our budget deficit in 1956-57 was not
very large. In 1957-58 our total deflicit was
$38.6 million. I believe these figures have been
given before, but as I have been asked I am
sure there will be no objection to my giving
them again. In 1958-59 our budget deficit was
$609 million, or a cumulative deficit for the
years 1956-59ý of $647 million. In 1959-60, the
cumulative deficit was just over $1 billion.
In 1960-61 it was $1,401 million. But let us
look at the other side, to the contributions
made by our federal Government to the provinces during that particular time. In 1956-57
the amount contributed was $689 million. I
do not know that I need to go into all these
figures.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: You promised the province of Ontario a $100 million increase, and
did not give it.
Hon. Mr. Hollet: I was not here at that
time. I have not the figures for the budget
deficit in 1961-62. The honourable senator wiil
know why. However, I heard the other day
that it was $200 million less than the honourable senators on the opposite side believed
and hoped and prayed it would be.
Our cumulative budget deficit-and I am
answering my honourable friend's question
now-for the years 1956-57 to 1960-61 was
$1,401 million, whereas the cumulative increase of the federal Government's contributions to the ten provinces for the same period
was $1,697.1 million. This means that the
cumulative increase in federal contributions
to the provinces, minus the cumulative budget
deficit, amounted to $295 million. In other
words, we increased the anount we gave to
all the provinces over the amount of the
budget deficit by $295 million, which shows
one of the reasons, and I am not saying the
only reason, these deficits occurred.
Hon. Mr. Prat: Would the honourable senator explain where the money came from for
all that expenditure?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Honourable senators, I do not want to interrupt too
abruptly this very interesting discussion, but
I rise on a point of order to remind the house
that we are discussing the Export Credits
Insurance Act.
The Hon. the Speaker: I shall allow the
honourable senator from Burin (Hon. Mr. Hollett) to reply to the question, but I suggest
that he keep within the framework of the
bill under debate.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: I believe the question
asked by the honourable senator from St.

John's West (Hon. Mr. Pratt) was, "Where
did the government get the money?" Well, I
think the honourable senator had better ask
me another question, because even he could
not tell that. The Government gets the money
mostly out of our pockets-and certainly out
of the pockets of all honourable senators.
It gets it from business profits and from
various sources. That is how the money must
be obtained. I suppose the implication is, did
they print the money?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): They get
it from the Export Credits Insurance Act.
The Hon. the Speaker: Let us come back
to the bill.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: Yes, Mr. Speaker, I shall
come back to the bill. Of course, I was put
aside by the questions.
The Hon. the Speaker: You were led on.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: I was led on.
This act was passed some years ago-I do
not know the year-and probably by a Liberal
administration. If so, I give credit to them.
Incidentally, I would like to compliment the
honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) who speaks most intelligently in a
debate on any bill. We have not all the same
ability to do so.
I was trying to point out why it was
necessary to increase the amount of export
credits insurance, and its effect on the increase
in our exports over the years. I am quite
sure all honourable senators would agree that
it bas done so. If our exports have thus been
increased, that gives me a good reason for
saying certain things about our personal incomes, and so on, which are undoubtedly derived from that particular source, from exports.
Now as to our corporation profits: In 1956,
corporation profits in Canada were $2.91
billion, by 1961 they had increased to $3.55
billion, or 22 per cent over that five-year
period.
Consumer spending is another indication
of the value of a bill such as this. This stood
at $18.8 billion in 1956, compared with $24.6
billion in 1961, or an increase of $5.8 billion.
You cannot spend money if you do not earn
it, and in Canada you will net earn it if you
do not export. There has been an increase in
consumer spending of 30 per cent in that fiveyear period.
Total personal savings, another important
item, have grown in spite of the fact that the
Government reaches down into our pockets
and takes our money. In 1956 they amounted
to $1.3 billion and in 1961 the figure had risen
to $1.7 billion, an increase of $400 million or
30 per cent.

FEBRUARY 27, 1962
Honourable senators, I do not wish to prolong my remarks, but I do support most
heartily this bill which was so ably introduced by the honourable senator from Colchester-Hants (Hon. Mr. Blois).
Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourable senators, my brief remarks will be confined to
the bill itself, which I heartily support.
I was very much interested in the speech
delivered by my honourable friend from Winnipeg South (Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson), but I was
rather disappointed that he did not reply to
what I thought was a useful contribution made
in this debate last Wednesday by the honourable senator from St. John's West (Hon. Mr.
Pratt) who said that this measure is very
useful to Canadian export trade and that he
heartily supported it. He then gave certain
figures to show that the Export Credits Insurance Corporation is not being used to the
same extent proportionately as the exporters
of Great Britain are using a similar insurance
fund in that country. He suggested that our
regulations with respect to this act are too
rigid or, I think he said, not flexible enough,
and suggested something might be done to
make them more flexible. In that way Canadian exporters could make more use of
this legislation.
I was rather disappointed that the honourable senator from Winnipeg South did not
touch on those two points. I was waiting for
him to tell us why Canadians are not using
this legislation as much as the British exporters are using theirs. I was waiting for
him to tell us whether our act is too rigid and
whether he had any suggestions as to how it
could be made more flexible and more useful.
I think honourable senators will agree that
I have stuck to the bill.
Hon. Donald Smith: Honourable senators,
I too shall be brief in my remarks and speak
to the bill itself.
I want to bring to the attention of honourable senators that we have on our statute
books the Export and Import Permits Act, the
purpose of which is to control export trade.
The act lists 166 items of a strategic nature
or value, the export of which might affect the
security of Canada.
I think somebody mentioned that gunpowder was included in our exports to Cuba,
and reference was made to a radioactive
cobalt bomb or some such item.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: It was blasting
powder, not gun powder.
Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): Well,
I do not know what the difference is. It is
my information that those 76 items for which
export permits were issued by the Government under the Export and Import Permits

Act had a total value of $3.25 million. In the
last year or so permits have been issued by
the Government for the export of 125 tons
of dynamite, aircraft engines, parts for aircraft engines, parts for aircraft radio receivers, synthetic rubber, steel in various
forms and electric transformers. All of these
items must certainly be of a type and kind
without which an army could not operateand those last words that I have used are
the words referred to by the present Minister
of Trade and Commerce in connection with
exports.
Now, honourable senators, it seems to me
that for the picayune commercial gain which
might come to a few scattered industrial and
exporting firms in this country in exporting
$3.25 million worth of goods for which
special permits must be secured under the
Export and Import Permits Act, we should
not sacrifice our good relations with the
best friend Canada could ever have, the
United States of America.
During a trip to the United States about a
year ago I had this subject of Canada's trade
with Cuba thrown in my face. While visiting
friends of mine in the American mid-west
I suppose I met a half dozen people who were
quite disturbed because they considered we
were not proving ourselves to be the kind
of friends we pretended to be. They could
not understand why we would carry on the
kind of trade about which they were informed long before the honourable senator
from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croll) spoke
about it here. They could not understand
why we were trading with Cuba at a time
when their own country deemed it to be in
its national interest and in the interest of the
hemisphere to sever trade with Cuba. Just
a week or so ago I was visiting with some
friends in New York state, and again the
subject of trade with Cuba was slammed
in my face. I want to say that in both these
instances I did not speak as I am speaking
in this chamber, for I am home now. But
when I was in a foreign country I thought
it my duty to defend the action taken by this
Government.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: May I ask my
honourable friend a question?
Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Did any of the
people with whom you talked in New York
state tell you they had read a report of the
speech delivered by the honourable senator
from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croll) or
some other speaker?
Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): The
answer is definitely no. The first occasion to
which I referred was about a year ago, or

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: With leave I move that
this report be adopted now.
Honourable senators, I should give a word
of explanation. The amendments which you
have heard read carry the approval of the
Law Clerk of the Senate, and were also approved by those persons interested in the
bill. May I just give the background of the
amendments?
The Muttart Development Company was
incorporated under federal charter in or
about 1958. Its chief object was to invest in mortgages, that is, to buy existing
mortgages, rather than to lend money on the
security of mortgages. Before incorporation
there was some question as to whether such
a company, having regard to the provisions
of the Loan Companies Act, could be incorporated by letters patent. The opinion
of the Department of Justice was obtained,
to the effect that investing in mortgages was
not subject to the Loan Companies Act and
therefore letters patent could issue, and they
did issue. The company carried on in that
fashion until 1961.
Many senators will recall that in 1961
Parliament amended the Loan Companies Act
by extending the coverage of that act to include not only loaning on the security of
real property, but also investing in mortgages that were secured by real property.
Then the question arose as and from the
middle of July last year, as to what was
the position of this company, which had an
existing charter permitting it to carry on
business, and yet an amendment to the Loan
Companies Act provided that if a company
were going to be set up on and after the
date the amendment became effective, it
would have to proceed by special act under
the Loan Companies Act. The question was
finally resolved by the company coming to
Parliament and asking for the passage of
this bill to have the company converted from
a charter company to a special act company,
so as to provide the necessary protection and
to validate what it had done, if it needed

FEBRUARY 28, 1962
validation, between July of last year, when
the Loan Companies Act was amended and
the date these amendments are passed.
The effect of the amendments is simply to
say that as and from July 12 last year the
powers of this company under its letters
patent are cancelled and it enjoys the powers
a loan company would enjoy. Secondly, that
all its investments in mortgages since that
date are not to be regarded as invalid only
because they do not conform or did not conform to the requirements of the Loan Companies Act during that period.
That is the scope and effect of these amendments, and they were all approved in committee this morning.

RE BUSINESS

OF COMMITTEE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Honourable senators, might I say that I have just
received notice that there will be a meeting
of the Standing Committee on Tourist Trafflc
tomorrow at noon. I am sure all honourable
senators are pleased to hear that this committee is meeting, but could the chairman of
that committee tell the house the nature of
the business that is on hand?
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
the meeting is merely being convened in
order to arrange the work of the committee.
As yet nothing has been arranged.

The members of the delegation are invited
to attend the sitting of the Senate here at
approximately 3.30 tomorrow afternoon. They
will be seated at the bar, and their
wives will be sitting in our gallery. Honourable Senator Aiken and Honourable Mr. Gallagher of the House of Representatives, the
two American co-chairmen, will be sitting to
my right on the floor of the Senate.
I know that the honourable Leader of the
Govornment (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) and the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) will wish to greet our visitors here on the floor of the Senate as they
greeted us on two occasions in Washington.
We will procced in the same way as we
did last year and the proceedings should not
last very long.
Therefore,
to try to be
our friends,
and tensions

I would ask honourable senators
here in good numbers to greet
for there are certain stresses
we can help to relieve.

Hon. Walter M. Aselline: Honourable senators, in addition to what His Honour the
Speaker has mentioned, I may say that tomorrow at this time I shall bring in a motion
authorizing us to invite the two co-chairmen

of the delegation to a place on the floor of
the Senate, and the others to take a place at
the bar of the Senate. I presume also at that
time we shall recognize the charming ladies
who will be in the gallery.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators
will recall that we were received on the floor
of the Senate in Washington. On the first occasion there were sixteen short speeches of

greeting to us, and twelve on the second occasion. We were not allowed to reply, since no
one other than an American senator is allowed to say anything on the floor of the
Senate in Washington. Fortunately, we have
no such rule here. I believe our friends, Honourable George D. Aiken and Honourable
Cornelius E. Gallagher will wish to reply
briefly to our remarks, as they did last year.

FEBRUARY 28, 1962
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: I am very pleased
to agree to the procedure which has been
mentioned.
The Hon. the Speaker: Thank you.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): I would
like to ask a question on another subject.
Has the Leader of the Government in the
Senate (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) any information
as to whether or not there will be royal
assent this week and, if so, when?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I am unable to answer
that question. At the moment, I have no
intimation of having royal assent this week.

FINANCE CHARGES (DISCLOSURE) BILL

SECOND READING- DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Tuesday, February 13, the adjourned debate on the motion
of Hon. Mr. Croll, for the second reading of
Bill S-2, to make provision for the disclosure
of information in respect to finance charges.
Hon. Saller A. Hayden: Honourable senators, this is the third time that we have had
a bill before us under the title which this
one bears. I must first commend my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Croll) for having taken
to heart the criticisms which were made in
respect of provisions in the bills which were
before us on two former occasions. While I
congratulate him on having demonstrated how
seriously his attention was given to this matter, I am fearful that the result has been an
emasculation of the bill, making the last
state of the bill worse than the first.
This bill simply provides that a condition
be added to a conditional sale agreement, providing that the transaction is not to be effective until certain stated information is
given to the borrower under that conditional
sale agreement.
I have examined this bill closely to see what
element of constitutionality there might be
which would give the federal Parliament
some jurisdiction. I can find no such element in it, and it strikes me that this is
clearly a matter of property and civil rights.

There is another problem which may arise
if this bill is enacted. There is a provincial
statute in Alberta which has been in force
for several years; and notice was given in the
Manitoba Legislature at this session regarding the enactment of legislation of a somewhat similar nature. Therefore, the problem
of the conflict as between the provincial
and federal authorities would come to the
fore at once. However, I feel strongly that
there is no point in the present bill on which
we can base federal constitutionality. There
is no question of criminal law left in it, since
the making of an offence out of the failure to
furnish information has been removed from
the bill.
It is true that interest is mentioned, and
that interest is an item over which the Parliament of Canada has jurisdiction. Even so,
interest is but one item in the list of items
in the definition of finance charges. Secondly,
it seems to me that interest over which the
federal authority has jurisdiction means the
substance or the subject matter of interest.
This bill imposes no control over interest,
and the figure that the lender is asked to
express to the borrower before the transaction becomes effective is, as we have heard
time after time, a calculation of the effective
rate of interest. This bill would require the
lender to state to the borrower three things,
the first of which is the total amount of the
unpaid balance outstanding. I take that to be
the unpaid balance of the purchase price in
a case, for instance, where a person enters
a furniture store, orders a chesterfield suite,
and pays some money down, leaving a balance
owing.
The second piece of information that the
lender is asked to furnish to the borrower is
the total amount of the finance charges expressed in dollars. Those finance charges are
enumerated in clause 2(b) of the bill, and
they include such items as interest, fees,
bonuses, service charges and any other type of
charge.
The third bit of information that must be
given to the borrower is the percentage relationship, expressed in terms of simple annual
interest, that the total amount of the finance
charges bears to the unpaid balance outstanding under the transaction. That, honourable
senators, is a long cry from an effective rate
of interest. What the lender is asked to do
here is to relate the total of the finance
charges, which may include all of those elements that I mentioned, percentagewise to the
unpaid balance outstanding.
On reading that, it would seem to be a very
simple calculation. If I were the lender then
I would have to take the total of the finance
charges and relate them to the unpaid balance.
That is what this subclause seems to say.

SENATE
rate of $5, at the end of which time he would
pay finance charges of $2. As reported in
Hansard, the honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina said:
Two dollars is 10 per cent of $20, so,
he bas paid 10 per cent in 60 days. He
has paid 10 per cent in two months, which
is 60 per cent annually.
Just to show the differences in calculations,
I worked out that percentage as 120 per cent.
I worked it out on the basis that the average
amount of money outstanding over the period
of two months would be $10 and not $20, and
that therefore the effective or true rate of
interest on an annual basis would be 120 per
cent instead of 60 per cent.
Now, if my honourable friend and I can
have these differences in a calculation which
is supposed to be a simple one, what about
the operator of a corner store who bas not
had the opportunity to calculate as often and
in so many ways as my honourable friend
and I?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: He would probably come
up with the correct answer.
Some Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: He might, although the
opportunity for variation, as has been illustrated, is considerable.
While the sponsor of this bill may say he
bas provided in this legislation for regulations which would provide for a degree of
accuracy or tolerance within which an error
would be permitted, I am wondering whether
the degree of accuracy would be as broad
as the difference of 60 per cent between my
honourable friend's calculations and mine.
If I could have assurance as to the degree of
accuracy I might not be complaining as much
about how unworkable this bill is in its demand for a statement percentagewise in terms
of simple annual interest of finance charges
to the unpaid balance. I feel that what is
requested here is unworkable.
In Alberta, where similar legislation has
been on the books for a number of years,
the requirement is made in the alternative;
that is, the lender furnishes in a lump sum
in dollars what the cost of the borrowing
is, or expresses the percentage in terms
of simple interest on an annual basis. There
is, therefore, a choice. When I contemplate
the information a lender is required to give,
I cannot possibly follow what additional
information a borrower gets if be is told
the rate of interest. What more appreciation
has he when he is told the rate of interest,
as well as being told that his borrowing
for 24 months is going to cost him $50?
My own feeling is that most people have
a better understanding of what $50 is in

relation to their own income and savings,
than being told they are going to be charged
interest at the rate of 25 or 30 per cent.
I think there would be very few persons
who would be prepared to make a deal
on the basis of paying $50, and who
would not make a deal when told that the
$50 amounted to 25 per cent, as expressed
in the form in which this legislation requires it. I cannot contemplate there would
be any who would say, "Now that this bas
been clarified as to the percentage, I will not
make a deal." To my way of thinking there
would be more confusion. Let me tell you
why. Even this simple illustration of a $20
battery and a $2 finance charge is completely
misleading when you relate it to an annual
basis, because the contract is for a duration
of two months. Nobody is borrowing money
on an annual basis in connection with that
purchase, so that we are making a fictional
calculation in respect of a transaction that
does not occur. The price of the battery
is $20, the interest charged is $2, and it has
to be all paid within two months. It is a
distortion of the picture to translate it into
a transaction made on an annual basis. The
purchaser is not entering into that kind of
a transaction.
During the course of his presentation the
honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina
(Hon. Mr. Croll) said:
The sole purpose of the bill is to
require every person who carries on the
business of extending consumer credit
to disclose in writing to the consumer
of such credit the total cost thereof,
expressed both as a lump sum and in
terms of simple annual interest.
Later on he said:
I repeat, the purpose of the bill is to
require the lenders and vendorsI take it he means the lenders who are
the vendors.
-to tell the truth about interest rates
and finance charges.
If the issue here were a question of the
truth in lending as against deception in
lending, I do not think anyone would take
the position that the borrower should get
less information than would entitle him to
know the full terms of the transaction, what
he has to repay and what it is costing him.
So that we start out on common ground:
I cannot conceive of any person opposing the
disclosure of information showing the borrower what his cost is, but I maintain that
unless the borrower knows what he owes he
cannot know when to stop paying. How does
he know what his arrangement is in respect
to the money? Therefore, I say that even at
the present time the borrower, under the

FEERUARY 28, 1962
information which he must be given, knows
what the cost of the borrowing is, expressed
in dollars. The borrower may flot know the
cost expressed in ternis of interest and, in,deed, the lender may flot be able to figure it
out. The question then arises: Is it necessary
in those circumstances, in order to say that
there is truth in lending and that there has
been sufficient disclosure of information to
enable the borrower to know what the transaction is costing hlm, that it be expressed in
terms of interest as well as in ternis of dollars? In my submission, I do flot think it is.
If I took sorne of my friend's staternents
in support of his bill, I would conclude that
what he was really getting at was contrai of
credit, and flot simply disclosure of an interest calculation. My friend talked about abuse
of credit, about the lls arising out of the use
and misuse of credit, and about people who
are gullible and get comrnitted beyond their
depth in the purchase and financing of merchandise. When you talk about protecting
people against themselves, even when they
themselves rnay flot be concerned, and say
that we should be concerned on their
behaif,'
you reach a stage where even prohibition is
flot very effective, and when legisiation for
that purpose is flot too effective for any
length of time.
Wben you talk about protecting people
against themselves and against their own lack
of concern, then you are talking about control
of credit, and not simply giving thern a bit of
information as though to convert them fromn
their folly and gullibility, and make thern less
susceptible to the wiles of a salesman, or even
to lead to a change in their own philosophy;
because many people nowadays have the
philosophy that while they have rnoney they
will spend it to the extent that At will give
thern everything they want to enjoy. If they
continue to have the samne income in future
years, they pay off the balance owing on the
merchandise they have bought, and if flot, or
if their incorne decreases, then it is just too
bad and they stop paying for those articles.
The articles may be repossessed. That is
too bad, but that is sornething rnany people
have become accustomed to.
So f ar as I can see, you cannot change
the situation by handing such persons a slip
of paper saying that financing of the merchandise they have bought will cost them $50, and
that the interest expressed in simple annuel
ixterest is five per cent. Whatever the cost,
they will buy, beceuse that is the wey they
look et things. I arn not criticizing that philosophy, but 1 arn saying that if we are
atternpting to justify legislation on one basis
because of the condition of these people, it
cannot be justified on that basis. We should
not offer a palliative. The right thing to do

then, if you think it is necessary to protect
these people against their own folly, would
be ta talk about control of credit.
My friend put it very well when lie said
that the need for consumer credit and consumer protection arises frorn many causes.
He enurnerated those causes as follows: (1)
Partly consumer ignorance; (2) Partly lack
of concern; (3) Partly the confusing and misleading form. in which the credit terms are
explained; (4) Partly failure, in particular,
of credit financier to provide essential inf ormation.
Let us examine those for a moment. First,
partly consumer ignorance. When a consumer
is told that something will cost hirn $50ý, and
lie is not told what the interest is, is he
suddenly going to shed his ignorance and becorne wise and alert when he finds out that
it works out at an interest rate of 25 per cent,
and say, "No, get thee behind me Satan with
this temptation"?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: He rnight.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Remember, he is given
the dollar cost.
My friend's next point is, partly leck of
concern. If a man has lack of concern, are
you going to stirnulate interest by telllng him
what the percentage relationship is of his
dollar charge to the total amount that lie is
borrowing? Again, I would say fia.
The thîrd point is, partly the confusing and
misleading forrn in which credit termis are
explained. When I discuss this point, rernerber I arn not dealing with the situation where
in effect a salesman or a vendor may practise
a fraud on the intending purchaser. I arn
dealing with the kind of case where a man
buys an article of merchandise and is told the
price of it. He says, "I can pay $50 down,
and I want to finance the rest for a period
of 24 months." Then he is told what it costs
hirn a rnonth to do that. In that set-up, to me
there is nothing confusing and there is nothing
misleading. There are remedies avaîlable to
catch those people who perpetrate a fraud on
buyers.
The fourth ground my friend gave was,
pertly the feilure, in particular, of the credit
financiers to furnish credit information. The
only basis to support thet would be to say
that giving the interest rate in the menner
in which rny friend's bill provides for it is
essentiel information. In my submission, it is
flot essential information. Furthermore, the
calculation is s0 difficult that you could flot
have any assurance of accuracy, and the
dealers and shopkeepers, in order to protect
themselves, would have to, lire actuaies, as
Pierre Berton did, and the cost to, the consumer would be increased.

SENATE

Alternatively, of course, there is a very
simple way out of my friend's proposal. Let
us assume this bill becomes law, and thereafter a man buys a battery for $20 and pays
$2 finance charges for two months. The battery might be advertised for $22, and offered
at $2 discount for cash. Then no problem
would arise. Or the battery might be rented
to an intending purchaser for a week for $2
and he might buy it over a period of eight
weeks for $20, and the problem of facing this
puzzling calculation of interest on this transaction which has drawn such a wide line
of demarcation between my friend and I
would not arise.
Now, my friend's bill makes one assumption-I have seen this expression in a
magazine; therefore, it is not my own. The
exact words of the expression are "bumpkin
borrowers". I think I saw that in Newsweek
some time ago. The assumption is that, for
purposes of this type of legislation, every
borrower is a bumpkin borrower, that is, be
knows nothing about finance and is completely at the mercy of the very shrewd
lender. I think, to say the least, that that is
very much overrated. I refuse to subscribe
to the theory that all borrowers are bumpkins,
and on that basis we should have this kind
of legislation to protect them against themselves. Now, if that were all that was to this,
I would sit down and you would know very
well what my view was of this bill.
One thing that has given me tremendous
concern has been the publicity which this
bill has given rise to, and the letters which
I and, I am sure, other senators have received
from responsible organizations. For instance,
I have a letter from the Canadian Catholic
Conference in which that organization refers
to a resolution enacted at their regional social
life conference in Banff, as follows:
Be it resolved that this conference recommend that every contract bearing interest shall clearly set out the true rate
of simple interest.
I am also in receipt of a letter from the
Canada Packers Employees' Credit Union
Limited which reads in part:
It is our considered opinion that this
is a valuable and desirable item of legislation. We are in agreement that there
is some considerable confusion as to
true interest rates which in certain instances does lead to severe abuses of
ethical business practice.
I have another one from the Canadian
Welfare Council, in which they say:
While the bill now before you is a
revised and simplified version of two
previous proposals, it still contains the

essential requirement of disclosure of information regarding finance charges of
consumer credit. Such disclosure would
provide the consumer with knowledge of
the full and true cost of his purchase on
credit. May we, in commending the present bill to your earnest consideration,
quote the Honourable David A. Croll
from his motion for second reading of the
bill. It "requires lenders and vendors to
tell the truth about the interest rates
and finance charges. The consumer bas
every right to know what he is getting
into, and if he does not know or care
enough to protect himself, it is our duty
to do something to protect him."
When I receive such letters from responsible organizations and when I read newspaper editorials I get a little concerned, and
having regard to the viewpoint that I have
in relation to this bill I wonder whether the
confusion rests with me rather than with
the people who have written these letters.
Have they written them from a lack of information, or is it that they see some measure
of protection that this bill might afford that
I do not see? Frankly, I cannot appreciate
these viewpoints at the moment, even though
I read all these editorials supporting this
bill in a general way. Now let us assume
that an intending borrower is told what the
rate of interest is. What effect is that going
to have on the transaction? What effect is that
going to have on him?
I am mindful of our well-known position
here in the Senate and our concern for the
problems of the people, something that I keep
before me all the time. But I have great difficulty trying to reconcile my own point of
view with those expressed in letters and newspapers as to the scope of this legislation. I
think it bas been brought forward by the
honourable sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr.
CrolD with the greatest sincerity, and with
the avowed purpose-I can say this, because
he said it in his speech-that this is the first
step, and if this succeeds we can move on into
the larger area where we might ultimately
end up in the control of credit.
If there was some way by which this bill
could go to committee without my being committed to the principle of it, or if my honourable friend could indicate to me that there
is a principle in the bill, even if he said that
the principle is disclosure of information, I
would still be concerned because such required
information is already in the hands of the
borrower; where the actual and particular bit
of information, such as the interest calculation, is not there the figures are disclosed from
which one might make such a calculation, with
the chance being that it would be as good as
the calculation that the lender would make.

explanatory remarks, I think that he has
answered his own question. I am certainly
not expressing an opinion at this time.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt: Honourable senators, I would like to have the expert knowledge of my colleague from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) in order to discuss the legal
aspect of the bill before us.
The honourable senator from Toronto tells
us that the legislation is not constitutional.
Last year, it seems, the honourable senator of
Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croll) told us,
after consulting the Minister of Justice, that
the bill was in keeping with the Constitution.
It so happens that, when we go to court,
where there are two lawyers, one on each
side, each one pleads his own case and states
that he is right. Now, imagine an ordinary
mortal like myself-how could I determine
the constitutional character of an act? It is
impossible.
Hon. Lionel Choquette: I am sorry, but I
think that, last year, the honourable senator
for Toronto-Spadina had sought the legal
opinion of our legal adviser, and not the
Department of Justice.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: Our legal adviserthank you for correcting my statement. But
I still have confidence in him.
Now, the honourable senator from Toronto
tells us that this is a matter for provincial legislation. That may be; I would not know. The
argument which he developed at length was
that it is difficult to figure out simple
interest rates. According to Mr. Berton's
article, which was published in Maclean's
magazine, the same conclusions were not
reached by the various actuaries. I have
myself consulted actuaries. We have one at
home. He asked me the following question:
"Was the calculation made on a weekly
basis, on a monthly basis, presuming there
are 30 days in the month, or was it made on a
daily basis? Calculations vary slightly on
these different bases."
In this regard, we do not have to get
deeply involved in calculations with our
credit unions at home. For 10 cents a copy,
we can get tables in which these calculations
are made on a daily and on a monthly
basis for various amounts, and in which the
simple interest rate to be charged is indicated. Nothing could be simpler. You can
find books containing tables which give the
interest at the rate of 6 per cent, 8 per
cent and even 50 per cent. Therefore, there
is no problem there. These calculations are
made neither by the vendor nor by the buyer.
All you have to do is to refer to these
tables.

I wish to express another point of view,
if I may, and I shall set aside the question
of interest and the method of figuring it out.
For more than twenty-five years, I have
been in daily touch with members of the
labour class, that is workers and farmers,
besides the organizations in which I am interested, such as family services and social
services. I have tried with my associates to
find a solution to the problems of many unfortunate families.
From the very beginning, we had to try to
find the cause of those family problems.
Twenty-five or thirty years ago the major
cause was alcoholism, but today the economic
question or financial aspect is ahead of alcoholism. Today, it is the main cause of many
broken homes.
In the area of Lévis, we have studied that
problem most carefully because the family
services-this is something we should not
forget-are a clinic where people come not
to ask for handouts or food, but especially
to try to find a solution to their family problems.
In 57 per cent of cases, those family troubles
find their origin in money problems; therefore
this aspect is ahead of alcoholism. That survey has been going on for several years. If
we analyze the whole problem, we find that
most young couples are penniless when they
get married. Everything has been squandered
before marriage. All pleasures have been
indulged in, without a thought about the
future. Besides, why worry? Everything is
being offered to us today with no money
down. Everything is sold on the instalment
plan and young couples imagine that since
they have nothing to pay on getting married,
everything will come to them without any
effort.
In the old days, when people got married
without much money, they would wait before
purchasing anything. They would not have
considered buying on credit and thus mortgaging their future for a long time to come.
But today, on account of the barrage of
publicity, credit selling has transformed the
whole economic pattern of this country. It
forces upon young people, especially, the habit
of spending extravagantly, the desire of possessing everything at once, se that their
salaries are mortgaged for years to come before they even have earned them.
What happens is that after a few years,
mothers are asking the children's aid society
to take care of their children, because their
husbands cannot support them. They want to
go back and earn their own living again. And
the children are put in the care of public
organizations. If this continues much longer,
I fear for the future of this nation.

FEBRUARY 28, 1962
When I first got interested in such matters,
some twenty-five to thirty years ago, the
major source of trouble in the home was
habituai drunkenness. Today, it is no longer
drunkenness, but financial problems because
our young people marry without any money
and they mortgage their whole future; they
buy furniture and appiances here and there
without stopping to wonder whether they will
be able to pay for their purchases. Then, two
or three years later, the wif e starts getting
nervous because every day someone is knocking at the door with the threat, if you do flot
pay today we are going to repossess your
furniture, or this and that. The poor woman
sees herseif thrown in the gutter.
When one studies this problem, when one
looks after family welf are, one soon discovers
that it is a kind of clinic where people do flot
corne to beg for charity or alms or money, but
to ask if it is possible to find a solution to the
moral problem that exists in their homes.
That is the question we should study, for we
will have to consult with the husband after
having spoken with the wif e. This kind of
work is flot performed in a day or two; it can
take months before we can find a solution to
this perpetual economie problem.
Last year, I asked our social service at home
to make a survey, saying that I thought this
economic problern was not as serlous as it
seemed among the you ,ng couples and that
we were indllned to a certain arnount of
exaggeration, and therefore, would they be
good enougli to give me sorne figures in order
for me to know what is the basic problemn
facing a young couple, a problern which may
wreck their home. This year we came to the
conclusion that 57 per cent of our new homes
are wrecked on account of the econornic
situation.
Those people buy things just like that, on
credit, and pay at least 27 per cent interest,
and, if we analyse ahl those factors, we corne
to an average of 60 per cent. How is it possible that these rates are as high as 60 per
cent? Let us take for instance the case of
someone getting married who buys $1,000
worth of furniture and other household appliances; he will have to pay up to $270 interest
but he had not counted on this before. As the
senator for Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) was
saying, people do not make any caiculation,
which is true; they are groping about biindly.
When those people buy thîngs, everything is
fine for the first f ew months and they make
their payments regularly. But then, the dealer
says, "'You shouid have another piece of furniture; we will raise your loan to $1,000 or to
$1,200 and refinance it."1 The amount increases
at once and with the interest added, the rate
is 40 or 50 per cent and at the end of three

years, 60 per cent. Which means that every
dollar invested by that man has cost him. 40
cents or 60 cents in interest.
I arn afraid that if that practice spreads
throughout the country, it will become really
harmful and will affect the economy of the
nation because the purchasing power will be
cut down to, the same extent and it will be
creating unemployment.
Mind you, it is not a matter of saying: "I1
can figure out an interest rate". It goes much
deeper than that and it can affect the economic
life of every home; this is what we mnust guard
against.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Would the bill protect
those people who default after two or three
months?
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: No. Here is another
example of a customer who cornes to one of
our credit unions. He had contracted for a
$1,500 loan sornewhere else and after three
years, haif of his payments had been used to
pay interest and he did not know how to get
out of the mess. But hie was an honest man,
and he had two children under the care of the
children's aid society. We took hlm. as a client,
and granted him a boan at 6 per cent interest.
Instead of finding himself with quite a considerable amount to pay, he gradually paid
off his debt and, wîthin three years, he did not
owe a cent.
Another gentleman came to us who, two
years before, had bought an eiectric washing
machine for $255, to be paid through 24 payments, plus 24 per cent interest. Three times,
during these two years, he had not been able
to make his regular payment and, after two
years, he still owed almost $250.
These people cannot make ends meet. It
wili be said: "They shouid think before spending". Easier said than done. On each side of a
bridge there are guard-rails; otherwise, toi
cross it would be dangerous. Now then, the
sarne thing must exist in matters of economy,
that is, there must be guard-rails to protect
people agaînst and in spite of themselves. It
is a question of long-range education.
During the war, there was a federal law
stating that if you buy such or such an article,
you rnust make a down payment of such an
amount and pay the balance witbin twelve
months. During that period, there was an
ernergency, it was claimed; today the emergency is just as serious as it was during the
war. That is why, after learning ail those
things, we must try to protect the people in
spite of themseives. It is true, and my colleague frorn Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) said
so a moment ago; it is useless otherwise
because those people behave like children.
Moreover, too much credit at an overly high
cost can have a bad influence on the whole

SENATE

country's economy. I would be glad if this
bill were referred to a committee, as requested by the senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) so that the views of everyone
could be known. We must think for those
people who need to be protected in spite
of themselves, just as a child needs protection. I have a suggestion to make. Why not
follow the example set by European countries? I have here an advertisement for a
household appliance sold in Switzerland. If
you pay cash, the article costs you 138 francs,
and if you buy on credit you will have to
make six monthly instalments of 25 francs,
and the total price will be 150 francs. Prospective buyers know immediately how much
it will cost them in interest; they do not have
to make calculations and I think that is a
good thing.
Here is another example of a product which
was advertised in a French newspaper and
which costs 90 new francs cash. If the
purchase is made by instalments, a down payment of 10 francs is required, the balance to
be paid in six monthly instalments of 15
francs each, that is, a total of 100 francs instead of 90. Thus people know immediately
how much they will have to pay; that does
not require much explanation. It is another
way of proceeding which could greatly simplify things. Practically all European countries
use that method. After the war, they realized
that numerous people wanted to buy on credit,
a situation which could have jeopardized the
country's future. If the people acted that way
it was because they had been deprived during
the war years. Such a barrier as this had to
be set up. When people are faced with such
facts, it makes them think.
Do you know, for instance, that when a person borrows $300, payable in twelve instalments, according to the method used today,
the cost is $113; but if that same person
borrows from a slightly humane institution,
the cost is only about $3. Those are facts; we
hear of such cases by the hundreds, every day.
If we could drive that home to our people, it
would make them think. However, you would
probably say that we cannot do that overnight, that it will take years. Quite true, but
if we do nothing, we are heading towards
disaster. If this cannot be done by Ottawa,
let the provinces do it. The alarm must be
sounded, our people must be made to think.
Let us take the necessary means to point out
the danger to them. This might take several

years, but that matters little. Something
must be done. In a few years time, we will
be happy at the results, for we will have
built a stronger nation, and there will be more
happiness in our homes.

Hon. John G. Higgins: Honourable senators,
I regret that my honourable friend from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) is not in the
chamber at this moment because I would like
to put to him a question with respect to an
ordinary transaction.
Why is it so difficult to calculate the interest where the contract is clear-cut and carries
through to the end? If A borrows $20 and his
payments are $2 a month for 15 months, then
he has to repay a total of $30. It is my understanding that under such a contract if the
debtor pays off the unpaid balance within,
say, four months he would still have to pay
$30. On top of that he would probably have
to pay a service charge of $10, which means
that his total payments would amount to $40.
So, if he pays $40 in 15 months, that means
he pays interest at the rate of 80 per cent
per annum. What is so difficult about that
calculation?
Does the complication set in when the
debtor falls down on his contract? Suppose
he pays for four months and then stops paying for a couple of months. In that case he is
charged an extra service charge because
there has to be a new contract drawn. Does
that make for difficulty with respect to calculating percentages? There must be something wrong with the system when an
accountant, or someone who is mathematically
inclined, cannot work out the interest. Where
does the difficulty come in? Am I wrong in
saying that the interest in the example I
gave is 80 per cent? If it is 80 per cent, then
the calculation is very simple.
Hon. Mr. Croll: From where I sit you are
perfectly right.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: Then, the complication
must arise in cases where the debtor falls
down on his contract and does not pay within
the time laid down, in which case a new
contract is made and there is another service
charge.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Wall debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

on External Affairs. We had an excellent
meeting of that committee this morning. The
witnesses explained several features of the
convention which gave us some trouble when
it was presented in the Senate.
Although the convention was very well
explained in the Senate by the honourable
senator from Winnipeg South and the honourable senator frorn Kingston (Hon. Mr.
Davies), it is a complicated document and
not easily understood from reading it. Therefore I would strongly recommend to honourable senators who were not able to be at
the committee meeting this morning that, if
they are interested in copyright matters, or the
rights of publishers and authors who produce
works in Canada for distribution throughout
the world, especially in the United States,
they should read the record of the committee's proceedings. I am sure they will find it
very much worth while.
I am most happy, honourable senators, to
support the motion.
Report adopted.
ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE
Hon. Walter M. Asel±ine: Honourable senators, with leave of the Senate, I move that
when the house adjourns today that it stand
adjourned until Tuesday, March 13, 1962 at
8 o'clock in the evening.
Honourable senators, if in the meantime
something of an important nature should
come up, the motion which was passed yesterday will enable Ris Honour the Speaker to
call us back before that date.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I would suggest to the
honourable Leader (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) that
if the adjournment is further extended, those
of us who live far away from Ottawa should
be notified to that effect.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Does that mean that the
Standing Committee on Divorce will not sit
during the adjournment?
Hon. Arthur W. Boebuck: Honourable senators, I shall have something to say about that.
May I point out to the members of the
Divorce Committee that the meeting which
is scheduled for tomorrow morning will be
held as usual, and I hope that all members
will attend.

The meetings that have been scheduled for
the period during which the Senate will be
in recess will, of course, not take place, and
we are sending notices advising the litigants
that their cases will be put over for a short
time. There is no real difficulty in that connection.
Perhaps some honourable senators will remember that February 28 was set as the last
day for the receipt of petitions for divorce
and other private bills. That time expired
yesterday.
Honourable senators will be interested in
the fact that this session we have 605 divorce
petitions to be dealt with. That is probably
the greatest number we have ever had in one
session. Some will go over to the next session,
as is always the case-perhaps in the order
of 100-so that there will be actually about
500 cases to be tried during this session. That,
I need hardly say, is a very big job. I am very
grateful to the members of the committee
for the excellent attendance we have had so
far this session. We have already heard quite
a number of cases.
Honourable senators, I rose merely to say
that the divorce committee will meet as usual
tomorrow.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I do not rise to oppose the motion but
I should point out that many senators, in
fact I think most of us, are not altogether
happy about the adjournment which is proposed. We are here for the purpose of putting
through legislation as expeditiously as possible, after thorough discussion. I might say
this adjournment is a great inconvenience for
a number of honourable senators, especially
those who come from a considerable distance.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): It is not
going to be easy-in fact, in many cases it
will be impossible-for thern to travel to
their homes for a week and return. In any
event, I believe we would far rather be here
doing our duty.
I know the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) has done all in
his power to obtain legislation frorn the other
house for our consideration, but he cannot
speed up the work of that house. I know
that he has done all in his power to have
bills introduced in the Senate.
The Hon. the Speaker: Might I remind the
honourable Leader of the Opposition that a
motion for adjournment is not debatable.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Mr.
Speaker, this is not a motion for adjournment: it is a motion to vary the procedure
or the effect of the rules of the Senate. I am

MARCH 1 1962
not opposing it, but I think it is unfortunate
that we are asked to agree to it at this time.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: If the honourable Leader
of the Opposition does not want the adjournment, I shall withdraw the motion.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: And we will come back
on Tuesday next, if that is what he would
prefer.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I have
no objection myself, but we are down here
to work, and now we are asked to adjourn.
1 say that there should be more work before
the Senate now.
As I said, I know that the honourable
Leader of the Government is doing all in
his power to have bills introduced in the
Senate, but so far he has not been successful.
We should appeal to the Governrment to have
more bills introduced here than has been the
case in the past. Even when I was Leader of
the Government we did not have enough
legislation introduced in this house. I hope
that in future the work will be so arranged
that there will be enough to keep the Senate
fully occupied.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I should like the honourable Leader of the Opposition to use his
influence in the other place to hurry the
legislation through.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The reason we are adjourning now is because we have not been
able to get the supplementary estimates
quickly enough. Yesterday the other place
spent the whole day on one item and still it
is not finished. What can I do, but ask honourable senators to agree to the adjournment
I have suggested, with the possibility that if
something of an important nature arises we
shall be called back before the time mentioned
in the motion?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Might I
say in reply to the honourable Leader of the
Government that I am not criticizing him,
nor the House of Commons, for what is
happening.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Then what is the complaint?

Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): But there
are bills other than money bills. Not one of
those has been introduced in the Senate. I
repeat I do not want the Leader of the
Government to feel that I am criticizing him
-far from it. I am merely saying to the Government that we are here, prepared to work.
Let the Government introduce non-money
bills in this house first.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Would the honourable
Leader of the Opposition suggest that we
should have reform in the House of Commons rather than in the Senate?
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
[Later:]
Hon. Mr. Beaubien (Provencher): May I ask
the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) if it would be possible for him to
make arrangements for those who live far
from Ottawa to travel home by plane?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): That is
a large order.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: I cannot give a precise
answer to that question. I know that at the
beginning and the end of the session honourable senators are entitled to travel by plane
and make a claim for expenses, but that
would not apply to a recess during the session.
Motion agreed to.

Hon. Walter M. Aselline: Honourable senators, you will remember that on February
23, 1961 I had the honour of welcoming to
this chamber the delegation of members from
the United States Senate and House of Representatives.
On that occasion, I think for the first time
in history, the co-chairmen of the delegation
were invited to take seats on the floor of
the Senate at the right of His Honour the
Speaker, and the other members of the delegation were given seats, as they are today,

at the bar of the Senate. Having been introduced, the co-chairmen were kind enough to
address us; and we certainly appreciated their
remarks very much.
We are honoured today by having the same
co-chairmen with us; and we hope that later
on they will say a few words to us.
We are also honoured by having on the floor
of the Senate the charming lady senator, the
Honourable Mrs. Maurine B. Neuberger, who
was introduced to us a few moments ago.
Honourable senators, we have followed the
same procedure today and I am indeed happy
and privileged to welcome once again to our
Canadian Senate the distinguished delegation of United States parliamentarians now
meeting with our Canadian parliamentarians
here in Ottawa.
This is an occasion to which we always look
forward, just as we Canadian parliamentarians anticipate our annual visit to Washington.
We regret that at this time we are in the
depths of a snowy winter and for that reason
are unable to entertain our visitors from the
United States and show them around as we
would like to do were they visiting us in the
summer or autumn.
I know I will be pardoned if I glance at
the south gallery, and say that we particularly
welcome the charming wives of our distinguished guests who are presently seated there.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Our two countries occupy by far the greater portion of the North
American continent, and we have merely
an imaginary line separating us one from
the other. That border line extends for more
than 4,000 miles from east to west, and we
have been living side by side in peace and
friendship without fortifications along it for
almost 150 years. That, honourable senators,
is something of which we can be justly proud.
It is a fine example to set for the rest of this
turbulent world. Of course, differences do
arise between us occasionally, but at all times
we have solved those differences by negotiation and a friendly approach. I am certain
that this attitude will continue to prevail at
all times in the future.
Honourable senators, the remarks made to
the press by the Honourable George D. Aiken,
the distinguished Co-Chairman of the American delegation, in Washington the other day
with reference to this visit clearly indicated
great wisdom and understanding on his part.
I am confident that his feelings are representative of those of his fellow countrymen.
We thank you, our distinguished visitors,
for your interest and understanding, and we
welcome you most sincerely to our chamber.

MARCH 1 1962
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, this is, indeed, a delightful occasion for
ail of us assembled here this afternoon. We
consider it a high privilege to welcome to the
Senate of Canada these distinguished members of the Congress of the United States of
America.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): It is not
on every continent of the world that representatives of neighbouring countries can come
together in one of those countries to discuss
mutual problems, and to discuss them not in
any spirit of rancour and bitter animosity but,
rather, in a spirit of true friendship and with
a keen desire to do those things which will be
of mutual benefit, and with an equally keen
desire not to do anything which would be
harmful to either country. That is the spirit
in which the representatives of these two
countries are meeting here today.
Over the years, honourable senators, each
of the two countries has admired and taken
pride in the achievements of the other. On
Tuesday, February 20, our admiration for
our American cousins reached an all-time
high as we followed the journey of their
courageous astronaut, Colonel John Glenn,
in his flight around the world, not once but
three times in less than five hours.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): That was
a magnificent achievement, not only for
Colonel Glenn but for all his fellow citizens.
He was modest enough to say that many of
his country's scientists and others associated
with them were directly responsible in large
measure for that successful flight. All the
people of that great democracy supported the
effort in a manner which must have proved
to the world that the United States of America is truly a united nation.
The interest of Canada in this wonderful
exploit was such that the House of Cornmons interrupted its sitting in order to follow the final stages of that journey. The
Senate was not sitting at that time, but its
members followed every minute of Colonel
Glenn's journey through outer space. It is
unnecessary for me to say that all Canadians
joined with all the citizens of the United
States on that day to follow a feat which will
be recorded in the annals of history, not only
as a great achievement but as one of the
most courageous achievements of ail time.
We congratulate the representatives of the
United States who are with us today on that
great accomplishment.
May I at this time congratulate you, Mr.
Speaker, upon the direction which you have

given to the Canadian section of the CanadaUnited States Interparliamentary Group. You
have directed it in not only an efficient manner but also a very pleasant manner.
I join also with the honourable Leader of
the Government (lIon. Mr. Aseltine) in welcoming to the floor of the Senate the distinguished members of Congress who are
with us, to the distinguished members of
Congress who sit behind the bar, and to
their wives who honour us today, and add
a great deal of charm to this gathering by
their presence in the gallery.
I trust that their stay here will be interesting and profitable, and that the close
association of the representatives of our
Parliament with the representatives of the
Congress of the United States of America,
both in committee and in social contacts, will
result in making even firmer and deeper, if
that is possible, the friendship that has
existed between us over the years.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. William R. Bruni: Honourable senators, it gives me a great deal of pleasure
to have the opportunity once again of welcoming to our country our friends from the
United States who are visiting us as representatives of the Congress of their country
and who, along with Canadian members of
Parliament, make up an interparliamentary
committee which, for the next few days,
will be studying some of the problems which
concern our two great countries.
This particular interparliamentary committee has been meeting for a number of
years. This meeting is, in fact, the sixth.
During that time a great number of subjects
which were of common interest to both
countries have been discussed, and much
has been accomplished to eliminate certain
irritations which have arisen from time to
time between our countries. I feel that the
discussions in the past have been profitable
and worth while, and I know that the
results of the discussions that will take place
at the present meeting will be equally worth
while.
Honourable senators, the citizens of both
our countries are, indeed, fortunate. Unlike
West Berlin, there are no air corridors between Canada and the United States.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We have a wall, just
the same.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Have we? Well, you can
speak about that.
The air is free to be flown by all properly
licensed airplanes. There exists between our
two countries a border of more than 3,000
miles in length, and unlike East Berlin and
West Berlin no crisis has arisen with respect
to it in over a hundred years.

SENATE
It is, indeed, a pleasure for me to welcome
certain new members of this committee who
are visiting our country. I feel sure you
will enjoy your visit and I know you will
find the discussions profitable. Time does not
permit me to refer to all of the members
of the committee, but I would like to refer
to one of the co-chairmen, namely, Senator
George D. Aiken from the state of Vermont.
I have always considered Senator Aiken
as one of the founders-or, shall I say,
one of the fathers-of this committee. He
did a great deal of work in organizing it,
and it was through bis efforts and those of
certain other people that the committee came
into existence.
We are all very pleased to have with us
again Representative Cornelius E. Gallagher,
that great Irishman from New Jersey, who
is also a co-chairman. Last year he made
a tremendous contribution to our discussions
and I know that be will make a similar
contribution at this meeting of the committee.
One cannot help but feel a bit of regret
that our good friend, Edna Kelly, the congresswoman from Brooklyn, New York, is not a
member of the United States delegation to
this meeting. I believe that this is the first
meeting she has not attended, and I know
we are going to miss ber because she always
took a most prominent part in our discussions.
However, we are pleased to have in her place,
Senator Maurine Neuberger.
I am going to let honourable senators in on
a little secret. Last evening a party was held
on the House of Commons side of the building
so that the Canadian and American members
of this parliamentary committee could become
better acquainted. I understand there was a
competition held with respect to a dance
called the Twist. I am sure all members of
the Senate will be pleased to learn that Senator Maurine Neuberger and His Honour the
Speaker, Senator Mark Drouin, were adjudged
the best Twist dancers.
A year ago when our friends from the
United States visited us we took them on a
trip to the city of Quebec and were able to
provide them with the worst snowstorm that
had taken place in that city in many a year.
It was quite an experience for them, and I
really believe they enjoyed it. However, I do
feel that one such experience is sufficient,
and I hasten to assure our American friends
that we will not again be providing them with
the entertainment of a real old-time Canadian
winter snowstorm on their present visit to
Canada.
The topics which the committee will discuss
are: (1) Berlin and European security problems, (2) China policy, (3) United Nations problems, and (4) Defence production sharing. All

of these topics will be discussed by a committee known as the Defence and Foreign
Policy Committee.
The Economic Committee, in turn, will discuss (1) Relations with the Common Market,
(2) Columbia River Treaty, (3) Canada and
United States economic problems, and (4) the
Richelieu-Champlain Waterway. This is indeed a most interesting group of subjects for
discussion, and I am sure that all of us will
derive a wealth of benefit from discussing
them.
I know that our visitors and friends from
the United States will add immeasurably to
the discussions which will take place during
the next two days, and I feel that as a result
our friends will return home with a better
understanding of our problems; and I can
assure them that we in Canada will have
a far better understanding of their problems.
Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard: Honourable senators, I am happy to join in the welcome to
the delegates from the Senate and the House
of Representatives of the United States to this
sixth meeting of the Interparliamentary
Group. May I say you do us great honour
when you take time from your own important responsibilities to join us in this meeting.
This particular meeting comes at a propitious time and under rather favourable auspices because of the recent great event to
which Senator Ross Macdonald has referred,
namely, when Colonel Glenn rode his spaceship thrice around the world. As representatives of your people you can take from us the
tribute which we would like to pay to you
and to your nation for that magnificent
achievement. It was one of the most historic
days in the life of mankind and may well be
the longest step forward towards world peace
that any country yet has taken, and therefore
this particular meeting takes place under the
most propitious circumstances.
As has been said, the fortunes of our two
countries are woven together, and these reciprocal meetings of the legislators of the
United States and of Canada afford us an
opportunity to strengthen the weave. The
full and frank discussions that take place, and
indeed they are very frank on occasions, the
mutual understandings formed and the warm
personal friendships made, afford us an opportunity of solving our joint problems and
help us to increase the strength of our support for those causes in which we are jointly
engaged.
If you, our counterparts from the United
States, derive as much benefit and pleasure
from these meetings as we Canadians do, we
shall indeed be happy. This meeting also gives
us an opportunity to repay, at least in part,

sense or the culture that are necessities for

a Canadian delegate.
I am sorry we were not given the opportunity of meeting you good people here.
That is only for a few, apparently; but it
would have been nice if we had got together
and talked over what occurred last year. However, we have been given the opportunity
of looking at our guests, and the sight is very
pleasant.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliol: Your Honour,
honoured guests and honourable senators:
May I quote to you an example of shrewd
diplomacy? I refer to a gentleman who was
Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States
to Canada in 1939, on the occasion of the
visit of the King and Queen to us. In my
former constituency of Temiscouata there is
a parish by the nane of Estcourt, just on
the boundary between Canada and the United
States. One of my good friends was originally
a squatter. He had taken possession of a
piece of land which was divided by the
boundary, which now divides houses. There
are houses which are partly in Canada and
partly in the United States-the dining room
is in Canada and the kitchen is out in the
United States. That gentleman was a farmer.
Part of his land was for pasture, as he had
wonderful cattle.
Those cattle had to eat, so the cows
and the oxen often crossed the border to
eat the grass on the American soil. A
United States customs inspector, who was
very severe, thought that although he could
not charge for the American grass eaten by
the Canadian cows on the American soil, he
had to require that the farmer have a licence
permitting the cows to eat on both sides
of the boundary. I was very much worried
about it. The farmer had to pay a fine for
each head of cattle.
Mr. Roper came to Ottawa. He was a
delightful gentleman from the south, and I
had a pleasant conversation with him about
that matter. He told me to leave it with him.
I did not hear from him, but some time
later I received a wire from the farmer
telling me that he had received a cheque
refunding the amount that he had paid for

the licence for the cattle, together with a
paper to sign. He asked me, "What shall
I do?" I answered, "Cash the cheque and
don't sign anything else."
Afterwards I went to Portland and met
the head of the customs office there. I asked
him if he knew Mr. Roper. He said, "Very
well, he is the gentleman who telephoned
me to send a cheque to your fariner."
This is a good example of what diplomacy
can do. There was no argument, and no
red tape; the matter was attended to by a
telephone call. It is worth remembering.
The Hon. the Speaker: Friends from the
United States, I greeted you this morning in
a somewhat more informal way. Here in the
Senate chamber it is more formal, but I must
say that it is without a "twist" of the tongue
that I greet you again here.
Our greeting to you in the Canadian Senate
would not be complete without a few words
of welcome spoken in French. I know that
our American friends are all bilingual, and
Canadian senators who are not may make
use of the simultaneous translation system in
the chamber.
(Translation):
It is a pleasure for me, honourable senators
and members of the Congress, to receive you
here and to welcome you officially on behalf
of the Senate.
The province of Quebec and the United
States are divided by a long and unprotected
border. Russia is confined between two walls:
the Great Wall of China and the wall of
Eastern Germany. But our two countries, as
was said earlier, are separated by an open
border and our hearts overflow on your side,
as yours, we hope, overflow on ours.
Each year, a great number of visitors travel
to and fro.
We also have, of course, the Columbia River
regarding which we shall come to an agreement, eventually.
(Text):
Honourable friends, we hope that your stay
here will be pleasant and very fruitful indeed,
and that you will come back.
I now ask Senator Aiken to say a few
words. I must say that Senator Aiken and
Representative Gallagher were not told that
they could again speak from the floor of
the Senate. So perhaps they are taken somewhat by surprise.
Hon. George D. Aiken, Senator from
Vermoni: Monsieur le Président, honourable
senators, I want on behalf of the United
States delegation to thank you very sincerely
for the kind words which have been spoken
in this chamber today. It is nearly four years
ago that I was first honoured by being

MARCH 1, 1962
brought to this very spot where I am now.
I had come to Canada as an explorer. That
was one of the few times I had been to
Canada without a fishing pole. But I came as
an explorer that day too, exploring the
possibility of establishing closer Parliamentary relationships between Ottawa and Washington. You know the results.
Your Prime Minister, your Speaker, and
the other officials were pursuing this very
goal, and I found I was trailing rather than
leading the field.
We have met since then officially and in
larger numbers six times, and I believe that
these meetings have been one of the most
worthwhile things which has happened to us
in recent history.
We had no parliamentary meeting since
the one in 1943, and I do not know whether
or not there had been any previous to that.
But now we have had the six meetings and
we have made very lasting personal friendships, the finest possession one could have.
We have also imparted and received understandings which we would not otherwise
have had. We dispelled rumours which floated
back and forth across the border and we
reached a clearer understanding of each
other's position in the event of differing
views.
We have met twice a year up to now and
it is remarkable how much can happen
between meetings. You all know what has
happened since we met last. You know of
the events in the Congo-they have had their
ups and downs-and the things which have
gone on on other continents. You know that
a year ago we did not have the Common
Market proposition facing us. Maybe you
know what to do about that problem, but I
am not sure that we know just what to do
about it yet.
You heard mentioned here that Colonel
John Glenn orbited the earth three times
between breakfast and lunchtime. We could
send him to Ottawa, but if be were to come
here in his conveyance he would have to
start somewhere in South America to let
down. So I do not think that would be
feasible.
Mention has been made of the fact that we
have 3,000 or 4,000 miles of border and no
wall between us. We never want anything
like that, although we do have some pasture
walls built to keep the cows on the right
side of the border.
However, at one time we did have a fort
on the border. After the war of 1812 the
United States built a big stone fort on the
west bank of Lake Champlain, on the
boundary. I do not know whether they foresaw the need for protecting the Richelieu
waterway or not, but at that time it was an

important waterway. They built that fort so
that if war came again we could control the
Champlain traffic. When the construction of
that big fort was completed it was found
that it had been built on Canadian soil, and
a solution was reached by Canada conveying the land on which it stood to the United
States.
Once more I want to thank you for the
courtesy and hospitality which bas been
shown us here; and we look forward to seeing you in Washington at some time in the
future. I do not know whether we can put on
another contest featuring Senator Neuberger
and Hon. Mr. Drouin. I shall not say more
about that now, but I can assure you, Maurine,
that you are not the only lady senator in
North America who can dance.
I want to thank you all again for your
hospitality, and to tell you how glad we are to
be here at this time.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Cornelius E. Gallagher, Representative
from New Jersey: Mr. Speaker and honourable senators, on behalf of the House of
Representatives I want to extend our sincere
thanks for the honour you pay us by inviting
us on to the floor of your chamber today. As
always, we are delighted to be back, joining
with our colleagues here in Canada, renewing
our old friendships and making new ones.
The good senator's story of the house being
built on both sides of the border, reminds me
of a similar instance. Several weeks ago I was
in Berlin, and there I saw a house that was
built on the border between East and West
Berlin. I happened to step into this particular
house to ask how things were going. The
resident said that the communists had caused
him great inconvenience and difficulty, and
that he had a very personal score to settle
with them. I asked him why that was, and
he replied, "Well, you can see my living room
and you can see my bedroom here, but those
communists have walled up my plumbing,
which is in East Berlin."
So we find problems existing in many
places, but what we want to do today is to
try, in our modest way, to make some small
contribution towards the elimination of differences that may exist. I might add that this
morning some very warm topics, like Cuba
and China, came up before our committee.
However, we need to find ways of eliminating
these differences. We should seek solutions so
that, as representatives of both countries, we
can be possessed of a greater understanding
to take back to our respective legislative
bodies, and, in this small way, add to the
understanding that must exist in the future if
these problems are to be eliminated.

SENATE
I certainly want to thank you for being
so gracious to us. The snow storm of last
year that Senator Brunt mentioned we very
much enjoyed, and it was only equalled by
the warm hospitality of Senator Quart, when
she welcomed us to Quebec City. One of the
things we wanted to find out on this trip
was whether or not our plane ever got out
of that snow storm.
Again, I want to thank you for the high
honour you pay us in inviting us here today.
The graciousness and hospitality which you
extended to us in the past, has been exceeded-though we did not think it possible-by your most cordial welcome today.
I believe that never before in recorded
history have there existed two independent
nations with such a mutuality of friendship,
fondness and purpose as ours possess. I hope
that in the days to come we can, through
these meetings, add to this greater understanding and the great tradition of friendship
that exists between us. Thank you.
Hon. Senators:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mrs. Maurine B. Neuberger, Senator
from Oregon: To you, my fellow Americansfor we are all residents of America, and
I was very much impressed with the comments of the honourable senator concerning
the doing away with borders-I want to say
just a word.
Perhaps I am sensitive on this subject
of borders because some 15 to 18 years ago
my husband wrote an article after one of
our many trips to Canada, in which he
said that the differences that separate us
are small compared to the things we have
in common, the things that join us, and that
eventually, though maybe not in our lifetime, we can be as one. He knew that he
was treading on some Canadian nationalism,
but he did not wish such a pronouncement
to hurt anyone. We do have a common
ancestry and common interests, and we need,
perhaps, to stand together and to do away
with some of the artificiality that exists
between us.
I might say that Dick and I called the
Vancouver Hotel in Vancouver our home
away from home, because we spent so much
time there. I would not hesitate to say that
I know more about British Columbia than
many residents of that great province.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Neuberger: I say that because
I have travelled through it from Squamish
to Kelowna, to Prince George and out again
to Prince Rupert, and have a great fondness
for the province.

I should like to relate a funny thing that
happened to me. Some years ago the Board
of Trade of Vancouver invited my husband
and me to address its members. It was the
first time in the history of that long-established organization that they had ever asked
the ladies to attend, but because my husband
and I were both in government, they asked
us to attend as a team, and they also asked
their wives to attend. I never worked so hard
on a speech as I did then, because we were
given the topic on which we were to address
them. Just before that one of your great
Canadian writers had written an article in a
Canadian newspaper entitled, "What's Wrong
with You Yanks?" The Board of Trade asked
us to come up with an answer, and gave us
the topic, "What's Wrong with You Canucks?"
Since I was so fond of Canadians, it was hard
for me to write a speech on that topic, but I
laboured on it.
Then the great day came, and I was to
speak first. I said I thought there was a certain inferiority about Canadians in regard to
their culture and their not developing writers
and so on. I spoke along that line for a time,
and then I got down to the domestic part of
it. I said that we American women in particular loved to come to Victoria and Vancouver and buy the beautiful woollens to be
found there, but that we took thern home and
had thern tailored there because Canadians
did not seem to have the knack of conforming to what we thought was good fashion. I
said that a good many Canadian womenthis was in British Columbia, of courselooked somewhat rough spun, from the fit of
their clothes.
Well, the next morning all the wonderful
erudite words my husband had said about
Canadian-American relations were lost and
the headlines featured this remark I had made.
I thought I had softened it by saying how
difficult it was to live up to the topic, but
my words went across Canada and we did
not dare cross the line again for about two
years. When I came back I was greeted by
a reporter, who interviewed me at my hotel.
Lo and behold a short time later, when I
went down on the street, there was the Vancouver Sun with the great headline: "That
woman is here again".
I hope on that occasion I did not disrupt our
good relations.
This is my first visit to eastern Canada and
I am enjoying the great hospitality which has
been shown to us here. Thank you.
Hon. Senators: Hear hear.

THE LATE SENATOR WILSON
TRIBUTES

Hon. Waller M. Aselline: Honourable senators, before we proceed with our regular business I rise with pain in my heart to refer to
the passing of a very dear friend, Senator
Cairine Wilson, who died on Saturday, March
3. A serious injury had resulted in ber confinement to hospital for some time; in fact,
she had suffered three serious accidents, which
ultimately brought about her death.
The late Senator Wilson was summoned to
the Senate some thirty-one years ago, and
she became a very active member of this
chamber from the first. Honourable senators
are also aware that she was the first woman
senator to sit in this chamber. Her appointment was an historic one, coming as it did
after quite a number of years of controversy
and litigation to establish the fact that a
woman had the same right as a man ta become
a member of the Canadian Senate.
The late Senator Wilson came from a
political family. Her father, I am informed,
was a senator, and sat on this rather than the
other side of the chamber. Her husband was a
Liberal member of Parliament.
Before and after her appointment, and until
the very time of her death, Senator Wilson
devoted much of her time and energy to welfare work. She was particularly interested in
refugees, in immigrants, and in underprivileged persons.
Senator Wilson held many important posts
and positions, and I will be pardoned if
I mention only a few. She was Honorary
President of the Ottawa Welfare Bureau,
and of the Save the Children Fund; she
was Chairman of the Canadian Committee
for Czechoslovakian Refugees, and was interested in many other like organizations.
The late senator was a life member of the
Canadian Welfare Council, the first President of the League of Nations Society of
Canada, and the first woman delegate to
the United Nations Assembly. For many
years she was Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. As I said a moment ago, I could
mention many other positions which she
held.

Senator Wilson took a very prominent
part in all Senate activities. In fact, at the
time of her passing she was the sponsor,
through the honourable Senator Hugessen
who was acting for her, of a Senate bill
respecting the Governing Councils of the
Salvation Army of Canada East and Canada
West.
Honourable senators will wonder how a
person with so many outside activities would
have time for the running of a home, but
in spite of her outside activities which took
a great deal of her time, she was a great
homemaker. Her home was very important
to her; she enjoyed it, and her large family
of eight children and fourteen grandchildren.
Her lovely residence, Manor House, and the
beautiful grounds surrounding it were open
at all times to her many friends. I certainly
appreciated the many occasions on which
I had the privilege of being able to pay
visits there. She was a most devoted wife
and mother, and a great public-minded
citizen.
In the death of Senator Wilson we mourn
the passing of a great Christian philanthropist.
Her place in this world will be a difficult
one to fill. We have lost a faithful friend
and a most distinguished colleague. Our
hearts go out in deepest sympathy to the
members of her family and ber relatives.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, it is indeed difficult to pay an adequate
tribute to our late colleague, Senator Cairine
Wilson. The Leader of the Government has
told honourable senators something of her
life and her many activities, and I trust that
you will pardon me if I repeat some of what
he has said.
Senator Wilson was, indeed, a remarkable
woman. She seemed to devote all her time
and talents to the interests and welfare of
others, but never for one moment did she
neglect her home or her family; they always
came first, and yet nothing which she undertook suffered as a result. Notwithstanding the
many honours that were heaped upon her, her
greatest pride, as the Leader of the Government has said, was in her eight children,
fourteen grandchildren and ber one greatgrandson.
Hers was a happy and hospitable home,
where she and ber husband, the late Norman
Wilson, at one time member of Parliament
for the constituency of Russell, and family
were always glad to open their doors to many
hundreds of guests, all of whom received an
equally warm welcome, whether they came
from home or abroad and irrespective of
whether they were of high or low birth. She
was an active and faithful member of St.

MARCH 13, 1962
Andrew's Presbyterian Church, where she and
her family, whenever they were in Ottawa,
were always in attendance on the Sabbath
morning.
The Leader of the Government (Han. Mr.
Aseltine) has mentioned some of the organizations to which aur late colleague gave active
and inspiring leadership. We cannot make the
record complete, but perhaps I wiil be pardoned if I mention some of the organizations
of which she was a prominent member. They
include the Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A., but more
especially the Y.W.C.A.; the Women's Canadian Club; the Princess Alice Scholarship
Foundation; the Victorian Order of Nurses;
the National Committee for Refugees; the
Business and Professional Women's Club; the
Zonta Club; the Canadian-American Women's
Committee an International Relations; and
the National Federation of Liberal Women of
Canada. She was one of those largely responsible for the founding of the last-mentioned
federation, of wbich she was honorary
president.
The late Senator Wilson received many
hanaurs during ber lifetime. I shall mention
some of them. She was a Dame de Grace of
the Venerable Order of the Hospital of St.
John of Jerusalem. In 1950, in recognition of
her outstanding work for refugee children,
the French Government created her a Knight
of the Legion of Honour. Queen's University
conferred upýon ber the honorary degree of
Doctor of Laws. Acadia University honoured
ber with the degree of Doctor of Civil Law.
Senator Wilson was admired witb affection
and esteem by ahl members of this honourable
bouse and ber passing is a personal loss to
eacb one of us.
Tbe bonourable Leader of tbe Government
has told us sometbing of the unus-ual circumstances under wbicb she became a member of
the Senate of Canada, being the first woman
ta become a member. It is interesting to, note
also that in 1955 she was selected by us to act
as Speaker of this bouse during the absence
of tbe honourable tbe Speaker on that day.
Tbus, she became the first woman ta preside
over the ýdelîberations of this chamber.
When Senator Wilson was in Ottawa she
was always ta be found in her place in the
Senate chamber, and she was rarely absent
from committee meetings. As the bonourable
Leader of tbe Government bas said, she was
Chairman of tbe Committee on Immigration
and Labour. She was unrelenting in ber efforts to bave Canada accept refugees wbo
were eking out a meagre existence in most
deplorable circumstances in refugee camps.
The acceptance by Canada of a number of

such refugees was due in large part ta ber
determination and untiring efforts. Many of
tbose refugees who found new homes and wbo
are now establisbed in Canada will forever
caîl ber blessed.
Honourable senators, there is much more
that can be said of tbe accomplisbments and
the wortbwhile contributions of this remarkable woman ta ber fellow Canadians, but I
shahl content myseif with saying that ber
good works wihl long bave a deep impact upon
tbe lives of ber countrymen. We in this cbamber deem it a privilege ta have been associated with one of such great charm and
intelligence who served the Senate and the
people of Canada with unusual distinction.
To ber loved ones I join witb the bonourable Leader of the Government in extending
aur very deep sympatby.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
over the past nine months tbe Angel of Death
bas paid frequent visits to tbe membership
of this bouse, but of all those occasions there
is not one tbat moves us more deeply than
does tbe passing of tbe gentle lady ta wbom
we pay aur tributes this evening.
Tbe late Senator Wilson moved in and out
among us "wearing tbe wbite flower of a
blameless if e". She was born a little over
seventy-seven years ago in the spaciaus days
of the late Victarian era. Her family was well
known in tbe city of Mantreal. She passed
tbrougb school and callege, and in the home
of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, in the early years of
the century, she met tbe gentleman wbo was
ta be ber husband and ber helpmate through
ife.
Those were tbe days, I am fain ta remark,
wben caurtesy and honour flourished more
fully than tbey do at the present time. Shýe
assumed the duties of a housewife. She was
the mother of eight cbihdren, and when tbe
task of rearing them was done she devoted
ber abilities ta the welfare work of her feilow
men.
Senator Wilson was nat a great intehlectual,
and I tbink she was the better for that. People
with strang intellects often lack imagination
and sympathy. Her qualities were the qualities of the heart, and I would remind honourable senators that in the Book of Proverbs,
where great wisdom is distilled, there appear these words:
Keep tby heart with ail diligence; for
out of it are the issues of life.
And that was essentially true of Cairine
Wilson: gentie, honourable, courageous and
sympathetic. Her heart went out to every
good cause; it tbrobbed for everyone in trouble

SENATE
or distress, and she gave not only of ber
time but of ber substance to try to remedy as
far as lay within ber power the injustice and
the wrongs of a long-suff ering world.
And so she has passed from us. Her memory, I venture to say, will remain green
with us as long as we in this chamber still
have our responsibilities in this life. She was
a fine example of motherhood. She was a fine
example of unselfish, devoted service to mankind, and on the long roll of the record no
one has played a more distinguished part to
her fellow-men and women in this country
than did the late Cairine Wilson.
I join with the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) and the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) in the words of sympathy
they have directed to the family of the late
senator. But the greatest solace that will
come to ber children and to her friends is
the recollection of the life that she lived,
at all times the self-sacrificing effort that she
made for the betterment of humanity.
(Translation):
Hon. Mariana B. Jodoin: Honourable senators, on behalf of the women of the province
of Quebec, I should like to associate myself
wholeheartedly with the compliments so
richly deserved by the first Canadian woman
appointed to the senate in 1930, who was born
and who bas lived in Montreal, in the heart
of Quebec.
A lady of great personal charm, she belonged to a family of distinguished parliamentarians. Brought up in an environment where
politics was the main topic of conversation,
Mrs. Cairine Wilson gave ber support to a
cause which was dear to her, that is, the advancement of women in the field of public life,
without, however, neglecting her family duties.
Her happy home, composed of eight children
and numerous grandchildren, is an obvious
proof of that.
On ber appointment in 1930, she stated, in
French, in the course of a brilliant speech in
the Senate:
"I keep a tender memory of my native
province, of the old French province of
Quebec, where it is good to live, on account of that great spirit of tolerance towards the English-speaking and Protestant minority of Quebec, and which I
should like to state as an example to
the whole of Canada.
It is only fair, at this time, when gratitude
is the order of the day, that on behalf of the
women of Quebec I should express to the
first Canadian woman appointed to Senate a
fond remembrance and our sincere appreciation for ber example of devotion to the women's cause.

Personally, I should like to thank her for the
warm welcome she gave me when I was appointed to the Senate.
I shall feel less alone, she told me,
because union is strength.
To ber bereaved family, I extend the most
sincere sympathies of all French-speaking
Canadian women.
(Text):
Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson: Honourable
senators, it is with the deepest sorrow mingled with pride that I wish to pay a tribute,
in this chamber which knew ber for so many
years, to the late Senator Cairine Reay Wilson, whose death leaves a permanent and
aching void in the lives and hearts of a
great many people, including my own.
The sorrow flows from the irreparable loss
we all have suffered. We will miss seeing
Senator Wilson in these halls. We will miss
the kindly interest she took in everyone for,
as was said in a poem recently dedicated to
ber and which was published in one of the
Ottawa newspapers after ber death,
She served the artisan and erudite with
equal fervor,
leaving each a vast inheritance.
We will miss the unwavering support that
we knew she would always give to legislation or projects she considered were for the
public good, particularly if she thought they
were for the benefit of people less fortunate
than herself. Canadians, and many people
beyond Canada, will long remember the tremendous amount of work she did over many
years on behalf of refugees.
Senator Wilson had excellent judgment,
and we will miss her wise counsel and advice, as we will miss, too, the friendship and
hospitality she extended so generously and so
graciously.
We are glad, I am sure, that in the antechamber of the Senate we have in remembrance of her a beautiful marble statue
which was placed there in 1960 upon the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of her
appointment as Canada's first woman senator.
The pride that I mentioned is shared by
all Canadian women when we look back
over Senator Wilson's career and realize how
ably she filled the difficult role of being
Canada's first woman senator. When Cairine
Wilson accepted the honour of an appointment to the Senate in 1930-and we all know
that such an appointment is a great honour
-being the daughter of a senator she realized
that ber appointment was not only an honour
but carried with it many duties and responsibilities, and she seriously took upon
herself the obligations accompanying the
office.

MARCH 13, 1962
Through all her thiry-two years in the
Senate, Cairine Wilson carried the honour of
being a senator-as well as many other honours which she subsequently won for herself-with dignity and distinction. She also
won deep respect for her conscientious and
scrupulous observance of her Senate duties
and responsibilities. Again, to quote from the
poem I referred to earlier:
The halls that heard her footsteps
were respectful in her presence
and behind her back.
Senator Wilson not only won respect for
herself and a place in Canadian history but,
by her example, she helped to make a
respected place for women in public life in
this country. For this legacy, Canadian women,
who are saddened by her death, will long
remember and pay tribute to her.
In my own province of New Brunswick
there is sincere mourning for Senator Wilson.
Although her home was in Ottawa, for many
years she spent the summer months at St.
Andrews, that beautiful New Brunswick town
by the sea. She became widely known
throughout the province for the active interest
she took in community aff airs, in church and
social life, in local organizations, particularly
the Women's Institutes, and in the local
schools which owe many prizes and scholarships to ber generosity. Throughout all of
New Brunswick, Senator Wilson is remembered with affection, with gratitude and with
pride.
It is unnecessary for me to repeat Senator
Wilson's accomplishments, which have already been spoken of by preceding speakers;
nor need I repeat the honours that have been
conferred upon her which, as you know,
were many. My feeling of respect for her is
such that for myself I hope for nothing better
during my remaining years in the Senate
than that I might emulate Senator Wilson in
her conscientious observance of her duties,
her compassion for the unfortunate and the
kindness and friendship she showed so freely
to all with whom she came in contact.
With the Leader of the Government, Senator Aseltine, the Leader of the Opposition,
Senator Macdonald, and Senator Crerar and
Senator Jodoin, I, too, extend my deepest and
most sincere sympathy to the members of
Senator Wilson's family.
Hon. Olive L. Irvine: Honourable senators,
may I be permitted to share in the tributes
being paid this evening in memory of our
colleague, the late Honourable Cairine Wilson.
During the short time that I have had the
honour to sit as a member of this chamber I
have had the most profound admiration for
this great Canadian. For years I read with

interest the remarkable record of our first
woman senator. To all, she was first and foremost a woman in the true sense of the word.
Secondly, she was an excellent mother, not
only to her own large family, but to all who
were crippled, handicapped, or in any way
downtrodden. In Canada today there are
hundreds of men and women who on account
of her compassionate heart will ever call her
blessed.
Her race is run; Canada has lost a great
Canadian, but ber example will live on.
Especially so will her passing be felt among
the women members of the Senate of Canada,
who have learned to love and admire her
sterling qualities. I am happy in the fact that
I have been given the privilege and opportunity to share the fellowship of her mind and
spirit.
Honourable senators, I join with the Leader
of the Government, the Leader of the Opposition and other of my colleagues who have
expressed the great sympathy and the serious
loss we feel in the death of Senator Cairine
Wilson, and in extending our sympathy to the
members of her family.
Hon. F. Elsie Inman: Honourable senators,
again we are called upon to mourn the passing
of a highly respected and greatly beloved
colleague and valuable member of this chamber.
The death of Senator Wilson is a distinct
loss to the Senate, where she was an outstanding personality, a true and loyal friend
to her associates.
Senator Wilson epitomized the ideal Canadian woman and all that is best in womanhood. She engaged in, and sponsored, every
worthwhile organization and movement which
contributes to the welfare of others, not only
in her own communities of Ottawa and St.
Andrews in New Brunswick, but in all Canada, and indeed much farther afield. An able
organizer, she always gave freely of ber time
and means to promote the well-being of those
in other countries who are not as fortunate as
Canadians. Her horizons were wide and deep.
Still she never allowed the scenes of these
horizons to dim her view of the closer needs.
Her advice and assistance were often sought
and she gave of both generously, whenever
and wherever required.
Senator Wilson's appointment to the Senate
in 1930 was acclaimed by al Canadian women,
irrespective of political colour. Her appointment was indeed a wise choice, for Senator
Wilson cut the bonds of prejudice against
women in public life, and by ber example
proved that women can easily and readily
shoulder their responsibilities in public
service.

SENATE
I had known Senator Wilson for many years
and found her always a true and sincere
friend. She could not be otherwise, for she
was fair, generous-minded and big-hearted,
a champion of what is best in life. I consider
it a great privilege to have known her and
to have been associated with her as one of her
colleagues and as a friend in this chamber.
To her sorrowing family, I wish to express
our deepest sympathy in their sad bereavement.
(Translation):
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators, in
a gesture of noble gratitude, France had bestowed the Legion of Honour upon the one
who has passed away. She loved our former
mother country and was familiar with French
culture which she appreciated. It is therefore
in my mother tongue that tonight I shall
pay ber this final tribute.
Honourable Cairine Wilson was, in the full
grace of this beautiful phrase, a grand lady.
An excellent education was a complement to
her natural charm. And because she was a
grand lady, she never acted haughty. As you
all know, honourable senators, she was goodhearted, she was as good as bread, as we say
in Quebec. Her heart was in the right place
and with generosity sought to relieve all
human afflictions: war-victim children, refugees, immigrants and many other charitable
works in which I was her humble associate.
She was a community-minded woman. She
was untiringly and steadfastly dedicated and
we were proud to see amongst us that distinguished Canadian lady who did honour to
our Liberal ideals.
Mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, she brought up a fine and large family
and to all of them, I offer the expression of
my deep sympathy.
The name of Cairine Wilson will remain
forever written in gold letters in our Canadian
annals, as both the Leader of the Government
and the Leader of the Opposition have
pointed out.
She was the first Canadian woman named
to this house. She also was the first Canadian
woman to represent ber country at the United
Nations. She considered it an honour to represent ber country, but it was also an honour
for our country to have ber as our representative.
The name of Cairine Wilson stands out in
the evolution of human rights. The good she
has done will endure after ber passing.
Through ber courage and her kindness she
belongs to history. Therefore, before I conclude my remarks, I want to quote those
verses written by Canon Lionel Groulx:

Ils gardent l'avenir ceux qui gardent
l'histoire,
Ceux dont la souvenance est sans
mauvais remords,
Et qui, près des tombeaux, sommeillent dans la gloire,
A l'âme des vivants mêlent l'âme des
morts.
We all want tonight to bow our heads to
pay a tribute to that kind and gentle friend
and unite our hearts to hers, unite our souls
to hers which was so deeply Christian.
(Text):
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
there is but little that can be added to what
has already been said, and so eloquently
said, by the speakers who have preceded
me. They have told us much about the position which Cairine Wilson occupied in the
public life of this country and as a member
of this chamber. There is no need of repetition of that; the record speaks for itself.
All that I want to do is to pay a tribute,
a very deep-felt tribute, to ber personality
as a woman and a friend.
From the day that I was summoned to
the Senate, now more than twenty-five years
ago, Cairine Wilson became and remained
until the end a good friend to both my wife
and myself. To visit ber in ber home, in
the delightful family life which she created
and by which she was surrounded, was a
happy experience, and the personal qualities
which she showed in ber home were the
same qualities which she showed in the wider
field of public service and which so greatly
distinguished her. They can be summarized
in a very few words-a deep humanity, a
generous spirit, and a high sense of public
duty. It is to the combination of these fine
qualities, and their application in many fields
of practical benevolence, that so many thousands of men and women from one end of
this country to the other owe so much, and
it is they who will venerate her name and
remember it in the years to come.
Honourable senators, we in this chamber
have lost much in the passing of Cairine
Wilson, and we can realize how much more
has been lost by those of her immediate
family, to whom she was so dear and so
near. I join with the leaders of both sides
of this house and with the other honourable
senators who spoke in extending our profound sympathy to the members of her family.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, it is not my intention to endeavour to
add to the tributes that have been paid, and
so well paid, and so thoroughly deserved by

the late Cairine Wilson. However, there is
one incident which I would like to recall. As someone has spoken about the

MARCH 13, 1962
charm and the intelligence of the late
Cairine Wilson, I would like to say a
word with regard to ber adherence to a high
and noble principle, an adherence that could
gain ber nothing in status or any other way
but which nevertheless was a tribute to her
character.
There were many incidents in the last war
of which we Canadians are very justly proud,
and naturally there are some which we would
like to forget, one of which was our treatment
of the Japanese-Canadian citizens on the
Pacific coast. I shall say no more about that
proceeding because we all know of it, except to say that there was nothing to be
gained in status or by appreciation of one's
fellow citizens in espousing the cause of the
downtrodden Japanese at that time. They
were the most unpopular people in Canada
in the early stages of the last war. We held
a meeting in the city of Toronto to protest
against the treatment that was being accorded them. I was the principal speaker at
that meeting, but I have always held a great
admiration for Cairine Wilson for the courage
and character which she exhibited in travelling from Ottawa to Toronto to attend that
meeting. She came there and spoke on behalf
of her fellow Canadian citizens of Japanese
origin. I was filled with admiration and I
have always remembered, with a certain
degree of gratitude to Cairine Wilson, that
she had the courage to espouse the cause of
the underdog, of the oppressed, of the downtrodden, without any possibility of benefit to
herself.
I join in the tributes that have been paid to
her and in the expression of sympathy to her
family; and I would like to add that I do it
because, above all things, of her adherence to
high and noble principles.
[Later:]
Hon. Josie D. Quart: Honourable senators,
due to an unavoidable delay, I arrived late at
the Senate tonight. May I now join with my
honourable colleagues in their expression of
sorrow on the passing of Senator Cairine
Wilson, a distinguished colleague and an outstanding personality. It will indeed be difficult
to realize that she will no longer take her
place with us in this chamber.
Historical events can at times be very confusing as to names and dates, but the memorable occasion when the first woman senator,
the Honourable Cairine Wilson, was appointed
to the Senate, will ever be remembered and
recorded in the pages of Canadian history as
well as in the records of all women's national
associations. For what woman in Canada did
not follow with pride her appointment to this

chamber? It has been given to few Canadian
women, if any, to date, to serve so long in
any official capacity.
We who follow her footsteps in this honourable and august chamber can only hope that
ber life and achievements will be an inspiration to all women who are called to serve
their country in the Senate.
I have always admired the manifest talents
and accomplishments of Senator Wilson but,
above all, her valiant and indomitable spirit
to surmount all obstacles. During her colourful career she made tremendous contributions
with unselfish devotion to philanthropic, civic,
political and to many other fields of endeavour.
Personally, I shall always treasure as precious souvenirs ber kind letters of congratulation to me when I was appointed a Canadian
delegate to the United Nations General
Assembly and again when I was a delegate to
the United Nations Status of Women Commission. Then when I was privileged to become a member of the Senate she graciously
welcomed me and offered ber help and kindly
advice.
Success crowned her life, and may her
eternal reward be great. May she rest in
peace.
To the members of ber family I wish to
extend my most sincere sympathy in their
great loss.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, as a final and heartfelt tribute to our
beloved colleague I would ask you to stand
at your places for a few moments of prayer.
Honourable senators stood in silence.

SENATE
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. Clarence V. Emerson: With leave of
the Senate, I move the second reading of the
bill now.
Hon. Waller M. Aseltine: Honourable senators, may I at this time inform the house of
the business to come before us, and why
leave is being asked for second reading of
this bill tonight. The Representation Act, the
measure now before us, and three other bills
to be introduced for first reading tonight,
makes five bills for consideration this week.
In addition we also expect the supplementary
estimates tomorrow or the next day. For
those reasons, I would like to go ahead with
second reading of this bill this evening, and
the honourable senator from Saint John-Albert
(Hon. Mr. Emerson) is ready, with consent of
the Senate, to open the debate on motion for
second reading. I trust he will be given permission to proceed so that we can deal with
this one bill, if possible, this evening.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, the Leader of the Government having
mentioned some of the business to come before the house, I should like to ask a question
of him. However, I should like to preface it
with a few remarks. I am sure we are all
pleased to sec the honourable senator from
Royal (Hon. Mr. Brooks) back with us, in his
accustomed place in the house. During the
last six months, approximately, he bas been
ably representing Canada at the United
Nations.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Bran±ford): All Canada is proud to have had him as its representative. On this side of the house we are
at times apt to criticize the Government and
the Prime Minister for what they do, but I
am sure we all support the Prime Minister in
that appointment.
My question of the Leader of the Government is this: Will there be an early opportunity afforded the honourable senator frorn
Royal to tell us something of his activities
at the United Nations?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I too want to congratulate the honourable senator from Royal on
the good work that he has been doing in
New York. The Secretary of State for External Affairs, the Honourable Howard
Green, has told me on several occasions how
pleased he bas been to have him there, and
how much confidence he has in him. I am also
pleased that the Leader of the Opposition has
turned over a new leaf-

Hon. Mr. Bruni: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: -and that he is praising the honourable senator from Royal for
his good work.
At the first opportunity I shall be glad to
arrange matters so that the honourable senator from Royal can give us a full report, but
I doubt that it will be this week. I hope that
you, Senator Brooks, will be in attendance
here for some little time, and that perhaps we
shall be able next week to arrange for you
to tell us your story of the big things that
have been done, and of some of your accomplishments at the United Nations.
Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators,
were I a modest man I should be very much
embarrassed by the kind remarks of the
honourable Leader of the Opposition and
my other friends in the Senate. I am not
particularly anxious to make a report on
my duties at the United Nations at the present time, and I should be pleased te wait
until the Leader of the Government deems
the time ripe. I thank you very much, bonourable senators, for your kind remarks.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I happened to be an observer at
the United Nations when the mission was led
by the Honourable Howard Green and the
honourable senator from Royal. I admired
the good teamwork that existed on the mission. For the present moment I must say to
you that our colleague the honourable senator from Royal has proved to be a careerdiplomat on every occasion.
Hon. Mr. Emerson: Honourable senators,
the purpose of Bill C-49 is to extend the
facilities provided by the Small Businesses
Loans Act, which I had the honour of sponsoring in this chamber a year ago last December.
The explanatory note is quite clear, and
I do not intend to take up much of your time
in explanation of the bill. Experience gained
through the operation of the Small Businesses Loans Act for over a year indicates
that small business enterprises need the assistance of the Government guarantee where
relocation of their premises is required. This
bill will render that assistance.
With leave of the Senate, I should like
to have included in Hansard a breakdown
of the 2,737 loans made under the terms
of the act since last spring, when, in effect,
it commenced to operate, and until November 30, 1961, the last date for which I have
complete statistics.
Some Hon. Senators: Agreed.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Emerson: This table shows the
distribution of the loans by number, by
value and by provinces for the different
industries. It shows that there has been
quite a substantial utilization of the legislation, considering that it is a new project
and that many small businessmen are probably not completely aware of it as yet.
There are those who will argue that the
scope of the assistance should be much
broader. I should, with respect, remind honourable senators that this legislation is designed to augment conventional credit facilities, not to supplant them.
As is necessary with most new legislation,
it is important that we move carefully and
with proper evaluation of the situation as
experience is gained. A year of experience
is not long, and the future may show that
further amendments to the act are wise and
expedient. Experience to date shows that
this present amendment is wise and expedient. An educated estimate is that the
second year of operations under the act, when
amended, should show guaranteed loans to
small businesses in the neighbourhood of $50
million.
I commend this bill to honourable senators and, if given second reading tonight,
I propose to move that it be referred to
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce for further consideration.
Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard: Honourable senators, I rise to speak in support of the
principle of this bill and, at the same time,
to voice a few words of criticism which,
however, I hope might be construed as constructive criticism.
In the first place, may I congratulate the
honourable senator from Saint John-Albert
(Hon. Mr. Emerson) on his remarks in explanation of the purpose of the bill, giving
us the benefit of the experience to date
under the act, and on his comments as to
the expectations with respect to it.
Actually the amendment contained in this
bill is a minor one. As the honourable senator from Saint John-Albert said, it merely
extends the purposes for which a loan may
be made under the act to include relocating
the premises of the borrower.
My criticism of the bill is not with respect
to what it contains but to what it omits.
In that connection, may I go back to the
act itself, and its introduction and passing last
session. The act passed in December 1960,
with the support of both Opposition and Government in both houses, followed a pattern
or a philosophy of legislation which has been
used on a number of occasions in the past
twenty-five or thirty years. That is a pattern
or philosophy of co-operation between the

Government and private enterprise. It may
be pleasant to contemplate the existence of
some clear line of demarcation between the
realm in which the Government has full
jurisdiction and that in which private enterprise operates. However, experience over the
years has shown that there is a border land.
One might say that sometimes there is quite a
gulf between those two jurisdictions, though
that gulf has been successfully bridged on a
number of occasions by a joint operation between Government and private enterprise.
Perhaps the most striking example of cooperation was in connection with housing. In
the 1930's, the Government desired housing
loans to be made in a field which went beyond
the powers of the normal lending institutions-the life insurance companies and the
other lending institutions-where there was a
need for loans beyond the 60 per cent, which
was then the limited amount of the loan that
an institution could make. It was also desired
to make loans in areas where borrowing was
expensive.
That was the origin of the National Housing
Act and of the Central Mortgage and Housing
Corporation, wherein the facilities of the existing private institutions, life insurance companies and other loan companies and trust
companies were used without requiring a
duplication of Government machinery, and at
the same time Government credit was added
to the credit of the institutions, and Government control was put on to see that the public
interest would be protected. Looking back
over the years, everyone will agree that that
operation has been and undoubtedly will continue to be a great success.
A similar type of combined jurisdiction
was put into effect in connection with home
improvement loans, where the banks and the
Government joined together.
Consequently, when there appeared to be
a need for additional credit for small business,
it was right and proper for the Government
to turn to this pattern which had had a
successful experience and ask the banks to
use their facilities to make loans to borrowers
who qualified, while at the same time the
Government stood behind the loans to a
percentage of the possible losses involved.
That principle was acceptable to all parties
in both houses and was the basis for the legislation then enacted.
I was one of those who felt at the time
that the legislation as introduced was too
confining, too narrow and too restricted. At
the same time, it was legislation which was
new and which did need some testing time.
Consequently, one could not be too dogmatic
in one's criticism. However, the result of
the year shows that those criticisns are valid
and that the act as it now stands is too

MARCH 13, 1962
narrow and too restrictive, and that the
amending legisiation should go further than it
does.
The first particular ground of criticismn is
that the amount of the loan itself is too small.
The maximum loan which can be made is
$25,000. The second criticism. is that the definition of the kind of business which qualifies
for a loan is also too limited. The act is
limited to businesses with a turnover of not

meantime I am, very happy to support the
principie of the bill. It is a good bill, but
it does not go far enough.

Hon. Mr. Croil: Honourabie senators, I have
no objection to second reading of the bill now,
but as I understood the honourabie sponsor
(Hon. Mr. Emerson), he asked permission to
place upon the record what I think hie called
a breakdown table of the number and amounts
ovr$250,000. In my own view, the size of of loans made and other information. That
the loan could quite properly be doubled or wiil appear in the record which will be demore than doubled. Similarly, the size of Livered to us tomorrow. I hope it is not the
turnover could be doubled or trebled. This intention to send this bili to the Standing
would stili leave the act a proper performance Committee on Banking and Commerce before
of the functions of co-operation as between Hansard is available to us tomorrow. If such
is the intention then 1 shailladjourn the deGovernment and lending institutions.

CURLING
CANADIAN CHAMPIONS-TRIBUTE
VICTORIOUS RINK

TO

On the Orders of the Day:

Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called I
wish to draw your attention to the performance of the Saskatchewan Rink in winning the Canadian curling championship at
Kitchener, Ontario, last week. The victorious
rink is a family group made up of Ernie
Richardson and his brother Garnet, and
cousins Arnold and Wes. I understand that it
is the first time in the history of this great
game that a rink with identical personnel has
won the Canadian curling championship three
times. I have boasted about this before; the
Richardson boys are relatives of mine. Their
grandparents came from the county of Pontiac
in the province of Quebec.

East, and the Governing Council of the Salvation Army, Canada West.
He said: Honourable senators, for some reason of which I am quite frankly unaware the
affairs of the Salvation Army in this country
are administered by two separate bodies, one
called the Governing Council of the Salvation Army, Canada East, and the other called
the Governing Council of the Salvation Army,
Canada West. As I say, I do not know the
reason for the distinction but it must have
appealed to the Canadian Parliament in former days, for the first of these organizations,

which I shall refer to in brief as Canada East,
was incorporated by act of Parliament in 1909,
while the second, Canada West, was also incorporated by act of Parliament in 1916.
The Canada East organization carries on
the business of the Salvation Army in all
provinces from Ontario east, while the Canada West organization carries on the business in the provinces from Manitoba to the
west coast. Both these organizations are
joining in a request for the passage of a
bill which I am now attempting to explain.
There are three purposes in the bill. The
first relates solely to Canada East, and its
object is to include in the territory of Canada
East, for the first time, the province of
Newfoundland. I should perhaps say for the
benefit of honourable senators from Newfoundland that the Salvation Army occupies
an important position in that province. I am
instructed that at the moment it has in contemplation capital expenditures there amounting to approximately $10 million, including
$6 million for a general hospital at St. John's.
It is felt that in this connection it will be
an advantage to have Newfoundland included in the territory of Canada East.
The other two objects in which both of
these organizations join, but in respect of
which each is seeking an amendment to its
own particular act, are these. Both, by their
present acts, are severely restricted in their
investment powers to mortgages and bonds,
and that sort of thing, and like so many
semi-public corporations, church bodies, and
so on, they are seeking an extension of those
powers to enable them to invest in a wider
class of securities, including certain common stocks. Therefore, they are asking to
be allowed to invest their funds in such
securities as they deem advisable.

MARCH 13, 1962
The third purpose of the bill is rather
a peculiar one. It has to do with annuities
which these corporations enter into with
individuals. Apparently, they have a practice
under which if an individual will give the
corporation a definite sum of capital and
the corporation undertakes to pay him the
interest on that capital during his lifetime,
the capital then belongs to the corporation
upon his death. For example, a man may
give the corporation of Canada East $10,000
on condition that it pays him $500 a year
until his death, and thereupon the capital
belongs to the corporation. Now, that is, in
a sense, dealing in annuities, and annuities
are, in a sense again, an attribute of insurance. Both corporations by their present acts
are forbidden to enter into the business of
insurance, and they want to make it quite
clear that the dealings they engage in in connection with these annuities are not in contravention of a prohibition to engage in the
business of insurance. So they wish to have
it made clear in this bill that in both cases
they may engage in this business-if you like
to call it an annuity business-in which they
have already engaged. They wish further to
be protected against any illegality, by already
having done this, when there might be a
possibility that it was not strictly within their
corporate powers.
I think everybody is very sympathetie
to the objects of the Salvation Army. The
bill seems to me to be quite innocuous,
and if it should receive second reading I
shall move that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Will the honourable senator permit a question? Does the bill contain
a retroactive clause to cover any of those
transactions which might be considered to be
invalid?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If my honourable
friend looks at section 6, he will see that it
would have a retroactive effect. That section
reads:
There shall not be and shall be deemed
not to have been in the past any limitation of the powers of the Governing
Council of The Salvation Army, Canada
East, or The Governing Council of The

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think so. They have
been doing this in good faith. I think it is
doubtful that they are presently contravening
any prohibition to engage in the business of
insurance, but now that the legislation is
before Parliament, it is wise to make it clear
that they are not-and I am confident that
they are not.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: May I ask the sponsor
of the bill if there are any restrictions at all
on the investment of these moneys? I mean
to say, the corporation seeks an extension of
its powers to enable it to invest, for instance,
in certain common stocks; but can it invest
the whole amount in common stocks if it so
desires?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Or else in mortgages.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, that is so.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I move that the bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, may I say first that it seems to me that
the Superintendent of Insurance should be
notified to be present when this bill is discussed in committee. The idea of making a
retroactive enactment of this kind is most
unusual, and before I would ever consent to
the passing of such a clause as this I would
require time to think very carefully as to
what its implications might be. May I suggest, therefore, before the motion is passed
upon, that it be specified that the Superintendent of Insurance be asked to be present
when the bill is considered in committee, and
that he be given a copy of the bill for study
prior to his appearance.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am obliged to my
honourable friend for his suggestion, which
I think is a most valuable one.
Hon. Salier A. Hayden: Honourable senators, with greatest good will towards this
organization, I am, like the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. RoeSalvation Army, Canada West.... to re- buck), a little concerned. We are in effect

him to make some study of the course of the
proceedings in the investment of money, so
that we may know that we are not going too
far afield in what we are validating by this
proposed section of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Croll: May I point out that if
we do what this bill asks, we shall merely be
doing what we did last week with another
bill.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Quite correct.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I do not know the length
of time over which validation was asked in
that bill.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: About nine months.
Hon. Mr. Croll: When we passed the other
bill we authorized certain restrictive provisions.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Probably
the honourable gentleman remembers the low
rate of interest charged in that bill.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I do not think that is a
proper description of the bill, but in the
circumstances we felt it was advisable. We
are not setting any precedent if we do what
the sponsor of this bill requests.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Surely the Salvation Army
is entitled to as good treatment as any other
organization.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
I made my suggestion to my honourable
friend from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
with the utmost good will towards this
organization.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think it is perfectly
clear, honourable senators, that when we give

second reading to a private bill it does not
necessarily mean we are accepting it in
principle; our immediate purpose in giving it
second reading is to enable it to be referred
to a standing committee for consideration and
study. It is quite unlike a public bill. I am
grateful to honourable senators who have
made suggestions and offered criticism, because it will enable the sponsors to realize
what they will have to face when they appear
before the standing committee. I have not
seen the sponsors of the bill, for I have had
to take over the handling of it on short
notice.
I only repeat that I am grateful that
honourable senators have voiced criticisms,
and I think the sponsors will be prepared
to meet and answer those criticisms when the
bill is in committee.
Motion agreed to.

On the motion to adjourn:
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, before we adjourn may I call to your
attention that we have a distinguished
visitor in the gallery in the person of Senator
Hubert H. Humphrey, from Minnesota. He
might have been President of the United
States, and he still has a chance, for he is
young and very eloquent.
We are glad to greet you, Senator

in Canada and the United States. The fifth
session was held in Washington in June 1961.
The United States delegates were welcomed
at the opening plenary session on Thursday,
March 1 by the Prime Minister of Canada,
the Right Honourable John G. Diefenbaker.
Committee meetings were held on both days.
One Committee discussed defence and foreign
policy matters of mutual interest and the
other discussed economic and boundary matters of concern to both countries. The agreed
summary reports of the two committees which
were approved at the final plenary session
today are attached.
Members of both delegations and their
wives are scheduled to leave Ottawa on Saturday morning for Montreal where they will
visit the RCAF Air Defence Command Headquarters and attend a reception given in their
honour by His Worship the Mayor and Mrs.
Drapeau. While in Montreal the co-chairmen
will visit the City Hall to sign the Golden
Book. In the evening the members and their
wives will attend a national league hockey
game. Both delegations will return to their
respective. capitals on Sunday.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON DEFENCE
AND FOREIGN POLICY

SENATE
Disarmament
The committee, noting that renewed disarmament negotiations are to begin in Geneva
on March 14, expressed the hope that these
would result in some progress. It also considered that there were some grounds for
restrained optimism in this regard. The committee agreed that initially a good basis for
the conference's work exists in the agreed
statement of principles and that the participation of foreign ministers would be appropriate
to lend additional guidance to the opening
phase of the negotiations.
The question of United States resumption
of nuclear testing was also discussed. The
United States members pointed out any resumption would be undertaken reluctantly
and in full awareness of the impact that this
would have on public opinion even though
devices tested would be held to the minimum
in point of number and size. On the other
hand, the progress which the Soviet Union
has made in the field of nuclear armaments
as evidenced by their series of tests last fall
might leave the United States no alternative
but to resume testing.

and all western countries would serve to
counter the communist threat. The Canadian
delegation recalled that Canada has long since
terminated any exports to Cuba of arms, and
is rigidly controlling other exports to Cuba and
is preventing any re-export of United States
goods through Canada. This is a similar policy
to that which was recently approved by OAS
at Punta del Este.
The committee agreed that the policies of
both Canada and the United States must be
developed in the light of each country's longrange plans to counter the communist threat.

United Nations Bond Issue
The committee was unanimous in its support
of the United Nations at this difficult juncture
in its history. In this connection the committee
discussed the method and extent of meeting
the United Nations' financial obligations arising principally from its efforts to establish
peace and security in the Congo. The committee discussed and explored the United Nations'
proposal to help meet these obligations through
the sale of bonds. The failure of many members to meet their assessments has created a
financial crisis.

MARCH 13, 1962
The Canadian delegation emphasized the
significance of traditional commonwealth trade
links, including especially free entry into the
United Kingdom market and the exchange of
preferences. The committee clearly recognized throughout the discussions that it was
for the United Kingdom alone to make a decision whether to join the European Common
Market.
It was agreed that Canada and the United
States have many common points of view and
of interest and that, consequently, in any
negotiations and measures undertaken or contemplated by either, this community of interest should be borne in mind.
Columbia River
The Canadian delegation outlined the present situation in Canada with regard to the
treaty and pointed out that delay of Canadian
ratification was related to differences between
the federal Government and the Government
of British Columbia. The Canadian delegation
noted that it still remains the policy of the
Canadian Government to ratify the treaty as
soon as possible.
The United States delegation observed that
the United States had ratified the treaty and
expressed the hope for early ratification by
Canada. The United States delegation made
reference to the urgent needs of the Pacific
northwest for power which would require
early decisions to be taken on alternative
sources of power.
The Richelieu Champlain Waterway
The committee took up the question of the
Richelieu River-Lake Champlain Waterway.
Such a waterway would cover a route of about
400 miles. It would reduce the water distance
between Montreal and New York City by
1,200 miles, and between New York City and
Great Lakes ports by a comparable distance.
The United States delegation outlined the
history of this proposal, observing that this
has been a water route since the earliest days
of North America. The United States delegation also noted significant increases in cargo in
past years on Lake Champlain, and pointed
out that development of the waterway would
provide considerably greater access to the St.
Lawrence Seaway.
It was noted that both governments have
proposed a joint submission of the question to
the International Joint Commission.
The committee welcomed the report that
this matter will be referred to the International Joint Commission and expressed the
view that the International Joint Commission
should begin a study and submit its recommendations as quickly as possible.
Lumber Trade
The United States delegation noted that recent United States housing legislation has had

the effect of increasing the market for lumber
in the United States and resulted in the increasing importation of Canadian lumber. As
a result the domestic market for United States
lumber has been affected. United States shipping legislation (the Jones Act) also has had
the effect of raising the cost of shipping
United States lumber from the Pacific northwest to the eastern seaboard.
There was a frank discussion of the problem
outlined by the United States delegation and of
the measures which might be taken to alleviate them.
It was apparent that the Canadian lumber
industry was not free from problems of competition as well.
Point Roberts
The Canadian delegation outlined the situation that exists at Point Roberts, Whatcom
County, Washington, a peninsula crossed by
the International Boundary (the 49th Parallel)
isolating the point from the State of Washington. The region is accessible only through
Canadian territory or by the sea and both
countries maintain border crossing points. The
area comprises some 5 or 6 square miles and
has a permanent population of some 200
people. Point Roberts is a popular residence
for Canadians but difficulties are experienced
because of the United States immigration
regulations.
United States residents of Whatcom County
recently urged the relaxation of United States
immigration regulations so as to allow of
easier entry by Canadian citizens, particularly
those seeking to make the area their permanent residence, by obviating the necessity of
their becoming United States citizens.
The United States delegation pointed out
that the highway between Haines and Whitehorse passes through a section of the Yukon
Territory making it necessary for people
using the road to pass through two separate
customs and immigration points.
The committee expressed sympathy for any
arrangements which would provide for a
satisfactory solution of such problems on
the border.
Canada-United States Bilateral Air Agreement
The Canadian delegation drew the committee's attention to delays experienced in
continuing discussions with the United States
on Canadian-United States air transport relations and pointed out that as a result the
Canadian authorities were unable to proceed
with current studies of regional air traffic
requirements in Canada.
The committee agreed that it would wel.
come an early resumption of negotiations on
the Bilateral Air Agreement.

The Senate met at 3 p.m., the Speaker in
the Chair.
Prayers.
THE LATE SENATOR HARDY
TRIBUTES

Hon. Walter M. Aseltine: Honourable senators, yesterday quite a number of members
of this chamber spoke with profound and
heartfelt sincerity of the late Senator Cairine
Wilson. Today we are met in sorrow to pay
tribute to the memory of another distinguished
senator, now deceased. I am sure we were all
distressed and shocked to hear over the radio
early this morning of the death of Senator
Arthur Hardy of Brockville. I knew Senator
Hardy quite intimately for over twenty-five
years, and regret that he is no longer to be
with us.
It would appear that Father Time, as usual,
is rapidly reforming the Senate-if that is
the proper term to use in these circumstances.
There are now ten vacancies in the Senate,
which no doubt will be filled in due course,
thus bringing in ten fresh viewpoints. It
hardly seems possible that Senator Horner
and I are now No. 2 and No. 3 respectively in
the Senate seniority list, followed by Senator
Farris and Senator Hugessen, who are No. 4
and No. 5, respectively.
Senator Hardy was a very dear friend of
mine from the first day I entered the Senate
chamber. As a young senator, I received much
valuable advice from him. Both of us being
lawyers and agriculturalists, we had much in
common. We had many talks on agriculture,
particularly the breeding of thoroughbred
cattle, about which he was a great expert.
Senator Hardy was Speaker of the Senate
in 1930 and was made a Privy Councillor the
same year. He held many important political
positions, notably that of president of the
Ontario Liberal Association from 1919 to
1932. He also had extensive business connections and belonged to a number of social organizations, too numerous to mention. He
lived a full, and I am sure all senators will
agree, a very happy and useful life.
We have lost another fine Canadian gentleman, and to his surviving children and other
relatives we extend our most sincere sympathy.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, as the Leader of the Government has
said, last night at about the time we were

paying tribute to the memory of our deceased
colleague Senator Wilson, there passed away
at Brockville another highly respected member, Senator Arthur C. Hardy, whose death
we mourn today.
Senator Hardy lived a long, interesting and
useful life. He lived to see his father become
Premier of the province of Ontario, while
he himself steeped in Liberal doctrine and
faithful to the cause, went on to contest a
more or less hopeless election in 1917 in the
county of Leeds against Sir Thomas White,
the then Minister of Finance. Our late colleague was unsuccessful but not dismayed.
He assumed the presidency of the Ontario
Liberal association, and during the victorious
campaign of 1921 he was one of the late
Mackenzie King's staunchest supporters.
I shall not repeat what the Leader of the
Government has so eloquently and fully told
of Senator Hardy's life-work and accomplishments in the Senate, except to say that he
was the dean of the Senate and at the time
of his passing was its second-ranking Privy
Councillor.
Senator Hardy was born in my home city
of Brantford, and although he left there over
sixty years ago he is always remembered
with esteem and affection by those who were
personally associated with him and those of
us who grew up in an era when the name
"Hardy" was highly revered in that city and
surrounding district. On the other hand, he
had not forgotten his home city, and he
followed our activities and growth there with
much satisfaction.
Recently, the town of Brockville selected
him as the citizen of the year, and in Brantford we rejoiced in this honour which had
come to one of our native sons.
Senator Hardy's father in the Legislature
of Ontario represented the constituency of
Brant, and I have always considered it a
privilege to have followed in his footsteps
and to have represented in the federal Parliament practically the same constituency.
Senator Hardy's kindness to me during my
early uphill election contests has never been
forgotten by me; and my success in the early
years of my political career I have always
attributed in no small measure to his help
and his never-failing encouragement.
I saw Senator Hardy about a month ago
at his home, and I can assure you that his
interest in the work of the Senate continued
to be just as intense as it was when he was
daily in his place in this chamber. He followed the debates in the House of Commons
and he read every word in the Senate Hansard; he was just as familiar with everything
which took place in the Senate as those of us
who were daily in attendance.

MARCH 14, 1962
Although at that time he was in his ninetieth year, bis mind was as keen and his
movements were as active as those of a much
younger man.
Senator Hardy was indeed remarkable. I
join with the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) in extending deep sympathy to his son and daughter and to al
those who were near and dear to him.
Hon. A. B. Baird: Honourable senators, it
is not without deep emotion that I rise today
to pay homage to a very dear friend, Senator
Hardy.
Since I became a member of the Senate in
1949, nearly thirteen years ago, I shared the
same room with him in this building, and the
cordiality of his welcome could never be
forgotten. He was a delightful personality,
and he had a highly cultivated mind.
As previously mentioned, he was Speaker
in this chamber in 1930. Only in the past
few years did he take a less active part in
the debates. He was extremely loyal to the
Senate, and in spite of his failing health he
never missed reading Hansard.
In Senator Hardy's passing we lose a colleague beloved by all. He will long remain in
our memories. I join with other honourable
senators in extending heartfelt and sincere
sympathy to his family.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I find it impossible to add anything
material to what has been said in the eloquent addresses of the honourable Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) and of my honourable friend who
has just preceded me (Hon. Mr. Baird).
I knew Senator Hardy for at least forty
years. I met him first in a political way, when
he was President of the Ontario Liberal
Association, long before the election of 1921,
and since that time I knew him rather closely.
I look back with some satisfaction on the
fact that in 1934 when I became Attorney
General of the province of Ontario one of
my first recommendations was the appointment of Senator Hardy to the office of King's
Counsel.
I knew Senator Hardy intimately during
the years that followed. It was only a few
weeks ago that I received a letter from him
in which he expressed his regret that he
could not take part in the routine of debates
in this chamber. In previous years he was
very active in this chamber, but his health
became such that he could not physically
stand the effort of debate, but, as has already
been said, no one was more familiar than he
with what was going on in this body. He
not only knew what was taking place in
Parliament, but he had real thought about it.
He was steeped in the principles of freedon

and liberalism, and he had a broadminded
view of people, of events, and of constitutional
law.
He had a fine mind, a high purpose, and
he was a lovable gentleman. He often wrote
me, and his letters contained reminiscences,
advice, and comment upon the passing events.
In his last letter he expressed his regret at
not being able to join in our routine debates.
I replied to the effect that one of his letters
was much more valuable than any speech
could be. That was the last communication
that passed between us.
I regret very much indeed his passing, but
I suppose that is in the course of nature. He
had a long, useful and happy life, and the
only ones with whom we sympathize now are
ourselves and the family he leaves behind.
To them I tender my deepest sympathy.
Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourable
senators, I would like to add a word of tribute
to the late Senator Hardy. When I came first
to the Senate, and for some years, I had the
great privilege of sharing a room with him
and the late Senator Euler-the room now
occupied by Senator Baird-and it was from
these two Ontario Liberals that I received my
education in federal politics. The friendship
that was established during those years has
remained, for I always had the deepest admiration for Senator Hardy.
As Senator Baird has said, the late Senator
Hardy had a cultivated mind and a wide grasp
of political aff airs all across Canada. He was
a delightful person and I fondly recollect the
enjoyable conversations I had with him.
Last summer when I called on him at his
home in Brockville he was alone and seemed
depressed. He talked about the Senate, in
which he took such a lively interest. He said
he always followed our debates as reported
in Senate Hansard, and he advised me as to
the course of action I should take in certain
issues that were then before this house. Before I left him he said, "I am very lonely.
All of my friends have gone. If I wanted to
give a dinner party here in Brockville I would
have to dig up the cemetery." So, as Senator
Roebuck has said, perhaps the only people
who need sympathy are ourselves and his
family, for in the last few years Senator
Hardy has had a rather sad time because of
illnesses which overtook him.
My associations with Senator Hardy will
always remain a bright spot in my memory,
and I believe that Canadian public life has
benefited widely from men of his character.
The Hon. the Speaker: I would ask honourable senators to stand at your places for a
few moments of silent prayer as a final tribute
to our late colleague.
Honourable senators stood in silence.

OTTAWA STREETS
SNOW

REMOVAL

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
¯I would like to draw attention to a matter that
I think is of some importance to the good
name of honourable senators and the members of the other house. A dispatch in the
Ottawa Citizen of a few days ago referred
critically to statements made by various members of the other place and our Leader in this
chamber. I certainly do not think the remarks,
being complaints as to the condition of
Ottawa streets and the clearing of snow, were
justified.
Anyone who has had any experience in
local and municipal government must have
some idea of the difficult problem that faces
a city in this climate, with heavy snowfalls
during the course of the winter.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: Did you say I made
some such statement?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes. You are quoted in
the newspaper as saying that there were snow
dumps all over the city, resembling garbage
dumps.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I never made any such
statement.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Well, the Citizen quotes
you as having said so. I just could not believe
that you were quoted correctly.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: It is incorrect.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I am glad to know that,
because I was somewhat concerned about it.
In the other place there has been much
sniping and complaining about the potholes
in the Ottawa streets, and exaggerations as to
their size. Anyone familiar with subsoil conditions knows that this beautiful city of
Ottawa is built on the finest soil in Canada,

and that the frost affects the subsoil. As long
as that condition exists these spring repairs
are going to have to be made-unless, of
course, we build streets the way the Romans
did, with slave labour.
So far as I am concerned I have not yet
lost that boyish delight of walking in the
snow, and I may say that I like walking in
water. The only desire that I have perhaps
lost is that of going into water deep enough
to go over the top of my rubbers.
I have known something of the municipal
government of the city of Ottawa for a
period of fifty-five years, and I believe that
the people of this city have had splendid
administration of their affairs. We, the members of Parliament, are here as guests, and
I may say that I have always found this to
be a most friendly city. I live on Hinton
Avenue, three miles from the centre of town,
and there the streets are plowed. I thought
the city was going to considerable expense
to do so, because I was the only one walking.
The plow was drawn by a big ton horse that
could easily push the snow off the sidewalk.
Judging by the way that job was donc, my
advice to the city council is to get back to
using about twenty or so of these big horses
to pull sidewalk scrapers where there is no
room for a tractor scraper. I have watched
tractors at work, and where there is any upgrade at all, when the snow is wet, they can
scarcely propel themselves.
As for myself, I have no complaints about
the way things are handled in Ottawa. I think
it is a friendly and wonderful city, and I
deplore any member in either chamber
criticizing the city administration for the little
bit of water or snow that collects on the
streets. I might say that there are places in
the world where there is neither rain nor
snow, and people who cannot put up with
these minor inconveniences should go there.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I do hope the mayor of
Ottawa hears of this.

MARCH 14, 1962
FARM IMPROVEMENT LOANS ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND

READING

Hon. Arthur M. Pearson moved the second
reading of Bill C-73, to amend the Farm Improvement Loans Act.
He said: Honourable senators, Bill C-73
provides an amendment to the Farm Improvement Loans Act, which comes up periodically
for extension. As honourable senators will
remember, the act originated in 1944-45, and
every three years since that time it has been
renewed for a further period of three years.
The present amendments would extend the
time from July 1, 1962 to June 30, 1965, and
provide that the aggregate principal amount
of the guaranteed farm improvement loans
shall be $400 million. Honourable senators
will remember that in 1959 the Farm Improvement Loans Act guaranteed a sum of
$300 million, but, since the indications are
that on the average there will be increased
numbers of loans and greater amounts borrowed by the farmers, it is felt that the
guaranteed amount should be $400 million.
Actually, the Government guarantees the
banks to the extent of 10 per cent of the
loan granted by the bank to the individual
farmer. The maximum amount that a farmer
could borrow was increased in 1959 to $7,500,
and it is now felt that that amount will be
ample for these intermediate term loans.
As you will note by referring to clause 2
of the bill, the total amount of loans shall be
$400 million, which means the aggregate
amount of principal which all banks in
Canada can lend. This $400 million is the
limit. Paragraph (f) has been added to restrict
the time to June 30, 1965 as the last day upon
which the Minister of Finance will be responsible for a guaranteed loan.
One reason why this bill comes before the
house at this time, and why it is felt necessary to have such measures end every three
years, is to permit the Minister of Finance to
review the situation, and, if he deems it necessary, to increase the amount of loan for
which a farmer may apply. This may be
given consideration at that time. Also the
amount of the guaranteed money may be
taken into consideration, just as we are asked
to do today.
The annual report by the department governing the Farm Improvement Loans Act has
not been prepared yet, but I have some figures which might be of some interest to
honourable senators.
The total loans granted from January 1,
1960 to December 31, 1960 numbered 68,000,
and the amount in that one year was
$101,855,746. From January 1, 1961 to December 31, 1961 the total number of loans
was 70,615, being roughly 2,600 more in that
year. The amount of money loaned was

$108,147,164. The average size of the loans
has increased from $1,497 in 1960, to $1,531
in 1961. The purchase of agricultural implements absorbed most of the loans, being
some 50,400 in 1961, for a total of $76.5
million. This is down somewhat from 1960,
when there were roughly 53,000 loans made
for implements, for an amount of nearly
$80 million. More loans, however, were made
in 1961 covering farm buildings, livestock and
other items, being a total of 20,200 loans,
as against 15,200 in 1960. The total for these
items, farm buildings, livestock and other
loans in 1960 amounted to $22 million, as
against $31,600,000 in 1961.
All provinces showed a larger number
of loans made, except Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island. Also the total
in dollars shows a similar trend for all provinces, except for Saskatchewan, Manitoba
and Prince Edward Island. I would judge
that the problem in Saskatchewan and Manitoba-and this is my personal opinionwas the drought of 1961, which caused many
farmers to cancel orders for machinery, and
the banks became a little wary of advancing
money under the difficult conditions the farmers experienced.
There were some requests made to have
the amount of $7,500 increased to $10,000
per farmer. From my own point of view,
I might say that $7,500 is a reasonable figure,
because in most cases a farmer is buying
only one additional piece of machinery and
generally he has some machinery to trade
in. If he is buying a $10,000 combine he
usually has an equity of about $3,000 or
$3,500 in the machine he is trading in, unless
it is very old. So that if he gets a loan
of $7,500, plus the $3,000, he can easily
buy his $10,000 machine. If he needs $10,000
as a young man just starting up, with no
assets in the form of a trade-in, he would
be much better advised to apply for a longterm loan under the Farm Credit Corporation with up to 20 or 25 years for repayment,
rather than work under this intermediate
loan arrangement which would only give
him some three to five years.
Honourable senators, if this bill is given
second reading today, I shall move that it
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Austin C. Taylor: Honourable senators, I rise only to express my satisfaction,
in general, in relation to the bill that is now
before us. I shall probably repeat some of
what has already been said by the sponsor
of the bill, the honourable senator from
Lumsden, (Hon. Mr. Pearson), but in order
to review the whole situation in relation to

SENATE
the application of the act I should like to
furnish a little more detailed information
regarding it.
I support the bill in principle; I think it is
a good bill. It amends another good piece of
Liberal legislation, which was passed in
1944.
Like all other legislation, no bill ever introduced or passed in Parliament is perfect.
No matter how satisfactory a piece of legislation may be, amendments are required from
time to time. This is one of the good amendments which the Government has seen fit
to make and I heartily support it in so far
as its general principles are concerned.
It is also well that we should remind ourselves of the ideals and principles back of
the thinking when this act was passed originally, some of which I should like to repeat.
One ideal was the improvement of Canadian
farms by enabling the farmer to equip his
farm with modern labour-saving equipment,
to procure more and better livestock, and to
make a variety of other improvements which
would serve to increase productivity on the
farm. Secondly, there was the idea of improving living conditions on the farm, through
plans which would enable the farmer to provide electrification, refrigeration, heating
and water systems, and other improvements
to reduce the work, particularly in the case
of farm women. Thirdly, it was sought to
provide credit on a sound basis, but at the
same time under terms and conditions suitable to the individual farmer's resources.
It cannot be denied that the principles I
have outlined have been carried through to
a very marked degree during the period in
which this legislation has been operative.
According to the annual report to which the
honourable senator from Lumsden (Hon. Mr.
Pearson) referred, there was a gradual increase in the number of applications up to
1952 or 1953. In 1952 there were 83,315
loans, making a total of $98,260,000. In 1953
there were 83,962 loans, for a total amount
of $98 million. Following this period and up
to 1958 there was a gradual decrease in the
amount of the loans made. The number of
loans has been reasonably constant since that
time, at around 70,000 per year, for a total
amount loaned in each of the years in the
vicinity of $100 million. The total amount of
loans made under the legislation from 1945
to 1961, as has been stated, amounted to approximately $1,122,000,000. It is also interesting to note the loss ratio, which is approximately one-tenth of one per cent. This, in my
opinion, constitutes a very fine record.
In the period March 1, 1945 to February
28, 1948 the percentage of repayment of loans
was 99.99; from March 1, 1948 to February
28, 1951, it was 99.92, from March 1, 1951 to

March 31, 1953 it was 99.74; from April 1,
1953 to March 31, 1956 it was 98.91; and from
April 1, 1956 to March 31, 1959 it was 85.
I would like to point out that while the
repayments of the loans, calculated on a percentage basis, were reduced during that period
ending March 31, 1959, some of the loans made
during that period are still repayable and will
not be repaid completely for some years to
come.
As I have stated already, no legislation is
perfect in its original form, and the Farm Improvement Loans Act is no exception. To
indicate the improvements made in it from
time to time, I need only refer to the fact
that under the original act the maximum
individual loan which could be granted was
only $3,000 and the total amount which could
be loaned under the legislation at that time
was $250 million. Under the Revised Statutes
of 1952, no change was made in the maximum
loan to the individual but the total amount
which could be loaned during the period was
reduced from $250 million to $200 million. I
presume that this reduction was due to the
fact that during the years from 1945-the
inception of the act and its coming into
operation-until 1952, the average amount
loaned per annum was in the vicinity of $38
million.
During the session of 1953 an amendment
was passed raising the maximum individual
loan from $3,000 to $4,000, and providing for
a total amount of $300 million which could be
loaned during that three-year period.
In 1956 there was another amendment
which increased the maximum loan per individual from $4,000 to $5,000.
In 1959, as all honourable senators will
recall, there was a general revision of the
act. The maximum amount which could be
loaned to any one farmer was increased to
$7,500, but the amount which could be loaned
under the act remained at $300 million. There
was also a revision in the definition section of
the act, to provide for the inclusion of beekeeping as a form of farm operations. The
definition also included stock and equipment
for the keeping of bees.
Another important amendment provided for
the inclusion of poultry in the definition of
livestock. I think all honourable senators are
aware of the fact that the poultry industry
today is pretty largely centred in large operations which require a good deal of financing.
These were all necessary amendments in regard to present-day farming operations.
The next revision of the act took place last
year, 1961. The total amount which could be>
borrowed by any individual remained at
$7,500 but the maximum which could be

MARCH 14, 1982
loaned during the period provided by the act
was increased from $300 million to $400
million.
As the sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr.
Pearson) has already indicated, the term of
the act expires at the end of every three
years. The principle is a good one, since it
gives the Government and Parliament an
opportunity to review what has taken place
during the previous three-year period, and
to introduce suitable amendments wherever
they may be necessary in order to carry out
the intent of the original act. As I have said,
that is exactly what is happening under this
present amendment.
Honourable senators, I have two suggestions
to make and I make them honestly and sincerely, in the firm belief that they would
result in an improvement to the present law.
The honourable senator from Lumsden has
stated already that he believes $7,500 as a
maximum loan is sufficiently high. It is true
that during recent years the average loan has
amounted to only $1,500. However, the fact
remains that over the years there may be
among the thousands of applicants some two
or three or more who seek a larger loan. I
appreciate the suggestion which has been
made, that if an application should exceed
$7,500 it could come under the Farm Credit
Corporation. However, it seems to me that
the purposes of this act, as outlined in the
review I have given, should not be confused
with the purpose of the Farm Credit Corporation. As I understand it, the Farm Credit
Act provides for a larger program of farm
development and for the purchase of farms
by individuals. The measure now before us
is for the individual who owns a farm but
who wants to improve his equipment and his
machinery.
I think I can point out one or two of the
reasons for the large amount of money that
the honourable senator mentioned was spent
last year. Out of $101 million, almost $80 million was required for the purchase of
machinery and equipment, necessitated by an
increase in mechanization and a loss of farm
help, and also by efforts on the part of
farmers to combat the cost-price squeeze.
I would like to suggest that even if there
are no applications for a $10,000 loan, or
only one application, I would like to see
provision for it in the bill. The fact that the
authority is there does not necessarily mean
that the board will have to grant a loan
of $10,000. If such an application is made
and the board feels that the applicant is not
worthy of it, then it does not have to grant
it.
In this respect I know something of what
I am talking about because I was charged

with the administration of the Farm Settlement Board in my own province for some 17
years. I know that we increased the amount
that could be borrowed under that arrangement from $3,000 to $10,000, but there were
very few loans made of large amounts. As a
matter of fact, I think for the first two or
three years there were no such loans granted,
but occasionally there was an individual who
wanted that amount of credit and we were
able to give it to him. It is for that reason
that I would like to see such a provision in
this bill.
My other suggestion is that the administration of the act, as is the case with respect to
the Farm Credit Corporation, should be placed
under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Agriculture rather than the Minister of Finance.
I think all honourable senators will agree
with me that in dealing with farm operations,
knowledge of the conditions that farmers are
living under and something about their costs,
and working with them day in and day out
for 365 days a year, puts the Department of
Agriculture in a better position to analyse
applications and grant loans to farmers who
are in need of them.
Therefore, my two suggestions are, first,
that the maximum amount of loan be increased from $7,500 to $10,000 and, second,
that the administration of the act should be
under the Minister of Agriculture.
To further emphasize the need for farm
credit, honourable senators, I will mention
that only this morning I received a telegram
from my own province which indicated that
a three-furrow plow with tractor, which ten
years ago cost $1,800, now costs $3,000 or
almost twice as much. A manure spreader,
which ten years ago cost $425, now costs
$580. That is one of the reasons why the maximum amount of loans should be increased.
I think we all recognize the fact that farmers today are still caught in a cost-price
squeeze. I do not know too much about
western agriculture, but I do know that western farmers need more credit now than ever
before in their history, especially by reason
of the drought conditions there during the
past year. The fact that this Parliament has
recently voted some $40 million to enable the
western grain growers of Canada to carry on
a program this year points this up.
I hope that my remarks have served to emphasize some of the conditions existing on the
farms of Canada today. It is for these reasons,
honourable senators, that I support the bill.
I trust that the honourable Leader of the
Government in this house (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
will give consideration to the recommendations I have made before the bill goes before
the committee. However, I say in closing that

Hon. Calveri C. Pratt: Honourable senators,
I should like ta speak for a few minutes on
the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act. 1 would
say that the inadequacy of it and the littie use
that has been made af it would justify the
removal of the word "Improvement" from the

It has been afficially announced that the

for in the Farm Improvement Loans Act.

SENATE
assistance runs into a lot of money. The federal
Government, in conjunction with the provincial governments and industry itself, should
take more progressive action than has been
taken in relation to our fisheries.
As far as the province of Newfoundland
is concerned, the application of this act has
been practically non-existent. During the
period from 1955 to 1961 only ten loans were
made within the province, aggregating $11,753.
Seeing that the announced purpose of this
act is to enable fishermen to acquire vessels
and modernize their operations, the fund itself
has in effect been non-existent in Newfoundland. I understand also that in the province
of Nova Scotia in 1961 there were loans to
the amount of only about $21,000.
The fishing industry throughout the world
has been undergoing industrial development,
keeping pace with scientific and technological
development of industry generally. As far as
my province in particular is concerned-and
I have not an intimate knowledge of the other
provinces in this connection-except for the
introduction of freezing plants, there has been
very little change throughout the years. The
value of the fishery products is about $30
million a year, but there are over 15,000
fishermen and more than 20,000 people employed at the fisheries, both on the sea and
on the land in this industry in Newfoundland.
During the past year there was a decline
of 15 per cent in the quantity of ground fish
caught. In part, of course, that was because
of fewer fish being available in certain areas,
but it was also because the methods of
catching were not kept up-to-date. That situation is fully emphasized when we realize the
tremendous increase in the fishery production
in the Atlantic waters off the east coast of
Canada by vessels from so many countries of
the world.
Foreign fishing in the northwest Atlantic
waters, primarily over the Grand Banks and
adjacent fishing areas, has undergone tremendous development. The most recent figures
I have seen which apply to 1959 or 1960 deepsea fishing operations show that Canada had
211 fishing vessels with a total of about 27,000
tons. These are comparatively small boats.
Portugal had 72 vessels totalling over 70,000
tons; Germany had 80 vessels with a total
of 53,000 tons; and other countries such as
Spain, Iceland and France have had large
numbers.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: What were the figures
for Portugal?
Hon. Mr. Prait: Seventy-two vessels with
a tonnage of 70,000. I have not the figures for
all countries. There are some British vessels,
but not very many. I would remind you that
I am referring only to the vessels operating
in the northwest Atlantic waters.

The operations of greatest significance over
the whole area originate in Russia. Russia's
fishing fleet was 111 vessels, with a total of
126,000 tons, or roughly five times the tonnage
of Canadian vessels.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: May I be allowed to intervene? Do you mean to say that Russia and all
these foreign nations are allowed to fish in
Newfoundland waters?
Hon. Mr. Prait: No. I am referring to the
waters in the area of the Grand Banks, and
the adjacent fishing areas, which, of course,
are international waters.
It is understood that during the past year
the Russian boats fishing in the North Atlantic waters increased considerably in number
as well as in tonnage. The amount of fish
caught by foreign boats in waters adjacent
to Newfoundland and Nova Scotia exceeds
many times the quantity taken in the ocean
fishing of the Atlantic provinces. Some of
these foreign operations are serviced not only
by modern fishing boats entirely beyond anything we have been able to visualize in Canada, but also by factory boats and even hospital and welfare ships attached to the fleets.
This shows the importance these countries
abroad are placing on the possibilities of the
fisheries in waters adjacent to our coast.
We hear a great deal of what is being done
in reference to fishery relief measures, which
are necessary for people in the industry.
What we want is something more constructive than relief measures which, although
necessary, do not create industry. It is the
creation of modern industry in this field that
is very important, in order that people may
earn a livelihood.
The fishing industry in the province of Newfoundland, in order to be prosperous, has to
be primarily dependent upon large quantities
of the lower priced types of fish, such as cod,
haddock and other ground fish. The fish of
the luxury type, such as lobster, salmon and
so forth are not as plentiful in our area. While
we have measures of assistance in various
forms, we are entirely lacking in a progressive policy. That definitely is a matter of national responsibility. We have not had such a
policy tied in with improved fishing facilities, which includes larger and more efficient
boats, more modern methods of catching, as
well as improved processing and consumer
packaging.
Newfoundland has an outstanding advantage in that it is close to the most abundant
and concentrated supply of fish such as cod,
flounders and so forth in the world, and this
is the reason that boats come thousands of
miles to fish in our waters. It is deplorable

MARCH 14. 1962
that there has been so littie modemn development in the catching and processing of fish
caught right at our doorstep.
A great deal of pessimisrn has often been
expressed by persons in authority with regard
to the fisheries in Newfoundland. The attitude
of good will exhibited by visiting officiais
seerns to be cloaked with a reservation that
the fisheries have to remain ini a static condition, and one cannot expect great advances
in the industry. We hear that in connection
with the sait flsh trade particularly. Despite
the trernendous extension of world trade in
that product, it has to be changed in its
forrn and made more acceptable to the changing consumer trade in the markets of the
world.
Also we very often hear it said that the
fishing industry caters to people of lower incornes living in the West Indies, South
America and Europe. That is flot altogether
correct, even when applied to saited fish.
It is true, however, that the product is more
acceptable to people in the West Indies, South
America and certain European countries than
it is to people in the United States and other
highly industrialized countries. Although
there bas been a trernendous expansion i
the earning power of our custorners i al
countries, their taste for this product has not
been lost, and they wii not; lose it if the
product is put up in an acceptable manner
which, unfortunateiy, is not being done at the
present time.
There is only one way that we can shape
up the whole fishing industry and keep it in
lime with the advancing trends of world commerce, and that is to have a progressive policy
set forth which, without denying the need for
relief on occasions, calis for constant thought
and action in the creation of advancing industry. Too littie thought bas been given to
the building-up processes. With regard to the
Fisheries Improvernent Loans Act now before us, I say it has had no value whatever
in the progress of our industry. The operation
of the act is so inconsecjuential with regard
to Newfoundland that, to tell you the truth,
the bill itself is hardly worth debating.
Han. John J. Kinley: Honourabie senators,
I have listened with pleasure to, the speeches
made by my two honourable friends from
Newfoundiand titis afternoon. They are qualilied, both by experience and by education,
to taik about this subject, for they live among
fishermen, and in close proximity to the finest fishing banks in the world. We therefore
must listen to thern with considerable interest
because we know that flshing is one of their
principal industries.
The Bill C-74, which is now before us,
is for the purpose of arnending a statute

already on our books. I listened with interest to the honourable senator from St. John's
East (Hon. Mr. Higgins) who explained the
bill, and I mnust say he gave a splendid explanation. The Fisheries Improvement Loans;
Act which titis bill seeks to amend was originaiiy enacted and assented to on the llthday of July, 1955. As my honourable friend,
said, this is a bill to arnend an act which
was introduced by a former government.
Since the inception of the legisiation we have
only done a littie to amend it fromn tirne to
tirne, and we must ail take the responsibiiitit
as well as the credit for it being on the statute.
books.
The act was amended in 1959 to extend its
provisions somewhat, and to make a minorchange in the definition as to who could be.
classed as a "'fisherman". I think I shoulcl
add to what rny honourable friend said, that
it opened up the way for others to corne in.
However, I think that that is limited a bit
by one phrase in the act, wherein it says
that a fisherman is a person whose principal
occupation is participation in a prirnary flshing enterprise. Honourable senators, I think
that condition narrows it down quite a bitThe bill is a simple one, and I think it
should receive the unanimous support of
the house.
I wouid like at this time to say a littieabout the principies of the original legisiatiori
and what has happened to it since, for it isof great interest to the fishermen located
on the east coast of Canada. I think that the
principal provision in the original act is
that you can borrow $4,000, at 5 per cent
interest. There can be no other charges except for insurance. To whom and what does
the act apply? Well, that is something that
gives us some thought. The answer is contained in section 3 of the act, chapter 46, of
the Statutes of 1955, which reads:
3. (1) The Minister shall, subject to
the provisions of this Act, pay to a
lender the amount of ioss sustained by
it as a resuit of a loan to a fisherman
pursuant to an application by such fisherman in any case where
(a) the application stated that the loan
was required by the fisherman for any
of the foiiowing purposes, namely,
(i) the purchase or construction of a
fishing vessel,
You could not; get much of a fishing vessel
for $4,000.
(ii) the purchase or construction of
fishing equiprnent,
And there again, not much in the way of
fishing equipment can be purchased for
$4,000.

SENATE
(iii) the major repair or major overhaul of a fishing vessel or its hull,
superstructure or engine,
(iv) the purchase or construction of a
shore installation,
(v) the purchase, construction, repair,
or alteration of or making of additions
to any building used or to be used in
carrying on a primary fishing enterprise,
or
(vi) any prescribed development or improvement of a primary fishing enterpriseNow, it seems to me that those who are
informed of the needs of the industry and
who are familiar with the costs of equipment
and fishing vessels, large and small, cannot
see much benefit in the legislation that is tied
to a $4,000 loan-a very small amount under
present conditions.
Mind you, I think this bill was originally
intended for the inshore fisherman, the small
boat fisherman, but he is getting bigger and
more expensive boats, and in order to succeed he must co-operate with his fellow
citizens, either members of his own family or
other men; and they must go together, and
together they are able to run a larger and
safer boat. They must do that if they are
to have any hope of succeeding but they are
restricted to a $4,000 loan on the vessel.
The fishing industry is a hazardous one to
both life and property. A fisherman might
today have a lot of boats, nets and equipment, but tonight there might be a storm
and tomorrow his property is all gone. For
years he was not able to obtain insurance,
but I believe it was in 1953 that the Government passed a bill which would insure a
fisherman's floating property and gear from
$250 to $10,000. That applies to the inshore
fisherman. The lobster fishermen are protected with respect to their traps at a low
rate. With regard to the inshore fisherman,
the charge is 1 per cent of the value for
full marine coverage. These are good contracts.
This is administered by the Chief Administrator of the fishermen's indemnity plan, and
one must apply to the local fishery officer for
this insurance. I believe they now have
6,000 boats insured.
The amount of $4,000 as a ceiling on loans
seems ridiculously low, when one considers
what the act has in view. I believe there are
requests being made to the Government that
it be raised to $8,000. The authorities have the
insurance protection facilities for a coverage
of $10,000, and I say that they should increase
it to that amount. These facilities have been
used only moderately. Not many fishermen in
the province of Nova Scotia, and I do not

think many in the province of Newfoundland, have used them. The scheme has not
been a spectacular success. A fisherman can
borrow $4,000 by guaranteed loan through a
bank or credit union, and the interest rate is
limited to 5 per cent. I know I cannot borrow
money at 5 per cent, but maybe the arrangement is not attractive enough to obtain the
enthusiastic backing of lending institutions
throughout the country.
Another point that occurs to me is that to
lend a man who is going into a business of
this kind only half of what he needs to do
the job is not sufficient. Everybody knows
that today if you are going to do a job which
you think will cost so much, it usually costs
actually twice as much as you originally
thought. The fisherman is left adrift and is
unable to obtain any more money. That is
something that should not happen.
The banks have given special privilegessuch as mortgages and bills of sale-and the
little fisherman can be required to give a
mortgage on his property in order to get the
$4,000 loan from the bank. Then you block
him in, because his credit is thus impaired.
When he goes to a merchant or ship chandler
they know that he has borrowed money.
Perhaps they do not know, because this may
not be registered. However, the fact remains
that he has borrowed half of what he must
have and he does not know where to go to
get the balance. The act does provide for
fishing activities, but these surrounding conditions have made if so foreign to the little
fisherman of the coast that he has made very
little use of its provisions.
I might say that the Fishermen's Loan Board
in Nova Scotia is quite active, and I believe
they have the limelight now with regard to
loans to fishermen because they are making
loans of considerable amounts. The fisherman
must make a down payment before he can
qualify for a loan; and the board takes into
account particularly the past success of the
skipper and his chances of future success.
It seems to me that something more should
be done for the fishermen of Nova Scotia,
the other Maritime provinces, and Newfoundland. These lending corporations that the Government creates are not losing money for the
Government. The other day, in a Senate committee hearing, we were told by the president
of one of the Government corporations that
they put millions of dollars into the Government's Treasury last year. The Industrial
Development Bank, for instance, makes
money. I do not think that this operation
now under discussion has lost money, notwithstanding the fact that little business has
been done in connection with it. However,
these facilities ought to be extended.

MARCH 14, 1962
I have looked into this matter to some extent, and I have here a booklet issued the
other day by the Industrial Development
Bank. I do not know whether it has been
officially released yet. I talked to a leading
official of the Department of Finance, and he
said that so far as the fishing industry of the
east coast is concerned he thinks that its needs
are getting big enough to indicate that an
approach should be made to the Industrial
Development Bank for loans.
This booklet, issued by the Industrial
Development Bank, entitled "A Source of
Financing for Canadian Business," has this
to say:
The Industrial Development Bank can
consider an application for financing
where these general requirements are
met:
The financing is required for a business
in Canada.
IDB can provide financial assistance
to almost every type of business, including
manufacturing and commercial businesses, wholesale and retail trade, primary and secondary industry, tourist,
recreational and service businesses, construction trades, professional services,
transportation, and other businesses as
well.
There are only a few types of businesses not regarded as appropriate for
IDB assistance, such as those engaged
in lending to others and those which
obtain a substantial portion of their
revenues from selling alcoholic beverages. Loans to finance residential properties or for residential land development are not available from IDB.
The business need not be an existing
one-IDB has helped finance the establishment of many new enterprises.
The required financing is not available
from other sources on reasonable terms
and conditions.
Here is the difference between an Industrial
Development Bank loan and a loan from
other institutions or through other arrangements made by the Government: a borrower
can obtain money from the Industrial Development Bank when it is not available anywhere else. The policy of the bank is that
you can go to it and obtain money when
you have been turned down by the normal
and general sources of supply of cash, such
as the companies who normally lend money.
The official I am speaking of holds quite
an important position, and he said that the
eastern people could apply through this bank
for money for the development of the fisheries.
Honourable senators, it is all very well
to talk about a ceiling of $4,000 on loans,

but a good beam trawler costs $400,000
today. Even an inshore fisherman may have
$50,000 invested in nets and boats that
he can lose at any time, because the industry
is such a hazardous one. This industrial
bank now has agencies all over the country.
I believe there is one in St. John's, Newfoundland, and one in Halifax. I am only
putting this point forward because I think
it is in the interest of the fishermen of my
province. I believe they should be well
advised as to what is going on, and that
as far as this act is concerned, maximum
loans to small fishermen should be raised
to $10,000. That is the amount they can
insure for under legislation. It makes the
venture safe; there is no special hazard
involved. I do not think many people in
this country would like to see the maximum
remain at $4,000.
I hope that this situation will be taken note
of by somebody in authority, as it is not good.
It might be that the fishing industry would be
better served through the facilities of the
Industrial Development Bank. In any event,
the provisions of this bill should be extended
to allow loans of $10,000 instead of $4,000.
The bill would then be of more service to
the smaller inshore fishermen.
Hon. Malcolm Holleti: Honourable senators, I should like to say, first of all, that the
principle of the bill is one with which we
can all agree, in regard to the extension of
the time limit. However, I wish to restrict
my remarks to the details outlined in the bill.
We must remember that the act was passed
in 1955, and it is not to be expected that the
Government of that day, when it was proposed to limit the amount to $4,000, would
appreciate the position as closely as does this
Government at the present time. It may be
that they were not properly advised.
I agree with every word spoken by the
honourable senator from St. John's West (Hon.
Mr. Pratt), and I agree also with what has
been said by the honourable senator from
Queens-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley). Naturally, I want to congratulate the honourable
senator from St. John's East (Hon. Mr. Higgins) for his explanation of the bill.
I myself was a fishery boy many years ago.
I remember one incident which has been
brought to my mind by the references made
by the honourable senator from Queens-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley). A half century ago
or more, my dad wanted to buy a new
schooner but he did not have any money. He
had paid all his bills and the schooner he had
was not much good. He went in to St. John's
and went to one of the merchants on the
waterfront. In those days the merchants were
the only people from whom one could get a

SENATE
loan. A lot has been said about the merchants
in St. John's in times past, but they were
the people who kept the fishing going in Newfoundland. He went to one of those merchants
and said he knew of a vessel in Lunenburg
named the "Dove". I dare say the honourable
senator remembers it. The merchant asked
how much it would cost. I think the price
was $3,800 and the vessel was 90 to 100 tons.
Now $3,800 in those days was a lot of money.
The merchant told my dad to get it and that
the question of the money would be looked
after. He got that schooner and paid for it
through the years.
I mention that incident to compare the fisheries of the past with the present. Certainly,
$3,000 or $4,000 fifty years ago was a lot of
money. On the other hand, let us not forget
that this act was passed in 1955, not 1956,
1957 or 1960. When it was passed $4,000 was
not sufficient to assist any fisherman, at least
in Newfoundland, to any great extent.
We have to be careful as far as Newfoundland is concerned, relative to fisheries. The
chances of any man in Newfoundland today
are greatly enhanced if he goes to an occupation other than fishing. Some additional
inducement is needed at present, and unless
this is given I feel that the fishing industry
in Newfoundland, as well as in Nova Scotia,
is in for a bad time.
I agree entirely with the honourable senator from St. John's West (Hon. Mr. Pratt)
and with the honourable senator from
Queens-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley). I believe every honourable senator will agree
with me that a $4,000 loan is not sufficient.
We should ask the Leader of the Government
in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) to acquaint
the proper authorities of the true position
with regard to that amount. Even $10,000
would not be sufficient, but it would be better.
In this day and generation, if we are to assist
our fishing industry, we must assist the men
who have the gumption to gamble in that
industry. One could hardly gamble on $4,000.
One could scarcely buy anything for that
amount. Therefore, there is no sense in one
sticking out one's neck about $4,000, when it
is not enough and you still have to try to
get money from another source.
I agree with the principle of extending the
time to 1965. I would say it should go to 1967,
which is the anniversary of Confederation.
I am convinced that, if the position in
regard to the $4,000 were laid properly before the powers that be-the Minister of
Fisheries, or even the Prime Minister who
has the fisherman's interest at heart as he
has that of the farmers-they would not
object to raising that limit beyond $4,000.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Higgins, bill referred

FINANCE CHARGES (DISCLOSURE) BILL
SECOND READING-DEBATE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
February 28, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Croll, for second reading
of Bill S-2, to make provision for the disclosure of information in respect to finance
charges.
Hon. William M. Wall: Honourable senators, I rise to support the motion for second
reading of Bill S-2 because I believe that appropriate steps should be taken at the national
level to give to an ever-increasing number
of Canadians who are consumers of credit
some additional measure of protection and
possibly relief through the provisions of this
bill. These provisions are directed not to the
control of loan charges or the level of loan
charges, but simply to their full and complete
disclosure in measurable or comparable terms
or yardsticks. This disclosure, in easily understandable and comparable terms, should help
to dispel some of the mystique and some of
the mystery with which so many credit transactions have been surrounded by so many
purveyors of consumer credit.
Discussing the large variety of credit transactions under the title "Mystery and MumboJumbo", one daily newspaper points out that
because no law at present requires the dealer
to reveal the effective rate of interest the
consumers of credit really have no effective
yardstick for making valid and meaningful
comparisons among the financing charges of
consumer loans. I am mindful at this point of
a first-page story dated May 13, 1961 and
carried in the Financial Post under this
thought-provoking title, "Stop Sharks Before
Public Gets Mad".
For me the important consideration at this
point of the debate is the basic idea, or the
basic principle. In the course of my remarks
I intend to prove, at least to myself, that the
bill is constitutional, that it is operable, and
it provides for the kind of information that
the people want and need.
I see the bill for what it is trying to do,
that is, to give additional and, in my judgment, needed statutory protection to borrowers or consumers of credit by making it an
offence not to give to each borrower certain
basic information. Honourable senators will
remember the kind of information that is
provided for under section 3 of the bill. It
requires the lender of credit to tell the borrower in unmistakable terms (1) how much

MARCH 14, 1962
he owes, or, in other words, the balance outstanding; (2) the sum total of all the charges
against that outstanding loan; and (3) what
this total means in measurable terms-and
the bill means in terms of simple annual
interest-which must be related to the outstanding average balance owing, and not to
anything else.
What is basically wrong with this proposition, honourable senators? That is something
that has been perturbing me and bothering
me, and the more opposition I see to this
kind of proposition the more suspicious I
become, because I fail to see why doubts
have been raised concerning the true intent and purpose of this piece of legislation.
After doubts were raised about its true intent, I did go back to the bill and read section
:2 with its definitions. Then I read section 3
with its request for a mandatory written
statement to the borrower containing those
three pieces of vital information. Then I
read section 4 dealing with the penalties for
non-compliance, which really amount to saying that the lender cannot collect. Then I
read section 5 which gives to the Governor
in Council rather narrow powers of making
regulations. I cannot, for the life of me, see
how anybody can construe this bill as meaning anything but what it says.
Of course, we who support the bill hope
that it will, through more effective means of
mandatory disclosure, give additional protection to the consumers of credit, but how
this can be expanded to mean that the bill
is a kind of thin edge of a future wedge for
actual and more direct control of credit rates
and credit terms is beyond me. I respectfully
submit that we should be dealing with the
substance of this bill as we have it printedin black and white.
The problem of constitutionality has been
raised again in a somewhat different fashion.
We are told that because the present bill is
now delimited to cover only conditional sale
agreements, and because criminality has been
taken out of it in the sense that the present
bill contains no criminal penalties for noncompliance, and because interest, which is an
exclusive federal responsibility, is being
merely included as one of the finance charges
against a consumer loan-which, in fact, is
the situation under the Small Loans Act-that
therefore, or perhaps, we are dealing more
with civil and property rights, which are
under the provincial jurisdiction.
Please note that here we appear to be
ducking the very plain fact that the major
component of these consumer loan charges is,
has been, and will continue to be, interest;
and because of that I have to go to the British
North America Act. I have to look at the

part entitled, "Distribution of Legislative
Powers", and read section 91 which says,
among other things:
. . . it is hereby declared that (notwithstanding anything in this Act) the execlusive Legislative Authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all Matters
coming within the Classes of Subjects
next hereinafter enumerated . . .
And among those classes of subjects is "19.
Interest".

Secondly, we must keep in mind that the
problem of defining the overall cost of a loan
as interest-the problem of defining the whole
cost of the loan, of all the financial charges,
as interest and, therefore, within the competence of the federal Parliament-was settled
away back in 1939 with the passing of the
Small Loans Act. I would just like to refer
honourable senators to page 744 of the
Debates of the Senate of 1960 where I referred
to a statement by a former Deputy Minister of Justice, Mr. Varcoe, concerning that
particular problem and how it was handled
in the context of the legality of the Small
Loans Act.
What does it mean, honourable senators,
when I find that the legality or the constitutionality of the Small Loans Act has not been
challenged in any Canadian court since its
coming into force? The present bill is almost
an identical twin of the Small Loans Act because it deals with interest similarly defined
and similarly equated, as it is in the Small
Loans Act and has been for the past 22 years.
If you examine the bill's definition of
finance charges and then look at the definition of loan charges in the Small Loans Act
you will find that the language, the purpose,
the principle, and the substance are the
same. It is a twin. What is the difference?
This bill only asks for disclosure, and it asks
for a valid percentage calculation. The Small
Loans Act is different because it prescribes
and controls the maximum charges, also
in percentage terms.
Furthermore, I am supported in my conviction that the bill before us is within the
competence of the national Parliament by
the very comprehensive statement by the Senate's Law Clerk, which has been referred
to in this house and which can be found in
the Debates of the Senate 1960-61, at pages
312-316.
Finally I ask myself-and this is a nonlegal mind asking-if it is not constitutional
for the federal Parliament to extend the
definition of interest, over which it does
have exclusive authority, to include the many
ancillary charges directly and intimately connected with the consumer loan, as our Parliament has already done in the Small Loans

SENATE

Act, why is it more constitutional for provincial legislatures to extend the interpretation
of the definition of property and civil rights
to include interest, which is an exclusive
federal matter?
It may be that the Alberta legislation,
to which reference has been made in this
debate, a copy of which I have in my hand
and which I have read quite carefully, is
guilty of some form of invasion of the
jurisdiction exclusively assigned to Parliament with respect to interest. It may be
that the projected Manitoba legislation, which
is about to be introduced in the legislature
in Winnipeg, will be guilty of a similar
jurisdictional invasion. Furthermore, just
because the provisions of the Alberta legislation have not been challenged does not
mean (a) that the constitutionality of the
provincial legislation has been definitely
established or, (b) that the constitutionality
of this bill can or will be successfully challenged.
Quite frankly-and I am not a lawyerI fail to understand why doubts should be
raised about the probable unconstitutionality
of Bill S-2, an act to make provision for
the disclosure of information in respect of
finance charges, but this aspect of the problem can be given further consideration in
committee, at which time we may have the
benefit of the judgment of constitutional
experts upon whom we may call.
What about the argument that perhaps the
law envisaged by the present bill would be
inoperable because of the variations in the
answers obtained even by experts in the calculation of the simple annual interest percentage relationship? I am decidedly of the
opinion that we are dealing now with a hypothetical problem area about which there is
much ado about not so much. I respectfully
submit that these calculations will not be as
difficult to make, and I believe that the answers will not be as variable if and when
they are made in line with, and in accordance
with, regulated and perhaps unitary type procedures, which will be prepared by experts,
under section 5 of this bill, and which will be
used in the same way by all lenders.
Although I do not want to get into details
at this stage, I do want to stress that the present bill contains a provision whereby the
Governor in Council may determine the degrec of accuracy within which the credit
financier must disclose finance charges.
This relaxation should at least dispose of
the argument-and I stress this point-that
finance charges cannot be calculated with conplete accuracy. I am referring, of course, to
the percentage relationship in terms of simple
annual interest. I tend to agree with the honourable senator from Kennebec (Hon. Mr.

Vaillancourt), that these rate calculations can
be made accurately enough for the purposes
of this legislation simply by being read off
specially prepared tables which could be
made available, and which may be available
now.
I have in my hand an all-purpose accounting statement. I do not mind showing it to
those honourable senators who are interested
in it but I do not wish to place the name of
the firm on record. In any event, this statement tells the customer that if he owes a
balance of so much money the service charge
for the month-and these are all on a monthly
basis and can be translated into an annual
basis-is so much.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: May I interrupt my honourable friend to ask a question?
Hon. Mr. Wall: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Does the rate you are re-

ferring to in that table change every month?
Hon. Mr. Wall: If I understand your question you meanHon. Mr. Isnor: I have asked whether the
table you are using changes every monthHon. Mr. Wall: No.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: -as
ticular amount?

it relates to any par-

Hon. Mr. Wall: It does relate to a particular amount. Actually, this particular table
is made for people who purchase articles and
who keep adding to their purchasing account.
They pay so much on the account and then
purchase something else, so that each month
they may have a different outstanding balance.
The balance changes from month to month.
This particular firm has a table starting from
zero and goes up to $1,500. If the customer
owes, say, between $25 and $35 the monthly
payment is te be $4 and the service charge
on such an amount is 45 cents. In other
words, they have calculated figure by figure
the exact amount of service charge to be
assessed against the account, which could be
changing in amount from month to month.
Therefore, there is a definite assessment of
a monthly charge against a monthly balance.
This is donc on a monthly basis.
Hon. Mr. Asehline: What is the annual rate
of interest?
Hon. Mr. Wall: That is a very fair question.
I looked into this problem most carefully and
I asked that question myself. The annual rate
of interest varies according to the amount
outstanding, and in respect of this particular
firm I was told it varies, starting at 1.45 per
cent per month. At the end of the table they
tell you that if you owe over $500 you will

MARCH 14, 1962
be charged a monthly service charge of 1.2
per cent, and if you multiply this by 12 it
will give you the annual figure.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: May I ask my honourable
friend a question?
Hon. Mr. Wall: Yes, certainly.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: My friend has made
reference to a certain table. Since this bill
concerns itself only with consumer credit, I
am wondering whether he is familiar with
the form of conditional sale agreement that
is generally used at this time.
Hon. Mr. Wall: Yes, I have quite a few of
those in my folder. I can refer to these forms,
some of which are open-ended and some of
which are for specific amounts for specific
purchases.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Would my friend permit
a further question? In the form of conditional
sale agreement generally used, there appears
on its face a sort of box in which a number
of items are enumerated, showing the total
cost of the purchase of for instance, an automobile, and any additional charges to be
made. The sale price is given, and the cash
down payment is shown as a deduction.
Insurance, if there is any, is set out as a
separate item, as also are recording charges,
and that means the registration fee. The total
cost is expressed as a separate item under
the heading "Finance Charges". All those
items appear, and are added in to the unpaid
balance, and that means the total deferred
amount owing. Then you have the provision,
depending on whether it is 12 months or
24 months financing at so much a month. Is
that right?

Hon. Mr. Wall: Ah! No, I cannot agree.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Well, would you read
section 2(b) of the bill?
Hon. Mr. Wall: No, let us talk about section
5 also. Most certainly this problem of ostensibility-and I think it is ostensibility and not
proven inoperability-merits our further attention and study, and this type of specific
study can best be done in committee.
We have also been told that the rate of
interest is not really germane or valuable
to the borrower in making consumer loans,
and that there would be adequate provision
for truth telling in these transactions if the
prospective lender was told the total amount
of the finance charges. My own experiences,
and what I hear from others, make me feel
very strongly that the average Canadian
would prefer to have information not only
about the sum total of the cost of the loan
but also about the interest rate relationship
on the average total amount of the unpaid
balance outstanding, if it is a regular account.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: The total amount of
interest, including the finance charges?
Hon. Mr. Wall: Yes. Well, I do not know
exactly what you mean, or how you define
"including the finance charges".
Hon. Mr. Hayden: My friend has been using
the word "interest". Is he describing "finance
charges" as synonymous with the term
"interest"?

Hon. Mr. Wall: In the context of the present
interpretation of this bill, as I make it, and
as I relate it to the analogous interpretation
Hon. Mr. Wall: That is perfectly correct. of "interest" being loan charges in the Small
Loans Act, I would say yes.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: You say they are

loan.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Hayden: But who gets it? We are
talking about interest.
Hon. Mr. Wall: Who gets it?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Yes, who gets it?
Hon. Mr. Wall: Well, certainly it is not the
lender who gets it, but the person who provides the insurance, that is true. It is part of
the cost of that credit transaction.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: To the borrower?
Hon. Mr. Wall: I am not arguing that the
vendor gets it. What I am arguing is that the
average Canadian believes, and correctly believes, that the simple annual interest rate
relationship of these total loan charges against
the finance charges as we have them in this
bill, to the average annual outstanding
amount, is really the only sensible and the
only comparable yardstick of the unit price
of the commodity that we call credit. There
is no other sensible yardstick the man can
use.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Is my friend saying that
the cost to the borrower and interest are
synonymous?
Hon. Mr. Wall: No. What I am saying is
that, as in the Small Loans Act and in this
present bill, the cost of the loan is construed
to be interest in the sense that it is interest
plus any ancillary charges which are connected with that loan or credit transaction,
and that whole thing is called the cost of the
loan. In this bill it is called finance charges,
and in order for an average person to know
what that means, the only way he can measure it is to take the total charge against the
loan, whatever its components are, and relate
it to the average amount of money that he
has borrowed that is outstanding, and say,
"O.K., I can measure this, and I can say that
it is 'X' per cent". I go to somebody else and
he wants to charge me 'X' plus five per cent.
Then I can compare and know where I stand;
otherwise I cannot compare.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Does my friend suggest
that finance charges in this bill are made
synonymous with interest?
Hon. Mr. Wall: The word "synonymous"
bothers me, because you have asked me that
question several times, and I fail to understand why.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is why it was asked
you.
Hon. Mr. Wall: Now, it is true, honourable
senators, that the Alberta legislation provides
for a choice of information; that is, the legislation asks the purveyor of credit to tell
the customer either the total charges or the
simple rate of interest. I for one would like

to know how this legislation has worked out
in actual practice. For example, what has
been the Alberta experience with the disclosure of the calculated annual interest rate?
Which type of information had the Alberta
borrowers preferred and found most useful?
Do Alberta borrowers ask for both disclosures?
Have there been any real problems with interest rate calculations? Has this legislation
been useful? Has it failed? If so, how and
why? Perhaps further committee study of this
bill can provide us with this very interesting
information.
We have also been told that the bill makes
the erroneous assumption that all consumers
of credit know so little about finance that
they may be rather ignominiously termed
"bumpkin borrowers". Are we sure this kind
of philosophizing is not a diversionary distraction? I respectfully submit that there
does exist in modern credit science a kind
of mystery and mystique which are a part
of so many consumer loan transactionsand I am thinking of the unsophisticated
borrowers reading their contractual obligations with the fine print, and of these sane
borrowers faced later with problems of refinancing, penalties for missing payments,
penalties for prepayment in the sense that
even the refundable portion of the interest
previously charged is sometimes only partly
refunded. I respectfully subrnit that the kind
of direct written information which the bill
envisages should help to clear away at least
some of this mysticism, and should make it
easier for the borrower to make more competent assessments of his consumer loan
obligations, and make it more likely that
there may be some comparative shopping
with respect to finance charges.
I believe that the average Canadian is in
favour of this kind of information. How else
can I explain the wide support for this measure by the average man or from responsible
organizations close to what we may term the
little man? I would like to read to you one
or two letters which are typical. The first one
is from a private individual in Portage la
Prairie. He indicates support of the bill, and
says:
I believe the establishment of a standard method of calculating interest on
loans and the revealing of the actual
cost of interest and other charges on
credit transactions is in the best interest
of the public.
Then he goes on with this interesting idea:
Interest is a measure of the cost of
borrowing or lending money, just as
is the gallon or pound, measuring gasoline
or butter. People are entitled to a measure
which is meaningful to them. They are
entitled to the basic information which

MARCH 14. 1962
will give them reasonable opportunity to
handle their credit needs wisely. I would
solicit your support in this matter.
The letter is signed by a Mr. Werbiski.
Also I had a letter from Mr. A. Kristinson,
Secretary Manager of the Gilbert Plains
Credit Union Society Limited, who writes as
follows:
At the annual meeting of the Credit
Union Federation of Manitoba, held last
month in Winnipeg, the members present
passed a strong resolution endorsing
Senator Croll's Financial Disclosure Bill.
I have been instructed to write you
to assure you that our members are very
strongly in favour of the measure, and
are hoping it will be enacted into law.
We would respectfully request your support for the measure, as being one that
means a great deal, both financially and
in principle, to the people, both urban
and rural.
Honourable senators, I am sure that all of
you have received through the mail a written submission from the Canadian Federation
of Agriculture which discusses this particular
bill. I would like to quote just two rather
long sentences from this particular submission, as follows.
The person of low and moderate income, the person who has a desire, and
we might add a perfect right, to avail
himself of many of the essentials of this
life, as well as some of the frills, is
seldom in a position to carry out "onthe-spot" calculations of true interest
rates ...
We submit the citizens of this country,
who are not for the most part financiers,
accountants, mathematicians, or very
well-to-do either, have every right to
expect the Government of Canada to
provide measures that will protect them
against interest rates that are usurious,
and lending practices which cloak the
true interest rates charged in such a way
that it is almost impossible for the average layman to determine the cost in
either percentages or in dollars. He has
every right to expect the legislators of
this country to curtail any practices that
do in fact cause hardship to either him
or his family.
Although I cannot subscribe to every
word of this particular submission, I do contend that it does show a wide measure of
interest on behalf of people I have termed
ordinary, average Canadians. They are interested. I have had very many letters from
individuals, and I have had between 15 and
20 letters from organizations.

I believe, honourable senators, that in the
modern business world consumer credit
in all its varied forms has become as much
a commodity as a pound of butter or a sack
of potatoes, and it is imperative that people
know the cost of this credit commodity both
in total amounts and in some percentage relationship.
I repeat, the annual interest rate relationship appears to me to be the only meaningful
measuring yardstick to show the true cost of
credit-much like the price per pound of
butter or cheese. Armed with this information, consumers of credit will be able to do
some comparative shopping in the field of
finance charges on consumer loans. This would
be a desirable development, in my opinion.
I, too, believe that potential purchasers should
be able to "shop for credit" in the same way
that housewives are able to shop for meats
or canned goods. The prices of such staples
are clearly marked, known and comparable.
Here there is no mystery or misunderstanding.
Why should the potential buyer of a new car
or television set, who cannot pay cash in full,
not be entitled to be similarly informed about
what he must pay in unit terms for obtaining
credit on the unpaid balance of his transaction
or transactions?
Honourable senators, I confess that I am
concerned by a problem area which has been
raised by the honourable senator from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden), namely, that the present
bill does not provide for consumer credit situations where the actual selling is done by one
person or entity, and where the financing of
the unpaid balance outstanding is a kind of
separate transaction entered into with another
person or business entity. If that is indeed
so, then the effectiveness of this piece of legislation will be delimited or narrowed, and
its potential benefits may be severely circumscribed. This probability disturbs me, and
I express the hope that committee study will
throw further light upon this problem area.
I thought that the rather careful definition
of "credit financier" in section 2(a) of the
bill did provide for this kind of consumer
loan transaction, but this is a technical problem of drafting and may best be handled in
committee.
In all fairness, honourable senators, I must
direct your attention to another problem area
which has been brought more forcibly to my
attention as I have discussed the implications
of this bill with responsible credit managers
of department stores and other commercial
enterprises which provide consumer credit. I
refer to what I might best describe as "openended," "revolving" or "optional" credit accounts, in which outstanding balances and instalment payments may vary month by month.
I bring these to your attention so that we may

SENATE
take into account the existing structure of the
various practices in extending consumer
credit; and these open-ended credit arrangements are now very much in use and are,
apparently, gaining in popularity.
I should like to explain very briefly what
I mean by open-ended or revolving credit accounts. Let us assume I am the customer and
that I go to department store "A" in this city
and say to them that I need to buy $300-worth
of goods of various kinds. They may or may
not extend to me credit for $300; but let us
assume that they are willing to do so. My
wife and I start shopping, and we buy $75
worth of goods during the first month. Then,
the next month we add another $50 worth,
but we have paid off $15, let us assume, so
that the amount of credit outstanding changes
month by month, depending on the instalments that are paid. There is, I am told, a
great deal of that kind of credit, and it varies
in type from establishment to establishment.
One establishment may say this: put down
$20, and we will allow you to buy up to this
or that amount on credit. Another establishment may say: we will allow you to buy on
credit with no down payment, up to a certain
amount, but the amount outstanding may vary
from month to month. The payments vary:
they may be regular $20 or $15 a month; or
they may vary, depending on the ability of
the customer to pay the loan off within the
terms of his original agreement.
I should like to point out, if I may, that I
have in my hand one such agreement. It is
an open-ended agreement. You sign the agreement. They ask for certain pertinent information dealing with credit, but the substance of
the agreement is this:
I understand and agree that my fixed
limit of charging on this account isAnd there is a blank to be filled in.
-that the monthly payment isAnd another blank space.
That I am to pay a carrying charge of
12 per cent of the amount owing.
That is 14 per cent per month, and so on.
Some stores charge 1 per cent per month and
some 14 per cent per month. Some stores give
an actual figure of the monthly charge, as I
have indicated to you. There are problems in
revealing both pieces of information in this
respect. In other words, it is not one single
transaction in which you can calculate the
finance charges and work out the simple annual interest rate relationship. This is a
variable account and, therefore, some stores
levy a monthly service charge according to
the amount owing or outstanding that month.
Some stores say that you owe so much and

that they will charge 1, 11, 14 or even half
of one per cent per month, depending on the
policy and experience of the store.
There may be problems in these types of
contracts. I believe that these more specific
problems could be profitably discussed in committee, with the help of those who furnish this
kind of credit. However, I do wish to make
this additional observation, that from my conversations with credit managers of some of
these firms who use this form of open-ended
credit agreement, I gathered that the disclosure requirements envisaged by the present
bill-that is the two types of disclosure, the
finance charges and the interest rate relationship-could and would be satisfactorily met in
practice by suitably conceived regulations provided for in section 5.
Honourable senators, I have almost finished.
From the sponsor of the bill you have heard
something about the high and often unconscionable finance charges which are levied
against the customers of consumer credit.
What perturbs me is the answer which I
find myself forced to give to this question:
With existing protective legislation presently
found upon federal and provincial statute
books, is there evidence to show that many
borrowers are now being subjected to high
finance charges which they cannot readily
assess and which, upon assessment, prove to
be usurious and unconscionable? If that is the
case, then why? So, if Parliament can do
something, if it can do anything to mitigate
and to alleviate this burden of loan charges,
then let us say, by all means, do this something.
I believe that this bill will help in two
ways: first, its disclosure features will provide
better price competition in the consumer
credit market; and, secondly, this additional
and mandatory credit charges information
will help to bring about better, because more
knowledgeable, credit management by the
individual borrowers.
In my view, the present bill is an improvement over the earlier bills in that it is
specific and limited to the field of consumer
credit. I hope and believe that the bill will
be approved in principle by most honourable
senators, and that it will be sent to committee
for more detailed study. It is because I am
basically in favour of what the bill proposes
to do that I feel that we should do nothing
less than permit this basic proposal to get
further study and additional assessment in
committee.
On motion of Hon. Mr. White, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 3
p.m.

ST. PATRICK'S DAY
TRIBUTES TO THE IRISH PEOPLE

Hon. John G. Higgins: Honourable senators, I rise to a point of privilege to ask that
the Senate perform again the terrific achievement-since this is an era of many achievements-of harnessing the sun and send this
day two days ahead so that we regard today
as March 17, St. Patrick's Day, and so preserve an old established custom.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Sing a song, Jack.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: If my request is granted
I shall again speak of the history and poetry
of Ireland, trusting that next year somebody
else will take the falling torch and keep the
custom going, as has been done in the past
by such capable hands and voices as the late
Senator Quinn of Halifax and the late Senator Burke of St. John's, Newfoundland.
We are apt to think of far-off days as
barbarous. Education to many minds is a
modern boon. It may surprise them to know
that many universities, like Oxford and
Cambridge, go back to the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries. In fact, so far had the
cult of learning progressed in those days that
students flocked to the universities in thousands. Strange is it to say that students of
a university of one country who went to universities of other countries found no difficulty
in the matter of language, for Latin was the
Esperanto of the Middle Ages and was the
tongue used by every professor.
But, stranger does it sound to say that six
centuries previously there was in northern
Europe a country of culture and erudition.
Ireland in the sixth century was a great seat
of learning. She had become the custodian of
civilization. The great schools of Ireland were
free and derived their income from public
endowment and periodical collections. Foreigners and natives were treated alike. Such
hospitality existed in pagan days and continued with Christianity. In the latter period
it became consecrated, and the old Irish expressions show the feeling and meaning:
Christ is in the person of every guest
Every stranger is Christ.

There is an ancient poem which says:
Oh, King of stars:
Whether my house be dark or bright,
Never shall it be closed to anyone
Lest Christ close His House against me.
If there be a guest in your house
And you conceal aught from him,
'Tis not the guest that will be without it
But Jesus, Mary's Son.
Time does not permit me to touch on the
phases of the civilization of Ireland, or to
deal with the social classes. But one remarkable institution should be remembered
of those days-the Bardic Order, the Order
of the Poets.
In an age when other nations were grovelling in the desolation of barbarism, ancient
Ireland, even when pagan, presented the
extraordinary, magnificent spectacle of a
civilization so high that its main criterion
was intellectual. Intellect was honoured more
than force and the scholar ranked before the
warrior, for the bards were next to royalty
in Ireland. The bards were the poets, the
musicians, the chroniclers and the historians.
It was their function to tell the history of
the country in rhyme. It was their duty to
record the achievements of kings, priests
and chiefs, to preserve their genealogies and
define their rights. They were privileged
guests at every feast, where they sang the
glories of their chieftains and of their country.
The people of all Ireland were taxed in
support of the bards. Twelve years were required for the training of the ordinary poet;
but the Ollamh, who was the highest in
rank, was required to know 350 kinds of
verse and be able to recite poetry extemporaneously on any subject whatsoever. Poetry
and music were inseparable. The bard usually sang his songs and played his harp.
The people got the worth of their money
-if we wish to use the modern commercial
criterion. The poets taught them, they preserved the traditions of the Gael, even as
Homer did for the Greeks and Virgil for the
Romans. In the forefront of the battle the
king was no more conspicuous than the bard
with his harp, inspiring each warrior to noble
deeds.
Learning was held in great respect. These
ancients had high standards. No man could
be chief poet unless he had drunk deeply
and copiously at the font of learning, and
there was a code for the bards:
Purity of hand, bright without wounding.
Purity of mouth, without poisonous
satire.
Purity of learning, without reproach.
Purity of husbandship in marriage.

MARCH 15, 1962
The importance of music and poetry was
not lessened by the introduction of Christianity, rather was it quickened. We are told that
St. Patrick advised the bards to keep their
harps and sing the songs of Erin's heroic
youth as in the pagan days. But he taught
them to use their harps to loftier strains than
those of the banquet hall or the battle march.
He sought to drive out from their songs the
evil spirit of undying hate and rancorous
vengeance, to impress the mind of the bard
with something of the divine spirit of Christian charity and to soften the fBerce melody
of his war song with cadences of pity for
a fallen foe. He taught them to chant the
psalms of David and to sing the music of the
church.
At the last great convention of the Gaels
held at Drumceat in the north of Ireland in
573 the Bardic Order was reformed. It was
decreed that regular schools should be
formed. Four arch poets or ollamhs, one for
each province, were appointed to preside
over these schools. It is in a great measure
due to these bardic schools that we owe the
preservation, not alone of the ancient and
authentic chronicles of Ireland but also of
an immense mass of romantic literature.
These schools, which taught music as well as
literature, attracted the outside world, and
so great was their reputation that students
from other lands flocked to perfect themselves, even as in recent years music lovers
came to Italy and Germany.
From the very earliest times in Ireland,
almost everything worth recording was put
into verse. When St. Patrick had the laws
codified a poet was asked to put them into
verse or to use the beautiful Gaelic expression "to put a thread of poetry around them".
Some scholars agree it was the ancient Irish
who invented rhyme and introduced it
through the Latin to Europe.
Less than a century after Patrick landed
in Ireland in 432, there was born the greatest
Gael of all times, Colm or Columcille commonly called Columba. His memory is perpetuated in the name of Malcolm-the son of
Colm-the name given ta the first convert
king of Scotland. Malcolm is a comnmon name
in Scotland, and many Scottish kings bore it.
His life was the history of Ireland and of
Scotland for nearly half a century. He was
the son of the High King of Ireland, and
would have been the High King himself if
he had not been a cleric. He founded Iona,
and he converted Scotland. He was the most
commanding personality of his time. He was
a poet of high order and some of his poems
have come down to us through the years.
One was written when he was in self-imposed exile, and this was translated by
Douglas Hyde in the original metre:

Oh Son of my God, what a pride, what
a pleasure
To plough the blue sea
The waves of the fountain of deluge to
measure
Dear Eire to thee.
Yet my visit and feasting with Komgall
have eased me
At Kainneacht's right hand,
And all but thy Government, Erin, has
pleased me,
Thou waterfall land.
The last two lines have a familiar ring.
Even in those days, men of action were criticizing the government of the time.
Time does not permit me to tell of the
poetry before the coming of Patrick, nor to
discuss the great sagas-the Red Branch or
Heroic Cycle, the Fenian cycle and the Ossianic poems.
The golden age of Ireland, from the fifth to
the twelfth centuries, produced many poets
whose writings are extant. The book of
Leinster contains a pretty little lyric of
Cormac, the Bishop King of Cashel, which has
precisely the theme of Tennyson's "Crossing
the Bar":
Wilt thou steer my frail black bark
O'er the dark broad ocean's foam?
Wilt thou come, Lord, to my boat
Where afloat, my will would roam?
Thine the mighty, thine the small:
Thine to make men fall, like rain;
God! wilt thou grant aid to me
Who came o'er the upheaving main.
The period from the coming of the Normans
to the days of Elizabeth produced some fine
poetry. The bardic families still produced
their poets. The great streams of bardic
poetry came down the centuries through
families such as those of O'Daly, O'Higgins,
MacNamee, Mac-a-Ward, Egan, O'Mulconry
and others, but new bardic families sprang up
fron time to time.
With the penal laws imposed by Elizabeth
and the ban on Gaelic literature the Order of
the Bards ceased and the bardic schools were
closed, but now and then some poet, maddened at the wrongs of his country, or sorrow
stricken at her plight, broke into rapturous
song. Mangan has translated one of these, a
poem entitled "Dark Rosaleen". The original
was called "Roisin Dhu", or "The Little Black
Rose", and was written in about 1590 by one
of the poets of Red Hugh O'Donnell, the great
chieftain. Red Hugh is supposed to be addressing Rosaleen, which is Ireland. We are told
that this song sang itself into the imagination
of the race. It has the sweetness of a lyric
and the swell of an anthem. It was written
when Ireland, under the throes of persecution,
was lamenting the loss of old chieftains, when

lofty work to compile the history. The dispersal
and loss of manuscripts and old records was
rapidly taking place and if the memorials
were not to be forever lost it was necessary
to collect such as remained and transfer them
into large books for the benefit of posterity.
They had sources of knowledge which have
since disappeared.
And so through days of persecution, at the
peril of their lives, they sat down in a ruined
monastery in Donegal from 1632 to 1636 and
wrote for posterity those immortal annals
which will be a treasured possession for al
time.
Piteous and dramatic was this compilation
of immemorial tradition in a land of woe and
desolation when the nation's day was darkest
and there was no star of hope to light the
deepening gloom, for they laboured in the
cold belief that the Irish nation was gone
forever and that nothing remained to be
salved except the memory and the memory
only of a once great nation.
They worked for no reward for they thought
the nation they loved was gone, but they
gave to the children of that nation a priceless
heritage; they made a picturesque tradition
sure knowledge, and they have earned the
thanks of the Gaelic world.
The later days give us some beautiful
poems and songs. In the bloody Cromwellian
régime, the land was taken away from the
owners, the forests were hewn down and the
chiefs went into exile. The old song "Shawn
O'Duibhir"-O'Dwyer of the Glen-summed
up the joyous life of sport and hospitality
that ended with the departure of O'Dwyer
and his men and with the falling of the trees.
The first three verses depict the good old
days, the last verse is one of tragedy:

There is a beautiful littie sang translated
by Douglas Hyde, where the loved ane of the
Bard is described as "la star af knowledge":
I thaught! 0 my lave! Yau were soAs the moan is, ar the sun an a fauntain,
And I thought after that you were snow,
The cold snow an the top of the mountain;
And I thought after that, you were more
Like God's lamp shining to find me,
Or the bright star af knowledge before,
And the star of knowledge behind me.
There are wonderful figures ai speech
opened up ta us. In one poem the silence and
unexpectedness af the coming of the Day of
Judgment is described as being like the
pushing up noiselessly but irresistibly af a
blade of grass through the ground.
As a light cornes aver the rising moon,
As a heat cames over the settled sun,
As the grass steals up thraugh the fields
af the world,
The day of the judgment of God shall

The Gaels neyer forget. They lack the
cynic approach of the modern mmnd. They
are sentimental. The dominant note in Irish
literature, according ta Matthew Arnold, is
sentiment. The Irish temperament is paetic.
They possess the superb devotion ta a cause.
And language expresses the feelings af a
people. Naturally, then, Gaelic is predaminantly the language ai devotion. One af the
Dukes af Argyle said that if he were addressing his savereign he would speak English; if he were addressing the lady af his
affection he would use French; but if he
were addressing his God he would choose
Gaellc.
Scholars tell us that Gaelic is a poetic
language, full of music. Gaelic sangs are
among the best in the world. They fill the
heart and have the glamour of the past
about them. They tell af "old unhappy things
and batties long aga". They are hauntingly
sad. In his famous poem "The White Horse",
Chesterton says:
The great men af the Gaels
Were the men that God made mad,
For they were merry in their wars
And in their sangs were sad.
There is a softness and music and a
fascinating lilt in the language. It is a
language af vawels. It is like Greek, and

unlike English in that it has no accentuation.
It is a tangue af vowel sounds. Take for
instance some wards we have often heardAcushla, Mavourneen, Doreen, Maureen,
Aileen Arou, Rasaleen, Erin go Bragh, Cead
mile failte. Even names af places and people
are musical-Gougane Bara, Lisdoonvarna,
Lissadil, Tyrconnell, Tara, Cruchan, Cuchulain.
It is only natural that Irish writers should
use English in such a way as ta adapt
musical words and for ordinary people ta
speak in musical terms.
There is a Celtic manner in poetry, the
Irish or rather Celtic manner af writing
English, the Celtic word imagery. Celtic
poetry has a quality which Matthew Arnold
said, "drenches the dew ai natural magice".
Now and then one word in a poem meets
the ear and strikes a vibrant chord which.
lingers in the memary. It is music in itself.
It is sheer word magic. It may be a proper
name, but paetry aiten gives such a name,
when used in its proper setting, a strange
beauty. May I quate a verse you have aiten
heard. It is in The Exile, by John Gaît
the Scottish Gael. One word in this verse
gives it a beauty that haunts us-the word
"Hebrides":
From the lane shieling in the misty
Island,
Mountains divide us and the waste
af seas
Yet still the blood is strong, the heart
is Highland,
And we in dreams behold the Hebrides.
Egypt, for instance, is by no means a melodious saunding word, but when Shakespeare puts in the mauth ai Anthony the
line: "I arn dying, Egypt, dyîng", he gave it
a wanderful signification.
Sametimes we find a full Une ai poetry
with that indescribable, haunting charm, that
dream-like music. For instance, there is
that much quated line: "A rase red city
half as aid as time". And we have such a
one from. the pen af that great Irishman and
Canadian, Thomas D'Arcy McGee-that line
that is dear ta the heart ai my sentimental

He said: Honourable senators, the amendment is a simple one. The bill provided for
the incorporation of the company with three
members. There was no provision for additional persons to become members of the
corporation or the organization. So if it happened that the three men died, the corporation would have been dissolved as there would
be no members. The purpose of the amendment is to provide that the corporation may
be continuous, and that there will always
be others who may become members of the
corporation. Therefore, the only pu:rpose of
the amendment is to prolong the corporation
beyond the lives of the three members who
applied for the incorporation.

study of it; there is no problern of redistribution involved. It simply gives a basic, fundamental right to these people-namely, the
franchise. Up to the present time, all persons
residing in the districts of Franklin and Keewatin have not had the right to vote at any
federal election, whether it be a general
election or a by-election. This is the situation
it is hoped to rectify by the passage of this
bill.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Might I ask the honourable sponsor of the bill whether one
could say that the real purpose of the bill
is to extend the present electoral district of
Mackenzie?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I shall come to that later
in my speech.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am sorry.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Of the persons residing
in these two districts, 75 per cent are of
Eskimo origin and the remainder are Northern Affairs administrative personnel, weather
station personnel, other civil servants and a
certain number of industrial workers who
reside at Rankin Inlet.
Under the proposed bill the districts of
Franklin and Keewatin are added to the electoral district of Mackenzie for election purposes, and the name of the electoral district
of Mackenzie River is changed to "the electoral district of the Northwest Territories".
I think all honourable senators will agree
with me that the bill is a good one, and
that this legislation is long overdue.
Hon. Mr. Reid: What is the total population there?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The total population of
the two districts together is about 8,000 persons.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: How many are Indian and
Eskimo?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Seventy-five per cent are
of Eskimo origin.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Will this
bill result in giving all residents of Canada
a vote?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I would think so.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Is there
any portion of Canada which is now left out
of an electoral district?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I think not; this takes in
the remainder of the residents of Canada
who do not have the right to vote.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Could the
honourable gentleman tell us how long it is
estimated it would take to record the votes
of these people living at these distant points?
26211-3-22j

Hon. Mr. Bruni: I shall come to that.
As I said, the legislation is long overdue,
and when the bill receives second reading
I propose referring it to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills; and
I have arranged for the sponsor of the bill
in the other place, Mr. Erik Nielsen, the
member for the Yukon, to come over and add
to my explanation by giving any further evidence that honourable senators might like to
hear concerning the bill.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Should
we not also have the Chief Electoral Officer
in attendance?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Give me a chance, I am
coming to that.
In addition, I have arranged for a representative of the Chief Electoral Office to attend, and at that time he will be prepared, I
am quite sure, to answer any further questions
honourable senators may desire to ask. Having discussed this bill with him, I am confident that he will be in a position to answer
the question raised by the honourable Leader
of the Opposition with respect to distances
involved and the time taken to register
votes.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I have
just one more question, which I am sure the
honourable gentleman can answer. When will
the first election take place at which these
persons will have a chance to vote?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I-t will take place on a
Monday prior to March 31, 1963.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Has the honourable senator been advised whether the district of
Keewatin, which is circumscribed by a dark
black line, includes some islands which are
very near the boundary of Quebec? I wonder
if the Governnent has been advised that
these islands should not be comprised in that
district?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The real problem arises not
in connection with the district of Keewatin,
but with the district of Franklin. If honourable senators will look at the map, at the tip
of what looks like Newfoundland they will
see a place marked Port Burwell. That is
located on an island, which I understand is
claimed by both the province of Newfoundland and by the province of Quebec. Nevertheless, the position taken by the Government
is that it is part of the district of Franklin,
since there is a channel six miles wide between the island on which Port Burwell is
situated and the mainland. To answer the
question, all offshore islands are included in
the two districts.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: There is another island,
or group of islands, which should be within

SENATE
the limits of the province of Quebec. Within
the district of Keewatin on the map, there are
the Belcher Islands which belong to Quebec.
They should not be included in Keewatin.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is something which I
feel must be left to the province of Quebec
and the Dominion of Canada to determine.
There is nothing I can do about it.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Has the eastern boundary
of the Yukon been changed?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: There has been no change
in the boundary at all.
Hon. Mr. Holleti: Did the honourable senator say that the Government attitude is that
Port Burwell island is a part of Quebec?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No. That is part of the
district of Franklin.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: Then it is no longer part
of Newfoundland?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: Which Government takes
that attitude?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The dominion Government.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Is not this a private
bill?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes, but it had to have
the consent and support of the Government,
in order to be passed in the other place.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
notwithstanding the eloquence of the honourable senator from Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt)
who introduced this measure this afternoon,
and notwithstanding the arguments which he
has advanced, which really were pretty thin
when you examine them, I find myself unable to support this proposed change. I cannot see how in reason the public life of this
country is going to gain by having people
in Ellesmere Island, for instance, or in Victoria Island, or the Queen Elizabeth Islands,
given the vote.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: Why should they not
have a vote?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: What do the people
living at, say, Resolute Bay, away up in the
Far North, know about the problems with
which this Parliament has to deal? If our
so-called democratic society-which is becoming less and less democratic-means anything, it is that these individual members of
society at least have enough knowledge and
enough understanding to vote with some
degree of intelligence upon the issues presented to them. How in the name of common
sense are several thousand Eskimos, who have

never been out of their native region in their
lives, to understand the great virtues of the
present Government?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald
would be difficult.

(Brantford):

That

Hon. Mr. Crerar: How are they to comprehend the program which the Opposition
may put forward, or the program which may
be put forward by the Social Credit Party
or the New Democratic Party? All that will
happen in the end is that some will go around
and say: "This Government has given you a
great many favours: you get family allowances, pensions and other benefits, therefore
you should be grateful and vote for this
Government." Honourable senators, on the
basis of sheer common sense, is that sort of
thing desirable?
As far as the white personnel in weather
stations and such places are concerned, arrangements can easily be made for them to
vote in the same way as soldiers vote when
they are absent during an election. They
vote as if they were in their own constituencies.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Would the honourable
senator go so far as to say that we should
disenfranchise the Eskimos residing in the
electoral district of Mackenzie River?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: No, I do not think I
would go so far as that; although, I would
remind my honourable friend from Hanover
(Hon. Mr. Brunt) that if we made a mistake in
giving illiterate people the vote in the Mackenzie River country, there is no reason on
earth why we should project and enlarge the
error into a much larger field. I have seen
some Indians who do not understand either
French or English. Because we have given
them the vote-and we made a mistake in
doing so-there is no reason for repeating
that mistake. That is the point I am making.
I have seen these Indians up in the Far
North. They have not the remotest idea of
what government is about in this country. Al
they know now-and they are being very
assiduously informed of it-is that the great
white mother, whom they imagine is the head
of the country, is conferring a favour upon
them through the Government, and that consequently they should give the Government
their support.
Honourable senators, regardless of the party
in power, the principle is unsound and will
tend to undermine our freedom. Today much
of the basis of appeal to the electorate is not
to their intelligence, not to their common
sense, to support this policy or to oppose that
policy, but more and more it is being made
on this basis: Support us because we will do
the most for you. For example, we will in-

MARCH 15, 1962
crease the pensions. If the other party has
increased then, then we will increase them
still more when we come to power, as was
the case in the 1957 election.
'I put it to you, honourable senators: Is
that a desirable thing in an endeavour to
perpetuate responsible government in this
country? I cannot see that it is. Educate these
people, yes, but to do what this bill suggests
is about as sensible as giving the franchise to
eight-year old boys who would exercise it
just as intelligently as would the illiterate
people in these very remote districts. They
know nothing of the English or the French
language, and have nothing but the vaguest
and haziest of ideas as to what goes on in
the outside world and what government
means. When they see a mounted policeman
from time to time they recognize him as
authority, but they do not know what is
behind him.
1, for one, cannot bring myself to approve
this measure for the enlargement of this
district. The fact that we may have made
mistakes in the past is no reason why we
should intensify them. As far as I am concerned, honourable senators, I am opposed to
this bill.
Hon. J. Wesley S±ambaugh: Honourable
senators, I would like to take issue with the
remarks of the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) that these people
are not entitled to representation. In my
opinion they were entitled to representation
long ago, and because they do not understand
the English or the French language, or both,
is no reason for disfranchising them and
thus saying they have no right to bring their
problems before this Parliament.
Most assuredly they do have the right to
have a representative here, who will be able
to bring their problems before the people,
and they do have problems. They have problems of which we have no knowledge. One
way in which we can find out about their
problems is by their having a representative
in Parliament, and the only way in which
they can have a representative is to elect one
and send him here.
I congratulate Mr. Erik Nielsen, who introduced this bill in the House of Commons.
It is, as I say, long overdue. These people
should have had representation many years
ago. They should have had representation at
the same time that the Yukon Territory and
the district of Mackenzie were included in
the act.
I should like to congratulate also the
honourable sponsor of this bill (Hon. Mr.
Brunt) for making this map available to us.

It draws our attention to the size of the territory, and also of the Mackenzie Rivet
constituency which has one member of Parliament.
I was very well acquainted with the late
member of Parliament for Mackenzie River,
Mr. Mervyn Hardie, and I know what a
difficult task he had representing that large
territory. I know how hard he worked at it,
and I know that he travelled to many places
to obtain first-hand knowledge of the problems of the people and bring them to Parliament.
By increasing the size of the territory the
problems of the member of Parliament will
be increased, and it is my hope that at some
time in the not distant future there will be
two members representing this large district.
In that hope I know I will run into considerable opposition from people who live in the
large cities. Let me illustrate what I have in
my mind.
The city of Edmonton, for instance, with
a population of over 200,000 people, has three
members of Parliament, but I would think it
is easier for one person to represent the whole
of that city than it is for one person to
represent this large constituency of Mackenzie
River. The reason for my saying that is very
simple. A member in that city can speak by
telephone to the mayor, who represents the
whole city in a municipal way, or to the
Chamber of Commerce, or the presidents of
every social service club. He can speak by
telephone to almost every important person
living in the city. If he wishes he can take
a city bus and in a couple of days travel
the whole of his constituency for the expenditure of only a couple of dollars. But if the
member for Mackenzie River wishes to see his
constituency and the various people up there
he must travel by foot, dog team, boat or
airplane. His means of travel are very
expensive, and if he travelled for two years
he would not see everything.
The city of Edmonton may get a new post
office, or a new federal building, and it would
be for the benefit of every person living in
the city. If a dock is built at Yellowknife,
for instance, it will not be of much interest
to the people in Hay River or in Fort Smith.
That is one reason why it is so difficult to
represent those people.
There are a dozen different municipalities
in the district of Mackenzie. I know something
about the district because I have travelled
there, and I know what a difficult task the
member there has. I am very happy that the
people living in these included territories will
now be able to vote and have a representative
in Parliament, which is their undoubted right.

with the disfranchisement of anybody on the
ground of his supposed unintefligence. The
intelligence test is a thing of bygone years
and is no longer acceptable to us in a deniacratic country.
May I ask just one question, for I think
once again my intelligence is below the test,
and I may flot have followed the sponsor's
explanation. Why is it necessary to repeal
section 2 of the Representation Act and substitute this section which sets out the number
of members of the House of Commons who
shahl be elected from. the varlous provinces?
Are we making any change in the numbers?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: There is no change in the
numbers.
Hon. Mr. Raebuck: Then what is the necessity for re-enacting that particular section?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: This could have been done
in one of two ways. Parliament could have
been asked to pass a section changing the
name of the electoral district of Mackenzie
River to the electoral district of the Northwest Territories. This could have been done
by a short section, and we would have then
included these two districts under section 2
of the bill. However, the drafters chose to
re-enact the entire section 2 of the Representation Act, and the only change they are
proposing is in the name of one of the electoral districts. It is being changed from
Mackenzie River to Northwest Territories.
As I say, this could have been done in either
way, and it bas been suggested that it be
done as set out in this bill.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not understand.
Wihy is it necessary to re-enact that there
shaîl be 85 members from the province of
Ontario?

Hon. Mr. Horner: My purpose in rising is
to speak about the Eskimos. I think the most
moving event I have heard of i modern
times was when, a few years ago, 17 Eskimos,
with their dogs, were carried out into Hudson
Bay on an ice fioe. When a week had elapsed
they were given Up for lost. Finally, the ice

therefore, it is possible to educate them. They
are a courageous people. Where else would

Undaunted, home they marched with their

them for what they said, and I think most

I have great admiration for the honourable

anything else. Do not let us ever think of

Hon. Mr. Bruni: Honourable senators, certain senators have pointed out to me that my
secretary in marking the maps made a slight
error as to the boundaries of these districts.
I might point out that she had to mark the
boundaries on more than one hundred copies
of the map, and one small error is, I think
excusable. However, I assure honourable
senators that when this bill is being considered in the committee there will be before
us a large-scale map which will correctly set
out in every detail the boundaries of each
district.
In closing the debate, I desire also to call
attention of honourable senators to paragraph
(b) on page 2 of the bill. I believe in my
earlier remarks I stated that the offshore
islands were included in these territories.
Honourable senators will note by paragraph
(b) that the islands in Hudson Bay, James
Bay and Ungava Bay are included, except
those islands that are within the provinces of
Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec.
I hope that answers my honourable friend's
question.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
with the indulgence of the house: Instead of
showing the boundaries on a map why do
we not have them described by metes and
bounds in the schedule? They surely can be
described in that way. That is the way all
other constituencies are described. Why do
we not do the same here?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I will endeavour to have
that done. It may be that a survey problem
is involved. I will endeavour to have that
answer for you when the bill is before committee.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
CONSTRUCTION OF A LINE OF RAILWAY
BETWEEN MATANE AND STE. ANNE DES
MONTS, QUEBEC-SECOND READING
Hon. Léon Méthot moved the second reading of Bill C-67, to authorize the construction and operation on behalf of Her Majesty
of a line of railway in the province of
Quebec between Matane and Ste. Anne des
Monts.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to authorize the construction
and operation of a line of railway in the
province of Quebec between Matane and Ste.
Anne des Monts, so as to promote the industrial and commercial development of the
Gaspé peninsula, by which the residents of
Gaspé hope to achieve full economic development on a scale comparable to that attained
by their compatriots in other parts of the
country.
The proposed route starts at Matane, and
leads along the Gaspé north shore in an easterly direction to Ste. Anne des Monts, which
is situated due south of the port of Seven
Islands, on the St. Lawrence north shore.
This railway will be 57 miles long and, under
the present bill, the Canadian National Railways would be authorized to act as agent for
the Government to build, maintain and operate the line which would connect with the
Canadian National Railways' network at Mont
Joli, Quebec, by means of the Canada and
Gulf Terminal Railway. The cost of construction is estimated at $14 million.
The people of that part of the country have
had difficult times in the past. They have
always suffered from a lack of transportation
facilities. Many requests were made to the
Government to correct this situation. The
Chambers of Commerce, the municipal councils, the economic planning councils and many
other associations have expressed their desire to see a railroad built from Matane to
Ste. Anne des Monts.
After having considered the importance of
this area the Government has decided to
comply favourably with these demands. Indeed, it may be pointed out that this bill is
only one of several steps already taken or
being implemented for the specific benefit
of this area of Quebec, particularly by way
of St. Lawrence ferry services and harbour
improvements.
This should bring about considerable traffic
between the two shores of the St. Lawrence
and should accelerate the development of the

MARCN 15. 1962
Gaspé peninsula. Between Mont Joli and
Matane there is a line of about 40 miles
in length, and the addition of the new construction will mean that the territory between Mont Joli and Ste. Anne des Monts
will be served by a railway for a distance
of about 100 miles. More than 100,000 people
are directly concerned with the present bil.
This is an economic developmnent project,
a railway designed ta stimulate the growth
and expansion of the entire Gaspé north
shore economy. In view of the developmental
nature of the project, this bill proposes that
the Canadian National Railway Company
should construct, maintain, manage and operate the new branch line on behaif of the
crown, it being understood that any surplus
or deficit arising ont of such maintenance
and operations will be for the Government's
account and kept separate from the C.N.R.
system accounts. Titis is provided for ln clauses
1 and 5 of this bill.
By clause 2 of the bill and the schedule
to which it refers, the leugth of lime will be
approximately 57 miles, and the cost of construction $14 million.
By clause 3 the Governor in Council will
be authorized to pay ta the compauy an
amount equal ta the entire cost of constructing the railway lime and acquiring the necessary land, but not exceeding, in amy case,
the sum o! $16,100,000. Titis amount represents the estimated cost o! $14 million, plus
15 per cent for coutingencies.
By clause 4 the amount of the payment
authorized shaîl be paid to the company
from time ta tirne at the direction o! the
Governor in Council, upon the report of the
Minister of Transport.
By clause 6 the Minister of Transport shail
present ta Parliament, duriug the flrst 30
days of each session held prior ta the date
of the campletion of the railway, a statement
shawimg ln detail the nature and exteut of
the work dame under the authority o! titis
act.
With respect ta the area ta be served by
the new railway branch lime, it is scarcely
necessary ta point out that experts who have
studied the problems of the lower St. Lawrence district agree that the lack of efficient
transportation has severely restricted economic expansion, particularly in the Gaspé
north shore region. Despite its great wealth
lu natural resources, such as forest products
and minerals, the Gaspé's north coast can
hardly be expected ta keep pace with the
rapid pragress made across the St. Lawrence,
lu the area of Seven Islands, Part Cartier
and Havre St. Pierre, unless its own basic
transportation structure is cousiderably inproved.

The residents o! Gaspé ask no more than
that they be given a f air opportunlty ta make
the most of their skills and resources. These
resources may be briefly itemized as foreat
products, minerals and general merchandise.
I do not think it necessary at this time ta
enter into details o! present and potential
traffic under these categories of commadities
since, if the bill is given second reading, I
shail move that it be re!erred ta the Standing
Committee on Transport and Communications
for detailed study. However, I should like
ta refer ta the importance of year-round
through-rail services ta the economy of the
Gaspé north shore, when it is rememnbered
that the coastal communities have depended
eutirely ou shippiug services in and out, amd
that these services are, un!ortunately, restricted ta the navigation season.
For the reasons I have already mentianed,
I hope that honourable senators wili approve
titis bill. If it is approved, as I say, it will
be referred ta the committee for further
consideration.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I arn very iniuch interested in this
kind o! legislation, because the province of
Quebec has mot been "spoiled" with railway Unes, and the limes ini that province
are, on the average, much shorter than those
in each of the western provinces, according
ta population.
The peninsula o! Gaspé is a vital part ofthe province of Quebec. It is the most eastern part o! it, and was discovered by Jacques Cartier in 1534. Columbus came ta
San Salvador in 1492. It was ouly a f ew
years a!ter that New France was discovered
by Frenchmen who took possession of the.
soil, and since then Gaspé has been the bastion of the province of Quebec, aud one of
the bastions of eastern Canada, together with,
Prince Edward Island and Cape Bretonand I will add New!oundlaud, now that that
province has joined Confederation.
I arn interested in the bill and I arn ready
ta support it, provided I have some assurance
that the railway will be started and will be
completed before December 31, 1964. 1 ask
the sponsor of the bill if he can promise me,
that.
Han. Mr. Méihoi: Well, I can promise you
that the surveyiug will be doue immediately
after the snow has melted titis spring.
Hon. Mr. Pouli: After this bill has passed
ail stages lu this house and has received royal
assent, when will the work be started by the
Canadian National?
Hon. Mr. Méthoi: As I said a moment aga,
I arn informed that they are supposed to.

SENATE
start the surveying immediately it is possible this spring, and the work will be done
afterwards.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: The work will be started
next summer, if I understand you correctly.
Then, I shall support the bill, and I shall
not be the only one to support it. I have
been told that our distinguished colleague,
the honourable senator from Gulf (Hon. Mr.
Power), has also a word to say about it;
but, like me, he wants to have moral
certitude that the work will proceed. Otherwise it will not be a railway; it will be a
balloon in the air, to try to charm the population at the time of the next federal election.
We are serious in this; we want that work
to be done, and to be done for the benefit of
not only the people directly concerned, but
for the benefit of Canada at large.
It would have been a source of revenue
for the Canadian National Railways, had the
work been done before, but I am not going
to elaborate on that. We are passing legislation which is good in itself, and if honourable
senators on the other side of the house take
Lt lightly, I shall oppose the bill as frivolous
legislation. We have to consider it seriously:
if they want to make jokes about it, I shall
vote against it; I am perfectly free. But I
am ready to support it, provided the work
is done, and provided it comes to the rescue
and helps the population of Gaspé.
In many ways previous governments have
done a lot for Gaspé. This seems to be a
good step, provided it is done with real meaning and with a definite purpose. I shall say
more than that: I say that sooner or later the
Gulf and Terminal Railway will have to be
purchased by the Canadian Government, because, under the present circumstances, all
the goods that will be carried from the west
and from Montreal and Quebec to the east,
to Ste Anne des Monts, will have to be conveyed over a line which will be independent
and which may be exacting in its relations
with the dominion Government.
I was struck by a very able and pertinent
question that was put by one of the members,
who asked if an understanding had been
entered into between the Canadian National
Railways and the Gulf and Terminal Railway.
The minister's answer was that there was
none, but there was supposed to be one. Now,
the total cost mentioned by the honourable
gentleman who so ably sponsored the bill
was $14 million. This is the rough estimate
which appears in the schedule to the bill.
However, it is not informative enough. We
should know what would be paid to the Gulf
and Terminal Railway for the right of using
their line for the cars which will come from
the west. It is my personal knowledge and the
knowledge of those in that region, that the

Gulf and Terminal railway has been trying
to sell its stock to the Government or to the
Canadian National Railways for a long time.
If we pass this legislation, as will probably
happen, they will be in a better position to
play the role of Shylock for the pound of
flesh. They will say the railway has to be
built, that such and such a station has been
passed. Some honourable senators have insisted that the work should start soon. Now
they will ask a high price for the use of the
railway. The attitude on the part of the
Canadian National Railways or on the part
of the Government was not businesslike. That
is unfortunate, and I do not know what
they will do. It seems to me that all this
should have been definitely settled before any
legislation was sponsored in Parliament. Now
that I have said that, my conscience is clear.
I welcome this legislation, provided that
it takes effect at the earliest possible dateprobably next summer. It is my experience
that it is very difficult to get new lines built
by the Canadian National Railways. I remember distinctly that when the St. Laurent Government had decided to purchase the Temiscouata railroad no less a man than Mr. Gordon
went to the Board of Transport Commissioners to complain about the decision of the
Government. I found it pretty strong, to use a
euphemism, but nevertheless the line was
bought, it was repaired, and now gives some
very good service and satisfaction to all the
people concerned.
I hope that this line will be proceeded with
and that it will not stop at Ste. Anne des
Monts but will continue to Gaspé in order to
have a circular line right around the Gaspé
peninsula. Not only that, there should be
another line between Ste Anne des Monts
and Chaleur Bay, crossing the Gaspé peninsula, which is full of very rich minerals.
An uncle of mine, who was a city engineer,
was asked in the days gone by, by the
Honourable Rodolphe Lemieux, who was the
member for Gaspé, to make a mineral inspection of the Gaspé Peninsula. He visited the
whole area and made soundings, and he was
the first one to discover oil and various ores
such as lead, zinc, etc. which could be most
profitable.
It has been mentioned that Ste. Anne des
Monts is in front of Seven Islands on the
north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
Seven Islands is the harbour from where
one goes to Schefferville and to all the new
mountain developments of northern Quebec.
In the summertime the steamships cross the
gulf between those two ports.
After the railway extension is built, the
connection between Ste. Anne des Monts
and Seven Islands, and the whole north shore
and Schefferville where there are huge

MARCH 15. 1962
mining activities, will mean great development not only locaily but for the whole of
Canada. It 15 not only as a citizen of the
province of Quebec, but as a Canadian, that
I hope a railway will be built to Ste. Anne
des Monts in the shortest possible time, that
the lîne wîll be extended in due course to
Gaspé, and that there will be another line
which will cross the Gaspé Peninsula between
Ste. Anne des Monts and Chaleur Bay, for
the benefit of Canada at large.
Hon. C. G. Power: Honourable senators, I
was indeed hîghly gratified to hear the words
of my honourable friend from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot). He of all senators
would have reason for being familiar with
the territory which is to be covered by this
railway. He lives closer to it than any of us,
,though in fact this area is within the circumscriptîon which I am allotted as a member
of the Senate.
For that reason, and many others, it is incumbent upon me to say a few words.
I was struck, as I very often am, by the
great polîtical knowledge of my honurable
friend from De la Durantaye, which explains
his anxiety to have some assurance that this
railway is going to be built. I recaîl, as doubtless does my honourable friend, that railways have always been a sort of election bait
flot only in our province but in other provinces, and sometimes the results have been
good.
I remember well as a boy that the representative of Quebec County was Mr. Charles
Fitzpatrick, afterwards Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, Minister of Justice, Chief Justice o!
Canada, and Lieutenant Governor of the
province of Quebec. In his constituency there
was almost an understanding that at every
election there would be the promise that a
railway would be commenced. After inany
years the railway was buiît; it is now known
as the Quebec and Lake St. John Railway
and has opened up the vast territory north
of the province o! Quebec.
As a young man I took Up a sort of crusade
to keep the walls of Quebec in repair. I made
innumerable speeches in the House of Commons asking that those ancient walls be saved.
There was somne objection !rorn the Department of National Defence which was charged
with the duty of looking after defences of
that kind. It was said that to ail intents and
purposes in modern times these walls were
absolutely useless. Nevertheless, I persisted,
and there were mischievous tongues-His
Honour the Speaker is probably aware of
some of thema-which said that it was a surprising coincidence that the walls were aiways repaired just about election time. Perhaps I gave some countenance to that by once

339

pleading that the House of Commons vote
more subsidies for the repair of those wails
lest they crumble and fail, and my waterfront mai ority be swept into the St. Lawrence. Be that as it may, these wails have
been repaired, and today, notwithstanding the
fact that the motivation might flot always
have been of the purest and in the highest
interests of the country, they are a credit
to the city of Quebec, and the Dominion o!
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): And a
credit to the honourable senator fromn Guif.
Hon. Mr. Bruni. He is too modest to say
so himself.
Hon. Mr. Power: In this case the minister
who presented this bill, and my honourable
friend who sponsored it in this chamber (Hon.
Mr. Méthot), were honest and candid enough
to tell us quite frankly that there is no suggestion, for the moment at least, that this
railroad will produce enough revenue to pay
for the cost of maintenance. It is purely and
simply a developmental and expansionist project. May I say, without any endeavour to
make remarks that might flot be well received, that in that respect it resemrbles the
Saskatchewan dam, the Hudson Bay Railway, and I would even go so far as to say
the Chignecto Canal or crossing.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: That has flot been bufit
yet.
Hon. Mr. Power: No, but it is on the wayand the Canso Causeway.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: What about the St. Lawrence Seaway?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: And the whole of the
C.N.R.
Hon. Mr. Power: All of these were projects
for the expansion of the country. 1 might even
go so far as to say that some railway projects
buiît by private enterprise, such as the
Arnaud Railway and the Wabush Lake Railway were not intended to be railroads which
of themselves would produce sufficient revenue to justify their building, but they do
open up vast expanses of territory. The territory in this case is the Gaspé, and it has
been neglected, as my honourable friend from
De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) has said,
f or years and years.
This area is rich in minerais. Noranda is
developing a very considerable mine in Murdochville. Mr. Beauchemin of the East Sullivan Mine is developing a mine quite close
to it, and there are a number of others. It is
my understanding that there are about 75
sawmills in the vicinity, and a considerable
wealth o! pulpwood and forest products.

SENATE
I know of my own knowledge that some
years ago certain people were interested in
the Gaspé Peninsula to the extent that they
purchased 200 or 300 miles of limits and some
freehold land in the vicinity of Ste. Anne des
Monts, but they were obliged to give up their
investment at some loss, or at least without
any great profit, some years afterwards because there was a lack of communication with
the outside world and they would not have
been able to operate profitably the sawmills
they intended to establish.
This project, honourable senators, when
looked at in the light of what has been fairly
and squarely presented by the minister and
by the honourable sponsor (Hon. Mr. Méthot),
is for the expansion and development of a
section of the country that needs it, and which
deserves to be recognized at last. It is a
project that deserves the support of this house.
Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourable
senators, I know nothing at all about the
matter that we are discussing here so far as
Quebec is concerned, but I was glad to hear
the remarks of the senator from Gulf (Hon.
Mr. Power), in which he gave some justification for supporting this measure, because, as
a citizen of the province of New Brunswick, I
know that in that province the policy of expansion has been reversed. The policy there
has been restrictive rather than expansive.
In New Brunswick railroads which will not
produce revenues have not been built, and on
a great many lines the services have been
abandoned. My honourable friend who lives at
Fredericton Junction (Hon. Mr. McGrand)
cannot now travel on a train to the city of
Fredericton, the capital of the province of
New Brunswick, because Fredericton has no
passenger service. That is an outrage. I look
across at my honourable friend from Royal
(Hon. Mr. Brooks) and my honourable friend
from Saint John-Albert (Hon. Mr. Emerson), and say that nothing like that happened
under the previous Government. We in the
province of New Brunswick are proud of
Fredericton. It is one of the most charming
cities of Canada, but today it is without
railway passenger service because the Canadian National Railways and the Canadian
Pacific Railway Company cannot afford to
supply it.

senator from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr.
Pouliot), I was pleased to hear from the honourable senator from Gulf (Hon. Mr. Power)
why he feels justified in supporting the bill.
I do hope this railway will not meet the
same fate as railways in the province of New
Brunswick have in the last five years.

COMPANY-

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
with the consent of the house I would ask
that this order be proceeded with ahead of
item No. 8 on the Order Paper.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Olive L. Irvine moved the second
reading of Bill S-14, respecting Canada
Security Assurance Company.
She said: Honourable senators, in moving
the second reading of this bill I wish to
say that its purpose is to amend the act
of incorporation of Canada Security Assurance Company, which firm was incorporated
by chapter 85, Statutes of Canada, 1920.
Canada Security Assurance Company is
a firm with its head office in the city of
Toronto. It has been carrying on the business
of fire, automobile and certain other classes
of casualty insurance since the time of its
incorporation.
The first purpose of the bill is te increase
the authorized capital of the company from
$1 million to $2 million. I might add here
that the present paid-up capital is $750,000.
Secondly, the bill repeals section 5 of the
act of incorporation and substitutes a new
section which contains an expanded list of
types or classes of insurance which may
hereafter be carried on by the company.
Originally the company was entitled to carry
on the business of fire and automobile insurance, together with eight other classes. The
bill adds an additional sixteen classes of

In spite of the eloquence of the sponsor to be made in paid-up capital in regard to
(Hon. Mr. Méthot) and of the honourable various classes. For instance, section 6 (1)

MARCH 15, 1962
provides that when the paid-up capital is
at least $750,000 the company may transact
certain classes of insurance.
Subsection (2) provides that the company
shall not commence business in certain other
classes of insurance which are authorized
by section 5 until certain amounts as set
out in the subsection are added to the paid-up
capital and surplus.
Then, there is a final provision of subsection (3) to the effect that, notwithstanding
the provisions of subsection (2) requiring
these specific amounts to be paid in, the
company is authorized to transact all the
classes of insurance referred to in section 5
when the paid-up capital and surplus amounts
to at least $1 million.
If second reading is given to this bill,
I shall move that it be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I compliment
the honourable senator on the clarity with
which she bas explained this bill. I understood her to say that the authorized capital
of the company is now $1 million, but I
see in the explanatory notes that the present
authorized capital of the company is $500,000
and may be increased to $1 million. Has
the authorized capital been so increased?
Hon. Mrs. Irvine: I am unaware of that,
but I am certain that this matter will be
fully covered when the bill is in committee.

POLARIS PIPE LINES-SECOND READING

Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson moved the
second reading of Bill S-13, to incorporate
Polaris Pipe Lines.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to incorporate a pipe line company for the transport of natural gas from
parts of western Canada to markets in the
United States.
It is intended that the project will be a
large diameter natural gas pipe line which
will originate in the gradually-developing
gas reserve areas of northeastern British
Columbia, and terminate at the United StatesCanadian boundary near Estevan, Saskatchewan. At this point the gas will become
available for eventual delivery to the markets
of the mid-west United States.
There are five persons named as applicants
for incorporation of the company, three of

them being executives of gas companies residing in the province of Alberta, all Canadian
citizens, and two of them being lawyers in
the city of Ottawa.
As is the case with all Canadian pipe line
corporations, the bill provides that the majority of the directors of the company shall
at all times be persons resident in Canada
and Canadian citizens.
The capital stock of the company is to
consist of: (a) 10 million common shares
without nominal or par value; and, (b) 500,000
preferred shares of the par value of $100
per share.
The head office of the company is to be
at the city of Calgary in the province of
Alberta.
In regard to the powers of the company,
these are stipulated to be subject to all the
limitations, liabilities and provisions of the
National Energy Board Act and any other
general legislation related to pipe lines enacted by Parliament.
The remainder of the bill contains pretty
much the usual provisions required in an act
to incorporate a pipe line company, namely,
it gives the company power to construct, purchase, lease or otherwise acquire and operate
a pipe line for the gathering, transmitting,
transporting, etc. of gases, oil and related
substances.
As I mentioned before, it is intended
that the pipe line in question will originate
in the vicinity of Fort Nelson in northeastern
British Columbia, and travel for a distance of
approximately 1,200 miles before reaching
the Canadian-United States border. Consequently, you will observe that the proposed
pipe line will travel diagonally from northwest to southeast, across part of the northeast
corner of the province of British Columbia,
across all of Alberta, and also diagonally
across part of Saskatchewan.
It is to be a 36-inch pipe line, and the
cost of the development is estimated to be
in the range of $400 million.
As is well known, the Trans-Canada pipe
line system originates at the Alberta-Saskatchewan border, whereas the origin of the
proposed pipe line is approximately 700 miles
to the northwest, namely in the vicinity of
Fort Nelson in British Columbia.
As honourable senators are aware, there
are three main gas exporting pipe line systems
currently in operation in Canada: firstly,
Trans-Canada Pipe Lines, originating at the
Alberta-Saskatchewan border, which exports
natural gas to the mid-western American
market; secondly, the West Coast Transmission Company Limited, which originates in
the Fort St. John area of British Columbia
and transports gas to the British Columbia
coastal area and thence south for export at

SENATE
the Canadian-United States boundary; thirdly,
the Alberta and Southern Gas Company
Limited operation, which exports gas from
western Canada to California.
At this point I should mention that Canadian natural gas reserves have in the past
few years been increasing at a very high
rate, and it has become evident that unless
new and substantial markets are developed,
the gas industry may curtail its exploration
and development activity in western Canada.
Who are the members of the sponsoring
group of the Polaris Pipe Lines project? They
are mainly officials of a firm operating in
western Canada under the name of Canadian Industrial Gas Limited, together with
various personnel of its affiliates and associates. They represent, as I am informed,
an experienced and knowledgeable group of
Canadians who have been actively engaged in
the Canadian natural gas industry virtually
since its inception.
As is well known, the natural gas industry
in Canada is young-indeed, not over 10
years old. Consequently, there exist in this
country very few persons who have all the
qualities which are required to initiate,
sponsor and develop a project of this type and
magnitude.
More will be said, of course, about the
sponsoring group when this bill is before
committee. However, just a few words in
regard to the magnitude of this development.
It is expected that the daily capacity of the
pipe line will be between 750 million and
950 million cubic feet per day. It will require
the purchase of apnroximately 10 trillion
cubic feet in natural gas reserves within the
next five to seven years.
The cost of exploration, development, processing and gathering will total several
hundreds of millions of dollars. Long-term
gas purchase contracts over a 25-year period
will be in excess of many hundreds of millions
of dollars.
I am informed by the sponsors that approaches have been made by their groups to
most of the producers who are carrying out,
or plan to carry out, the extensive exploration and development programs to prove up
such large reserves.
The long-range aspects are recognized, and
the general consensus so far has been that a
project of this magnitude must be initiated
several years in advance of estimated completion dates to ensure that reserves in
deliverable quantities are available when
other presently used reserves are depleted
and become insufficient to serve market
growth.
Another point which should be observed
in regard to a project such as this is that it

will provide a very great incentive to continued exploration and development of the
oil resources of the far north. The publication entitled, "Schedule of Wells, N.W.T. and
Yukon Territory," published by the Department of Northern Affairs, 1920-1960, shows
a total of 207 wells drilled and 273 structures
test holes completed. It seems essential, therefore, to provide possibilities of markets for
these outlying areas where independent companies may acquire acreage to explore and
develop. This proposed project should provide this and greatly stimulate far northern
activities.
It should also be noted that with the
establishment of the National Energy Board,
all necessary protection by regulation is now
assured to the public of Canada with regard
to Canadian requirements, namely, gas reserve development, line exploration and
routing, tariffs and rates of return, as well
as methods of financing and Canadian ownership participation. In other words, the incorporation of a pipe line company in Canada
today is merely the beginning of a venture
in the transportation of oil or natural gas.
The various other factors which I have referred to are now placed in the hands of the
National Energy Board.
In regard to the present interest in production of petroleum and natural gas in northeastern British Columbia, no less than 19 of
the largest companies on this continent are
interested and are actual or potential producers in the area, either individually or as
joint venturers. Furthermore, in the Northwest Territories and the Yukon, 17 large
companies are represented in the producing
role.
It might also be mentioned-indeed it is a
matter of some importance-that the quality
of the gas in the northerly areas is less complex than that to the south, and therefore
requires less costly processing facilities and
does not present problems of marketing high
sulphur or by-product content.
Furthermore, I am informed that although
there is a continuing and widespread exploration activity in these northern areas, nevertheless, several of the companies have
indicated that they do not wish to accelerate
or increase development projects until there
is a definite indication of a pipe line project
of the type and size envisaged by the Polaris
Pipe Lines project, because they do not consider present pipe line outlets will provide
sufficient additional markets to justify such
expenditures for many years to come.
What about gas reserves in the areas that
I have referred to? Natural gas reserves
estimates by producer company geologists
and independent consultants range from 30
trillion to 80 trillion cubic feet of reserves

MARCH 15, 1962
for the far northern area of British Columbia
alone, and the potential of the Northwest
Territories and northern Alberta is suggested
to be as many trillions more.
In its "First Report", dated October 1958,
the Royal Commission on Energy stated:
The evidence suggests that it is reasonable to anticipate under favourable
economic conditions, an ultimate discovery of some 300 trillion cubic feet of
natural gas in the western Canada sedimentary basin.
I might observe that since the time of this
report, considerable exploration and development has occurred in western Canada, which
strongly supports the commission's figures.
With regard to markets, in a report issued
in January 1962 by the Department of
Northern Affairs and National Resources, and
entitled "Economics of Oil and Gas Development in Northern Canada", the author, Dr.
G. David Quirin, deals in chapter 7 with
"Markets for Northern Gas", and points out
that "market growth in North America is
also expected to continue"; and in Table 59
he compares the total annual marketed production for 1950 of 13,463.4 trillion cubic feet
with annual estimated totals of 15,787 trillion
cubic feet in 1965, 19,123 trillion cubic feet
in 1970, 23,477 trillion in 1975, and 28,701
trillion in 1980. That, of course, represents
the consumption on the North American continent.
The Hon. the Speaker: Let us remain within
the scope of the bill, and not go too far afield.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I think all these matters, honourable senators, are quite within
the scope of the bill because I believe they
are basic to the question of whether it should
pass this house.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And they are very interesting.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Now, in Table 60 Dr.
Quirin sets out the "Life Index of U.S. Gas
Reserves 1950-1960", which confirms the future need for additional sources of gas reserves outside of the United States if the
natural gas industry is only to maintain its
share of the total energy market, let alone
continue to expand. With reference to Table
59, "Natural Gas Reserves and Marketed Production North America, 1959", the author remarks:
Table 59 shows that Area 2, Western
Canada, is the only area on the continent
having, at the present time, gas reserves
substantially in excess of those required
to provide for the normal growth of
existing markets.
It should be clear that a difficult problem
may exist in regard to the exact timing of a

new natural gas market entry from Canada
into the United States. That will depend on
the rates of market growth as well as the
rates of depletion and discovery of U.S. gas
reserves. However, in view of the past histories of formations and completions of other
large pipe line projects, it is certain that at
least five years will be required to develop
and bring this project into operation, once
it has obtained a corporate status. In other
words, this project would not likely be shipping gas into the United States prior to the
year 1967.
Let me say a word or two about capital
cost and financing. Preliminary studies indicate that a 1200-mile 36-inch diameter pipe
line from the Fort Nelson area of northern
British Columbia to a delivery point on the
international boundary in the vicinity of
Estevan, Saskatchewan, would require a capital expenditure in the order of $400 million.
It should also be emphasized that this project,
unlike its predecessors, is in a position to
purchase within Canada all its Canadian pipe
requirements, estimated at approximately
$170 million. I am informed that it is the
intent of the sponsors that purchases will be
made in Canada of Canadian material and
equipment whenever available and suitable.
It is also their intention to employ Canadian
personnel and services to the fullest extent
that these are qualified and available.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Are they going to give
us a guarantee to that effect?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I am afraid that
might not be easy to do.
It should be clear to us all that very considerable benefits accrue to the communities
through which a pipe line is constructed,
both by way of employment, the purchase of
materials and rights-of-way, and, not least,
the assessment and taxes paid to municipalities which a project like this traverses.
In regard to financing, it may be observed
from the bill that provision is made for a
large amount of equity capital which will, of
course, combine with debt capital in the
ultimate financing of the project.
I am aware of the fact that a great deal
more needs to be said in regard to this bill
before it is finally passed in this house. As
honourable senators are well aware, if the
bill receives second reading here, a motion
will be made to refer it for further close
scrutiny to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, before which committee the applicants for incorporation and
any other persons who may wish to be heard
may present their views on it.

PRIVATE BILL
THE CANADIAN INDEMNITY COMPANY AND
THE CANADIAN FIRE INSURANCE COMPANYSECOND READING

Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson moved the
second reading of Bill S-15, respecting The
Canadian Indemnity Company and the Canadian Fire Insurance Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill provides for the amalgamation of two insurance
companies, The Canadian Indemnity Company
and the Canadian Fire Insurance Company,
each of which has its head office in the city
of Winnipeg. The amalgamation is being made
under the provisions of section 108 of the
Canadian and British Insurance Companies
Act, by virtue of an agreement between the
two companies entered into on July 26, 1961.
The bill, as well as effecting an amalgamation, would also create a new corporation,
referred to as "the continuing corporation",
under the name of The Canadian Indemnity
Company, and, in French, L'Indemnité Compagnie Canadienne. The continuing corporation is to have all the powers of the predecessor corporations and is entitled to carry on
the combined businesses of the predecessor
corporations and may transact the business of
insurance in all its forms and branches, except
that of life insurance. The continuing corporation will, of course, also possess all the
property and assets of the predecessor corporations and will be subject to all their contracts
and liabilities.

The two predecessor companies are among
the oldest fire and casualty insurance companies in western Canada. The Canadian Fire
Insurance Company was incorporated as a
provincial company and started business in
1895, and secured a dominion charter in 1897.
The Canadian Indemnity Company was incorporated and commenced business in 1912.
The amalgamation itself has presented comparatively few problems of any great difficulty, for the reason that practically all the
shares of both companies are owned by one
owner, a corporation, namely, United Canadian Shares Limited. These are, in fact, sister
companies and have always operated in the
same office and pretty much by the same
staffs.
The authorized share capital of The Canadian Indemnity Company is $1 million, divided into 100,000 shares of a par value of
$10 each, of which there are 50,000 issued and
outstanding as fully paid. The authorized
capital of the Canadian Fire Insurance Company is also $1 million, divided into 100,000
shares of the par value of $10 each, all of
which are presently issued and outstanding
as fully paid. The authorized capital of the
continuing corporation is $5 million divided
into 500,000 shares of a par value of $10
each.
The consideration being paid in regard to
amalgamation is by the issue of shares in the
continuing corporation for the outstanding
shares in the predecessor companies. The
number of shares being issued by the continuing corporation for the shares of the predecessor corporations is 150,000. The basis
of amalgamation will, therefore, be threequarters of a share of stock in the new
company for every share outstanding in the
Canadian Fire Insurance Company, and one
and one-half shares of stock in the new company for every share outstanding in The
Canadian Indemnity Company.
As I mentioned earlier, the amalgamation
is being effected under the terms of an agreement made between the two predecessor
companies and dated July 26, 1961. This
agreement was entered into subject, of course,
to final ratification by the enactment of this
bill approving the terms of the agreement
and incorporating the continuing corporation.
I mentioned at the outset of these remarks
that the two predecessor corporations are
two of the oldest fire and casualty insurance
companies doing business in western Canada.
Their size may be judged from the fact that,
although the capitalization appears quite modest, their gross premium income for the
year 1961 was more than $17 million.
For the information of honourable senators, I might observe that the head office of
both predecessor companies is in the city of

MARCH 20, 1962
Winnipeg. As early as 1898 tbe Canadian Fire
Insurance Company, whicb is the older, extended its operations to, the Maritime provinces, to Newfoundland and ta British Columbia, and in 1899 bad establisbed a brancb
offIce in Toronto. I make tbese remarks to
indicate that some of our insurance companies
in western Canada started ta, expand to
otber parts o! Canada, and indeed to otber
parts of tbe world, many years ago.
In 1926, this company entered the United
States market and proceeded ta build up a
very considerable business in the states of
California, Washington and Oregon, and later
secured a licence and commenced to, do
business in Alaska.. During the hast decade
this company extended its activities further
afield, and at tbe present time it is licensed
in eight provinces of Canada and in twentytwo states of tbe United States of America.
The United States head office of the company
is hocated in Los Angeles, Cahifornia.
The Canadian Indemnity Company also
carnies on business tbrougbout Canada and as
wehh in nearly bal o! the states of tbe
United States o! America.
Considering tbe fact tbat the ownersbip
o! these companies is the same, and tbey
carry on business side by side, tbe advantages
of amalgamation are deemed to be as follows:
(1) Tbe elimînation of duplicate licence fees
and duplicate accounting systems, savings in
stationery, policy forms, printing and so fortb;
(2) competitive advantages in baving one
larger company; (3) greater freedom ta operate in tbe United States; (4) more impact on
advertislng as a resuit of stressing one name
instead of two.
In closing tbese remarks I would 1l*ike to
add-and I arn sure the western senators are
aware of the facts to wbicb I shail refertbat tbe two predecessor companies bave for
practically two generations been an important factor in tbe business and commercial life of the city o! Winnipeg, and tbeir
awnersbip bas rested witb people and familles
who bave an enviable record o! distinguisheci
service in the community o! Winnipeg and
indeed in western Canada.
Honourable senators, if this bill receives
second reading, I sball propose tbat it be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce wbere I am sure any
information tbat may be reciuired by bonourable senators will be given.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
this is quite an interesting bill from the
point o! view o! a practising lawyer. I see
that the amalgamation is to take place under
the provisions o! section 108 o! the Canadian
and British Insurance Companies Act. I arn
not aware o! any previous occasion upon

whicb that section bas been made use of,
but there may be some cases. In my 25
years in this bouse I do not remember
any case in which there bas been a bill
of similar character; so, perhaps we are
breaking new ground.
I take it that my bonourable friend will
obtain the opinion of our Law Clerk as to
whetber ail the necessary formalities have
been complied with in order that section 108
rnay properly apply under the circumstances.
I notice also that the scbedule to the billwhicb is the agreement that the bill seeks
to sanction-provides, in section 16, that
the agreement shahl be submitted for the
sanction of the Treasury Board of the Government of Canada and, apparently, that is
to be done before the bill is introduced in
Parliament.
May I ask my bonourable friend if the
sanction of the Treasury Board has been obtained?
Han. Mr. Thorvaldson: Yes, I believe so.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If my bonourable
friend will look at sections 16 and 17, apParently the approval of the Treasury Board
is a prerequisite to the bill being introduced.
0f course he will have te, satisfy our legal
department that that has been done.
I further assume that the matter bas been
discussed and cleared with the Superintendent of Insurance. Perbaps it would be an
advantage, wben the bill is before tbe committee, to, have the Superintendent of Insurance present to, give us bis views on the
bull. As honourable senators know, we pay
a great deal of attention to, tbe views whicb
he expresses in matters relating to insurance
companies.
Hon. Mr. Thorvadson: In reply toi my
honourable friend for Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen), may I say that bis remarks are
a good indication of the sbrewdness witb
wbicb be bas followed the proceedings in
tbis bouse since be bas been a member o! it,
for be is quite rigbt in saying that this is
tbe flrst time an amalgamation bas taken
place in the manner in wbicb it bas been
done bere. I must say that I arn quite amazed
tbat my honourable friend was able to pick
out that fact so quickly.
Furtber, I may say tbat tbe various factors
of this amalgamation bave been worked out
in great detail by Winnipeg counsel for the
company, and its officers and accountants,
witb Mr. MacGregor, the Superintendent of
Insurance, and other officiais of bis department.
As I said, it is quite true tbat tbis is the
first occasion upon wbicb an amalgamation

SENATE
has been effected in this manner, and of
course the bill will now go to committee
where it will be further explained.
Hon. John G. Higgins: I notice that section
8 of the schedule states:
The assets of each of the predecessor
corporations and the liabilities to which
the same are subject are as particularly
set forth in their respective balance
sheets as of December 31, 1960...
What will be the position with respect to
the assets and liabilities, if a change has
taken place since December 31, 1960?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: The honourable senator from St. John's East (Hon. Mr. Higgins)
has asked a very good question. Of course,
it is true that in the period of a year there
might be changes in the assets of each of
these companies, but since the ownership of
these two companies is identical, that is,
within a fraction of 1 per cent, it really makes
no difference in regard to the continuing
corporation whether or not there has been
any change in these assets since the time of
the publication of the last balance sheet
prior to the agreement of July 26, 1961.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I suppose the reason
for the selection of the date, December 31,
1960, in the section to which my honourable
friend has referred, is because the agreement
itself is dated July 26, 1961, and that the
last available balance sheet at that date was
as of December 31 preceding.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Honourable senators, there
is only one feature of this bill that concerns
me. I have looked into the agreement rather
hurriedly, and I cannot find in it any clause
which will protect all the employees of both
companies. My understanding is that in an
amalgamation such as this, provision is usually made for all the employees of both companies, in order to protect them in their
present positions.
Motion agreed to and bill read second
time.

He said: Honourable senators, this report,
which relates to an employee of the Library
of Parliament, recommends the approval of
the report of the Civil Service Commission
providing for an adjustment in the salary of
Miss Yvette D. Chevrier from $4,380 to $4,560
per annum, in order to bring it into line with
the salary rate of Cataloguing Librarians 1,
who commenced employment at a later date
and at an annual salary of $4,560. The purpose of this civil service report is to correct
an injustice caused by the commission's decision to recruit librarians at the higher rate
of $4,560 per annum.
Report approved.
THIRD REPORT APPROVED

Hon. Mr. Bruni moved that the third report
of the committee be approved.
He said: Honourable senators, this report is
much longer than the first and relates to a
number of employees of the Library of
Parliament. It recommends the approval of
the report of the Civil Service Commission
providing for salary increases for a number
of classes of professional librarians in the
Library of Parliament, in order to bring them
into line with similar classes in other branches
of the Government service which have already received salary increases.
I would point out to honourable senators
that this report has already been approved
in the other place. The approval of both
houses is required in order for persons in
these classes to receive the increases.
Report approved.

tical farmers there.

MARCH 20, 1962
Hon. Mr. White: The present bill is considerably different from the two previous
bills. As the explanatory notes to the bill
state, it does not apply to cash loans, mortgages on real estate, etc. However, I take it
that this bill would apply in the case of sales
of goods where a chattel mortgage is taken
back.
While this bill represents a change in that
respect, there remains the important question as to whether or not these provisions
are within the jurisdiction of the federal Parliament.
In introducing the bill, the honourable
member from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr.
Crol) put three points very clearly. As reported at page 142 of Senate Hansard, in the
first column, he states:
The sole purpose of the bill is to require every person who carries on the
business of extending consumer credit
to disclose in writing to the consumer of
such credit the total cost thereof, expressed both as a lump sum and in terms
of simple annual interest.
The second point was made clear by him
on the same page, in the same column. He
stated:
Furthermore, no criminal liability
would flow from non-compliance with the
bill, but in the face of non-disclosure, a
credit financier would be unable to recover or retain any finance charges whatsoever on any unpaid balance in respect
of which he has extended credit.
On the same page, in the second column,
the honourable senator dealt with his third
point, and stated:
This bill does not attempt to control
consumer credit or interest.
Honourable senators, it seems clear that
the bill now before us does not attempt in
any way to control interest and that there is
now no criminal liability under the bill.
Therefore, it is most difficult to find any
provision in it which would bring it under
federal jurisdiction.
This bill deals mainly with conditional sale
contracts and agreements. In the main, it
provides that the purchaser of consumer
credit is to be given a statement containing
certain information before the transaction is
completed. Everyone will agree that the large
majority of conditional sale contracts covers
three different classes of articles, namely,
motor vehicles, electrical appliances, and
furniture. I submit that anything having to
do with these items clearly has to do with
a matter of property and civil rights and
therefore comes under the jurisdiction of the
provincial legislature.
26211-3-23

The honourable senator from TorontoSpadina in presenting this bill is reported at
page 146 of Senate Hansard as follows:
Honourable senators, this bill does not
cover cash loans, banking transactions,
mortgages or real estate transactions.
They are dealt with federally by the
Bank Act, the Loan Companies Act, and
the Small Loans Act, and it is at least
arguable that should provision for disclosure be considered desirable in those
fields, the specific acts themselves should
be amended accordingly.
I do not disagree with that, because there
the honourable senator was dealing entirely
with federal acts. However, he went on to
state:
At any rate, the present bill deals
exclusively with the extension of credit
in respect of any unpaid balance arising
out of any agreement for the sale of
goods or for the provision of services. I
need hardly remind this house that consumer credit constitutes a very considerable segment of our economy and that it
is not regulated federally.
The honourable senator makes it quite clear
that this bill deals entirely with the extension of credit for the unpaid balance arising
out of an agreement on the sale of goods,
and he states further that consumer credit
is not regulated federally. I would go a
little further than that and say that at the
present time, as far as the province of Ontario
is concerned, consumer credit is regulated to
a certain degree. The sale of goods which
takes place before there can be a conditional
sale contract is covered in Ontario by the
Conditional Sales Act. As the honourable senator pointed out, if it is necessary to have
disclosure about banking, the proper procedure is to amend the Bank Act. My contention is that, under the Conditional Sales
Act of Ontario consumer credit is controlled
to a certain degree, and that any new provisions dealing with consumer credit should
be introduced by way of an amendment to
that act. Furthermore, I am advised that
some other provinces have legislation which
is very similar to that contained in the
Ontario act.
The Ontario Conditional Sales Act has been
in force for many years. It goes into great
detail and sets out very clearly the law in
that province affecting conditional sale contracts and agreements-which really means
the law dealing with consumer credit. I wish
to indicate briefly some of the things dealt
with in the Ontario act. It says, first, that the
contract must be in writing; secondly, it must
be signed by the purchaser or his agent; and,
thirdly, the terms and conditions of the sale

SENATE
must be stated. The goods must be described.
The contract must be registered within ten
days of its being executed, and a renewal
statement must be filed if the contract is for
more than three years.
I ask you, honourable senators, to note the
exact wording. The contract must state "the
terms and conditions of the sale". What does
"the terms and conditions of the sale" mean?
The honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden), during the speech of the
honourable senator from Winnipeg North
(Hon. Mr. Wall), put on Hansard at page 319
certain information as to what a conditional
sale contract contains. I do not wish to repeat
that information, and I am quite sure that
all honourable senators are familiar with the
terms in the ordinary conditional sale contract
with respect to the sale of electrical appliances, motor cars, and things of that
nature. All the items contained in this bill's
definition of "finance charges" are set out on
the conditional sale contract forms used in
the province of Ontario and, in addition, the
first two items in clause 3 of the bill are also
set out.
By paragraph (a) of clause 3 of this bill
the person extending credit is required to
furnish the person receiving it a clear statement in writing setting forth the total amount
of the unpaid balance outstanding. That is
already provided for in the form of conditional sale agreement used in Ontario.
Paragraph (b) of clause 3 requires the furnishing of a clear statement in writing of the
total amount of the finance charges to be
borne by such borrower in connection with
the transaction. The ordinary conditional sale
agreement form used in Ontario contains that
information.
It is for that reason, honourable senators,
that I suggest what is being sought by the
honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina
(Hon. Mr. Croll) under this bill could be
obtained quite properly by an amendment to
the Conditional Sales Act of Ontario, to be
inserted immediately following subsection
(1) (a) of section 2 which requires the contract to be evidenced by a writing, signed by
the purchaser or his agent, stating the terms
and conditions of the sale and describing the
goods sold.
Hon. Mr. Reid: On what date was that
provincial act passed?
Hon. Mr. White: I could not give the honourable senator the date, but it was in the
provincial statutes long before I started to
practise law. It has been in existence for a
very long time.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: For more than ten years.
Hon. Mr. White: Yes.

The Conditional Sales Act of Ontario goes
on to provide that a copy of the contract must
be delivered to the purchaser, and also that
with respect to any contract for more than
three years there must be renewal statement
filed with the clerk of the county or district
court. It is interesting to note that there
must be set out in that renewal statement,
namely, (a) the name and residence of the
seller and the name and residence of the
purchaser, (b) a brief description of the goods,
(c) the amount of the contract price and an
itemized statement of all payments, if any,
made on account thereof, and the unpaid
balance. In addition to that the statement must
be sworn.
Honourable senators, I would like to draw
your attention next to this most important
provision with respect to consumer credit and
the sale of consumer goods, to the effect
that in all of these sales the title to the
goods remains in the vendor. It becomes important, therefore, to know what happens and
what the procedure is when default is made.
This aspect is fully covered by the Ontario
act, which provides that where the seller retakes possession of goods for breach of contract he must retain those goods for twenty
days, the purchaser being able to redeem them
within that period of time by paying the
amount then in arrears together with interest
and the actual cost and expenses of taking
and keeping possession.
The act further provides that where the
purchase price of the goods exceeds $30, and
the seller intends to look to the purchaser for
any deficiency on resale, the goods shall not
be resold until after notice in writing of the
intention to sell bas been given to the purchaser or his successor in interest. The act
clearly sets out that the notice must contain:
(a) a brief description of the goods;
(b) an itemized statement of the balance
of the contract price due and the actual
costs and expenses of taking and keeping
possession up to the time of the notice;
(c) a demand that the amount as stated
in the notice shall be paid on or before
a day mentioned, which day shall not
be less than twenty days from the day
of retaking possession of the goodsIn addition, it provides that the notice must
be served on the purchaser, such service being
made either personally, or by leaving the
notice at his last known residence, or sending
it to him by prepaid registered mail.
I point out, however, honourable senators,
that one of the things that must be shown
is the actual cost of taking and keeping the
goods in possession, and these costs are

MARCH 20, 1962
provided for by the Costs of Distress Act
which is chapter 74 of the Revised Statutes
of Ontario, 1960.
There are many provisions in this Conditional Sales Act, honourable senators, and I
have cited only a few of them to show the
full and complete manner in which the
Ontario Legislature has attempted to deal
with consumer credit. If the bill before us
covers chattel mortgages, then I would mention that the Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgages Act of Ontario covers all matters with
respect to a chattel mortgage.
I cannot agree with the remarks made by
the honourable
senator from TorontoSpadina (Hon. Mr. Croîl) and the honourable
senator from Winnipeg North (Hon. Mr.
Wall) that "cost of a loan" as defined in the
Small Loans Act and "finance charges" as
defined in the bill now before the Senate
are synonymous with interest charges. In
the Small Loans Act the definition of the cost
of a loan includes no fewer than ten different
items, of which one is interest. It provides:
"Cost" of a loan means the whole of
the cost of the loan to the borrower
whether the same is called interest or
is claimed as discount, deduction from
an advance, commission, brokerage, chattel mortgage and recording fees, fines,
penalties or charges for inquiries, defaults or renewals or otherwiseIt is certainly a full description. In his
bill the honourable senator from TorontoSpadina (Hon. Mr. Croil) has set out some
of these items but in order to be sure that
every possible item is covered he concludes
the definition of finance charges with the
words, "and any other type of charge".
Hon. Mr. Bruni: It is a scoop shovel.
Hon. Mr. White: In Ontario we have the
Unconscionable Transactions Relief Act, chapter 410 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario,
1960, which provides that an individual may
apply to the court for relief where the costs
of a loan are deemed to be excessive. It is
interesting to note the definition of the cost
of a loan in this act, as follows:
"cost of the loan" means the whole cost
to the debtor of money lent and includes
interest, discount, subscription, premium,
dues, bonus, commission, brokerage fees
and charges, but not actual lawful and
necessary disbursements made to a registrar of deeds, a master or local master of
titles, a clerk of a county or district court,
a sheriff or a treasurer of a municipality ...

Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask a question?
Hon. Mr. White: Yes.
26211-3-23J

Hon. Mr. Reid: Is Ontario the only province
which has legislation of that kind?
Hon. Mr. White: I am informed that a number of other provinces have a Conditional
Sales Act, several of which are practically
identical to the Ontario statute.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. White: In dealing with the definition of "finance charges" in Bill S-2, I would
like to refer briefly to an example of insurance under an ordinary conditional sale agreement. As you know, in these agreements there
are often two insurance policies. There is the
premium or charge for group-creditor insurance on the purchaser's life. This is a type of
policy whereby the life of the purchaser is
insured for the lifetime of the contract. The
premium is very low and in the event of the
death of the purchaser the contract is paid
in full. I am sure few people would fail to
recognize the benefits of such a plan, and certainly anyone who practises law, at least in
the country, will have had a number of cases
reflecting the advantage of such a policy. As
I have said, the charge would be very moderate in any case.
The second insurance premium under an
ordinary conditional sale agreement for the
sale of a motor car would be to cover fire,
theft, and collision damage. As honourable
senators are aware, the amount of premium
for this insurance varies depending on the
type of car, whether it is new or used, the age
of the driver, and whether persons under the
age of 25 years will drive the car. Depending
on these factors, this policy could vary from
$40 to $60 per annum. I would simply point
out that if there is a contract for the sale of
a motor car over a period of 24 or 36 months
there would have to be insurance premiums
for as long as three years, but the purchaser
could pay his premium only once a year. It
would seem to me that it would be rather
difficult, before the transaction is completed,
for the vendor to give the purchaser a clear
and correct statement which would include
the insurance premium covering two, three or
perhaps four years.
I have mentioned these facts about insurance to show the extent to which the honourable senator is endeavouring to interpret
finance charges to be interest. As a previous
speaker pointed out, it is important to remember that in some of these insurance policies, whether on the purchaser's life or on a
motor car, the insurance is not arranged by
the vendor of the goods but by an insurance
agent who receives the premium for the
policy. I consider that the purchaser of a
motor car who takes out an insurance policy
is simply paying the premium for protection

SENATE
in exactly the same manner as an individual
who pays a premium on a life insurance
policy he has taken out.
Bill S-2 provides that before a transaction
is complete the credit financier must furnish
a statement, but the sponsor of the bill did
not indicate in any way as to when he believed such contract would be complete. Some
would say that the transaction is complete
when the purchaser has signed the conditional
sale agreement. Others would say it would be
on delivery of the goods, or perhaps when
the conditional sale agreement is registered,
or when the purchaser receives a copy of the
contract. The two Ontario statutes I have
referred to, the Conditional Sales Act and the
Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgages Act, contain sample copies of the form which is to be
registered, but in the bill before us provision
is made under section 5 for regulations to be
passed by the Governor in Council covering
three items set forth in that section. I do
not believe that is sufficient. The form or
manner of the statement, whatever it may be,
should be incorporated in the bill, and the
method of calculating the total amount of the
finance charges and so on should be in the
bill, as should· the degree of accuracy.
In section 2 of the bill, which deals with
provision of services, the mover has given
no explanation as to what services are
covered. A good many services could be
covered. I would just like to suggest one,
though you may think it is rather far-fetched.
In the province of Ontario, for the past
year or two, there have been great developments in the installation of gas for heating
homes. I would take it that a gas company
would come under this act, because it is a
corporation. It would also be a credit financier,
because it is a corporation which enters into
agreements for supplying present and future
services. If that is correct, I wonder when it
could be said that a transaction is complete
and when the gas company would have to
furnish each individual customer with a
statement under this act showing the unpaid
balance due, finance charges, if any, and if
there are finance charges, what the simple
interest would be. It might be said that that
example is rather ridiculous but, after all, it
seems to me that it comes within the purview
of this bill. If you make a deal with a gas
company to supply you with gas-that is a
deal for services for the present and the
future-the company will bill you every month
or two months, and render further statements
in the future.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: May I intervene to
say that applies not only to gas companies,

years. The interest charge is six per cent,
and it is reduced every month according to
the amount paid by the customer.
Hon. Mr. White: I was just going to speak
of the oil truck deliveries, because everybody is quite familiar with how the oil is
delivered and the kind of bill furnished,
and so on. Just when one would say that the
transaction is complete, I do not know. However, the interpretation might be that when
the oil is put into the tank the transaction
is completed, and then a statement would
have to be furnished under the provisions
of this bill.
Honourable senators, in the event this bill
receives second reading and is referred to
the Banking and Commerce Committee, I
suggest that the honourable senator from
Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Crol), furnish
the committee with the following information:
1. A legal opinion that the bill is within
the jurisdiction of the federal Parliament.
2. Full information as to the definition of
"provision of services".
3. An amendment to the bill to provide
the manner in which the statement is to be
served on the purchaser, either by personal
service or by registered mail.
4. An amendment to the bill that will
cover and include in the bill the three matters referred to in paragraph 5 of the bill.
On motion of Hon. Mrs. Fergusson, debate

MARCH 21, 1962
Honourable senators may be interested to
know that I have just received a letter from
a New York tourist organization inviting
some Canadians to visit there.
I do flot wish to prolong this discussion,
since some other honourable senator may
wish to say a word or two.
Hon. David A. Cro11: Honourable senators,
1as a member of the Tourist Traffic Committee, I very much welcome the resolution,
which gives me some hope that we wiil be
in a position to do something about a matter
which really requires our attention.
I was particularly impressed with a document I received this morning, and which no
doubt came to ail honourable senators,
namely, the Bank of Montreal Business Reviewi for February of this year, entitled
"A Nation of Travellers." It contains much
interesting information which perhaps in
capsule form wiil appeal to this house. One
of the things it says is that Canadians on
a per capita basis spend more money for
travelling than anybody else in the North
American area. Prior to 1951, we had a surplus in our travel account, but since then
there has always been a deficit.
.In 1960, Canadians expended for travel
$627 million, and traveilers from outside
Canada coming here spent $420 million. S0
you see that on the overail picture we had a
deficit.
It is interesting to note that tourism brings
In more cash than any other industry ini
this country except the newsprint business.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I thought it was behind
farming.
Han. Mr. Croil: No; newsprint is the
leader.
The Han. the Speaker: What was the overal
deficit in tourism?
Hon. Mr. Croit: Some $200 million in 1960.
In 1960 roughly 30 million Americans entered Canada. Those were the entries recorded. May I read the words of the review.
During 1960 the number of entries
into Canada by residents of the United
States totalled nearly 30 million and
roughly the same number of Canadian
visits to the United States were recorded.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Those entries do not
represent individual tourists; some entrants
would cross the line back and forth every
day for maybe 300 days in a year.
Hon. Mr. Croli: Yes; they would stay for
only a very short time.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Those figures of entries
would include for instance, people working
in Detroit, and living in Windsor.

Hon. Mr. Croli: That is right.
In 1960 Canadians, in the course of visits
to the United States, spent $462 million in
that country, whereas Americans who came
to Canada spent $375 million, resulting in
a deficit of $87 million. In that same year
240,000 Canadians travelled overseas, and
71,000 overseas travellers visited this country.
This publication attributes the large amount
of travelling by Canadians to the fact that
we have a high level of income, longer
vacations and 10w air fares. It indicates that
three-quarters of the Canadians returning
from overseas travel by air. One of the
reasons for the high figures on Canadian
travel is the fact that in recent years a large
number of immigrants have corne to thîs
country, and they have been going home to
visit their familles and relatives. Seventyfive per cent of the people who went to
Brîtain last year went for the purpose of
visiting their familles.
Honourable senators, my point in rising was
to give you a few facts. I do flot thlnk we
are spending enough money on tourism. The
trouble is that when the people in the department concerned spend a dollar they want
to know whether it is going to earn $2 or $1.
You cannot make such forecasts in this business; you have to gamble, and competition
is becoming increaslngly keen.
We have to do more publicizing and advertising. Europeans have money; they can
travel; the restrictions on taking funds out of
the European countries have almost disappeared. It is true that here in Ottawa we have
some special attractions to tourists, such as the
Changing of the Guard and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, but what else have we?
We are getting used to these attractions and
we now have to develop some new ones. We
cannot expect these people to visit Canada
only in a period of two or three months in
the summertime. We also have facilities for
attracting tourists in the winter months, such
as fishing, hunting and skilng. Provision is
made for financial help to people who wish
to bulld lodges. True, the tourist facilities
have improved considerably, but it strikes
me that Canadian advertisements displaying
bathing beauties are a little overdone. It
seems to me that in bikinis ail women are
beautiful.
Han. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators, I wish to commend the Chairman of the
Standing Comrnittee on Tourist Traffic for
revitalizing that committee, because I have
felt for some time that in ternis of potential
business that can be generated, this could be
one of the most Important committees of the
Senate.

SENATE
I have never been too happy with the support that the chambers of commerce and businessmen in general have given to the idea of
promoting tourist traffic, except in those areas
which are almost entirely dependent on the
tourist trade, such as the one in which I
live, at Banff. I remember that year after
year, at the annual conventions of the Chamber of Commerce, the local chambers of Banff
and Calgary put forward resolutions suggesting that the National Chamber of Commerce
should concern itself more with encouraging
a national approach to the development of
this important industry. Time and again the
resolution was brushed off. Fortunately, during the last couple of years it has received
some support.
The honourable senator from TorontoSpadina (Hon. Mr. Croll) has emphasized that
tourism is Canada's second largest industry.
Without too great an effort it could be the
largest, and I believe that we should stop at
nothing short of making it so.
Might I at this time suggest to the Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) that
he exercise all the powers of persuasion which
he possesses to see that the Rogers Pass section of the Trans-Canada Highway is open
for tourist traffic by the middle of June or the
first of July. I have been trying to bring some
pressure to bear on the federal Minister of
Public Works, and he says that he will do his
best in this regard but that the Minister of
Public Works for British Columbia should
have some pressure brought to bear on him.
If that is the case, let us all press him for
action, because with the Seattle World's Fair
being held on the west coast this summer
there will be a tremendous amount of traffic
over the newly-opened Trans-Canada Highway. I believe it is not too difficult to get the
highway opened for what is called "controlled traffic". Some bridges may not be finished and the tourists may have to make a
detour. However, this prospect is well worth
the effort, and we should leave no stone unturned in this respect. We should make it
possible for people of eastern Canada to go
out over the Canadian route and back over
the American route, if they wish, and for
Americans who are on a cross-continent
tour to do the same. I would like to see a
development in regard to this matter.
In recent times the air line companies have
been making special pleas and offering reduced rates to induce people to fly to Europe.
In my experience, many people in eastern
Canada think they have seen the west if they
have gone as far west as Sarnia or get even
to Winnipeg. Let me assure them that Winnipeg is only the beginning of the west, and that
today some of the most exciting things in Canada are happening in Alberta and British

Columbia. We would like our eastern neighbours to come and look at the west. Perhaps
the air line companies would consider this as
part of a campaign which might reduce their
deficits and also get more people to see Canada first. They could offer special inducements to easterners to come and see the western part of the country, and as well they
could ask westerners, of course, to see the
Maritimes and Quebec.
If we are to develop the proper kind of
tourist trade, we must pay more attention to
the quality of the service we offer in hotels
and motels and particularly in restaurants.
We have the kind of raw materials we need,
the world's best beef, the best wheat, and all
the other attributes of good living in Canada.
However, the food that is served on restaurant
tables in some of our tourist centres, prepared by .alleged chefs, should not be offered
to anyone.
This committee might also encourage those
responsible for developing the tourist trade
to put special emphasis on the quality of
service we offer. I believe that people will
quickly respond to tasty food and good
service.
I remember being in Phoenix, Arizona,
not so long ago and having dinner at one
of the main restaurants there. My wife and
I saw a lineup at a very small place across
the street and we remarked: That must be
a good place to eat. After dinner we went
across to this place, called Sue's Kitchen.
Now, any time you are in Phoenix you will
see a lineup in front of this small restaurant
every day. Why? For just one reason-good
food, nicely served. I believe we do not put
enough emphasis on that aspect of our
tourist trade.
As a final point I should like to refer
to a subject which is becoming of increasing
importance in Canada. We have some magnificent historic sites in this country, but as
yet we have not done nearly enough to
develop and publicize them. A very fine
example of what can be done is to be found
within 40 miles of Ottawa, along the Seaway,
known as Upper Canada Village. The federal
Government and the province of Ontario have
done a magnificent job in recreating an early
Canadian village. The same sort of thing
should be done in many other parts of the
country. Such enterprises would pay rich
dividends by attracting more people.
Honourable senators, any of you who have
been down along the Custer Battlefield Highway in the United States must have been
struck by the way the Americans have developed every point of historic interest there.
Along the Columbia river and on the old

MARCH 21, 1962
Oregon trail, they have done the same thing,
all of which bas greatly added to the interest
which those places have for tourists.
May I say a word on behalf of the people
who administer our tourist program-the
men in the National Parks Branch, in the
Historie Sites and Monuments section, and
in the many tourist promotion bureaus. They
have been subject to criticism more often
than commendation. One of the most important jobs this committee could do would
be to bring those agencies before it, so that
we may inform ourselves more fully on
their work. Once fully informed, we should
get behind them and give them the support
they need to develop what can be Canada's
biggest business.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I am sure we are unanimous in regard
to the object of this motion, which is to
endeavour to bring more tourists to Canada.
We are unanimous also in saying that here
we have attractions which are as great as
those of any other country. This committee
must study what it can do to make our
resources available and to bring people to
Canada.
I was a member of the committee-I think
I still am-some years ago, when it was
much more active than it bas been recently.
At that time we devoted one session to fishIng. There is nothing like specializing from
time to time. We brought before us amateur
fishermen-not the professionals-who were
filled with enthusiasm for the sport. They
told us about the great fish that they caught,
where and how they could be caught, and so
on. Their presentation was very effective.
The problem which faces us is that of
advertising. Our own newspapers are ever
ready to co-operate with us, but we must
give them information which they can use. I
have spoken of fishing and, of course, there
are many other attractions. Possibly we could
bring here the enthusiasts in various particular spheres, by contributing something towards their travelling expenses to Ottawa.
They could talk about their particular interests, and I am sure the newspapers would
tell the story of those visits. In that way we
might get some free advertising.
If we are to depend on formal advertising,
we will have to spend a large amount of
money. We never can have enough advertising, so we should make use of our facilities
and our opportunities to spread the news by
word of mouth, newspapers, radio, and so
on. This committee may well perform a very
useful service by calling such enthusiasts
together and allowing them to tell the story of
the particular sport which they have enjoyed
26211-3-24

and which others may enjoy. I wish the committee good luck and good service.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, I would like to add a few words in that
connection.
In our province of Quebec which, together
with the Maritimes, is the oldest settled area
in Canada, there are many historical spots
unknown to tourists. Yet, those places have
seen the birth of history of the whole continent.
My colleague the previous speaker (Hon.
Mr. Cameron) said the West was well known
for its good food and its fine restaurants. Now,
at this very time of the year, an industry is
being reactivated, mainly in Quebec. It is
the maple sugar industry. I remember one
day, when I was lecturing before the
Institut des Sociétés savantes de Paris, a film
had been shown on the maple sugar industry
in the province of Quebec, and some members of the audience had asked me what
was added in the fabrication of maple sugar.
This shows that people are not too familiar
with that industry. We have wholesome, natural products that we can advertise.
In regard to food, tourists, particularly the
Americans, tell us they find very good restaurants where the food is excellent, but they
are unable to find any maple product. This
seems quite amazing to me. Almost every restaurant in our country should be able to
obtain genuine maple products, since they
actually are Canadian products. I feel our
country should be proud to show tourists what
nature can produce from our soil. To use an
advertising phrase so popular in the United
States, we have "The best product that nature can produce"; this is another point we
should stress.
I am happy to say that if our maple sugar
can contribute anything to such publicity, we
will be only too pleased to co-operate with
the committee.

Motion agreed to.
FINANCE CHARGES (DISCLOSURE) BILL
SECOND READING-DEBATE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Croll, for the second reading of Bill S-2, to
make provision for the disclosure of information in respect of finance charges.

SENATE
Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson: Honourable
senators, as this is the first opportunity I have
had to do so, I would like to join with many
earlier speakers in extending a warm welcome to the new senator from the Atlantic
provinces, Senator Hollett. I should also like
to congratulate the friendly and genial senator
from Shawinigan (Hon. Mr. Méthot), as well
as the new senator from Burin (Hon. Mr.
Hollett), on their interesting speeches as mover
and seconder of the motion for an address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne.
If you will permit me, I should also like
to join in the compliments paid this session to
our Speaker who has won for himself the
affection and respect of senators on both sides
of the house.
This is the third occasion on which I have
spoken in this chamber in support of a bill
to make provision for disclosure of information
in respect of finance charges. Al the bills
were introduced by the honourable senator
from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croll)-one
he introduced in 1960, and the other in 1961.
I commend him highly for his continued initiative in this matter, despite the discouragement and opposition he has encountered at
times in the past.
I am confident that this time the bill will
receive second reading here, will be reported
out of committee and will, indeed, pass the
Senate. If prorogation or dissolution does not
supervene I hope it may even acquire the
force of law at this session-although, of
course, I have no way of knowing what attitude may be taken on the bill in another
place.
The reasons for my renewed confidence in
the success of this bill are neither hard to find
nor to express. In the first place, obviously
there has been an intensification of popular
opinion in favour of this legislation. Like the
senator from Winnipeg North (Hon. Mr. Wall),
and I feel sure like many other senators,
I have received this year a great many letters
from individuals and organizations supporting
this legislation. A large number, but certainly
not all of these, have come from the Maritimes, and my own belief is that support for
this measure is nationwide.
Honourable senators, I do not believe that
the Senate should, or would, disregard the
manifestations of public approval that are
evident on all sides. We should, indeed, demonstrate for all to see that the Senate is
not a temple of money-changers but a forum
in which the overriding good of the people
is the paramount concern. I sincerely believe
this bill is for the public good.
Secondly, contrary to opinion of the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.

Hayden), I believe that the present bill is
a vast improvement over the predecessor
bills in that it is now both specific and easy
to understand. Some of us who favoured
the principle of the earlier bills realized
that further definition and delimitation were
required. I mentioned this when speaking
on one of the predecessor bills but, at that
time, I, and others who supported the bills,
believed that the necessary adjustments in
the form of the bill could best be made
after full discussion in our very able Banking
and Commerce committee. Others, I know,
felt that this work of "sculpturing" should
be done by the sponsor of the bill prior to
its reference to committee. The necessary
sculpturing has now been done by the honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina, and
any refinements or modifications required in
committee should be of minor and, indeed,
of minimal character. Senator Croll has done
his homework, and a large section of earlier
opposition to the bill must thereby have been
removed.
Finally, there has been no departure from
the basic principles of the predecessor bills.
Credit financiers, now clearly defined, must
disclose all of the finance charges, both as
a total sum and in terms of annual interest.
The consequences of non-disclosure certainly
could not be called unduly severe and are
not, under the new bill, criminal in nature.
Penalties to the purveyors of credit are
simply that they will not be able to recover
or retain any finance charges whatsoever,
unless they have disclosed them in advance
and in writing, in accordance with the bill.
I realize that there might be some difficulty in arriving at the correct annual rate
of interest as required by this bill but I
feel, like the honourable senator from Winnipeg, that this difficulty could easily be
overcome through a formula for such calculation being set out under the regulations
which are provided for in section 5 of
the bill.
When I spoke on the bill introduced in
1960 I had not studied the question of its
constitutionality, and you may remember
that I was rather cautious on that point.
Subsequently I did considerable study on
the matter. Like the honourable senator from
Hastings-Frontenac (Hon. Mr. White), I am
only a country lawyer but I have always
taken a keen interest in constitutional problems. In speaking on the 1961 bill, after
having studied the matter I was convinced
that under the British North America Act
the Parliament of Canada was within its
rights in enacting such a law, and I am
still of the same opinion.

MARCH 21, 1962

Honourable senators, it was only because
illness prevented me from being in Ottawa
that I did flot record my vote in support
of the 1961 bill. However, if at this time
Bill S-2 cornes to a recorded vote-although
there may be no necessity for such a voteI certainly will support it and I hope and

26211-3-24J

trust that the vote will be overwhelmingly in
favour of the principle of this bill.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Smith (Kamloops),
debate adjourned.

in its favour. As you know, it gives the
franchise for the first time to the people in
the districts of Franklin and Keewatin. The
total population of the two districts is about
8,000 persons, 75 per cent of whom are of
Eskimo origin. In my opinion, this reform is
long overdue.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Hear,
hear.
Hon. Mr. Gladstone: We have already given
the vote in federal elections to the Indian
population, and, to say the least, it would be
inconsistent ta deny a similar privilege, for
whatever reason, to persons of Eskimo extraction.
Honourable senators, in our democratic
system we have no intelligence tests for voting, nor do the voters have to give evidence
of any particular grammatical or linguistic
skill. I welcome this legislation, and I am
sure that ways and means will be found to
communicate the political issues to the Eskimos, if necessary in their native tongue. It
should not be so large a task that it cannot
be done. Perhaps I should add that if we
were to introduce special voting qualifications
of the sort suggested by the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), we
would be disfranchising large numbers of our
people and would be setting the demnocratic
clock back a long way. Universal suffrage is
the principle on which our democracy rests
and it is being applied in the present bill.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliol: Honourable
senators, in the name of human rights and
fundamental freedoms, I am very sorry to
have to protest against the reference made
by the honourable gentleman who has just
spoken (Hon. Mr. Gladstone) about the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar). We live in a free country, and the
opinion that the honourable senator from
Churchill expressed was his own sincere
opinion; but it did not bind the Liberal party
or the Opposition in this house. Therefore, it

PRIVATE BILL
SALVATION ARMY GOVERNING COUNCILSREPORT OF COMMITTEE ADOPTED
Hon. Paul H. Bouffard, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private

Bills, reported that the committee had considered Bill S-11, respecting the Governing
Council of the Salvation Army, Canada East,
and the Governing Council of the Salvation
Army, Canada West, and had directed that
the bill be reported with the following
amendments:
1. Page 1: Strike out clause 2 and substitute therefor the following:"2. Section 8A of chapter 132 of the
statutes of 1909, as amended by section 7
of chapter 63 of the statutes of 1916, is
further amended by adding thereto the
following subsections:
'(2) The Corporation may receive and
accept for its own use, as to the principal
sum or corpus thereof, any monies or
other personal properties subject to and
in consideration of the payment of interest
thereon or of an annuity in respect
thereof.
(3) At least once in every three years
the Corporation shall obtain a report,
made by an actuary qualified within the
meaning of section 100 of the Canadian
and British Insurance Companies Act,
showing the results of an actuarial valuation of annuities in force at the date of
the valuation and the actuary shall certify that, in his opinion, the reserves
shown by such valuation are sufficient to
provide for the payment of all annuities
without deduction or abatement.
(4) The reserves shown by the most recent actuarial valuation, or at the option
of the Corporation any higher reserves,
shall be entered as liabilities in the balance sheet of the Corporation.'"
2. Page 2: Strike out clause 3 and substitute therefor the following:"3. Section 9 of chapter 64 of the statutes of 1916 is amended by adding

The Hon. th. Speaker: Does the honourable
senator wish t0 explain the amendments?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Yes. The amendments
concern the receipt of moneys or any other
goods which could be converted into annuifies or interest bearing accounts-that is,
something similar to insurance annuities. The
Superintendent of Insurance, who has examnined the bill, desires that the situation with
respect to annuitants be considered by an
actuary every three years. He thought if
would be more consistent wifh the Canadian
and British Insurance Companies Acfs, and
it would also be a protection for the annuitants and the corporation. The councils have
no objection to the addition of these amendments covering the corporation, and the commnittee adopted fhem accordingly.

UNITED NATIONS
SIXTEENTH

SESSION 0F GENERAL ASSEMBLY
-DEBATE AD)JOURNED

Hon. A. J. Brooks rose pursuant to notice:
Thaf he will eall the attention of the
Senate to the Sixteenth Session of the
General Assembly of the United Nations,
hehd in New York City, and in parficuhar
f0 the discussions and proceedings of the
Assembhy and the participation therein
of the dehegafion of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, it is a great
pleasure and privilege for me f0 be afforded
this opportunify of giving you a report this
afternoon on some of the work of the Sixteenth Session of the United Nations. I assure
you thaft Ishall mot undertake a report of ail
the happenings at this session because, in the
firsf place, if would fake foo long and, in the
second place, I am sure all honourable semators folhowed closehy the work of the United
Nations and ifs various committees through
the reporting media of the press, radio and
television.
I read the reports of fhe work of the United
Nations in the newspapers whihe I was in New
York, and it is my opinion there was no
better reporting than that done by fhe Canadian j ournalists.
At the outsef I should say that I was the
vice-chairman of fhe Canadian dehegation, and
as such had an active part in its work and
deliberations, and that has been one of fhe
most satisfyimg experiences of my public hife.
Canada has a splendid mission to the United
Nations at New York. If is one of fhe besf
among those of the 104 nations represenfed

SENATE
there. I cannot pay too high a tribute to the
personnel of the Department of External Affairs who are responsible for our work at the
United Nations. Those connected with the
mission at New York, and those sent from
Ottawa to advise and help during the session,
have done and continue to do a tremendous
job. I found them, as I am sure everyone else
did, a dedicated and devoted group of men
and women.
There is not sufficient time this afternoon
for me to mention individually all those who
serve Canada in New York, but I can say that
our mission there is composed of about fifty
individuals. The Minister of External Affairs,
of course, is the head. He attended the session
on numerous occasions and always made his
presence felt in the deliberations.
Our ambassador to the United Nations was
Mr. Charles Ritchie, who did an excellent job.
His work there was so well recognized that
he was recently appointed our ambassador to
Washington, one of the highest ambassadorial
posts in the world so far as Canada is concerned. Another outstanding representative is
General Burns. He is a recognized authority
on disarmament, and is now attending the
Geneva Convention as one of our advisers.
May I say that he was one of the most
respected men at the United Nations; and
his advice was sought not only by the Canadian delegation but also by delegations from
other countries. These two men held the two
most important positions so far as Canada is
concerned, and with them were many advisers
from Ottawa.
Besides the plenary sessions of the United
Nations there are six committees which sit
regularly, and the work of the United Nations is divided among them. The first committee was headed by Mr. Green, when
he was there, and in his absence Mr. Ritchie,
General Burns, or I took charge.
Mr. Gordon Aiken, member of Parliament,
was in charge of the Canadian representation on the second committee. His work was
outstanding.
The Canadian section of the third committee, which looked after social work mostly,
was under Mrs. Jean Casselman, member of
Parliament, and she, along with others, received high credit for the work she did on
her committee. It was very gratifying to
read an article in the London Times about
the ladies attending the United Nations and
to note that the reporter of that newspaper
considered Mrs. Jean Casselman of Canada
one of the most outstanding women at the
United Nations.
Our work on the fourth committee was
under Mr. Martial Asselin, one of our members of Parliament. This was one of the
most difficult committees of the United Nations, but Mr. Asselin knew his work well.

He had been in Africa and had a knowledge
of colonial administration, and the committee
benefited from his great knowledge.
Another committee looked after finance.
On it we had Brigadier John Price from
Montreal, one of the outstanding financiers
of Canada.
The last committee had charge of legal
matters, and the Canadians on this committee were headed by Mr. Marcel Cadieux,
a senior member of the Department of External Affairs who is now a member of
the International Law Commission of the
United Nations. Of the 43 names put up
for election this year that of Mr. Marcel
Cadieux of the Canadian delegation was
third when the vote was taken.
I must not fail to mention the Special
Political Committee, the chairman of which
was Mr. Paul Tremblay, Canadian ambassador to Chile and one of our leading ambassadors abroad. We also had many observers,
members of Parliament. I have not time to
mention their names, but I should like to say
that in attendance were three of our outstanding colleagues in the Senate. There was
the honourable senator from De la Durantaye
(Hon. Mr. Pouliot)-and it is not necessary
for me to say that wherever he goes he makes
his personality felt. He took a very active
part in our work and proved to be one of the
most popular delegates with the mission
staff.
There was the honourable senator from
Northumberland-Miramichi (Hon. Mr. Burchill), who took a keen interest in the work of
the various committees, at which he was a
faithful attendant. He also assisted with the
important entertainment functions of the
United Nations. Incidentally, one of the most
demanding jobs at the United Nations is to
attend the many entertainments put on by
the various delegations.
Last but not least was our genial senator
from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croll). We
know him here as a man who has made work,
work, work a mode of life. He was always
at it in New York and he contributed much
to the success of our mission and organization.
Honourable senators, as to our meetings
and deliberations, you will recall that they
commenced on September 19, at a time when
there was intense anxiety and apprehension
about the dangerous course of international
relations. There was violence and bloodshed
in the Congo. We are, of course, pleased to
see that the situation there has improved and
we hope it continues to improve. The trouble
in the Congo was associated with the tragic
death of that great and good man, Dag Hammarskjold, the mainspring and hope of the
United Nations at that time.

MARCH 22, 1962
There was pressure from greatly enlarged
and undetermined membership. New nations
were being admitted and it was hard to
understand just what their attitude might be
on various matters. The United Nations
organization was threatened by bankruptcy
due to the failure an-d refusai of financial
support from a number of nations, including
the U.S.S.R. and France. One of the most
discouraging things was the failure of the
disarmament conference and the renewal of
nuclear tests by Soviet Russia. There was an
uneasiness about developments in Southeast
Asia, the Middle East, Algeria, the Caribbean,
Angola, New Guinea, and many other parts
of the world-there stili is, of course-and as
well, the sentiment about colonial issues and
racial discrimination ran strong. Apartheid
was a word you heard used by the delegates,
especially those from Africa.
This was the atmosphere and situation
under wbich the organization met. It could
hardly have been gloomier. It was flot surprising that some observers expressed pessimism about the prospects and even the future
of the United Nations. But there were in
attendance too many big and understanding
men and women from ail parts of the world
to allow pessimismi to prevail. There were
difficuit tasks to perform, and the members
feit it was the duty of the United Nations
Assembly to perform them. Dag Hammarski old was dead, but the United Nations stili
lived.
First and forernost was the appointment of
a successor to perform the duties of Dag
Hammarskjold. After due tribute from one
hundred nations to, this outstanding man
whose name will go down in history as being
truly great, the task of replacing hlm. was
undertaken, with the resuits of which honourable senators are aware. The Soviet Union
insisted on a three-man secretariat-"troika"
was the word used-a division which was
strongly opposed, I arn glad to say, by al
nations except the Soviet bloc and Cuba. The
Soviet Union advanced the argument that
the international character of the secretariat
would best be guaran-teed by representation
of the main political currents which divided
the world: communism, democracy, neutralism. As opposed to this proposition, most
nations argued that to instail a triumvirate
with rotating authority would, in the words of
one of the speakers, replace order with anarchy, action with paralysis, confidence with
confusion. Common sense prevailed and it was
finally decided to have a temporary SecretaryGeneral to carry on during the unfinished
tern of Dag Hammarskjold, to December 6,
1963. Russia finally accepted this conditionaily, but gave notice o! her determination to
insist on her formula, the triumvirate or

troika, when the matter came up the next
year. It is expected there wlll be a big fight
at that time.
The man who has been selected as Secretary-General-his name has been in the
press and everybody is familiar with it-is
U Thant of Burma. For a number of years
he was one of the very outstanding delegates
to the United Nations. He was a member of
many committees and acted as chairman of
some. A man of great ability, he was mild
but firm. In his own country he was a teacher,
lawyer, politician, a man generally liked by
ail who meet him, and, may I say, a man o!
real courage, for otherwise he would not have
undertaken such a difficuit assignment.
After his appointment the session could
and did get down to business. Many delegations, including Canada's, immediately sought
to crystallize the concern o! people in al
parts o! the world as to the hazards which
resuit from increased radiation !ollowing the
resumption of nuclear atmospheric tests by
the Soviet Union, including explosion o!
nuclear bombs.
I would point out here that Canada has
always played a leading role at the United
Nations and elsewhere whenever the question
o! radiation has been raised. We succeeded in
having the General Assembly give high priority to consideration of the annual report of
scientific committees on radiation, thus bringing this subi ect almost immediately before
the Assembly. In fact, it was the first major
problem to be discussed a!ter the appointment o! the acting Secretary-General. This
report of the scientific committee expressed
direct and general concern about the possible
dangerous effects o! resumed testing ini the
atmosphere.
Twenty-four member states joined with
Canada in submitting a draft resolution designed, on the one hand, to focus the attention
of ail nations on the consequence of increased
fallout and, on the other hand, to put forward
concrete proposais for accelerating research
on the effects of radiation and for organizing
a global system of measuring the incidence
of radioactivity in the atmosphere. This resolution had the overwhelming support of the
General Assembly and was adopted in plenary
session by a vote of 74 in favour, none against,
with 17 abstentions, whlch I may say included the Soviet bloc. May I aiso say that
the proposai for synoptic reporting of atmospheric levels has already been taken up by
the world meteorological organization. Canada
took the leading role in promoting this
resolution.
The next matter which came up for consideration was the nuclear test ban. The series
of nuclear weapons tests which, the Soviet
Union conducted in the atmosphere in the

SENATE
early days of the Assembly and, in particular, Mr. Khrushchev's threat to explode
a super bomb prompted a number of delegations to take action to try to prevent that
occurrence.
Eight states, including Canada, joined in cosponsoring a resolution calling on the Soviet
Union not to carry on its intention to explode a 50-megaton bomb. Although this
resolution was supported by 87 delegations out
of 100, only the Soviet bloc and Cuba opposed.
The Soviet Union later, it will be recalled,
went ahead with two very large explosions
in defiance of the Assembly's appeal. These
bombs were even larger than expected, and
I have been told they had more explosive
power than all the bombs used in World
War IL.
In furtherance of its efforts to bring about
a halt to testing, the General Assembly gave
overwhelming support to two other resolutions calling for the cessation of nuclear
weapons tests and emphasizing the urgency
of resuming negotiations, with a view to
achieving a safeguarded international ban on
tests. Both these resolutions were adopted by
large majorities. Following their adoption,
agreement was reached by the United States,
the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union to
resume nuclear test negotiations in Geneva.
These talks, which began in November, were
recessed over Christmas, and are now being
continued, with what results one can read
from the press. Some days the talks seem
to be successful, while other days they do not
seem to be so hopeful. However, I am sure
we all hope that ultimately they will be
successful.
The next subject was that of disarmament.
This was, is, and I am sure will be until the
armament race is halted, the most important
and difficult problem facing the United Nations and the world. At the Sixteenth Session
the West pursued vigorously its efforts to
bring about a resumption of disarmament
negotiations, which had been in abeyance
since June 1960, when Russia walked out on
the disarmament committee.
The Canadian delegation kept closely in
touch with the intensive discussions behind
the scenes which led to agreement on new
negotiations and the basis of an agreed statement of principles. General Burns was our
mainspring in this matter; he was our expert and adviser on disarmament in a very
long debate extending over a period of weeks,
in which practically every member of the
United Nations took part, including Russia.
President Kennedy, as you will remember, addressed the Assembly, and in that excellent
speech he said in part:
Today every inhabitant of this planet
must contemplate the day when this

planet may no longer be habitable.
Every man, woman and child lives under
a nuclear Sword of Damocles hanging by
the slenderest of threads, capable of being cut at any moment by accident, miscalculation or by madness. The weapons
of war must be abolished before they
abolish us.
He went on to say:
For 15 years this organization has
sought the reduction and destruction of
arms. Now that goal is no longer a dream.
It is a practical matter of life and death.
The risks inherent in disarmament pale
in comparison to the risks inherent in an
unlimited arms race.
This grave concern about the resumption of
negotiations was also re-stated emphatically
by the Secretary of State for External Affairs in the general debate on November 24
in the first committee. The minister proposed
an expansion of the disarmament negotiating
body of ten nations by the inclusion of new
members representing the main geographical areas of the world. These ideas were reflected in the agreement eventually reached
to add eight new members to the group. The
proposal was unanimously approved by a
resolution of the General Assembly on November 28 and the negotiations have now
been resumed. There is a hitch over the meeting at the top, but the discussion is going
on. France, a member of the group of eighteen
nations, has not been attending, but I know
from reading today's press that efforts are
being made to have her take part.
Honourable senators, I would like to mention some of the provisions of the new plan
which was submitted to the United Nations
by President Kennedy on September 25
which, as I stated, contained many suggestions made by Canada and adopted by the
General Assembly on November 22. You will
also recognize some of them as again being
emphasized by Mr. Green at Geneva at the
present time. Among its most significant
provisions are the following.
The new plan of the United States and
Canada provides for the cessation, in the
first stage, of the production of nuclear
material for warlike purposes, and for the
transfer of agreed quantities from past production to peaceful uses. It calls for reductions at the beginning of the program of
the major means of delivery of nuclear
weapons and for cessation of production of
certain types of these weapons; and it provides for early measures to stop the further
spread of nuclear weapons. It makes provision for significant reductions in armed
forces to 2.1 million men for the United
States and the Soviet Union in the first

MARCH 22, 1962
stage. It also calls for the reduction of conventional armaments and for limitations on
the production of certain types of weapons.
In addition, there are provisions designed
to reduce the danger of war by miscalculation or surprise attack. Measures are also
included in the plan which would prohibit
the placing of weapons of mass destruction
in outer space, and to provide for the advance notification of satellite launchings to
reassure states that these are for peaceful
purposes only.
The implementation of the entire program
of disarmament is to be verified by a rigorous system of international control to verify
that all states are living up to their obligations.
Finally, provision is made for increasing
the strength and effectiveness of international
peace-keeping machinery, that is, an international force, in order to ensure that the
security of all states will be fully protected
as disarmament progresses. This, of course,
is very necessary.
The United States plan, as now drafted,
is fully consistent with Canadian policy on
disarmament. Taken as a whole, the plan
represents the most far-reaching and wellbalanced series of disarmament measures
which has yet been put forward by the
Western powers.
On December 20 the General Assembly
unanimously approved a resolution endorsing
the agreement reached between the United
States and the Soviet Union to resume disarmament negotiations in an eighteen-member
committee made up as follows: in the tennation committee there are Canada, France,
Italy, the United Kingdom and the United
States on the western side, and Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia, Poland, Roumania and the
U.S.S.R. on the communist side; the additional eight members are Ethiopia, Nigeria,
Brazil, Mexico, India, Burma, the United
Arab Republic, and Sweden.
The next subject of great importance which
was considered after disarmament was the
use of outer space for peaceful purposes. It
was not so long ago that most of us thought

that space ships and outer space was a
subject for the comic strips. But this subject
has in the past few years become one of
the most complex problems facing the United
Nations and the world. To date little progress
towards a solution has been made, apart
from setting up another space committee
of which Canada is a member.
The subject of outer space was introduced
this session by Dr. Belaunde of Peru, a very
distinguished member of the United Nations
and an outstanding international lawyer.
Among other things, when the Outer Space

Committee's report was brought up for consideration, he had this to say:
No one is unaware of the danger that
the domination of outer space by any
country and the establishment of space
platforms and stations for warlike purposes would present to the world, if
only by influencing the physical elements of the atmosphere and the meteorological conditions above the earth. The
conquest of outer space was thus not
merely a matter of purely scientific progress, but was of such tremendous and
immediate human importance that it must
be the subject of international co-operation. Outer space could not be subject to
exclusive claims, exclusive exploitation,
or exclusive use by any one power or
group of powers. It was because atomic
energy had not from the outset been an
international matter that it had given
rise to the crises which mankind was
experiencing. If still greater dangers were
to be avoided, an international solution
must quickly be found for the question
of outer space.
This subject, I understand, is to be included
in the disarmament talks, and it definitely
should be. Mr. Khrushchev has already
boasted that the U.S.S.R. could drop a super
bomb from outer space on any target in the
world.
On December 20, after intensive consultations involving members of the Outer Space
Committee, the General Assembly gave
unanimous approval to a resolution outlining
a program for international co-operation in
the use of outer space for peaceful purposes.
This result was particularly gratifying for
Canada, as we have been a member of the
Outer Space Committee since its establishment
in 1958 and will continue to serve on the committee in future. The hope is that after being
a stalemate for two years, again held up by
Russia, the committee will now be able to
pursue its work with a new sense of purpose
and responsibility. The Assembly, when approving this year's resolution, specifically
endorsed a view that outer space should be
freely available for exploration and use by
all nations in conformity with agreed principles of international law, including a prohibition on the appropriation of outer space or
celestial bodies by any one state.
We come now to an issue which is affecting
many nations, a difficult and tumultuous issue
facing the United Nations and different parts
of the world, namely, the colonial issue,
mostly in Africa and Asia.
I remember some time ago when Prime
Minister Macmillan of Great Britain was
visiting Africa he spoke of the winds of

SENATE
change. Someone in the United Nations said
they are no longer winds but have become
hurricanes of change.
Since the last war 54 new states have come
into being. When the United Nations was set
up in 1946 it had 50 members; today there are
104, with many more preparing to enter.
In 1946 the population of dependencies under
the United Kingdom numbered 650 million.
Today the corresponding figure is 40 million.
Hon. Mr. Reid: How many?
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Forty million. Of course,
since the second world war India, Pakistan,
Ceylon, Burma, Malaya, Ghana, Nigeria and
others-I could name a dozen-have become
independent.
The real trouble they are finding in this
matter of colonization, or at least of self-determination, is that many of the nations are
not prepared for self-government. This is not
true of those that France and Great Britain
have been helping. Both these countries try
to prepare the new countries for self-rule.
They recognize two great principles; first, that
no country can govern itself unless it has an
educated and trained civil service; and,
second, that no country can control its people
without outside assistance unless it has a
trained army to enforce the law and see that
the people keep the peace. These are two
important advantages which Great Britain and
France have provided for the nations which
gained independence and were formerly their
responsibility. The great difficulty is that
many of these nations seeking self-determination do not wish to wait. The year 1962 was
set for self-determination for all dependent
peoples.
It has been found that that target could
not be achieved.
This year Nigeria-which, I may say,
is one of the best informed of the new
nations, and a former British colony-brought
in a resolution asking that the period be
extended to 1970, to give them adequate
time to prepare. Unfortunately, this resolution was defeated. Russia always agrees with
these nations which are in a hurry. She
knows full well that many of them are not
prepared. She knows full well that if a
country like the Congo, for instance, had had
a well-trained civil service and force to look
after the control and peace of the country,
it would not have experienced the great difficulties it has over the past year or year
and a half. Many, though not all, of these
countries are too immature; some are too
anxious; some lack education and understanding of the great problems of self-government.
Honourable senators, I now turn to another
most important matter, one which must be

dealt with effectively if the United Nations
is to survive-and that it must do-that of
United Nations financing. As I have said,
there is a special committee on financing.
Unfortunately, many of the member nations
have not been paying in the amounts which
have been levied against them. This year,
in order to avert financial ruin and severe
curtailment of its peace-keeping operations,
the Assembly gave final approval to the
following money measures which were recommended by the fifth committee: First, permission was given to make a $200-million
bond issue. The United Nations is greatly
in debt in the Congo, and going behind at
a rate of about $10 million a month. Second,
provision for an $80-million appropriation
to cover the costs of the United Nations
Congo operation. Third, provision for an
appropriation of $9,750,000 for the United
Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East.
Fourth, a request for a World Court opinion
on whether United Nations members are
legally obliged to pay their Congo and United
Nations Emergency Force debts. Many have
not paid. Fifth, a regular operating budget
of $82,144,000 for current expenses.
These financial moves will keep the 104nation United Nations, which has been teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, a going
concern for at least another year.
Delegates hailed a "re-affirmation of faith"
in the United Nations as evidenced by the
cash resolutions, but political assessments of
the assembly were less bright.
At this point I should like to call the
attention of honourable senators to some
comments published in the New York Herald
Tribune with reference to these money matters at the United Nations. This dispatch,
which appeared shortly after the resolution
was passed, shows where the burden has
been borne. It states in part:
The United States has supplied almost
half of all the money that the United
Nations and related agencies have spent
since the United Nations was created
in 1945The United States has contributed $256
million toward annual budgets of the
UN totalling $784 million, and $168.6
million toward budgets of nine specialized agencies totalling $594.12 million.
These specialized agencies include the
Food and Agriculture Organization, the
World Health Organization and others
dealing with labour, learning, aviation,
shipping, mail, telecommunications and
weather forecasting.
The UN military operations have put
the UN in debt. All 104 of the members
of the UN are assessed to pay for them,

MARCH 22. 1962
but only about 40 of the members pay
for the Middle East force and only about
35 for the Congo force.
Another dispatch, on the same page, mentions those who are buying United Nations
bonds. No doubt the list is longer now than
it was at that time, the end of January. It
states:
Eight governments thus far have promised to subscribe to a total of $34,070,000
in the UN's $200 million bond issue.
I believe that the United States has guaranteed $100 million.
The pledges are in response to an
appeal Secretary General U. Thant circulated January 10.
The countries and their pledges are:
Australia, $4 million.
Canada, $6,240,000.
Denmark, $2.5 million.
Finland, $1,480,000.
Norway, $1.8 million.
Pakistan, $250,000.
Sweden, up to $5.8 million.
United Kingdom, up to $12 million.
Another report on the same page of the
Herald Tribune gives a further breakdown.
It states:
The United Nations, in assessing its
104 members obtain the money for its
regular budget and its Congo and Middle East operations ...
The dispatch then sets out its 10 largest
accounts, being one neutralist, two cominunist and seven pro-western countries.
The countries and their total 1961 assessments for the three purposes were:
United States ........
$60,651,890
Soviet Union ..........
25,420,205
Britain ...............
14,513,783
France ...............
11,940,181
Nationalist China ......
9,346,924
Canada ...............
5,802,182
India ................
4,589,508
Italy .................
4,197,720
Japan ................
4,085,781
Soviet Ukraine ........
3,358,177
When studying these amounts honourable
senators will see that of the 104 nations contributing to the United Nations, Canada always comes about fifth or sixth. We stand
very high in the list, as far as contributions
to all UN activities are concerned.
Honourable senators, it is not my intention
to worry you further with these figures, but
they do show the financial situation of the
United Nations as of this year. The expectations are that the organization now has the
situation well in hand, and that it need not

worry so much in the future over its financial
position. The fifth committee did a good job.
Canada has been and is one of the leading
members of the United Nations in promoting
plans for the purpose of contributing food and
help to underdeveloped nations.
Honourable senators, there are many other
subjects which I could discuss this afternoon, but I have touched on some of the main
ones. Some of the principal topics discussed
at length were, the admission of China to the
United Nations, the trouble between Portugal
and Angola, the difficulties between Tibet and
China, between Cuba and the United States,
and between New Guinea and Holland. Then
there was discussion on UNRRA; the trouble
between the United Arab Republic and Israel over the Gaza Strip; Rhodesia, where
Britain has very serious headaches; UNESCO;
trade, tariffs, and so on. These problems are
part and parcel of the work of the United
Nations.
I understand that someone criticized Canada as not being too popular at the United
Nations. I do not think there can be any
serious criticism. One honourable member in
the other place was at the United Nations
for a very short time, and I believe he must
have got his information from a wrong source.
The only people who seem in any way to dislike Canada at the United Nations are the Soviet nations, and I did not find them bitter.
It is no exaggeration to say that Canada is,
has been, and will continue to be one of the
most popular nations at the United Nations
and in the world. There is good reason why
she should be. We have no quarrel with any
other people. I mentioned a moment ago some
of the nations who have had quarrels. I could
mention others, such as India and Pakistan
Qver Kashmir,.North and South Vietnam, and
many others. We in Canada have no quarrel
with any other country. We have been contributing, not only recently but ever since we
have been a member, to every worthwhile
project which has been brought before the
U.N. We contribute to the feeding of millions
of starving people through the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,
known as FAO. We contribute to the education of millions of people in Africa, South
America and Asia, people who are seeking to
learn so that they may become more equal
with the other peoples of the world.
We have always paid our full share of the
expenses of the United Nations. When I
attended the UN meetings last year, it amazed
me to note the number of people who came
to the Canadian table to find out how we
were going to vote on this or that matter, so
they could follow our lead. Canada is a
bright spot to many other nations there. I

SENATE
am told-and I know it is a fact-that certain nations vote in a certain way very often
because Canada gives them a lead.
I also know that when resolutions are
brought before the United Nations, sponsoring nations endeavour to get Canada to be a
co-sponsor. For that reason I have no hesitation in saying that at the UN no nation is
more popular than Canada. And, as I said a
moment ago, there is a very good reason for
that popularity.
As to the future of the United Nations, one
need only attend the meetings to realize the
great necessity for that organization. The
world is in a very serious state, and there is
no other organization which will help to
provide for its future security. The United
Nations is especially needed for those new
countries which are struggling towards independence. They must be helped financially,
they must be helped through education, they
must be helped to govern themselves, and to
develop their trade and their economy. This
is what the UN is doing. Moreover, there
would not be a disarmament conference in
Europe today if it were not for the United
Nations.
To my mind, the whole future of the world
depends to a great extent on the success of
the United Nations. I am very proud indeed
to say that Canada is bearing her full share
of this burden and is doing far more than
many other larger and better prepared nations.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Pouliot, debate
adjourned.

POLARIS PIPE LINES-THIRD

READING

MARCH 22, 1962
The railways concerned were incorporated
a long time ago. The Joliette and Brandon
Railway Company was incorporated by the
province of Quebec in 1905, and the other two
companies were incorporated in the province
of New Brunswick many years ago.
These raiiways are actually the property
of the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company in
that it owns ail of the stocks and bonds, and
operates themn under long-term leases. One
lease is for 94 years, one is for 999 years and
the other for 99 years.
The objeet of the bill is to simplify the
corporate organization of the Canadian Pacifie
Raiiway Company. The passing of this bill
will mean that these railway companies wil
no longer operate under the names of Joliette
and Brandon Railway Company, the Saint
John Bridge and Railway Extension Company,
and the Saint Stephen and Milltown Railway
Company, but under the name of the Canadian
Pacifie Railway Company.
The public is not at ail interested in the
matter because the passing of this bull will
not affect the operations of the railways. They
are ail small lines, one being less than a mile
long, one 13 miles, and the other 4.65 miles.
They conneet certain stations with the Canadian Pacific Railway.
The Joliette and Brandon Railway Company
is a very small lie that goes from St. Gabriel
to Brandon, thus connecting St. Gabriel with
the C.P.R. which is about 13 miles further
south.
The Saint Stephen and Milltown Railway
Company conneets two smail villages, and is
a line of approximately 4.65 miles. The Saint
John Bridge and Railway Extension Company
is a line ini New Brunswick that permits the
Canadian Pacifie Railway to go into the
Union Station at Saint John and connreets the
Lancaster line with the Canadian Pacific
Railway.
These three railway companies have been
operated by the Canadian Pacifie Railway
Company for many years. The Canadian
Pacifie Railway Company has purchased the
stocks and bonds of these companies, and it
now wishes to have these railways made part
of its system.
Honourable senators, if this bull receives
second reading it is my intention to move that
it be referred to the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications where any
honourabie senator who requires information
which I am not able to give can obtain it
from either the public officiais or the officials
of the company.
Honourable senators, I see no objection to
this bill. It is the resuit of resolutions passed
by the Canadian Pacifie Raiiway Company,

and by each of these three railway companies at regular meetings of their sharehoiders. A document was signed by each of
the companies with respect to their being
in favour of the bill and of the amalgamation
with the Canadian Pacifie Raiiway Company.
When this bill is passed these companies will
disappear, and so will ail the ciericai work
connected with them.
If honourable senators have any questions
that I arn able to answer I shail be pleased
to answer them.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Can the honourabie senator say when the C.P.R. bought up the
stocks and bonds from the original owners?
In other words, for how long has the Canadian
Pacifie Railway Company actually owned
these Uines?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I do not know the
exact length of time, but the leases must
have commenced when the Canadian Pacifie
Railway Company became the owner of the
stocks and bondIs. The Joliette and Brandon
Railway Company was incorporated in Quebec
in 1905, and it was leased to the Canadian
Pacifie Railway Company in 1906 for a period
of 94 years.
The lease of the Saint John Bridge and
Railway Extension Company was made in
1943 for 999 years. In that case the Canadian
Pacifie Railway Company more recently
became the owners of the stocks and bonds.
The lease of the Saint Stephen and Miiltown
Raiiway Company is dated May 1, 1897
and is for a period of 99 years, so that Uine
has been operated by the Canadian Pacifie
for over 68 years. I presumne that the C.P.R.
was at that time at ieast the owner of the
majority of the stocks and bonds. Whether
it acquired more stock in later years I do not
know, but that information will be made
available in committee.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Wiii the passtag of this bull
change the relationship between the C.P.R.
and the companies?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: No, not at ail. The
C.P.R. is acquiring ail the assets and is taking.
over ail of the liabilities of these corporations,
and the raiiways wili be operated under the
name of the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company rather than under the individual names.
Hon. Mr. Prati: Does the C.P.R. own ail
the assets?
Hon. Mr. Bouff ard: Everything-all the outstanding shares, stocks and bonds.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I wonder if the Saint
John Bridge and Raiiway Extension Company
goes to Fredericton, the capital city of New
Brunswick?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: No. The Saint John
Bridge and Railway Extension Company is
a short line starting at Lancaster and going
into the city of Saint John. It is less than
a mile in length. It goes over the bridge
to the city of Saint John and connects with
the C.P.R. there.
Hon. Mr. Pouliol: Naturally I have no
power of attorney to speak on behalf of our
distinguished colleague from Northumberland-Miramichi (Hon. Mr. Burchill), but the
other day he complained that the Canadian
National Railways and the Canadian Pacific
Railway Company had ceased to give passenger service to the city of Fredericton, the
capital of New Brunswick. I would like to
know whether the present legislation will
affect Fredericton?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It does not affect
Fredericton at all; it does not go to Fredericton. In any event, there will be no abandonment of any line or any curtailment of the
services unless so authorized by the Board of
Transport Commissioners.
Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators, I
am quite familiar with the line from Lancaster to Saint John. It has always been part of
the C.P.R. As was said a moment ago, the
bonds were taken over by the C.P.R. some
sixty years ago. The purpose of the line was
merely to connect Lancaster, or Fairville,
as it was called at that time, which was a terminal of the C.P.R., with the new union station built in Saint John when the railway
bridge was constructed across the river.
As far as the honourable senator from
Northumberland-Miramichi (Hon. Mr. Burchill) is concerned, on Thursday last he addressed a question to me regarding the closing
of the line from Fredericton Junction to
Fredericton, which of course has been operated by the privately-owned C.P.R. It is not
a Government line at all. Unfortunately, this
reflects what is happening all across Canada
in that railways are having to discontinue lines
because of insufficient passenger traffic. Fredericton has a modern airport and most people
now travel by air, bus or private automobile.
I do not want to delay the house, but I
might relate a little story about a meeting
which I attended in Ottawa not so many
years ago, to which the residents of a certain
community some miles from this city came
to complain about the abandonment of certain train service from their community to
Ottawa. There were in attendance forty-four
people from the centre involved, and the representative of the railway pointed out that
of those forty-four people, forty had come to
Ottawa by private automobile, and of the remaining four who had come by train three
had used railway passes. I feel that illustrates

the major reason for the abandonment of rail
services across Canada. People are travelling
by other means, and I do not think anyone
is to blame.
Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): Except in the Gaspé peninsula.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Well, that line is not for

passengers but for freight, and its purpose is
to open up mining and other industries.

Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Bouffard, bill referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
PRIVATE BILL
THE UNITED

CHURCH OF CANADA-SECOND
READING

Hon. George S. White moved the second

reading of Bill S-16, respecting The United
Church of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, at present
The United Church of Canada limits invest-

ments in common stocks to 15 per cent
of the ledger assets of the corporation, and the
purpose of this bill is to remove those limits.
The United Church of Canada came into
existence in July 1924, under act of federal
Parliament, chapter 100. Section 18, subsection (c) of the original act dealt with the
investment powers of church funds. At that
time the securities in which the church
could invest were somewhat restricted. In
1951 section 18, subsection (c) was repealed
and the church was given authority to invest its funds, subject to the limitation on
investments, in stocks, bonds and debentures as set out in the Canadian and British
Insurance Companies Act, chapter 31 of the
Revised Statutes of 1952. Section 63 of this
act, which covers some seven and one-half
pages, sets out very clearly a long list of

investments that may be made under the
act. An amendment which was passed in the
session of 1960-61, being chapter 13 of the
Revised Statutes of 1960-61, covers some four
and one-half pages.
Here we are concerned with

section 63,

subsection (7) of the Canadian and British
Insurance
follows:

Companies

Act, which

reads

The total book value of the
ments of a company in common
shall not exceed fifteen per cent
book value of the total assets

as

investshares
of the
of the

company.

The present bill is simply an amendment
providing that the investments by the church
shall not be subject to the limits as set

MARCH 22. 1962
out in subsection (7) of section 63. The administration of finances of the United Church
of Canada is the responsibility of the Board
of Finance, which. is composed of forty-three
members representing ail areas and branches
of the church. The administrative functions
of the board are conducted through three
departments: the Pension Departm-ent, the
Missionary and Maintenance Departmnent, and
the Treasury Department. It is the Treasury
Department which keeps the accounts of the
church, conducts the general business and
supervises ail investments made by the
church.
That department has an investment committee, primarily composed of laymen experienced and skilled in the field of investmnents.
They are as foilows: Mr. A. H. Lemnon (Chairman), Vice-President and Treasurer, The Canada Life Assurance Company; Mr. M. A.
Bradshaw, Vice-President in charge of fInance, The North American Life Assurance
Company; Mr. D'Arcy Dingle, Vice-President,
Wood, Gundy and Company Limited; Mr.
C. L. McCutcheon, retired, formeriy VicePresident, Bankers Bond Corporation Limnited;
Mr. H. R. Jackman, President, the Debenture and Securities Corporation of Canada; Mr. W. N. McLeod, retired, formerly
Chairman of the Board of Moore Corporation Limited; Mr. Fraser Wilson, Secretary,
The T. Eaton Company Limited; Mr. E. H.
Ainlay, Treasurer, National Trust Company
Limited.
At the present time the invested assets of
the United Church total some $45,400,000, held
in three separate funds, as follows:, The Pension Fund of $25 million is for the ministers
of the church, their widows and orphans. The
Lay Employees' Retirement Plan, $2,400,000,
is for the lay employees at the church headquarters, in church-run institutions, or employees of local United Churches. The General
Funds of $18 million, are made up o! permanient endowment funds, special accounts, and
reserve funds.
Honourable senators, if this bull receives
second reading, I shall move that it be referred
to the Committee on Misceilaneous Private
Bills. When the committee meets, the legal
counsel for the church will be present, and
he will have with him somne of the head
officials of the church who will be glad to
give any further explanation or information
that might be requested.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the sponsor of
the bill (Hon. Mr. White) if the hast figure
he mentioned, $18 million, is included in the
total of $45,400,000, or is it in addition to that
ainount?
Hon. Mr. White: No, it is not in addition.
The three funds 1 mentioned make up the
total of $45,400,000.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): May I
ask the honourable gentleman who introduced
the bill, what branch or body of the church
asked for this amendment?
Hon. Mr. White: Ail I can say to the honourable senator is that my interviews have
been with the local solicitor who acts for the
United Church, and I do not think I could say
who in the church asked for the amendment.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I wondered if that had ever been discussed at the
meeting of the general assembly?
Hon. Mr. White: I cannot tell you, sir.
However, I understand that when the bill is
discussed in committee, the two head officiais
of the church will be present to give that
information.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Can the
honourable gentleman tell the house if other
churches in Canada have a provision in their
charter similar to this proposed amendrnent?
Hon. Mr. White: I amn afraid I cannot answer
that; I do not know.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I arn trying to learn why the church is requesting this
amendment, and what branch of the church
is seeking it. It occurred to me that it might
be done to bring it into lime with other
churches of comparable size in Canada. I do
not understand why the proposal is being
made. The church can now invest 15 per cent
o! its funds in common stocks. Obviously it
wants to have the right to invest more than
15 per cent.
Hon. Mr. White: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Would
that apply to the pension fund only, or to the
other two funds also?
Hon. Mr. White: I refer the honourable
senator to the brief explanatory note of the
bill which says:
At present the United Church of Canada Act limits investments in common

restriction.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): My point
is, is the purpose of the amendment to remove
the restriction onhy froma the moneys which
are held by the pension fund?
Hon. Mr. White: Ail I can say to that is
that the restriction in the act simply says
that the total book value of the investments
of the corporation shahl not exceed 15 per cent

corporation; so I suppose it would apply to
whatever would be covered by 15 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable gentleman what is the restriction in the
Companies Act as to the amount of the
assets which may be invested in the common
stock of other corporations, and would the
Companies Act provide a basis, were we to
strike out this 15 per cent limitation in the
present act?

are concerned, but we are dealing here with
a trustee fund and up to the present that
fund could only invest in common stocks to
the extent of 15 per cent. Now you are proposing to take away that 15 per cent restriction entirely and, as I said before, because
the tendency today is to get a little better
return on investments, they might be inclined
to invest to a greater degree in common
stocks. That is the point.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Honourable senators, again I rise, this time to ask
the question whether the intention is just to
seek the power to invest this pension fund
under the provisions of the present bill, or
to invest all of the funds under its provisions?
Honourable senators will notice that in
paragraph 1, subclause (c) it is stated "invest
and re-invest its moneys". Now, that would
be ali its moneys, I would think. And then
it goes on to say, "to invest and re-invest its

Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Whom

Hon. Mr. White: I am told that counsel for

Hon. Calveri C. Prati: Honourable senators, as to these funds I do not think there
is need for concern, because they are especially provided for under the provisions of
the Canadian and British Insurance Companies Act, which in itself surely is a safeguard, which would be quite sufficient for the
administration of the funds. Insurance companies are regularly administering pension
funds and so forth under this act.
To my mind the only consideration for us
here is the question that has been raised
as to the authority for this enactment. Does
it come from the controlling body of the
church, that is, the general conference of the
United Church, or is it from some administrative body which might not have the actual
authority within the church to require this
to be done? As far as the practical application is concerned, my thought is that since
the funds come under the provisions of the
Canadian and British Insurance Companies
Act, surely ample security is provided. I have
some slight personal knowledge of the administration of the finances of the United
Church. I have not had any personal participation in handling the funds referred to
here, but I know something of the members
who are administering the various funds.
There are in those groups some of the most
capable financial men in Canada, and they are
guiding the church in these administrative
matters.
Hon. Mr. White: Honourable senators, a
moment ago when I was replying to the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald, Brantford) I told him that
the only interview I had was with the legal
counsel. I might say that any correspondence
I have had has been with the Reverend Ernest
G. Long, secretary of the United Church, but
I have had no interview with him.
I am sure that when the bill is before committee all the various points in question that
have been raised by honourable senators will
be answered to their entire satisfaction.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

PRIVATE BILL
GREYMAC

MORTGAGE CORPORATIONSECOND READING

Hon. John J. Connolly moved second reading of Bill S-18, to incorporate Greymac Mortgage Corporation.
He said: Honourable senators, this relatively
simple bill is to incorporate Greymac Mortgage Corporation under the general provisions
of the Loan Companies Act.
The incorporators are all Canadians, I am
informed, and most of them are lawyers, experienced in the field of mortgage work.
The capital of the company is to be $1 million. The Superintendent of Insurance to
whom the bill bas been referred has prescribed
that before a general meeting of shareholders
can be held at least $500,000 must be subscribed, and that before the company commences business $200,000 must be paid into
the treasury. The head office of the company
will be in Hamilton.
Honourable senators, perhaps I should say
something about the bill itself. A mortgage
company of this character cannot, under the
provisions of section 4 of the Loan Companies
Act, be incorporated by letters patent; it must
be incorporated by act of Parliament. The
bill which is submitted to Parliament in the
normal case is in the form of the model bill
provided in the schedule to the act. In this
case the form in the schedule to the act has
been rigidly adhered to.
The powers of a company incorporated in
this way are set out in the Loan Companies
Act and, more specifically, in sections 60 and
62 of that act. I restrict myself to those two
sections because they are the two powers
section, and they are so referred to in the
interpretation section, namely, section 2 (1) (f).
One of the powers provided in section 60
of the Loan Companies Act for a company
of this character is the power to lend money
on the security of mortgages. Section 62 also
allows the company to act as agent for other
companies or individuals supplying money for
the purpose of lending upon the security of
mortgages.
Under the provisions of section 60(l)(f) of
the Loan Companies Act, companies of this
kind are restricted in the amount of money
they can lend on the security of mortgages to
two-thirds of the value of the land which is
to be taken as security. However, such a company-and 1 am told this is the intention of

SENATE
the incorporators of this company-can become an "approved lender" under the provisions of the National Housing Act by applying for that status to the Central Mortgage
and Housing Corporation. Of course, great
advantages accrue to borrowers if they can
come within the provisions of the National
Housing Act. This act permits lenders to lend
to a greater percentage of the value of the
land, and to extend longer terms than are
normally allowed in conventional mortgages.
There are certain privileges of repayment
specified in the National Housing Act which
normally do not apply in the case of conventional loans. And, perhaps more important
than anything else, the loans are insured.
I believe it can be said generally that this
company proposes to occupy a portion of the
field now occupied by the lending institutions
of this country which qualify as "approved
lenders" under the National Housing Act. I
am informed that there are various ways and
means of attracting funds to a company like
this, and that it expects to fIl some of the
vacuum that from time to time exists when
regular lenders, the big institutional lenders
of Canada, have exhausted the funds they
have allocated particularly for loans under
the National Housing Act.
The bill has been submitted to the Superintendent of Insurance. I cannot assure honourable senators that he will be present at
the committee hearing, but if honourable senators require either him or someone from his
office to be present, I am sure there would be
no difficulty in having a representative attend.
As this is a private bill, I think the appropriate committee to which it should be sent
is the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Will the company be
lending on farm lands?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I do not
think there is any restriction in that respect.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: What is the intention?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): The intention is to take advantage of the provisions,
mainly of the National Housing Act.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: What is the par value of
the stock?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I wondered about that myself.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Since it has not been fixed,
I presume that it will be fixed by the act
and will be $100 per share?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I am
afraid the honourable senator will have to
wait until the committee hearing to obtain
an answer to that question.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I understand that a company incorporated under the
Loan Companies Act can receive deposits. My
question is: will this company be empowered
to invest all its funds in loans under the National Housing Act? Is there any restriction
as to how much of its funds can be used under
the National Housing Act? Were it not for
the National Housing Act, they could invest
in mortgages only up to 60 per cent of their
value.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Sixty-six and two-thirds
per cent.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Yes, sixtysix and two-thirds per cent, under the amendment. But they are going to be empowered to
invest in mortgages under the National Housing Act, and that allows investment of up to
90 per cent in some cases.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is right, but it is
guaranteed.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): That is
quite so. I think the honourable senator
must make a distinction between the percentage of the value of the real estate up
to which the company can loan, and whether
or not it will be lending all of its assets. Certainly, in the latter case I believe it is a matter of business judgment. I presume that, like
any other lending company, it would decide
in a given period of time that it would have
so much money to lend. For the sake of
argument, let us say it planned to put out
$200,000 over a period of six months. That
would go out on the basis of each individual
loan being scrutinized; if it were under a
National Housing Act, and if it were a
multiple family unit, then it could lend up
to 80 per cent of the value of the land and
buildings to be mortgaged in that particular
case.
Motion agreed to and bibi rend second
time.

FINANCE CHARGES (DISCLOSURE) BILL
SECOND READING-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
March 21, the adjourned debate on the motion
of Hon. Mr. Croll, for the second reading of
Bill S-2, to make provision for the disclosure
of information in respect of finance charges.
Hon. Sydney J. Smith: Honourable senators, as many previous speakers have mentioned, Bill S-2 is the third in a series of
three bills, all of which have aimed at providing for the disclosure of information in
respect of finance charges. The version which
is before us now reflects some of the sound
criticism which was directed at the two
previous bills. I regret that the honourable

sponsor of this bill (Hon. Mr. Crol) is not
in his seat, for I wish to congratulate him on
his amending it so that it is now divorced
from the Criminal Code. The bill has also
been trimmed down and now applies to the
field of consumer credit only, and has no
application to cash loans, mortgages on real
estate and that sort of consumer finance.
The bill in its present form meets two of
the three major objections I made to last
year's bill. I feel, naturally, that my criticism
at that time was not in vain, and I consider
the bill in its present form worthy of further
study, particularly in connection with the
requirement that the finance charges shall
be expressed as a percentage of simple annual
interest. I am sure the honourable sponsor of
the bill (Hon. Mr. Croil) continues to welcome observations and suggestions that are
intended to help him accomplish his basic
object, and in this respect I wish to repeat
my third major objection of last year, and
point out why I consider that the bill in its
present form raises a very serious problem.
It is quite apparent that the honourable
senator from Toronto-Spadina realizes that
the calculation of the finance charges in terms
of simple annual interest is a difficult one,
for he disposes of it by providing that the
regulations under which this act will operate
will be made by the Governor in Council. In
my opinion this is akin to sweeping the problem under the rug. The method or formula
for determining the percentage rates should
be spelled out in the bill. If not, the act will
be ineffective. I am satisfied that if the bill
in its present form becomes law it will either
go on the shelf and be forgotten, or it will
become the subject of long and expensive
litigation and may eventually be amended.
Some honourable senators who have spoken
in this debate have expressed confidence in
their ability to produce some simple table or
chart that could be used by a vendor to
determine the required percentage rate. This
matter should be pursued by the committee
in an effort to arrive at some solution of the
problem, and to canvass the possibility of
producing such a table or chart from which
a rapid and reasonably accurate calculation
of the exact rate could be made.
This bill confines itself to the sale of
goods and services on a consumer credit
basis, and I want to say something about
the people who are engaged in this type of
time-sales business. Generally speaking, the
people who are engaged in the sale of goods
and services on a consumer credit basis are
honest, respectable and responsible people.
They have to be such under our present competitive system, but while competition controls to some extent the methods used in
business, I know that there are exceptions.

SENATE
As I said when speaking on a similar
bill in the past, we find scoundrels and
scalawags in every walk of life, and I can
just hear someone say, "We should do something to control the operations of such
people". I am in complete agreement with
that thought, but I think we should look
beyond abuses that may exist; that is, while
not overlooking abuses, we should look
beyond them in an effort to find a workable
method for dealing with them. It is one
thing to diagnose an illness, but whether you
diagnose it rightly or wrongly it is an entirely
different matter to prescribe a cure, and
sometimes the cure is worse than the disease.
It may call for trying one method and
then another, and the process of trial and
error can long delay the cure.
In connection with the subject now under
consideration, if we follow a process of trial
and error in an effort to control certain
operations by legislation, we may find it will
take a long time to accomplish much. I do
not think that responsible and reputable
businessmen engaged in consumer credit
business are unwilling or even reluctant
to declare openly the cost of their credit
service. I can speak with some authority
about the automobile business, which is responsible for about two-thirds of all consumer
business done in Canada. I have examined
the time-payment contract forms used by
the major automobile finance companies in
Canada, and I say without any hesitation
that they all provide for a complete statement of finance charges. They must do this
in order to comply with the provincial laws
which exist in most if not all provinces.
I know that in British Columbia we have an
act controlling this sort of thing. It is
patterned to a large extent on the Ontario
law, which was referred to during this debate
by the honourable senator from HastingsFrontenac (Hon. Mr. White).
Over a period of some 40 years I have had
thousands of these forms cross my desk as
completed contracts, and I have yet to see one
single contract that would give any person
who can subtract one figure from another any
difficulty in ascertaining the difference between the cash price and the time price. The
details and figures are plainly written, and
the operators who handle this class of timepayment business have no objection to a law
that would make it mandatory for them to
do what they are already doing.
There is one obligation prescribed in this
bill that worries them, namely, that imposed
by clause 3, subclause (c), which calls for setting out the percentage relationship, expressed in terms of simple annual interest,
that the total amount of the finance charges
bears to the unpaid balance outstanding under

the transaction. No one has ever been able
to convert the sum that represents the difference between the cash price and the total
time price into a percentage rate, based on
simple annual interest and within a reasonable degree of accuracy, by a formula that
would lend itself to rapid calculation. According to the bill this act when passed will be
subject to regulations referred to in clause
5. That clause reads as follows:
The Governor in Council may make
regulations prescribing
(a) the form and manner in which the
written statement referred to in section 3
is to ba made;
(b) the manner of calculating the total
amount of the finance charges to be borne
and the manner of calculating the simple
annual interest thereon in respect of any
transaction or type of transaction; and
(c) the degree of accuracy within which
the total amount of the finance charges
and the annual interest thereon shal be
calculated.
That is an open admission that there is a problem here, and provision must be made for a
margin of accuracy. I shall come back to that
in a few minutes.
If I were opposed to this bill and did not
wish it to come into effect at all, I would be
quite satisfied to leave it unaltered because
I am convinced that it could not be made to
work. If it is left to the Governor in Council
to produce regulations under which it will
operate, I cannot imagine the Cabinet, or any
other body, taking the responsibility of producing a formula for arriving at the percentage rate which would make this legislation
workable.
I am sure the honourable senator who sponsored the bill (Hon. Mr. Croll) will not object
to my borrowing his example of the $20 battery deal. I think the example originated
with the Retail Merchants Association, which
received 25 replies to inquiries made in order
to ascertain the interest rate in percentage
points of a $2 finance charge. The 25 replies
contained 25 different answers. With reference
to the 25 different answers, the honourable
senator who sponsored the bill said:
That may be true, but they would all
be reasonably close.
Well, I have done some checking too and I
am not at all sure that they would be reasonably close. The honourable senator himself
made a rapid calculation in the house, treating this as a two-month credit, which it is
not, and on that basis he arrived at a 60 per
cent simple annual interest rate on a figure
of $20, for two months.

MARCH 23, 1962
Another honourable senator who dealt with
the same question said he made the calculation on the basis that the average amount of
money outstanding over the period of two
months would be $10 and not $20, and that
therefore the effective or true rate of interest
on an annual basis would be 120 per cent.
As I have said, I did some checking myself
but before giving you my answer I would
like to call attention to the regulations provided for in the bill for prescribing the
degree of accuracy of calculations. What would
be a reasonable degree of accuracy to be
prescribed by the regulations? Should it be
one-half of 1 per cent, 2 per cent, 5 per cent,
or 25 per cent, 50 per cent or even 100 per
cent?
Now, I have had an actuarial rate struck
on this example which was given by the
honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Croîl). As a
matter of fact, it was arrived at by the
mechanical or electronic calculator and rechecked by three individuals on a per diem
basis, and would therefore be accurate. As I
will explain later, this is not a two-month
loan, but is only a matter of days. It checks
out on that basis to 146 per cent, which shows
what little meaning the percentage rate has,
when one considers the facts related to the
actual transaction. In such a case, however,
at 146 per cent, which I am satisfied that I
can show is an accurate rate, the two honourable gentlemen who arrived at an answer by
rapid calculation methods were .out 86 per cent
and 26 per cent respectively. I can understand
quite easily that the 25 persons who sent
replies to the retail merchants might all vary,
and I am not at all prepared to accept the
assumption that they were reasonably close
to the accurate rate.
Before I leave this $20 battery deal, I wish
to point out to honourable senators that such
an example is very misleading as compared
with, say, the example of the sale of an automobile for $5,000, with a cash payment of 40
per cent and the balance over a long term,
or the sale of an expensive airplane to an
established air line with established credit. I
can assure you that a great deal of air line
equipment is financed by finance companies,
just as printing plant machinery, bakeshop
equipment, and even new roofs for buildings,
are financed in this manner. Time-payment
deals for larger amounts, particularly if there
is a substantial cash payment, or if the purchaser has established a good credit record,
involve finance charges that when converted
to a percentage rate would produce a figure
quite incomparable to the rate applying to a
small deal, without any cash payment, and to
an obviously questionable credit risk.
It would be hard to find a more extreme
case than the one used of a $20 sale, without
26211-3-25

any down payment, repayable in four small
instalments over a period of 46 days, carrying
a finance charge of $2, which works out to
146 per cent per annum simple interest.
The service station that sold the battery
cannot exist on the sale of one battery; it
sells hundreds, perhaps thousands of batteries.
Let us say they sell 100 batteries to similar
customers, on similar terms as used in the
example. It is a foregone conclusion that some
of 100 customers will walk in on due dates
and make their payments. It is also a foregone
conclusion that many will be late, that some
will never walk in-they will have to be
chased at great expense-and that some of the
money will never be collected. So who would
say that the vendor is not entitled to a $2
finance charge, regardless of the simple annual interest rate? I do not think anyone
would object to that small finance charge
per deal, which in the case of 100 customers
would amount to only $200. It would be a
common experience for a dealer in making 100
such deals to lose more than $200, which he
would never collect, to say nothing of what
he might spend trying to collect.
The proposal to express finance charges in
terms of interest is not a new idea. It has
been studied by scores of committees and commissions, with the result that there is a tremendous volume of reliable material in book
form available to the researcher. A study of
such material reveals that interest is a payment for waiting for the return of moneyfor "forbearance", more specifically-and this
is the most important thing to observe: pure
interest is a payment for forbearance on a
riskless investment.
Among the authorities I have read is a
book written by a renowned economist, entitled Principles of Economics, published in
1890 by Macmillans of London. It sums up
the situation better than anything else I have
read. At page 620, in commenting on the
problem of cost in connection with loans, it
says:
When there is any risk that the interest
and the capital will not be duly paid, a
special allowance must of course be made
under this head for insurance against
risk. This is obvious, and is not often
overlooked. But it is less obvious that
every loan causes some trouble to the
lender; and that from the nature of the
case, the loan involves considerable risks,
a good deal of trouble has often to be
taken to keep these risks as small as
possible; and that then a great part of
what appears to the borrower as interest
is, from the point of view of the lender,
earnings of management of a troublesome
business.

SENATE
I point these things out, honourable senators,
not as destructive criticism, but as evidence
of the grave complexity of the problem involved in this bill relating to the percentage
rate on a simple annual interest basis. One
solution might be to make it mandatory for
vendors of goods and services, on credit, to use
the services of licensed actuarial experts, who
of course would charge a fee which would
have to be included in the finance charge.
This is what Pierre Berton did, according to
the example given us by the sponsor of the
bill (Hon. Mr. Croil). I imagine these experts
would have to be licensed, if this is to be the
solution to the problem. They would charge a
fee under any circumstances, and that would
be another item of cost. There is only one
person to whose account it would be added
and from whom it would be collected, and
that is the purchaser.
Another solution would be for vending firms
to buy or rent this calculating equipment,
which is very expensive. That also would add
another item of cost which would find its
way into the finance charge before the final
total was arrived at.
Another solution would be to permit the
use of the words "more or less" to be inserted after the figure purporting to be the
rate. Still another solution would be to eliminate the percentage requirement from the
bill entirely, as was suggested by one honourable senator. Yet another solution would
be to await the report of the royal commisison that has been set up to inquire into
all aspects of banking and finance. This
body is now holding sessions throughout
Canada. The great importance and the growing volume of consumer credit business in
Canada will surely receive the attention
of that commission. There is every reason to
hope that the report and recommendations
of the commission will offer something of
interest.
I am glad to see that so many interested
persons and organizations have taken the
trouble to express their views on this bill
to members of the Senate. The many letters
and briefs that I have received are all from
supporters of the bill, and I am going to do
what I can to see that they get more than an
unworkable, empty gesture. At no time has
there been any evidence of a high pressure campaign or lobby by those opposed to
it. Unfortunately, constructive criticism has
been misinterpreted by some sections of the
press and public to mean that the Senate
is engaged in a battle between those who
uphold the truth and those who do not. This
of course is ridiculous.
If this bill, honourable senators, is referred
to committee, I commend to it for further

study and consideration the several alternatives that I have suggested to meet the
difficulty related to the percentage feature of
the bill.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Higgins, debate
adjourned.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Walier M. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I have been expecting all day to receive
from the other place the bill dealing with
supplementary estimates No. 3, for the fiscal
year 1961-62 which comes to an end next
week. There is a possibility that we will
receive this bill shortly; in fact, from inquiries I have made I gather that it may
reach us by four o'clock. However, as it is
now ten minutes to four and we have no
further information, it may be later.
All I can do at the present moment is
ask the Senate to adjourn during pleasure
to reassemble at the call of the bell when
the bill becomes available. I would like
to have it dealt with this afternoon, if possible, to meet the heavy payments which
have to be made to the Canadian armed
forces before the end of the month. It is
already so late that it is doubtful that all will
get their cheques by then. Therefore, I hope
we can deal with these supplementary estimates this afternoon, so that there will be
no more delay than is absolutely necessary
under the circumstances.
For those reasons, I now ask that the
Senate adjourn during pleasure to reassemble
at the call of the bell.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Honourable senators, I am just as anxious as is
the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) to see that the troops receive their
pay. I know that when I was a soldier if I did
not receive my pay I did not like it very
much.
Honourable senators, this is the same old
story over again. Whenever we receive
supplementary estimates, everything has to
be done at the last minute. I was hopeful
that there would be a change in this respect.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Honourable senatorsHon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): My honourable friend from Winnipeg South (Hon.
Mr. Thorvaldson) is about to blame it on
the House of Commons. Now, he cannot
blame everything on the other house. I know
that the Government has taken a lot of
blame, but they have a lot of blame to take
for their responsibility in this matter.
When I am speaking on the bill I shall
point out how many supplementary estimates
we have had this year, and we have been in

MARCH 23, 1962
session for two months. That is the way the
country is being run. We should have had
one set of supplementary estimates which
included everything, and it could have been
introduced a rnonth ago. I would remind my
honourable friend frorn Winnipeg South (Hon.
Mr. Thorvaldson) and other honourable
gentlemen, that this is flot the final supplementary estirnates. There is another one yet
to corne. Next week we shall have another
one.
I say with deep regret that I arn forced
to go along with the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), and I arn doing it
for the sole reason that I do not want in any
way to delay soldiers, airmen or seamen receiving their pay.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
At 5 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
APPROPRIATION BILL No. 2, 1962
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-78, for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money
for the public service for the financial year
ending the 3lst March, 1962.
Bill read first Urne.
SECOND READING

The Han. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shaîl this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. Walter M. Aseltine: For the reasons
that 1 gave a short time ago, I move, with
leave of the Senate, that the bill be read the
second trne now.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Have copies of the bill been
distributed?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: There are only a few
copies of the bill, which is a very short one,
but there are ample copies of the supplementary estimates, in case any honourable
senator has not brought his copy with him.
The bill is in the usual f orrn consisting of
four short paragraphs, providing for these
moneys.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is because I have *a suspicious mind that I should like to see it.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I have an extra copy of
the bill which I can give the honourable
senator.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Thank you.
Han. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senatars, I
shahl be as brief as I can in my explanation
26211-3-25J

of the bill. It provîdes for payrnent out of the
Consolidated Revenue Fund o! a surn not
exceeding $153,270,929, for the purposes mentîoned in the supplernentary estirnates, which
have now been before honourable senators
for almost a rnonth. I presume that ail honourable senators have read and considered
these supplernentary estimates many times.
I shall do my best to explain sorne of the
more important ones, for your information.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: Are these the further
Supplernentary Estirnates (3)?
Han. Mr. Aselline: Yes, No. 3.
First, I should like to deal with Vote 615,
which provides $190,000 to cover the arnount
required for contributions to the Prairie
provinces, to pay one-half of the amounts
paid by the governents of those provinces
to farmers in respect of the harvesting and
baling of drought-ridden crops for fodder, to
a maximum of $2.50 per ton. The other ha]!,
$2.50 per ton, has been paid by the provinces.
This prograrn was devised to encourage
farmers to cut their early grain crops which
were not worth harvesting as grain, but which
could be made into good fodder for livestock,
if cut at the proper time. The federal share
was $190,000. In Manitoba 8,000 tons were
cut and $20,000 was paid by the federal
Government; in Saskatchewan, 65,000 tons
were cut, and $162,500 paid by the federal
Governrnent; in Alberta, 3,000 tons, and
$7,500-making a total of $190,000.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Who makes the estirnate of
the tonnage to be cut? You pay by the ton,
$2.50 a ton?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: The total price was $5
per ton; $2.50 was paid by the province which
did the inspecting, and the other $2.50 per
ton was paid by the federal Governrnent.
As a result o! this measure 75,000 or 80,000
tons of feed were produced, and in view af
the fact the farrners destroyed what was left
of their crops, they were paid titis amount ta
reimburse them.
I turn to Vote 616. Titis also was found
necessary on account of the drought In the
Prairie provinces, which was not fareseeable.
The surn o! $100,000 is for the purpose o!
making better use o! community pastures;
$1 million is for water development, dugouts,
stock watering dams, assistance to municipalities in drilling wells, and that kind o!
service. Titis was necessary because there had
been fia rain in many districts for over two
years.
Work has been going an for some time on
the St. Mary's irrigation project. It has been
proceeding more rapidly than was expected.
This improved progress was due ta the long
period of favourable weather. This makes it

SENATE
necessary to provide now a sum of $500,000.
The same situation applies to the South
Saskatchewan River Dam project, for which
$1,600,000 is required. That amount is required because the work is ahead of schedule,
as a consequence of the favourable weather.
In the main estimates $13,050,000 was provided; the actual requirements are estimated
now to be $14,650,000; therefore, the additional amount required is $1,600,000.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Will that
amount complete the dam in Saskatchewan?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No, I do not think so. It
will not be completed until about 1965.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): You
referred to the complete amount.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: No, I do not remember
referring to any complete amount.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): I thought
you used those words.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I said that in the main
estimates $13,050,000 was provided, but the
actual requirements total $14,650,000. The
difference between these two sums is the
amount of this vote.
Hon. Mr. Wall: In regard to the $1 million
for water development, am I right in presuming that this is added to the previous sum?
Could the honourable senator tell us the total
amount expended for water development, and
in what province?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That is Vote 616. I said
that $1 million is being provided for water
development because of the drought conditions which prevail in those provinces. The
amount of $550,000 was provided in the main
estimates for this purpose. The expenditures
and the number of applications received indicate that 1961-62 will be a record year for
this assistance. It is anticipated that some
8,750 projects will receive assistance, at a total
cost of $1,700,000.
There is also a program to assist municipalities is drilling wells, which was not provided
for in the main estimates.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
Leader of the Government if he has any information as to the amount of money that
has already been spent on the South Saskatchewan Dam?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: During the first years
this project was behind schedule, and on that
account considerable funds lapsed. Construction progress has been excellent this year due
mainly to the splendid weather. The funds
provided in the main estimates are insufficient
if progress is maintained at the current level.
That is the reason this money is needed at
this time.

Hon. Mr. Reid: I still do not know how
much money has been spent.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): You are
still uninformed.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I
would like to refer next to Vote 636, which
has to do with technical and vocational training assistance.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I wonder if, before he
deals with that, the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), would tell
me if I am correct in understanding that
Votes 615, 616 and 617 in the amounts of
$190,000, $3,200,000 and $498,693, for a total
of $3,888,693 in supplementary estimates, all
apply to the three Prairie provinces?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: The two votes I mentioned first have to do with the Prairie provinces.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Did you deal with the
third one which is headed "special"?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Votes 615 and 616.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: What about Vote 617?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I was not going to deal
with Vote 617. I can deal with it if you
wish me to, but I do not have time to deal
with every item.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: The point I make is that
this is the third group of supplementary
estimates, and when one looks at these items
it can be seen that every one of them could
have been included in the main estimates.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No. The main estimates
provided for $690,483, and there have been
no supplementaries prior to this one. This
supplementary is for $498,693, and the total
amount required is $1,189,176. If necessary
I can give all the details of how that amount
is made up, but it will take me some considerable time.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): And the
soldiers will not get their pay.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes; I will come to
that one presently.
I wish to deal next with Vote 636 which
is for the large sum of $28,400,000. This has
to do with technical and vocational training,
and provides for payments to the provinces,
the Northwest Territories and the Yukon
under agreements entered into under authority of the Technical and Vocational Training
Assistance Act. The agreements are in effect for a six-year period ending March 31,
1967, and include provision for a federal
contribution of 75 per cent of expenditures
incurred by the provinces prior to April 1,
1963, for training facilities, and after that the

MARCH 23, 1962
contribution is to be 50 per cent. This supplementary estimate is required to meet
additional claims which are anticipated as a
result of the large expansion in the program
to provide facilities for technical and vocational training as well as to meet increased
operational expenses under several of the
training programs.
An amount of $24,550,000 is for capital assistance for the various projects, 245 of which
have already been given approval. One
hundred and thirty-four are for new schools,
80 are for major additions, and 31 for minor
additions. It is estimated that these projects
will provide for 90,000 additional student
placements. Included is one new institute of
technology, 18 new trade schools, five new
combined trade schools and institutes of
technology, and 114 new vocational schools.
The training programs-that is for youths and
adults-include vocational high school training, technical training, trade and occupational
training, training in industry, of unemployed
persons, of disabled persons, of technical
and vocational teachers, and vocational correspondence courses mostly for students of
grade eight education and under.
There was provided in the main estimates
$46,600,000; the total amount is $75 million,
and the amount now required is $28,400,000.
Hon. Mr. Smith (Kamloops): May I ask the
honourable Leader of the Government
whether there is a deadline for applications
under this scheme? In other words, have we
passed the deadline or is there a further
period for consideration of applications?

connection with movements of coal under conditions prescribed by the Governor in Council.
Electric power in Ontario placed an order for
200,000 tons with Nova Scotia producers, at a
cost of $1,978,000.
The sum of $1,900,000 was used to provide
for losses incurred by the Dominion Coal Company and associated companies in maintaining
three coal mines in operation beyond the time
ordinarily required for closure. The remaining
$900,000 was to cover the increase in the
amount of coking coal shipped for export to
Japan. The original order was 500,000 tons.
Subsequently that was increased, and the
amount shipped was 700,000 tons. The subsidy
was $4.50 a ton.
I come now to vote 644 for $35 million,
which has to do with the Canadian Army. It
is chiefly required to cover pay and allowances
arising out of Cabinet decisions for an increase of 10,600 men in the Canadian Army
in Canada, and an increase of 1,100 in the
strength of the Canadian Army brigade in
Europe, as well as for a special program for
the training of 100,000 militia men during the
winter of 1961-62, and to cover the cost of
the acceleration of the national survival program. The estimated cost of the carrying out
of these decisions was $37,742,000, but because of certain surpluses in other items it
is estimated that $35 million will be sufficient.
Details will be found on page 14 of the printed
estimates. It will be noted that $23,120,000 is
for pay and allowances. That amount is now
due, and that is one important reason that
these supplementaries should be dealt with by
this House as expeditiously as possible.

Hon. Mr. Aselline: The deadline is March
31, 1967.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): As far
as I know, honourable senators, there is no
provision in these supplementary estimates. I
might add that we are very hopeful that provision will be made by August so that Mine
16 will be able to keep in operation.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I come now to Vote
645-Royal Canadian Air Force. The main
estimate was $235 million-odd. There were
no previous supplementary estimates. This
supplementary is for $31 million, making
the total amount required $266,887,000. The
$31 million is made up mostly of the purchase
of aircraft and engines for which a total
of $194 million was paid out.
The approved estimates provided for
$146,800,000. The difference is $47,200,000,
but there were certain surpluses left over
from other estimates which reduced the
amount required.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I will deal next with
Vote 669-Labour. This represents a loan of
$25 million to the Unemployment Insurance
Fund. It will only be used if it becomes necessary to do so between now and the end
of May, when payments are at the peak. In
June the amount contributed begins to overtake the amount paid out. This is just a safety
measure, should there be heavy lay-offs in
some parts of the country or should unemployment occur from a labour dispute. At the
end of January last the balance remaining in
the fund was $135,877,305. At present the
outgoings are 17 per cent less than they were
a year ago, which is an indication of general
economic improvement.

Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): I wonder if the honourable Leader of the Government could give us a little more information
on this matter. Could he tell us what is in the

be necessary to loan this money at all-that
is the hope. However, they want to have it
available if it should be needed between now
and the end of May.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Would that be due to an

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: There is an increase in

ask, but I do not want to make it difficult
for the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine). I notice that the
increase in contributions came in under legislation we had in force about a year ago, and
related to the difference in the total. The increase in contributions from employers and
employees for 1959-60 totalled between $40
million and $50 million. That increased
amount, of course, did not do anything to
solve the major problem of the drain on the
fund. Now we are being asked to vote half
that amount, which is supposed to solve this
problem. I am afraid I cannot admit to being
as strong an optimist as the honourable
Leader of the Government.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: I hope it will be sufficient.
The next vote is No. 670, for National Defence. In the main estimate the sum of $5
million was provided. In these supplementary
estimates there is a further $5 million, making a total of $10 million. This vote is required for service rental housing projects already authorized, plus further projects which
have been approved in principle by the
Treasury Board. Already approved projects
total $9,784,318. The amount for projects
approved in principle was $16,470,000, making
a total of $26,254,318. Already there had
been provided in previous years $22 million
of that anount, which leaves a balance now
required of $4,254,318-in round figures, $5
million.

Hon. John J. Connolly: Are ail these expenditures to be made in Canada or are they
for forces elsewhere?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: They are all in Canada
-St. James, Manitoba; Summerside, Prince
Edward Island; Uplands, Ontario; North Bay;
Red Deer, Alberta; Dartmouth, Nova Scotia;
London, Ontario; Winnipeg; Halifax; Perth;
Carp, etc.
The votes which I have dealt with so far
total $132,590,000, out of total supplementary requirements of $153 million-odd.
Should honourable senators require information with respect to other items I will be
only too pleased to furnish it if it is at al
possible for me to do so.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) has given a fair
explanation of all the items, having regard
to the very limited time at his disposal. He
started to speak at five o'clock, and it is now
twenty minutes before six. My time is even
more limited, because I understand that the
Deputy to His Excellency the Governor General will arrive in about five minutes.
The Hon. the Speaker: He bas arrived.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Then I
hope it will not be considered an affront if
I take up five minutes of his time.
The honourable Leader of the Government
has gone over the estimates which are before
us, and has had to handle them in a hit-andmiss manner. He has not had time to do otherwise. I shall have to handle them in less of
a "hit" and more of a "miss" manner.
I must bring to the attention of this bouse
the fact that these are the third supplementary estimates we have had before us this
year. Honourable senators will recall that it
is customary for me to review the financial
position of the Government when we are
considering supplementary estimates. I will
have to forego that custom at this time, but
I do hope that more time will be made available when the next supplementary estimates
come before us.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I can table ail of the
figures if the honourable senator wishes to
have them on the record.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): I will
have them, no doubt, when the next supplementary estimates come before us. I hope the
limited time at our disposai then will not tie
my tongue, for I would like to give my views
as to the way finances have been administered
by the Government during the past year.
However, honourable senators, I do think
it is unnecessary to have so many supplementary estimates. Considerable time could

SENATE
have been saved if there were fewer supplementary estimates, and if the many were
combined in one. It might be said that the
larger amounts would still be discussed, but
I point out that every time supplementary
estimates are tabled Parliament feels it must
start over again and discuss in detail the
individual departments. Supplementary estimates provoke discussion, and discussion is
bound to take up considerable time.
We have before us now the third further
supplementary estimates, and my honourable
friend the Leader of the Government tabled
in the house the other day the fourth further
supplementary estimates. I have looked over
these, honourable senators, and I cannot see
why these two sets of estimates could not
have been tabled as one.
With respect to Agriculture, for instance,
the honourable Leader of the Government
referred to Vote 615. There are similar items
under Agriculture in the estimates he has
tabled, and these could all have been considered at the same time.
I am not unreasonable. I do not say that it
is possible at the beginning of the session to
table main estimates which include everything, but I do think that the Government
should have foreseen some of the expenditures in these supplementary estimates.
My honourable friend referred a minute
ago to Vote 644, under National Defence. He
said that that item of defence included pay
for 10,000 men who had been taken on
strength. Well, I know that those men were
taken on strength almost a year ago. Why,
then, could not that estimate have been included in one of the previous supplementary
estimates? The Government knew it had to
make the payment, but it waited until the
last minute of this fiscal year to ask for the
money.
I would remind honourable senators that
previous to these supplementary estimates, the
main supplementary estimates were tabled in
the house in June 1961, and further supplementary estimates were tabled in July of that
year, and now in the present session three
supplementary estimates have been tabled in
this house in two months. How is the Government running this country? Is it considering the payments that have to be made
from week to week, or every two weeks, or
even every three weeks? I put this question
because there have been three supplementary
estimates tabled in eight weeks. It seems to
me that a merchant running a country store
carries on his operations in a more businesslike manner than this Government is carrying on the $6 billion corporation known as
the Government of Canada.
Are we to understand that the Government
could not tell two months ago how much

money would be required to carry on the
ordinary business of the country? Can anyone take satisfaction from that? I certainly
can't. I say that there is nothing in the supplementary estimates No. 3 that could not
have been included in No. 4, and vice versa.
In fact, there is one item of $250,000 in supplemenetary estimates No. 4 which is to be
paid to the war veterans under the War
Veterans Allowance Act, which should be included, if any item should, in the present
supplementary estimates. That money must
be paid to the veterans by the end of this
month-at least, in all fairness to them it
should be paid-but the amount is not provided for in the supplementary estimates now
under consideration. Does that mean that at
the last hour of this month we are going to
be presented with an item for this amount?
I am not going to object to the payment of
this money. I am not going to hold up the
supplementary estimates at that time so as to
prevent the veterans from getting this money,
but I say that this item above all others in
supplementary estimates No. 4 should have
been included in the present supplementary
estimates.
The honourable Leader of the Government
referred to an item of $25 million for the
Unemployment Insurance Fund. I am of the
opinion that had the fund been properly administered-and I am putting the blame on
the Government and not on the commissionthis payment of $25 million would never have
been necessary.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: What are your suggestions?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): I will
give my friend the answer in just a moment.
Before doing so perhaps I had better bring to
the attention of the house just where we
stand with respect to unemployment in
Canada today. Perhaps someone will say to
me, "Oh, it is not as bad as last year." Thank
goodness it is not, but it is still very bad.
There are 583,000 people out of work in
Canada today, and I must point out to honourable senators that that is the highest percentage of unemployment in the world.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: And your party
seems to take a great deal of satisfaction in it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Bran±ford): I do not
take any satisfaction in it, and I hope my
friend from Winnipeg South does not eitherI am sure he does not.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Of course not.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): And of
course I do not. However, that is the sad fact
of the condition of unemployment in Canada
today. Normally, there are 6,438,000 persons

MARCH 23, 1962
employed. Using round figures, of six million
people who are normally working, half a
million are out of work.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: The United States
percentage is much higher.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): The
United States percentage is much lower than
that, and my friend cannot take cold comfort
in his thought, because it is not correct.
Honourable senators, it is not a very happy
condition to have as large a number of
unemployed persons in a country blessed
with so many of the good things of life.
I would point out to my friends that all
these unemployed persons are not on unemployment insurance. How those who are not
on it are able to get along, I do not know.
Even with this smaller number of unemployed who enjoy the benefits of unemployment insurance, it is not a happy condition
to exist, to say the least. I would say the
country is in a very sick condition, and I
repeat that the illness is due in large measure
to the way this fund has been administered
by this Government.
Let me remind honourable senators that
when this Government came into office in
1957 there was $900 million in the Unemployment Insurance Fund. On March 31, 1958
it was down to $754 million. On March 31,
1959, it was down to $512 million.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Because of the mess
that your party made of things.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): On March
31, 1960 it was down to $383 million. My
friend said something about a mess. Well,
after the present Government had been in
power for four years, the Unemployment
Insurance Fund had gone down from $900
million to $140 million at the end of March
1961, and unfortunately the fund continues
to go down. The last figures obtainable show
that at the end of February, 1962 there was
$104,618,000 in the fund. Well, all I can say
is that the Government has not done very
well for this ailing patient.
You ask, why do I blame the Government?
Altogether apart from its general policies,
a considerable amount of the money from
that fund has been improperly used by the
Government. If the directors of an insurance
company had used the funds of their policyholders in the manner in which the Government has used the money of the policyholders in this fund-and every worker who
contributes is a policyholder-to say the least,
they would have found themselves in grave
difficulties.
The concept of insurance has been entirely
forgotten and the fund has been raided to
provide benefits for those who did not come
under the provisions of the act.
26211-3-26

I say that would have been a breach of
trust had it been done by directors of an insurance company. Why do I say that? Well,
honourable senators, in 1958 the fund was
called upon to provide seasonal benefits to
those who did not come within the provisions
of the fund. Now, honourable senators, do
not say, "Why shouldn't they have been
helped?" I say they should have been helped,
but they should not be helped by money to
which they were not entitled; they should not
have been helped by using the funds to which
the policyholders had contributed.
In 1958 this Government took $63 million
from that fund, and in 1959 it took $116 million, making a total of $179 million, to pay
Canadian workers who had not contributed
to the fund.
Now, honourable senators, let me make
myself clear. I think those people who got the
money should have been helped, but they
should have been helped from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. That is where the money
should have been taken from. If the unemployment fund had been properly administered, this amount of $25 million would not
be needed today. There would have been in
the fund today, in addition to what is there
now, $179 million.
Three years ago a conversion loan was
floated and the commissioners, I am informed,
were directed to convert the short-term bonds
which they held into long-term bonds, which
they did. Then the commission had to have
more money, and it had to sell the long-term
bonds. These short-term bonds, if held, could
have been sold at par, but, as happened, they
had to be sold and the loss amounted to
$27,758,000. Therefore, had those bonds been
held, and had the fund been properly administered, it would today have $200 million
more than it has.
Is there any reason why I should not be
incensed over this? Is there any reason why
the working people, who are the policyholders,
should not be wondering why this fund is in
an almost bankrupt condition?
Hon. Mr. Holleti: Is not the Government a
policyholder?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): No, the
Government is not. The Government pays
for the administration of the fund, and they
do contribute a portion of it, but the major
portion is contributed by the worker and the
employer. Is there any reason why they should
not be asking the Government, which administers the fund, why it is in this bankrupt
condition?
Honourable senators, I notice that a commission has been appointed to go into this
whole question. I hope that its report will
come down soon, and that the next time

SENATE
we are considering appropriations the Unemployment Insurance Fund will be in a
much heaithier state than it is today.
Motion agreed to, and bill read second time.

CANADA GRAIN ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND

READING

Hon. Walter M. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I would like to have permission to
proceed first with Order No. 2, for the second
reading of a bill I am sponsoring, to amend
the Canada Grain Act. I am asking that this
bill be considered first for the reason that,
should it be referred to a committee, a representative of the Board of Grain Commissioners
will be coming here from Winnipeg to attend
the meeting.
Same Hon. Senaors: Agreed.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
with leave, I now move second reading of
Bill S-19, to amend the Canada Grain Act.
Honourable senators, this bill has to do
with mustard seed and rapeseed. The subject
may be more or less dry to senators who are
not actively engaged in farming, but I shall
do my best to make it as interesting as possible.
The bill has three purposes. The first is to
ratify the transfer of responsibility for the
Board of Grain Commissioners from the
Minister of Trade and Commerce to the Minister of Agriculture.
In November 1960 an Order in Council was
passed under the authority of section 2(a) of
the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, which is chapter 227 of the
Revised Statutes, 1952. For the information
of honourable senators I should like to read
that section. It is not very long.
2. The Governor in Council may (a)
transfer any powers, duties or functions
or the control or supervision of any part
of the public service from one Minister
of the Crown to any other Minister of
the Crown, or from one department or
portion of the public service to any
other department or portion of the public
service;
The purpose of the first section of this bill
then is to give statutory effect to this change
which, in my opinion, has worked out very
satisfactorily. The second purpose is to establish statutory grades of domestic mustard
seed. The third purpose is to redefine the
statutory grades of rapeseed, as presently set
out in the first and second schedules to the
act. I should like to give honourable senators
some general information before I proceed
to explain the second and third purposes of
the bill.
As honourable senators know, I am engaged
in farming operations in the province of Saskatchewan, but I do not grow mustard seed
or rapeseed. Of course, we farmers who grow
wheat, flax and other cereal grains grow a
lot of wild mustard, mostly tumbling mustard
and Ontario yellow mustard, but it is not
grown for seed. It comes up automatically,
and unfortunately we are put to great expense
every spring to kill it by spraying it with
2,4-D, which is quite effective.
The production of mustard seed, that is,
tame or domestic mustard, has increased significantly in recent years. I have a table
showing Canadian production for the past five
years. It shows the number of acres seeded
to mustard seed in the three Prairie provinces
where most of it is grown, the average yield

per acre and the production over the past five
years. I would ask permission of the house
to have this table taken into the record of
today's proceedings.
Some Hon. Senalors: Agreed.

Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask if the mustard

abroad?

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I have all those figures
for the honourable senator, and I shall give
them a little later.
Honourable senators, in the past five years
there has also been a tendency to expand
the acreage and production of rapeseed. I
have a table here showing the Canadian production for the past five years. It shows the
seeded acreage, the average yield per acre
and the production in the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta and for the
whole Dominion of Canada. I would ask permission to have this table placed in the
record also.

Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators, I
also have a table indicating the quantities of
mustard seed and rapeseed exported during
the past four crop years, and the thirteen
countries which have been importing these
items from Canada. Over this four-year period the big exports of mustard seed have
been to Italy, Germany, Japan and the United
States of America. The table relating to mustard seed is very interesting and I think honourable senators will find it also informative
and instructive. I would ask permission to
have it placed on the record.

Honourable senators, in my opinion this is
flot a complicated bill, but if it is your wish
after it has received second readîng to have
it referred to committee, I shall be glad to
do so. I arn informed that a representative
of the Board of Grain Commissioners will be
available to answer questions.
I hope that I have explained the bull fully,
but I shall be glad to try to answer any
questions honourable senators may have.
Hon. J. Wesley Siambaugh: Could the hionourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) inform the house as to the approximate percentage of mustard seed and rapeseed exported fromn Canada?
Hon. Mr. Aseijine: Mustard seed is flot
ground into oul in this coun'try, and except
for a small amount which is used for domestic purposes the seeds are exported.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: I was about to say
that practically ail of our mustard see and
rapeseed is exported.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I believe that is correct.
Hon. Mr. Stamnbaugh: Yes; that is a fact.
Like the honourable Leader of the Government, I do not grow any mustard or rapeseed, but I have planted rape at various tirnes
for hog pasture and it is very good. Both
rapeseed and mustard seed are important to
a considerable number of farmers in Alberta.
Up until recently there has been a surplus
of wheat and it has been wisdom on the part
of farmers to shift to the production of rapeseed or mustard seed because of ils export
value and the fact that it helps to keep
Canada's economy in good shape.
Until the present we have always sold
these commodities by sample, which is flot a
good way to sell grain. We found it was flot
a suitable way of dealing with wheat, oats
and barley. Ail these grains are graded very
closely, and it is certainly a good idea to
grade mustard seed in the samne way.
By the way, my deskmate has just asked
me how it could ever be possible to identify
ail the various grades of the different seeds.
Certainly, it is quite a proposition,' because
the seeds are small. However, we have the
benefit of the inspection department. The seed
will sirnply have to be weighed, probably by
the ounce in this case, and the various kinds
of seed counted; whereas, in the case of
wheat, oats and barley it is weighed by the
pound. I amn confident that it will be done
properly, for it will be passed by competent
inspectors, and if a buyer in Japan or some

other country wants to buy a certain grade
of rapeseed or mustard seed, hie will know
what hie is getting. 0f course, a sample could
be sent over, but that is flot as satisfactory
as having inspectors take their own samples
from a car for inspection, by which means
a representative sample of the whole carload
can be taken. This is much more satîsfactory
and dependable than obtaining a sample from
the exporter.
Honourable senators, I arn very much in
favour of the transfer of the Board of Grain
Commissioners from the Department of Trade
and Commerce to the Department of Agriculture. A number of years ago 1 suggested
this to the Honourable James MacKinnon, a
great personal friend of mine, when he was
Minister of Trade and Commerce. 1 was a
littie careful of what I said about it afterwards because he was a bit hurt over it,
but I stili think it is natural that the board
should, come under the Department of Agriculture.
I conunend the Government on bringing
in this proposed amendment to the Canada
Grain Act, and compliment the Leader of the
Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) for introducing it. I am sure the farmers
of western Canada, at least the vast majorîty
of them, will be in favour of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Could the honourable leader
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) give us some idea of the
price at which these seeds are sold? I do
not think hie mentioned in his explanation
this evening the total value of these seeds,
and I feel it would be most valuable to have
that.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: As I have already stated,
I have not grown any of the seed and I do
not know exactly what it selis for per pound.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien <Provencher): It varies
from year to year.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I believe it is somewhere
in the neighbourhood of four cents a pound.
Hon. Mr. S±ambaugh: That is for mustard
seed.
Hon. Mr. Leonard: May I ask the honourable leader whether these seeds are marketed
through the Grain Board?
Hon. Mr. Aselfine: No; the Board of Grain
Commissioners supervise only the grading.
Motion agreed to and bull read second Urne.

perbaps it would be appropriate to refer this
bill to the Banking and Commerce Comrnittee,
which is to meet tomorrow morning. As the
measure, to a great extent, has to do with

SENATE

commerce I think it would be in order to
ask that it be referred to that committee for
further consideration.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I was about to suggest that the bill be
referred to a committee because it is being
introduced into Parliament in this house and,
of course, has not yet been considered in the
other house.
I wish to take this opportunity of congratulating the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) on having a bill introduced in
the Senate. I feel that this house could be
of much greater service to Parliament and the
country if more bills were introduced in the
first instance in this chamber. Now that we
have started, I hope more will come along in
the same way.
When this bill goes to committee I hope
the proceedings will be recorded so that the
members of the other house will have the
full benefit of all that takes place at the
meeting.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That is agreeable.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Aseltine, bill referred to the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce.
FINANCE CHARGES (DISCLOSURE) BILL
SECOND READING-DEBATE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Friday, March
23, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Croll, for the second reading of
Bill S-2, to make provision for the disclosure
of information in respect of finance charges.
Hon. John G. Higgins: Honourable senators, my speech shall be short, and consequently I shall give no reason to be accused
of trying to hold up the bill.
The first bill dealing with the disclosure of
information in connection with loans did not
seem to be a fair one, for reasons which
seemed quite obvious to me. While the
proponents of that bill claimed it was meant
to strike at individuals, firms or companies
which lend money at exorbitant rates of interest, yet it took within its ambit institutions
like banks and trust companies, which have
been of great help to the public for generations and which never could be accused of
lending money at heavy interest. That bill,
if enacted, would have thrust on them an
oppressive and unnecessary burden.
If it was the intention of the sponsor of that
bill (Hon. Mr. Croll) that it should affect
only firms lending on the credit-consumer
plan, why did he bring in a bill which also
affected institutions that were of absolute
public benefit? Further, the act would have
brought them within the shadow of the

Criminal Code of Canada, had they made a
mistake. My conscience in voting against that
bill was as clear as the conscience of those
who supported it.
The bill before us is, in my opinion, of
quite a different kind. It certainly has merit
and I feel that it should go to the appropriate
committee for discussion. It should not be a
deterrent to its passing on second reading
just because the interest rate may be difficult
to calculate, as is claimed. Though interest
may be difficult to calculate, it is easy to
compute how much a borrower must pay for
a loan. If that cannot be computed, then the
whole institution of lending on a consumer
credit plan should be abolished for uncertainty. If such a position is adhered to, then
all I can say is that the people who make up
the contract do not know what they are
drafting. There are mathematical geniuses
who can solve any problem, and there must
be a large number of ordinary people who
can make two and two appear to be really
four.
When I say that in my opinion this bill
should go to the appropriate committee, I am
doing so without being influenced in the
slightest by lobbyists. The Senate is not to
be stampeded by lobbyists. We may listen to
them or we may read their briefs, but they
should not dictate. I hope we are all independent enough to follow our own thinking.
There is one doubt, however, in the matter
and that is whether the bill is constitutional.
That question cannot be passed over lightly.
Is this a matter for the federal Parliament or
for the provincial legislatures?
It is easy to give an opinion without setting
out adequate reasons. If it is not a matter for
the provincial legislatures, why did Ontario
pass such an act many years ago? And, if
such a proceeding was thought by some to
be unconstitutional, why was not the matter
tested in the Supreme Court of Canada? I
understand that Alberta passed a bill like the
bill before us. Has not each province passed
its own Conditional Sales Act and does it not
deal with interest?
In view of the varied opinions expressed
by many eminent lawyers, it may be thought
that the matter must eventually go to the
Supreme Court of Canada. I trust, however,
that if this bill is referred to committee, the
committee will be able to clear away and
settle our doubts.
I had no intention of speaking on this
bill, but certain remarks have been made in
this debate which in my estimation should
not go unchallenged.
One honourable senator said:
We should, indeed, demonstrate for all
to see that the Senate is not a temple of

MARCH 27, 1962

money-changers but a forum in which
the overriding good of the people is the
paramount concern.
What is meant by this? Is there a hint or
a blunt statement that anyone who votes
against this bill, no matter how honourable
his intentions, is a money-changer; or, if the
Senate does not pass the bill that the Senate
is composed of money-changers?
Another honourable senator said:
What is basically wrong with this
proposition, honourable senators? That
is something that has been perturbing
me and bothering me, and the more opposition I see to this kind of proposition
the more suspicious I become, because I
fail to see why doubts have been raised
concerning the true intent and purpose
of this piece of legislation.

a statement should be given publicity is
lamentable and should be the cause of indignation. After all, the integrity of the
Senate is paramount.
Although I feel that this bill has merit,
at the same time I feel justified in making
the statements which I have made.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Bouffard, debate
adjourned.

SENATE
(Hon. Mr. Brooks) with whom I sat a long
time ago on the civil service committee, and
where we managed very well. Although sometimes there was much discussion, we succeeded then, in 1938 and 1939, in having a
unanimous report. I wonder whose good influence it was in the civil service committee
meetings that brought about our unanimous
recommendations to the House of Commons.
The same thing occurred at the meetings of
the United Nations. The meetings started
at 9.30 in the morning, at the office of the
Canadian Permanent Mission on Third Avenue, and everybody had to be there. The
Secretary of State for External Affairs was
there and, his alter ego, my honourable friend
from Royal, as were the other persons that he
mentioned in his report. Then everybody was
given some work to do, some work of approach to the delegates of the other countries
and, in particular, the newer delegates who
came from the continent of Africa.
The President of the General Assembly was
Mr. Mongi Slim. He was the ambassador from
Tunisia, and was elected President of the
General Assembly. At that time the office of
Secretary-General became vacant because of
the death of Mr. Hammarskjold. We were at
a meeting at the offices of the Permanent
Mission when word was given to us of the
painful and tragic accident in which Mr.
Hammarskjold lost his life. It created an impression of general sorrow among all the
members. A ceremony was held which was
most impressive. It took place in the hall of
the General Assembly and was one of the
most beautiful concerts I have ever attended.
There we heard the great Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony and artists from the Metropolitan
performed. Also we heard the recorded speech
that Mr. Hammarskjold had delivered the
year before, on the anniversary of the United
Nations. It was an occasion to remember; it
was really beautiful.
I noticed something else that struck me
very much. I had been under the impression
that the Americans and the Russians were at
odds. Naturally, if we judge by the press
this is the conclusion we come to, but to my
great surprise I read in the New York papers
that Mr. Gromyko had received Mr. Rusk
and that Mr. Rusk had received Mr. Gromyko,
and that Mr. Stevenson, the ambassador of
the United States to the United Nations, had
also received some Russian representatives.
There is nothing like personal contact. Even
if the press reports that there is no agreement, the mere fact that the representatives
of the east and west meet together is a good
sign; it gives hope for the future. That
created a very good impression, and the time
for insults towards each other seemed to have
passed. I remember there was a time when

anybody who said unpleasant things to the
other side had great success of oratory; but
at the United Nations it was very different
and everybody seemed to fraternize to a
certain extent, although agreement had to
be waited for, and was not always perfect.
I have said a word about the time of the
meetings. The meeting at the Canadian Permanent Mission lasted approximately one and
one-half hours, from 9.30 to 11 o'clock in the
morning, and then the members of the delegation and some of the staff took the 10minute walk to the United Nations building,
to attend first the meetings of the General
Assembly and, afterwards, the meetings of
the various committees. Those who have
not attended those meetings would be surprised at the seriousness of the discussions
and the solemnity of certain occasions when
new states were admitted to the United Nations, which now number 104. There everybody explained his problems. In the first
place, at the meetings of the General Assembly we had something like a general
outline of the feelings and the needs of each
country by its representative.
What impressed me was that not only did
Mr. Mongi Slim, the President of the General
Assembly, speak perfect French but he was
a very well educated man who had studied
in French universities. He also had the distinction of having been imprisoned for his
political convictions. Most of the representatives of Africa spoke beautiful French. We
French-speaking representatives found that
we were very much at home in New York
when we heard these speeches. They were
well thought out, well reasoned, and well
delivered by the representatives of the various countries. We had visits from the President of the Argentine, from the President of
Chile and other dignitaries, accompanied by
their staffs. For all of these the red carpet
was laid.
Honourable senators, what struck me very
forcibly was the consideration which the
representatives of all nations had for Canada.
This is not new. It dates back to the time of
Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Borden and Mackenzie
King. Now Canadians are respected as Canadians in New York, as they are anywhere
else-but mostly in New York, as there is a
world in miniature at the United Nations,
where 104 countries are represented by outstanding men and women.
We were given various tasks to perform
while we were there. These were given to us
by the Secretary of State for External Aff airs,
and by our colleague, the honourable senator
from Royal (Hon. Mr. Brooks) when the minister was not there. We divided the work
among ourselves. Each one had his task. I
was assigned to meet the representatives of

MARCH 27, 1962
the African countries and I made good friendships with them. I found that they were
patriots, men of culture who could speak
very well and who represented their countries with honour at the United Nations. I
cherish a very good recollection of them.
I asked the Secretary of State for External
Affairs to give us some literature about
Canada. He did this willingly and with
pleasure. We had some beautifully illustrated
books about Canada, and I had some books
from the province of Quebec. We gave these
to the ladies and gentlemen who came from
various countries, so that they were able to
have an illustrated view of our country. I
soon realized that they had a very good
opinion of our country. We invited them to
come to visit us. Some of them came to Montreal and to Quebec City, where they were
very well received.
I do not know what was done after I left.
I was invited by my leader to attend the
conference for a month and a half, but I
could stay only three weeks and I was replaced by my good friend from Northumberland-Miramichi (Hon. Mr. BurchilD.
Honourable senators, I realized that it was
very important to make friends with those
people from various countries who look to
Canada for inspiration and guidance. The
literature which was given to them was nonpolitical, naturally; it informed them about
the grandeur and the possibilities of Canada
and how important it is for them to rely
on us. That explains why the representative
of Canada had the support of many countries
in his endeavour to ban nuclear weapons.
I will not start to mention names, as I may
forget some which should be mentioned. My
experience was satisfactory. The only regret

I had was in regard to some newspaper reports. Generally the reports from press agencies were very good but at times some
journalists created a false impression by
writing false reports for the press. For instance, I read in one of the yellow papers
of New York city, an important daily paper,
a letter supposedly from someone in the
Vatican City-there was no name-saying
that Mr. Khrushchev was just a hypocrite.
This is not at all the language of Vatican
City. I reported it to the religious authorities
who said it was far from the language used
in the vicinity of the Holy Father. That
shows the kind of man who exists to create
animosity, and who was giving the people
of New York and the whole world a false
impression.
To conclude, honourable senators, I remember what I said when I was a member
of Parliament to the effect that for me
Canada, although not the most populous
country in the world, is the most beautiful
and the greatest country in the world. Therefore, the interest of Canada should be the
main inspiration of our undertakings at the
United Nations and at all international conferences. I have returned with a good impression of the United Nations. Everything there
is not perfect, but all the delegates, whetler
from the east or from the west, are on speaking terms. We hope there will be no third
world war, and that by continuing to talk
with each other the representatives of Canada
and of all the other countries of the world
will succeed at last in promoting world
peace.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Burchill, debate

4. If so, frorn whom and when?
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, my inquiry on the Order Paper is
very clear, and the answer will be very short

and I am anxious to receive it. For those
who are not familiar with the law, the question has reference to the relation which exists
between constitutional and civil law. To my
profound amazement I have come to the conclusion that all the amendments passed by
all the provincial Legislatures of Canada since
Confederation about marriage, except for its
solemnization, are ultra vires and void.
You may realize, honourable senators, what
implications could come from it. I want to
know if any representations have been made

to the Government about it. I am anxious
to be informed whether or not representations
have been made and, if so, by whom, and
when. That is one question.

There are other implications that I will
not mention now because it would take too
much time, but I will tell you in due course
why I ask these questions and why I am
so much interested in having an answer as
soon as possible from the Government.

MARCH 28, 1962
Hon. Walter M. Aseltine: The day following the notice of inquiry by the honourable
senator who has just spoken (Hon. Mr.
Pouliot) I saw to it that a copy of the
inquiry was sent to the proper authority,
and I have no doubt that I will receive
an answer in due course. Up to the present
moment I have not received an answer,
but the matter will be followed up from
day to day until the answer is obtained.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I thank the honourable
gentleman very much, and I appreciate the
good care that he takes of every matter
that is submitted to him by his colleagues
in this house.

SALE OF WHEAT TO CHINA

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called
I have a brief announcement to make, namely,
that an additional sale of slightly more than
39 million bushels of wheat has been made
to China. The estimated value of this contract, which is the sixth to be completed
under the long-term agreement of last spring,
is $75 million. It is the largest single sale
of wheat to China thus far.
FINANCE CHARGES (DISCLOSURE) BILL
SECOND READING-DEBATE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday, the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Croll, for the second reading of Bill
S-2, to make provision for the disclosure
of information in respect of finance charges.
(Translation):
Hon. Paul H. Bouffard: Honourable senators, this bill has been introduced and discussed many times from ail angles. Therefore,
it seems to me that a very long discussion is
not called for.
When this bill was considered, we discussed just about ail the questions and the
doubtful issues which were expressed, and
I would not want to repeat what was said
then.
I wish to congratulate the honourable senator for Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croîl) for
his efforts to improve the bill and to restrict its
application to certain persons, instead of
applying it in a general way to people who
give credit under conditions which are perfectly sound and above board. Nevertheless,
I came to the conclusion that the present bill
has not been improved in any way. I suggest
that more than ever it remains unconstitutional and that the comparisons, if any, which
the borrowers may make, are not as easy to

draw as was asserted in the previous bill, for
in my opinion at least, a great number of
people are not compelled to give out the information which would be required for these
comparisons of the costs of credit.
There is no doubt that the constitutionality
of the bill, under our general system, depends
upon two things in the bill. In the first place,
does the bill bear on a criminal matter?
In the past, those who infringed upon the
clauses of the bill had to face a penalty which
was called criminal. In my opinion, it was
not so because the distinction between a
criminal offence and a penal offence was not
clearly drawn. It goes without saying that the
provinces can impose penalties for breaches
of provincial legislation. Those are not criminal but penal offences.
An offence committed by a vendor who was
penalized for not respecting the terms of the
honourable senator's bill of previous years was
a penal offence. Had it been a criminal offence,
the buyer, as well as the signer of the contract, would have been guilty, for anyone
who is a party to a criminal offence is
guilty either directly or as an accomplice.
And, since that did not exist, I can only
conclude that, last year, that criminal action
essential to ensure the constitutionality of the
act did not exist. And besides, it is not necessary to discuss it since the infringement of
the provisions of the bill is not considered of
a criminal nature.
The Hon. the Speaker: If the honourable
senator will allow me, I would point out that
some senators, listening with their earphones,
are turning them too loud in order to listen
to the interpretation, thus making it difficult
for those who understand the language to
follow the speech properly.
(Text):
I would ask the honourable senators to
be more careful in listening to their earphones, so as not to disturb those who understand the language that is being spoken.
Senator Bouffard, you may proceed.
(Translation):
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: The second point about
which this bill cannot give any jurisdiction
to the federal Government is the question
of interest. Under section 91 of the British
North America Act, the federal Government
has jurisdiction over interest. Well, you may
look wherever you wish to find a definition
of interest in the act. There is none. In
the civil code of the province of Quebec,
there is some provision dealing with interest.

SENATE
then there is no civil law contract under
provincial jurisdiction. All contracts are subject to terms of financing where the parties
so agree. If this is called interest, no contract is then subject to provincial jurisdiction
and all contracts come under federal jurisdiction. I therefore claim that the deferred payment contract remains a sales contract and
that the federal Government has no power to
legislate on it. This is why all provinces have
enacted conditional sales acts and regulated
such sales. Similar acts have been passed in
the western provinces, in the province of
Ontario, in the province of Quebec, following

In the federal statutes, interest is dealt with
but nowhere can you find a definition of it
except in works by various writers. And
what do they say about interest? What is
interest? Well, it is the compensation that
a person may give to another for the use
of money which the lender can do without
and which the borrower can enjoy for a
given time. Therefore, there is no doubt
whatever that it is a reward to the one
who lends his money in order to invest his
capital; it cannot be anything else, otherwise
it is not interest.

If, on the other hand, that contract is
treated as a loan contract, and the interest
is the amount charged in order to allow an
individual to enjoy the possession of goods
for a period of time without paying for them,

Therefore, I say that according to the bill
now before us, if such interest is deemed to
come under federal jurisdiction, it is far from
being a charge contract. Insurance or service
charges are not part of the interest charges

when it will be payable nor what the monthly

going to calculate simple interest? I am asking honourable senators the question. Think
of the situation you will create with respect
to countless transactions-it would be impossible to calculate. We must not ask our
vendors to do something which is just impossible. All honourable senators wish to protect the consumer against high interest rates;
no one is against that. However, we must find
a solution which is reasonable, constitutional
and practical. If such a formula is brought
forward, I will be the first one to vote in
favour of such a bill. I should not want any
Canadian to be charged excessive interest

the rates charged elsewhere. However, I would

been successful in business, but who are not
in a position, because of the various transactions that come up daily, to make such calculations. Therefore, I say you are going
to impose that bill on people who are unaware of its implications but who think that
the bill is just an ordinary measure to give
out information. Most of our people will be
unable to give the information and will be
compelled to hire actuaries or accountants
to make out the calculations and will therefore be forced out of business. There are
some difficult cases and some impossible ones.
In mathematics, it is the same as in other
fields; through effort, you can always work
out a solution to a problem, providing you
have the necessary data to figure it out.

May I give a few examples. Take all the
amounts payable on demand, under a credit
sale transaction. As the time within which
the amount must be paid is unknown, it is
absolutely impossible to arrive at exact figures.
It is more than the simple annual interest
at the moment the transaction was made,
since the time during which to pay is not
known. I have never been in the automobile
business, but I am told that automobile dealers
get automobiles from the plant by the
"carload". These they store on their premises.
They are called upon to pay the manufacturer
on demand, but a tradition exists between
manufacturers and dealers to the effect that
no car has to be paid for until it has been sold.
How can you calculate simple interest then?
You do not know when the interest is due
and it is absolutely impossible to calculate
how much it will amount to. Those are frequent transactions. As the senator for
Winnipeg North (Hon. Mr. Wall) stated in his
speech, there is what is known as store credit
under which a store extends to a customer
from $500 to $1,000 worth of credit at any one
time in the year. Yet, the store does not know
when the merchandise will be purchased,

Yet, back home we make loans for a period
of ten, fifteen or twenty years, which are
repaid monthly, and sometimes weekly, with
all interest computed in advance. All the
tables are prepared in anticipation. I wonder
why we could not do the sarne thing. Could
you explain it to me?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It is easy to explain. The computing of simple interest in
such a case is approximate and, as the legislation asks for accurate figures, and you are
unable to give such accurate figures, even
with all your logarithmic tables, you get,
under the circumstances only a tentative
amount, and we should not demand of our
businessmen that they give approximate
figures, only to be told afterwards that they
were only approximate.
But I shall give you another example.
Let us take the case of a vendor or a
manufacturer if you wish, who sells goods
to a wholesaler or to a retailer. Take for
instance a product of the textile industry
which is sold to a wholesaler or a retailer
in textiles, the amount being payable within
ten days at a 2 per cent discount, within

MARCH 28, 1962
30 days at a 5 per cent discount or within
40 days with 10 per cent-that is the opposite-this businessman will sell his merchandise at 10 days with a 10 per cent
discount, at 20 days for instance at 5 per
cent, or 30 days at 2 per cent. Well, is that
not a discount; but what are you doing?
You enable retailers and wholesalers to buy
goods and pay within 10, 20 or 30 days,
but depending upon the scheme chosen by
the purchaser the discount varies and consequently the interest paid will be different.
What will it be? Try to figure it out. Nobody
can figure out such an interest. Why? Because we lack one essential factor. First of
all, no one knows what will then be the
choice of the interested party at the time of
passing the contract. Secondly, if the time
limit is 10 days, and if he does not pay within
10 days, what will happen? Then, the amount
is payable by instalments. When will that
person pay? In a day, in two or three days?
Will the interest be the same after three
months or six months? It is impossible to
figure out. However, for centuries there have
been people of good faith who have been
buying that way. But such trading practices
would have to be abandoned should this bill
be enacted.
Let me give another example. Public utilities-I believe the honourable senator for
Winnipeg North (Hon. Mr. Wall) brought up
the question-almost all public utilities grant
a discount for electricity, gas and so on, and
the bill is payable within one, two, or
three months. When the man comes to read
the meter at a given period he determines the
amount due and the bill is sent to the user.
The user will receive a bill on which it is
written that the amount is payable on a
certain date less 10 per cent discount. After
that day he has to pay 10 per cent more.
But who is going to figure out the amounit
of interest? Everybody knows what the
figure on the bill is, but who is going to
figure out the simple interest rate? If the
bill is paid within the next five days, then
the interest will be much higher than if
the payment had been made one, two,
three or four months later. This means that
nobody is able to make this calculation for
the simple reason that essential data is missing. That calculation can absolutely not be
made by anyone, even by the best mathematician in the world.
I do not intend to draw out the discussion
any longer. I simply wanted to express my
views. I wanted to let this house know that
I would wholeheartedly support a bill which

would bring a practical solution to this problem. Let us not put forward a solution which
will annoy all merchants, which will put part
of the people in the impossibility of implementing it. So, next year, all kinds of representations will be made to us, so that we will
be forced to amend this bill once again or
else shelve it for good.
If you will allow me, I would suggest a
formula which would solve the problem. First,
there is now a royal commission on banking,
commerce, industry, finance etc. Why not
submit the matter to that commission? Perhaps it could find means of solving the
problem to the benefit of everyone, and thus
give everyone some practical solution. I suggest, therefore, that the matter be submitted
to the royal commission on banking, commerce, industry, etc.
The second suggestion I would hazard,
would be that in Europe, in most countries
in Europe that is, the calculation of the
simple interest rate is not mandatory, but
the buyer must be asked what the cost would
be to him in terms of cash or credit, including insurance and service charges. This
is a must in all European contracts. Why
should we try to go further in placing on our
merchants' shoulders a burden which they
will find impossible to bear? Therefore, why
do we not adopt the plan followed by those
countries which are ahead of us commercially?
In the United States where there is a considerable amount of sales, they have not
found as yet the solution to this problem and
a bill introduced by Senator Douglas has been
the subject of discussion for the last two
years without a solution being reached as yet.
Hon. Mr. Méthot: May I ask you a question?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Méthot: Do you suggest that this
bill covers the discounts allowed on purchases
made on credit?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: In my opinion, it covers
everything. This becomes a matter of interpretation. However, I do not have this bill
with me but it seems to me that this becomes
a matter of interpretation. My friend bas just
handed me a copy and I quote:
(Text):

"finance charges" means the total cost
of the credit to the consumer thereof, and
includes interest, fees, bonuses, service
charges, discounts and any other type of
charge;
(Translation):

I think that there is no doubt about that.
It is not interest.

UNITED NATIONS
SIXTEENTH SESSION OF GENERAL ASSEMBLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the inquiry of the Honourable Senator Brooks, P.C., calling the attention of the Senate to the Sixteenth Session
of the General Assembly of the United Nations, held in New York City, and in particular to the discussions and proceedings of
the Assembly and the participation therein of
the delegation of Canada.
Hon.

G.

Percival

Burchill:

Honourable

senators, after listening to the excellent address delivered by my honourable friend from
Royal (Hon. Mr. Brooks) last Thursday, and
that by my honourable friend from De la
Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) last night, I
feel there is little I can add for the information of the chamber on the subject before us.
However, I cannot let this occasion pass
without expressing my warmest thanks to my
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald,
Brantford) for making it possible for me to
attend the session of the United Nations, and
I would like to join with the two previous
speakers in expressing admiration of the
United Nations and to say I am a warm supporter of the people who are working tirelessly in that vast organization.
We have all read and heard much about the
institution of the United Nations, but one
has to go there in person, attend the session
and follow the proceedings, in order to capture its atmosphere. Then you realize that
you are attending a forum of free discussion
where representatives of practically every nation in the world can express their opinions
on problems which are of concern to all
countries.
I found it an exhilarating and informative
experience and, notwithstanding the shortcomings and frustrations encountered at the
United Nations, I came away with the feeling that it has a stabilizing influence on
world peace and deserves the support of free
men everywhere.
I think I can best portray the proceedings
at the United Nations by giving some impressions that I gained while I was there. First
impressions are lasting ones with me; at least,
that was my experience in New York.

I was favourably impressed on my arrival
at the Pennsylvania station in New York
when I was met by a member of the Canadian
delegation, an honourable gentleman from the
other house who is not a political but is a
personal friend of mine, Mr. Gage Montgomery. He was good enough to rise at an
early hour in the morning to meet us at the
station with a mission car and conduct us to
our hotel. That act of kindness set the tone
for my whole experience at the United Nations, for all the time I was there I received
assistance from every member of our delegation.
In this connection I should like to pay
tribute to my old friend, the honourable senator from Royal (Hon. Mr. Brooks), who distinguished himself as vice-chairman of our
delegation. He did honour to the Senate and
to his native province of New Brunswick. He
worked assiduously and indefatigably at all
times in his conscientious way. The only
criticism I had to make was that he worked
so hard I was deprived of his company much
of the time.
People generally do not realize the tremendous amount of work done by the principal delegates, and especially the vice-chairman
of the Canadian delegation. I can testify that
Senator Brooks, our vice-chairman, was on
the job continuously. In fact, the entire Canadian group was energetically and conscientiously on the job all the time. I liked to
watch Ambassador Ritchie as he moved
through the various delegations, and it was
easy to see how highly regarded he was by
observing his association with the various
delegation leaders. His sound judgment and
practical approach made him welcome
wherever he went, and one could not but
feel that Canada's interests were safe in his
hands.
The other Canadian delegates made a grand
contribution, and Canada's voice was listened
to with respect in the various committees.
General Burns on disarmament, Brigadier
Price on finance, and Ambassador Tremblay,
who represented Canada on the Special
Political Committee, all were prominent in
their contributions to the work of the UN.
I was very much impressed with the whole
staff of the Canadian Permanent Mission, and
I wish also to make special mention of the
staff of the Department of External Affairs.
I understand there are about thirty-five persons in the permanent establishment at New
York, and that during the sessions of the
Assembly this staff is increased to eighty or
more. These men and women are of a splendid,
high-calibre type of which this country might
well be proud.
I was impressed by the speeches of the representatives of the new African nations. The

MARCH 28, 1962
honourable senator from De la Durantaye
(Hon. Mr. Pouliot) described their use of
perfect French, and I want to say that the
clarity of expression and the splendid delivery
of their English truly amazed me. In fact, the
speeches reminded me of the debate in Parliament on the address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne, where considerable latitude
is allowed and one may discuss any subject
be likes. There was no restriction at all. The
speakers followed for the most part the same
pattern. They would commence with a note
of congratulation to the newly-elected President and include a moving and eloquent
tribute to that wonderful man, the late Dag
Hammarskjold, who had just passed away.
They would go on to a denunciation of
colonialism and how in all its phases it had
affected their state and the neighbouring
states. The speakers would then conclude with
a great burst of optimism as to the glowing
prospect ahead since they had become free
and independent. That was the general pattern
of the speeches.
Perhaps honourable senators might be
interested in hearing of an incident which
occurred on the occasion of the speech of the
representative from South Africa, who devoted a major part of his speech to a defence
of the apartheid policy in his country.
Whether one agrees with his philosophy or
not, his speech struck me as being a partieularly able one. He cited figures as to the
number of schools, universities, hospitals, and
trained personnel in his country, to support
his statement that the well-being of the
people living in his country was high compared with neighbouring states, and that the
percentage of illiteracy among the natives in
South Africa was much lower than that of
other African countries.
At the conclusion of that address, the representative from Liberia mounted the rostrum, and in a very bitter speech stated that
the South African delegate had insulted the
African races and had made statements that
were untrue. He then moved that the South
African speech be expunged from the records.
The Assembly was tense when he finished
his remarks. I happened to be alone with one
of the junior members of the staff of the
department at the time, the others all being
occupied in committee proceedings. In my
ignorance I feared that a snap vote might be
taken on the motion, so I dispatched my
young friend to find the vice-chairman or the
ambassador, and they arrived forthwith.
However, there was no occasion for haste
and my fears were groundless, because the
motion set off a round of speeches which
went on for two or three days, and several

days passed before the Liberian representative could be persuaded to water down his
resolution to a motion of censure, which was
finally voted on.
When that vote was taken and Canada was
called, my honourable friend opposite responded, wisely, I thought, with "Abstain". A
minute or two later, when the name of the
United Kingdom was called, the response was
"Not participating". I was curious to learn
the difference between "Abstain" and "Not
participating". However, my honourable
friend opposite could not enlighten me very
much, so I decided to be content to regard
it as a distinction without a difference.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: There was not much
difference.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: As I listened to the
abstentions that day, it occurred to me that
whether one agreed with them or not, each
had the right to express his own opinion in
a free assembly. It was pointed out that some
of our Russian friends had expressed sentiments on a number of matters that many did
not agree with at all, and they had not been
asked to expunge their remarks. I felt that
this practice of abstaining might be quite useful, honourable senators, if we adopted it
sometimes in our discussions in the Parliament of Canada.
Ambassador Ritchie and Senator Brooks
very generously made it possible for us to
attend many functions, both social and otherwise. We were guests at a reception and
luncheon given under the auspices of the
Women's Division Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, at the Hotel Pierre.
It was a most delightful affair. On United
Nations Day we attended an interesting ceremony in City Hall, on the invitation of
Mayor Robert F. Wagner. In the evening we
were entertained at a Salute to the United
Nations Ball given by the United States Committee for the United Nations at the WaldorfAstoria. It was a spectacular event, at which
thousands of persons were present. I was
sorry my friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Brooks)
could not be present. These events afforded
us the opportunity to meet many distinguished
persons.
We also attended an interesting function
arranged by the Secretariat of the United
Nations and the National Council for United
States Art. It was the presentation to the
United Nations of a piece of sculpture placed
on the east side of the exterior wall of the
General Assembly building. It had been designed, after consultation with the former
Secretary-General, the late Dag Hammarskjold. While listening to the many interesting
speeches delivered by distinguished people
that day, I was particularly struck by the
remarks of the United States Ambassador,

SENATE
Adlai Stevenson, who informed us that the
sculpture facing the east was intended to
convey in the language of art the word "Inspiration". Mr. Stevenson said that it was
much more fitting to use that word on the
outside of the building, as those who were
labouring on the inside in their effort to make
progress in negotiations for disarmament and
for an easing of world tension would be more
in the habit of using the word "frustration"
or even "desperation". I could appreciate
what he meant by that, because often after
days and weeks of planning and trying to
establish some basis for negotiation, the plans
would fall to the ground and we would
sense a feeling of absolute frustration and
desperation.
My only regret, as I think back over my
experience, is that I did not get the opportunity of meeting more of the delegates from
the various countries. In that respect I was
not as fortunate as my honourable friend
from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot). I
agree with him that one of the great advantages of attending the United Nations
Assembly is the opportunity it gives for
personal contact. I want to suggest for the
future that perhaps some way could be
worked out whereby the observers-and we
were there as observers-might get to know
and talk with more of the delegates from
other countries.
The honourable senator from Royal (Hon.
Mr. Brooks) referred to the long and difficult negotiations which took place following
the death of Dag Hammarskjold to persuade
the Soviet Union to agree to the selection
of U Thant as his successor. As you know,
the Soviet Union wanted to substitute the
troika principle. His selection was only accomplished after six or seven weeks of skilful
diplomacy. A great measure of the success
of the United Nations depends upon the
Secretary-General for, apart from being the
chief administrative officer, he is the father
confessor, as Walter Lippmann so well describes him, to the member government;
he is the man in whom they confide and
who plays a very important-though perhaps
hidden at times-role :as mediator in international controversy. Thus, it will be seen
how important it was for the future of the
United Nations to find a successor to Dag
Hammarskjold. The point I wish to emphasize is that U Thant's selection was finally
brought about by influence exerted by the
small, weak and unaligned countries who
rallied to the cause of the United Nations.
In this connection, I would like to quote
the words of Mr. Walter Lippmann:
Mr. Adlai Stevenson would be the last,
I imagine, to call the result of the
part he played a victory over the Soviet
Union. A really good diplomat does not

go in for victories even when he wins
them. For the essence of a diplomatic
success is that the contenders can accept
the result without loss of face. A good
diplomat, like the old Chinese warlords,
never destroys the last bridge over which
the enemy could retreat. What Mr.
Stevenson has doneAnd this is the point.
-these past six weeks is to use the
influence of the United States to help
the weaker nations save the UN. Only
a wise, experienced, patient and selfeffacing man could have done it.
With that in mind, and after listening to the
discussions and speeches which I heard, I
think one might be justified in making the
prediction that these small, weak and unaligned countries will play an even greater
role in the United Nations of the future. Who
knows but that the dreams of mankind for
world peace and security may eventually be
realized, not through armaments and the possession of nuclear bombs, but from the
deliberations of the United Nations. Perhaps
this is what Tennyson had in mind when he
wrote in Locksley Hall over a century ago:
Till the war-drum throbb'd no longer,
and the battle-flags were furl'd
In the Parliament of man, the Federation
of the world.
On returning to my province, I was amazed
to find the number of people who were interested in the United Nations. I was invited
to address several groups in my community
and throughout the province on the subject,
and I found them keenly interested in what
I had to say.
I came back a warm supporter of the United
Nations. I recognize its difficulties, its problems and its shortcomings, and I sympathize
very much with the people who amid disappointments and frustrations day after day,
tirelessly continue working for the cause of
peace. I recall the words of one of the
speakers who, with strong feeling, described
the United Nations as "the conscience of the
world". As such, I feel it warrants the support of the Canadian people.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, would
the honourable senator who has just spoken
(Hon. Mr. Burchill) care to answer a question
I have in mind? It is this: In your meetings
and discussions off the record, in a casual
way, with the varlous delegates, did you hear
anyone mention China? I raise the question
because I am one who has read-and I advise
other members to read-the history of China
up to the present day. If you do so, you cannot help but come to the opinion that that
country is going to be the greatest menace to.

MARCH 28, 1962
peace, far greater than the Soviet is, in days
to come. As a matter of fact, Khrushchev
backed off from China, and the division is
growing. China has 650 million people. The
hatred they have for the United States and
Britain, and people generally who are not
Chinese, augurs very serious ill for the future.
Therefore I was wondering if there was any
discussion about allowing China to join the
United Nations. I think it is a great mistake
to keep her out.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I agree with my honourable friend from New Westminster. China was
not openly mentioned, although I think that
back of the scenes, in the various rooms and
in committees, there was a lot of discussion.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: I would ie
to say a
word on that later.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I agree with what my
honourable friend from New Westminster
says, and I felt all the time that there was
a sort of shadow hanging over the place in
so far as China was concerned.
Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators, in
this connection may I say a few words? After
the honourable senator from NorthumberlandMiramichi (Hon. Mr. Burchil) left New York
a resolution was brought before the United
Nations with reference to the admission of
China to membership in the UN.
As you know, Formosa now represents
China and there is a growing sentiment, not
only at the United Nations but in different
parts of the world, that these 650 million
Chinese that the honourable senator from New
Westminster speaks of should at some time
have representation in the United Nations.
It is not a practical idea that they should
remain out for all time.
One argument used against communist
China being admitted to the United Nations
was that, to start with, she did not conform

to the principles and regulations laid down
in the United Nations charter. The strongest
argument was that China will not recognize
Formosa as a separate nation. She says that
Formosa is a part of China and that, if recognition is given to communist China herself
as a member of the United Nations, representation must be taken away from Formosa.
The western nations and other fair-minded
nations of the world said no, that Formosa
should have a chance to seek self-determination.
I believe the feeling at the United Nations
is that some day, if communist China changes
her views internationally, Formosa and communist China could be represented at the
UN as separate countries. Formosa has a
population, as honourable senators know, of
about 15 million, and there are nations in the
United Nations that have less than 500,000
inhabitants; so it would not be an anomalous
situation for Formosa, if she voted for selfdetermination and acquired definite independence, to be represented there. I believe
there is the feeling that if communist China
changes her opinions and principles, some day
she may very well be represented. There was
quite a long debate on this subject at the
United Nations.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators it had been my intention to abstain from
taking part in this debate, and even now I am
not quite sure whether I will participate.
However, I understand there are several other
honourable senators not present today who
may wish to take part in the debate. If it
meets with the approval of honourable senators, I would adjourn the debate for, say, one
week?
On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford), debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND

READING

Hon. John Hnatyshyn moved the second
reading of Bill C-75, to amnend the Canýadian
Wheat Board Act.
He said: Honourable senators, it is a privilege for me to be given the opportunity of
moving the second reading of Bill C-75, to
amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act, and
to say a f ew words in connection with it. It
is a privilege for me because for many years
I have been associated with farming and,
though I have not been actively engaged in
it for a number of years, I still manage some
8,000 acres of land for non-residents of my
province.
Wheat and its effect on the economy of
our country has been of the greatest importance because it concerns flot only the welfare of some 230,000 farmers but also that of
every individual in Canada. I should have
lîked to review the history of the Canadian
Wheat Board and the formi of marketing that
the producers have established for their
grain. However, 1 am not going to do that
now, fascinating as that story may be, because it would take too long, and the fact is
tha-t the Canadian Whea't Board Act has been
reviewed by Parliament every five years.
Although the Canadian Wheat Board is
an independent body carrying on its own
business for producers, in accordance with
the statutes it has held certain powers for
only five-year periods and unless the act is
amended to extend these powers they wil
expire on July 31 of this year.
It has been considered practical and desirable for Parliament ta review the actîvities
of the wheat board every five years. In 1957
the Senate made an extensive study of the
functions of the board, and should this bull
receive second reading I hope that it will
be referred to a committee where we wil
have an opportunity to look into the many
phases of the work of the wheat board.
There is one item I should like ta refer
to specifically before I proceed with my explanation of the variaus sections of the bill.
Whenever a payment is made for wheat,
whether it is an interim payment of 15 cents
a bushel or a final payment of a larger
amount, some people in eastern Canada and
26211-3-27

the Maritimes-not honourable senatrsseem to think the money is coming out of the
treasury of this country.
Hon. Mr. Smith <Queens-Shelburne): Surely
my honourable friend is not referring to
members of the Senate.
Han. Mr. Hnalyshyn: I certainly am not,
and I think I made that very plain. I just
want ta make it clear as a matter of record
that the Canadian Wheat Board is a marketing
agency of the praducers of this country. AUl
the money that the farmers receive from it
cames from the sale of grain negotiated by
the wheat board, and the salaries of al
the officiais of the board are paid by the
producers.
Han. Mr. Lambert: The honourable senatar
has referred ta the wheat board as a producers' board. It was that in the beginning,
if I ar n ot mistaken, but it has long since
been established by legislation of this Parliament as a crown corporation, and it is
today the property of the Government and the
people of Canada. It is flot a producers'
board exclusively. I stand ta be corrected.
Hon. Mr. HnIratyshyn: With ail due respect,
I differ with my honourable friend. I maintain
that for ail intents and purposes it is a
producers' board. No Government has dared
interfere with the functions of the Canadian
Wheat Board. The board has almost 100 per
cent support from the 230,000 producers I
have mentioned. Hawever, I will not start a
debate on that point at this stage.
Honourable senatars, the main purpose or
principle of this bull is ta extend for another
five years the provisions of the Canadian Wheat
Board Act, which expires at the end of this
crop year, namely, July 31 next. The board
is the sole marketing agency for western
wheat, oats and barley in ail interprovincial,
and expart trade, the exception being that
farmers cau buy grain from other farmers in
a province without marketing it through this
agency.
ýFrom what I have read in the proceedings
of this house, a very extensive study was
made of the history of the wheat board, and
for that reason I amrnfot going to deal with
that aspect. However, there are certain
activities of the wheat board that to a large
degree are dependent on supply and demand,
and I think this would be of interest ta the
house.
The ail-time peak carryover occurred in
the 1956-57 crop year, when there were some
733 million bushels of wheat on hand in Caniada. That was one of the big difficulties as far
as the economny of western Canada was concerned, for the farmers hadl the wheat on
hand and were nat able ta seil it. I am happy

SENATE
to state that the carryover as estimated at
July 31, 1962 will be less than 300 million
bushels. In fact, it is now so low that many
are concerned as to whether it should go
much below what it is today, in the event
of another crop failure.
This has been the first occasion in nine
years that the carryover into the new crop
year bas been less than 500 million bushels.
There are two important factors for the
drastic reduction in the carryover: first,
we have had well above average exports and,
secondly, we have had below average production. These two factors combined have disposed of one of the serious problems that
existed as far as the western farmer was
concerned.
Wheat is a very important factor in the
economy of our country, not only to the
producer but to all citizens. The domestic
usage of wheat has remained fairly well
constant over a number of years, averaging
between 148 million bushels and 166 million
bushels per year, whereas exports over the
last five-year period have averaged around
320 million bushels compared to 295 million
bushels per year for the preceding five-year
period. Exports during the crop year 1960-61
and the combined exports of wheat and
flour in that one crop year amounted to 353.3
million bushels.
Last year there was a strong demand for
Canadian wheat in Europe and other traditional markets of Canada. In that crop year
sales of wheat to Japan reached a new record
of 56.6 million bushels. A heavy demand
came from Europe for durum wheat, with
the result that stocks of that grain in Canada
are almost exhausted.
While on a visit home ten days ago I
heard a persistent rumour-I do not suggest
that any member of the Senate started itthat there is something wrong with the wheat
payments as far as the Peoples Republic of
China is concerned, implying that that
customer has defaulted in its payments.
Honourable senators, I only wish to point
out to you, and also to put on the record the
fact that sales of wheat and barley to China
to date have accounted for $190 million, of
which amount $108 million has already been
paid. Payments are up to date. The latest
payment, that of $11 million for February
and March, has been made. From January 3,
1961 to March 12, 1962 the price of No. 1
Northern wheat, basis in store Lakehead, increased by 22j cents a bushel. Durum wheat,
as honourable senators are aware, increased
75 cents per bushel. This has spread very
substantial benefits throughout the Canadian
economy because, as I stated before and now

repeat, the wheat economy in Canada benefits not only the producers but every citizen
of the Dominion.
The Canadian Wheat Board during 1961
brought to Canada seven important missions
for the study of methods of production, handling, storing, milling, processing and merchandising of western grain. These groups
were composed of milling representatives
from various countries and grain trade officials. They represented the following countries: Belgium, Ireland, United Kingdom, Austria, Switzerland, Norway and the Peoples
Republic of China. In addition, the Canadian
Wheat Board, with the assistance of the Department of Trade and Commerce, has kept
in close contact with overseas customers
through personal visits to the principal markets in Europe, Central and South America,
the Caribbean area, and Asia, with the result
that the surplus has decreased in the manner
and for the reasons I have pointed out,
One of the big problems in western Canada has disappeared, namely, the so-called
quota system whereby each individual farmer
could sell only a certain number of bushels
of wheat per acre. According to the figures
given to me by the departmental officials, as
at March 26, 1962, some 1,920 delivery points
in western Canada, or 99 per cent, were on an
open delivery quota, seven were on a sixbushel quota, and 22 were on a seven-bushel
quota. It is anticipated by the officials of
the department that in a very short timeprobably less than a month-all delivery
points will be on an open quota basis. Many
of the 29 delivery points not now on an open
quota with stocks of No. 1 Northern wheat
exclusively are in the Vancouver shipping
area. To ship No. 1 Northern from these
points in excess of market requirements would
cause congestion at Vancouver for a grade
of wheat not in immediate market demand.
However, it is anticipated that additional
quantities of No. 1 Northern will be required in the near future at Vancouver, and
these stocks will be shipped from these 29
points. A daily check is being made on the
29 points in order that they will move to an
open basis as rapidly as possible, consistent
with good marketing practices.
Before closing my general remarks I should
like to deal with the various amendments
proposed in Bill C-75.
Clause 1: The purpose of the amendment to
paragraph (e) of subsection (1) of section 2
is to bring rapeseed within the jurisdiction of
the Canadian Wheat Board Act. Rapeseed is
now considered a grain for purposes of the
Canada Grain Act and the Railway Act. All
rapeseed delivered to an elevator must be
accepted for storage if space is available.

MARCH 29, 1982
Thus, an elevator could be congested with
rapeseed to the detriment of other grains
which are subject to the board's quota regulations. The proposed amendment would permit
the board to establish delivery quotas on
rapeseed, if such are considered necessary, and
to control its movement into terminal elevators, where in this and past years it has caused
some congestion on certain occasions.
The purpose of the amendment to paragraph
(f) is to effect an editorial change necessitated
by reason of the transfer of responsibility for
the Canadian Wheat Board from the Minister
of Trade and Commerce to the Minister of
Agriculture.
Clause 2: At present there is no provision
in the Canadian Wheat Board Act for the
establishment of a group insurance scheme
for the members and employees of the board.
Offhand, I believe there are approximately
724 employees of the Canadian Wheat Board.
The purpose of the amendment is to permit
the board to arrange for group insurance to
cover death benefits as well as medicalsurgical benefits for the board's members and
employees, with the approval of the Governor
in Council. The amendment would permit the
board to contribute the employer's share of
the cost and to charge such cost as an expense
incurred in connection with the operations of
the board. Both the board and the Government
are of the belief that an employees' group insurance plan is warranted on the basis of
good business practice and that it is a fringe
benefit that is required in order to attract and
hold adequate personnel. There would, of
course, be no commitment on the Consolidated
Revenue Fund. I need hardly repeat that this
expense would be borne by the producers.
Clauses 3, 4 and 6: The purpose of these
amendments to sections 23, 24 and 34 respectively of the act is to extend for another five
years certain vital sections of the Canadian
Wheat Board Act which expire, as I have
already stated, at the end of this crop yearthat is, on July 31 next. These sections have
the effect of maintaining the board as the
sole marketing agency for western wheat,
oats and barley in interprovincial and export
trade. If this bill goes through rapeseed will
be included.
Clause 5: At present the act permits the
board to transfer undistributed balances from
pool accounts that have been open for over
six years to the board's separate account, and
to pay claims against such transferred accounts of grain. Because the 1945-49 five-year
pools had large undistributed balances, which
have now been transferred to the separate account, and because the undistributed balances
since then have been relatively small, the possibility exists that the sum total of claims
presented against pool accounts that have been
26211-3-27J

transferred would be greater than the total
of the undistributed balances in the earliest
open pool accounts.
The amendments would permit the board to
use the moneys in the board's separate account to pay bona fide claims against pool
accounts that have been closed out by transference to the separate account, instead of
paying them from the undistributed balances
in the earliest open account, as at present.
With this short explanation, I highly commend this bill to all honourable senators.
Hon. J. Wesley Stambaugh: I wonder if
the honourable sponsor of the bill would
have any objection to adding mustard seed, as
well as rapeseed, to clause 1, paragraph (e)?
Hon. Mr. Hnalyshyn: Personally, I would
have no objection. I understand that presently
there are certain difficulties and that they
will exist until certain other acts are amended
to make mustard seed a grain. I would agree
with the honourable senator that mustard
seed should be added, but I am informed by
the law officers and by officials of the department that there would be great difficulty in
adding it.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Honourable senators,
I am glad that the honourable senator agrees
with me, because it seems that the same reason for adding rapeseed applies to the adding
of mustard seed. If we are able to add rapeseed, we should be able to add mustard seed.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald
hear.

(Brantford): Hear,

Hon. Mr. S±ambaugh: Furthermore, I am
sure that it is just as necessary to have
mustard seed included in this bill, and I am
sure that it would be just as popular with the
farmers of western Canada. It would help
the farmers of western Canada who are raising
mustard seed, if it were added to this bill.
In other respects this is a very good
bill. I have nothing but praise for the way
the Canadian Wheat Board has handled our
wheat, and later on our oats, barley and
flaxseed. If my memory serves me right,
when the wheat board was first formed some
25 years ago, it was to handle wheat only.
Later on, it commenced to handle oats and
barley and, later still, rye and flaxseed. Now
rapeseed is being added. Next year, we may
get around to adding mustard seed. I hope
we shall do that.
I can scarcely agree with the sponsor of
the bill that this is purely a producers' board.
I know that the producers pay al the expenses and in that respect it is a producers'
board; but if it is not a Government agency,
I do not understand why it comes under a

SENATE
minister and a department or why it has been
transferred from one department to another.
Some years ago, a deal was made by this
Government with the British Government to
sell our wheat at a certain price. To the
western farmers that was not a very good
agreement. I also know that the western
farmers and the Canadian Wheat Board had
nothing to do with that agreement. As a
matter of fact, I know the Chairman of the
wheat board was opposed to it. If that agreement were purely a producers' agreement, I
think they would have had something to do
with it.
On the other hand, a deal is being made
right now with China, which appears to be
a good deal, and the Government is making it.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Even so, the Government refuses to give us details of that deal
or to make the terms of the contract known
to us. I am a producer of wheat and I sell
my wheat to the board. If this is my board,
then as a producer I am certainly entitled to
know what that agreement is. On the other
hand, if this is a Government agency it seems
to me that Parliament has the right to know
what that agreement is. Therefore, in my
opinion the sponsor is wrong in claiming that
this board is a producers' board.
With regard to clause 2, I see nothing
wrong in it. As a matter of fact, I am surprised that this action has not been taken
before. In any case, I doubt that it is absolutely necessary to come to Parliament for
agreement on this point. I understand the
board has over 700 employees. The board
should have the same rights as any other
crown corporation, agency or employer, to
insure its employees.
By and large, I am in favour of the bill
and shall vote for it. I am glad to see that it
has been brought in, though I must repeat
that I am sorry that we cannot add mustard
seed to it.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Honourable senators,
I would like to put a question to the sponsor
of the bill. I notice that clause 1 includes
wheat, oats, barley, rye, flaxseed and rapeseed. Why is rye included? As far as I know,
it does not come under the wheat board.

Hon. Mr. Croll: The act says that "grain"
includes wheat, oats, barley, rye and flaxseed.
Hon. Mr. Hnalyshyn: I think the Canadian
Wheat Board never found it necessary to
put rye on a quota basis, as the demand has
always been greater than the supply, and the
crop grown has always been a cash crop.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Has the honourable senator any information regarding the number
of farmers now growing wheat as compared
with that of ten years ago? I understand there
has been quite a drop in the number of
farmers actually engaged in agriculture.
Hon. Mr. Hnalyshyn: I can give only the
general information which was given to me
by an official of the department. It relates not
to the number of farmers but to the number
of people engaged in farming, some of whom
may not be operating a farm but may be
working on one. I understand that there has
been a drop of 400,000 in the past ten years,
but that the reduced numbers produce more.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I am sure the sponsor of the bill (Hon.
Mr. Hnatyshyn) has a very good knowledge
of the Canadian Wheat Board Act. A question was addressed to him by the honourable
senator from Bruce (Hon. Mr. Stambaugh)
as to why mustard seed was not included, and
he answered that it would be difficult to administer it under the board. As one who
knows much more about mustard seed than I
do about rapeseed, I cannot understand where
the difficulty would lie in administering the
act if mustard seed were included.
I say with all sincerity that the sponsor of
the bill is well informed on this matter, and
I wonder if he could explain to the Senate
just where the difficulty would be if mustard
seed were brought under this board. All honourable senators who have spoken were in
favour of bringing mustard seed under the
bill. Perhaps we could be informed as to
where the difficulty lies.

Hon. Mr. Hna±yshyn: Honourable senators,
I do not think that is quite what I said. I
repeated just what I had been told, that there
would be some legal difficulty in bringing
mustard seed in. I understand that the Grain
Act relates to grain, and that the change

MARCH 29, 1962
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it intended that this bill should be
referred to a committee?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes, Mr. Speaker.
Hon. John G. Higgins: May I ask the honourable senator if he has ever heard of creeping red fescue seed and if so, is it included
in the provisions of this bill? I have never
heard of it before. I have here a clipping
from a newspaper in my own home town
which refers to it.
Hon. Mr. Hnatyshyn: Perhaps it is something that grows only in Newfoundland.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: No, this report comes
from Ottawa. It does not grow in Newfoundland. As a matter of fact, we do not grow
enough wheat to make a barrel of flour. This
news item reads:
Authorities here say they are puzzled
by an American senator's allegations that
Canadian growers of creeping red fescue
seed-a forage crop-enjoy a hidden subsidy to the detriment of United States
producers.
This allegation, apparently, comes from
Senator Wayne Morse. The news item reads
further:
Creeping red fescue is used in Canada
to seed forage areas in community pastures operated under the Prairie Farm
Rehabilitation Act. But exports are the
main item.
These
have increased
to nearly
15,000,000 pounds as of April 30 last year
compared with 7,236,000 pounds on
average annually in the 1954-59 period.
I wonder why this seed is not mentioned in
this bill.
Hon. Mr. Hnatyshyn: I think that would be
a good question to put to the newspaper that
printed that information.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: The item bears an Ottawa
dateline. A journalist who sits down to write
at the place where the news comes from does
not make a mistake about the place. The departmental authorities must know something
about it. I must say it is a name that has
been hidden from me. There seems to be
some importance to it when Senator Wayne
Morse of the United States makes this complaint.

FINANCE CHARGES (DISCLOSURE) BILL
SECOND

READING-DEBATE

CONTINUE]D

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Croll, for the second reading of Bill S-2, to
make provision for the disclosure of information in respect of finance charges.
Hon. William R. Bruni: Honourable senators,
when Bill S-2 was introduced in this chamber
it was not my intention to participate in the
debate on it. However, in view of the many
opinions which have been expressed with
regard to the bill, I now feel that there are
a few remarks I should make.
I should like, first of all, to compliment
the honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina
(Hon. Mr. Croîl) on the composition of the
bill. We are all aware that this is the third
bill dealing with this particular subject that
the honourable senator has introduced. I believe the original bill, Bill S-25, was introduced in this chamber on March 16, 1960,
and after being debated here and studied
by the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, it failed to pass.
The honourable senator then amended
clause 4 of his original bill, and introduced
it as Bill S-4, on December 14, 1960. The
amendment to clause 4 was a very minor one,
and I believe it was made for the sole purpose
of clarifying the meaning of the section.
Finally, on January 31 last the honourable
senator presented Bill S-2, dealing with the
same subject matter. This bill, however, is
quite different from and, I am sure everyone
will agree, a great improvement over the
two previous bills that my honourable friend
introduced.
I would like to compliment and congratulate Senator Croll for the very extensive
explanation he gave when he moved the
second reading. However, despite the improvements in this bill over previous bills,
and the excellent presentation of it, I do
not feel that I can support it. If a vote is
taken on this motion my present feeling is
that I shall vote against Lt.
I have three reasons for not supporting
this particular bill: first, it is most unfair to
the small merchandiser of goods in this
country, and gives to the large merchandiser
a very distinct advantage. In other words, this
bill, in my opinion, is detrimental to the
many thousands of small storekeepers across
Canada who are carrying on a credit, timepayment business.
Secondly, it is my opinion that it is impossible to properly ascertain and compute
the percentage relationship expressed in
terms of simple annual interest that the total
amount of the finance charges bears to the

SENATE
unpaid balance outstanding under any transaction. In other words, I do not think that
paragraph (c) of clause 3 is workable.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): May I
ask the honourable senator one question for
purposes of information? He said that he
thinks the bill is detrimental to the small
storekeepers across Canada. Do his thoughts
in that connection apply to small storekeepers
of every kind?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: To everyone who sells
merchandise. I might clarify this by saying it
is detrimental to all storekeepers who make
credit sales and impose finance charges or
who sell goods on a monthly time-payment
plan.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I add to that question? It would be very enlightening if the
honourable senator would make clear the
disadvantage that the small storekeepers are
under now. They are under a disadvantage
today.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I am coming to that. For
the moment I will say "a further disadvantage".

article reads, in part, as follows:

in the larger centres of Canada, that sell

Hon. Mr. Bruni: Oh, yes. Wait until you

Hon. Mr. Croll: As a matter of general
knowledge, does the honourable senator not
know that the discount stores sell for cash?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Wait until you learn how
they handle their cash transactions. This is
something entirely new that has been introduced.
Some discounters have finance companies handling credit arrangements independently, from an office in their store.
Others pay these firms a fee to run a
credit department. Others run their own.

Hon. Mr. Bruni: Furthermore, Laurentide

two Miracle Mart stores in the province of
Quebec. These are the low mark-up, selfservice department stores run jointly by
Woodward Stores Ltd. and Steinberg's Ltd.
Laurentide have also opened a credit office
at the Mon Mart discount store in the city
of Montreal.
Atlantic Acceptance Corporation has opened
an office at Frederick's Department Stores
Limited, located in London, Ontario, and
further, Banner Discount Department Stores
Ltd. states that it may take on a finance
company with future expansion of its business. What this means is that not one of
these stores has to sel on time, and yet there
are credit arrangements and facilities right
within the store.
I am sure that all honourable senators will
realize that the small, independent storekeeper across Canada would not have sufficient volume of credit business for a finance
company to open a department in his store.
Such a department can only* be opened and
operated at a profit in the large stores
throughout Canada. There is nothing to prevent Eaton's, Simpson's or any other large
store, from having a credit department set
up where the money is advanced to the purchaser. The purchaser pays the finance and
other charges to a credit company, and he
takes the cash from the credit company and
buys the article from the store for cash. I
am thinking of Eaton's, Simpson's and other
large stores which, by this procedure, would
not have to comply with the provisions of
this bill.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Does my honourable friend
think this legislation would have any effect
on bringing about the situation he has just
outlined?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: It might. These credit
people may be keeping just one jump ahead
of the honourable senator from TorontoSpadina (Hon. Mr. Croîl).
Hon. Mr. Croll: I am listening with interest and I do not want to interrupt my honourable friend, but what he is saying is not
new. He knows that the purpose for which
all this is being done is to meet Eaton's and
Simpson's competition, because they will put
them out of business in six months.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Is there anything to prevent Eaton's or Simpson's from doing the
identical thing without having to comply
with the terns of this bill?
- Hon. Mr. Croll: They are doing it now, and
they are complying as well as they can.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): May I
ask the honourable senator from Hanover a
question? I am not for or against this bill at
the moment. I am just looking for information, as are many other honourable senators.
Could not the Sayvette company and the
associated credit companies do what the honourable gentleman has said they are going
to do, whether or not this bill comes into
effect?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes, that is right. There is
no argument about that.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Then
what has this bill to do with the new set-up?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: What I am saying is, even
if the bill passes it would not affect the
arrangement they now have.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Would the honourable
senator support an amendment to the bill
making it wide enough to include the finance
companies to which he refers?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That provision was in the
second previous bill and it was not acceptable.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: You opposed it.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: It was not acceptable, and
that is why it was taken out.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Does the
honourable gentleman suggest that Sayvette
and similar companies would not be able to
do what they intend to do if they thought
this bill would come into effect?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I think they would do it
anyway. But they have facilities to get
around this legislation, and I say the small
storekeeper does not have these facilities.
Honourable senators may not know that
a similar bill to this was introduced two years
ago by the Honourable Paul H. Douglas, the
senator from the State of Illinois. Ever since
then Senator Douglas has been urging Congress of the United States to pass a law so
that every borrower in that country would
know what he was being charged for interest.
I hold in my hand a volume published by the
Government of the United States entitled
"Truth in Lending Bill". It contains the minutes of the hearings before a subcommittee
of the Committee on Banking and Currency
of the U.S. Senate.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I know what my honourable friend is going to read from and that is
his privilege. I just want the record to be
correct, and I know he will forgive me for
interrupting him. He said that a similar bill
to this was introduced by Senator Douglas.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Well, it was a similar bill

Hon. Mr. Bruni: Finally, the whole matter
of interest is complicated by the problem of
the odd payment. When an odd payment is
thrown in it disrupts everything.
I feel sure honourable senators will realize
by this time that it is practically impossible
to comply with paragraph C of Clause 3 of
the bill. Frankly, I have grave doubts that
any small merchant anywhere in Canada can
sit down with pencil and paper and make
this calculation. If the honourable senator
from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croll) would
incorporate in his bill a simple formula for
calculating the true rate of interest, one
that the average person could work out without the use of a calculating machine, then
I would be willing to consider his bill in a
more favourable light.
Now to deal with clause 5 of the bill.
You will note that in this clause the honourable senator has shifted to the Governor
in Council three things: first, the form and
manner in which the written statement referred to in clause 3 is to be made; secondly,
the manner of calculating the total amount
of the finance charges to be borne, and the
manner of calculating the simple interest
thereon in respect of any transaction or type
of transaction; and, thirdly, the degree of
accuracy within which the total amount of
finance charges. and the annual interest
thereon shall be calculated.
I am sure the honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina realizes that before he can get
his bill before the Governor in Council he
must find a sponsoring minister. After all,
this is a private bill he is sponsoring, and if
it passes here he will have to find a sponsor

for it in the other place. Should it pass there
and then receive royal assent, it would be
necessary for him to find a minister to sponsor the act and bring it before the Governor
in Council. Honourable senators, do you
think that any minister would want to bring
this measure before the Governor in Council
when it contains a provision such as clause
5, which could only lead to trouble?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Do you
mean a minister of the present Government
or the next Government?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I said "any minister";
I will make it all-inclusive.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We will have a minister
for you.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: A rather extensive search
failed to find another private bill with a
clause such as clause 5 in this bill.
I am quite sure that no minister wants to
take the responsibility of proposing regulations to carry out paragraphs (b) and (c) of
clause 5. In my opinion clause 5 should be
stricken from the bill, and the honourable
senator from Toronto-Spadina should insert
sufficient additional clauses in it to carry out
those things which he now proposes the Governor in Council should do by regulation.
I am sure all senators will agree with me
when I say that this is a pet or favourite
bill of the honourable senator, and that he
thinks it is a great bill. He is thoroughly
convinced that his bill is a right and proper
one. Therefore, I say to him, if it is a proper
bill he should complete it and should not ask

(c) The annual rate of change ini the
totals of the above items was 10.5 per
cent.
I had hoped to avoid on this occasion the
necessity o! speaking on the constitutionality
o! the present bill. However, sonie remarks
made by honourable senators suggest that I
should deal with this question once more.
I hope that I will be able to deal with this
aspect of the problem, with reasonable brevlty.
In particular, one honourable senator
prof essed to see no element of constitutionality therein which would give the federal
Parliament some jurisdiction since there is
no longer a question of criminal law le!t In
the bill. To say that there is no peg in the
British North America Act for this bill is
not to have read the bill or the E.N.A. Act.
It is true that the clause which would have
made noncompliance with the provisions o!
the bull an offence punishable on summary
conviction has flot been included in the new
bill. It is equally true that a numnber of
honourable senators on previous occasions expressed the view that criminal consequences
should not fiow from noncompliance. The
consequences which flow fromn the present bull
are therefore civil in nature, in that credit
financiers who do flot comply will be unable
to collect or retain any finance charges. The
summary convictions clause has been left
out of the present bill in deference to the
honourable senators who felt that the penalty

(a) As of December 31, 1961, finance
company and retail dealer credit extended

Chartered bank unsecured personal loans
totalled $1,030 million. The total of these
items was $3,379 million.

last ten years are as follows (in $
million):

was too stringent. In any event, though I
did flot argue this point and I do not; agree ta
it now, the honourable senator fromn Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) last year indicated unmistakably that at least in his view the bill
was not sustainable under the heading of
criminal law.
On the other hand, as I have stated before,
the present bill is clearly constitutional as
being in pith and substance legisiation relating to interest. This being so, it is unnecessary
to invoke any other constitutional basis for
the validity o! the proposed legisiation.
In deaiing with interest I propose to consider first the actual words o! the British
North America Act, 1867, including, if I
may use the expression, the fine print thereof,
and then the legal opinions aiready given, as
well as the existing case law on the subi ect.
I would remind honourable senators that
the introductory words o! section 91 of the
British North America Act, 1867, together
with head 19 thereof, make it abundantly
clear, and here 1 quote:
. .. the exclusive Legisiative Authority
o! the Parliament of Canada extends to
ail Matters coming within the Classes af
Subjects next hereinafter enumerated;
that is to say19. Interest
I caîl attention at once to the !act that the
legisiative authority of Parliament in relation

SENATE
to "interest" is exclusive, and that it extends
to all matters in relation to interest. The honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) appeared to suggest that "interest" was
synonymous with "regulation of interest." Of
course, that is clearly not the case. Not only
does the British North America Act not employ the phrase "regulation of interest", but
it specifically provides that Parliament may
legislate with respect to all matters relating
to interest. If, therefore, this legislation is in
relation to "interest" it is valid whether it
deals with regulation, disclosure or otherwise.
Then you ask, does this legislation, in pith
and substance, relate to "interest"? If so,
it must be subtracted, so to speak, from
Property and Civil Rights in the Province,
which by head 13 of section 92 of the British
North America Act is assigned exclusively
to the provincial legislatures. The honourable
senator from Toronto has suggested more
than once that since this legislation deals with
contracts, it is properly within the exclusive
competence of the provincial legislatures.
However, it has been held many times that
"interest" includes "contractual interest". Viscount Caldecote, in Lethbridge Northern Irrigation (1940) A.C. 513, with reference to
"interest", remarked:
It is sufficient to say that in its ordinary connotation it covers contractual
interest, and contractual interest is a subject of the act now in question.
In that case the judicial committee held
invalid a provincial statute seeking to cut in
half the interest on certain provincial government debentures. Lord Caldecote went on
to say:
Their Lordships have considered the
Act with a view to ascertaining its "true
nature and character" or "its pith and
substance". It relates in substance not
to borrowing but to payment of interest.
Still another leading case, the language of
which is clearly applicable to the present
bill, is Attorney General of Saskatchewan v.
Attorney General of Canada (1949), A.C. 110.
In that case the judicial committee considered,
inter alia, the validity of a Saskatchewan act
providing in the event of a crop failure for
the reduction of the principal amount upon
which interest was to be payable. It was held
that this was in pith and substance legislation in relation to interest and thus not
properly legislation in respect either of
"agriculture within the province" or "property and civil rights". In the judgment, Viscount Simon said:
To provide that principal is to be
reduced by statute but that the amount

to be paid as interest is to remain unaltered is necessarily to increase the rate
on the principal outstanding.
He added:
The Dominion power would likewise
be invaded if the provincial enactment
was directed to postponing the contractual date for the payment of interest
without altering the rate, for this would
equally be legislating in respect of
interest.
There is yet another case which is germane
to the present question. It is the case of
Cummings v. Silverwood (1918) 11 S.L.R.,
407. In that case the plaintiff advanced to
the defendant on April 29, 1914 a sum of
$10,000. The defendant agreed in consideration thereof to pay to the plaintiff two months
later the sum of $12,000, or three months
later the sum of $13,000, on the security of
real estate. It was held that the surplus was
interest. Mr. Justice Macdonald said:
Interest is defined as money paid for
the use of money at a fixed rate. Plaintiff contends there is no fixed rate, but
in so doing he is clearly mistaken and
apparently confounds "fixed rate" with
a stated rate percentum per annum,
which is quite a different thing.
I cite these cases to honourable senators in
support of the argument that I made much
earlier when I first presented the bill here.
I said then that in my view it was constitutional. However, there are other views
which should reasonably be taken into consideration. I should point out now that the
courts have taken a broad and not a narrow
view of interest, and have had no difficulty
in determining that any charge for the use of
money, including credit, however veiled or
disguised that charge may be, is in the nature
of interest, and thus within federal rather
than provincial jurisdiction.
As honourable senators know, the Small
Loans Act is based on the total cost of the
loan. It would be well to remember those
words. The monthly rate on a loan up to
$1,500 is thus regulated. The expression "total
cost of the credit" in the present bill is indistinguishable. As I reminded honourable senators on an earlier occasion, Mr. F. P. Varcoe,
Q.C., a former Deputy Minister of Justice,
assured Parliament on many occasions that
the Small Loans Act is constitutionally valid
as being in pith and substance related to
interest.
Honourable senators, the honourable senator from Fredericton (Hon. Mrs. Fergusson)
has already quoted Mr. Varcoe's exact words
when he was testifying before the House of
Commons Standing Committee on Banking

APRIL 8, 1962
and Commerce on July 19, 1956. This appears
at page 682 of the printed proceedings of that
cammittee. The words bear re-reading now.
I shall read them very slowly so that honourable senators will appreciate the full effect of
Mis words. This was Mis opinion:
In 1939 the device was resorted to of
fixing the over-ail cost of a loan. The
idea behind that was, flrst of a11, that
everything that is paid ta the lender by
the borrower, apart, of course, f rom the
principal, is interest. What the lender
does with that, and how he disposes of
it, does not make the sum which he
receives any the less interest. Now
interest is, as you know, the return made
to the lender for accepting the risk of the
loan and for compensating hlmi for the
use of the money lent. That was the flrst
basis we had in mind when we prepared
this legisiation in 1939-everything which
the borrower pays is interest, no matter
how the lender may break it down, and
suggest that it is for this and that, chattel
mortgage charges, and s0 on. In case
that did not caver the whole field a!
these charges we said, secondly, that
when yau fix the cast of the loan, accepting the view that there might be some
Items i there which are not interest,
then you are nevertheless regulating the
Interest because yau fix the maximum of
12 per cent, or whatever it is, and if any
part of that is samething other than interest you are nevertheless regulating
interest by reference to that.
Honourable senatars, yau wlll note that
Mr. Varcae closed the front door and the
back door on thase people who were deaiing
in small loans. As yet, no one has attacked
that act as being unconstitutional, although
there were threats ta do so at the time it
was passed.
I repeat, the present bil ini pith and substance relates ta interest and therefore fails
within the legisiative jurisdiction o! Parliament. Moreaver, because of the provisions
relating ta, the retention and recovery of finance charges, the bibl may be said ta regulate
interest. Even if it daes not regulate interest,
it still relates ta the subi ect of interest. As
I said earbier, federal jurisdictian extends ta
all matters relating ta, interest and flot merely
ta the regulation thereof. The disclosure af
finance charges surely must corne within the
description o! a matter relating ta interest.
This house is pecullarly sensitive about
matters relating ta constitutionality. That
probably arises fram the history of the house,
in that its original purpose was ta protect
provincial rigzhts and the rights of minorities.

Furthermore, the house has a sense of direction and o! respansibillty.
The days of the great canstitutianal questions are past; the days. of the great constitutional practitianers have gane. Some of
us remember the names o! Ewart, Lafleur,
Geaffrion, Tilley, Rowell and W. F. O'Connor,
a former Law Clerk and Parliamentary
Counsel of the Senate.
They are gane from the scene naw. I would
associate with thern twa great attarneys
general, one in the province o! Ontario and
the ather in the province o! British Columbia,
who made great contributions ini their day
in that office. They are, my deskmate the
Hanourable Mr. Roebuck, and the Honourable
Mr. Farris. This house is honoured and pleased
ta have them here.
Sa far as I know, there are two great authorities in this country an constitutional matters who are outside the practising legal
profession. They are, Mr. Frank Scott at
McGîll University and Mr. Bora Laskin at
the University o! Toronta. They are prabably
aur best autharities; but the great nanies
asociated with importent constitutional issues
are entombed in the case books.
The last vital challenge which we had o!
constitutional consequence was that made by
the Social Credit goverment some years ago.
There has been very little since the second
warbd war. It would be foolish for me ta ask
Parbiament ta enact a bill that is clearly unconstitutional.
Honourable senatars, let me say that aithough there are flot very many constitutional
lawyers in Canada, the best are right here in
Ottawa. They can be faund in the Department
o! Justice, in the Department of External
Affairs, on the staff of the House o! Commans,
and on aur own staff . They are good constitutional lawyers because they live with the
problem every day. They are speciallsts. They
have become experts, and are so recognized.
I want this house ta know that there is
within this bill four built-in safeguards for
the protection a! every honaurable senator
on the question o! constitutionality. I will take
a minute ta, elaborate.
I do flot stand before you as a constitutional
iawyer asking you ta take my word. I shahl
give the best opinions I can. The first opinion
I gave was that of Mr. Varcoe, a former
Deputy Minister of Justice. I read ta you Mis
opinion with respect ta the Smafl Loans Act,
and i doing sa I indicated that the definition
of "total cost of loan" in that act, and the
definition of "total cost of credit"l in the bill
now before this house, are indistinguishable.
Honourable senators, you have the opinion
of aur Law Cberk and Parliamentary Counsel that this bill is constitutional. We should

SENATE
not belittle our own counsel and disregard
his views. I think it would be well for me to
remind all honourable senators that Mr. Hopkins is a graduate of the University of Saskatchewan, the University of Toronto, Harvard
University and Oxford University, that he is
a Rhodes Scholar, and was Professor of Law
at the University of Toronto. He is a man
of considerable attainments, and is our counsel here because he is competent. You have
his views as to the constitutionality of this
bill. It is in the affirmative.
Let me assume, honourable senators, that
the bill passes this house in its present form.
It will then go to the House of Commons
where it must pass two tests. First of all,
there must be a certificate that it in no way
contravenes the Bill of Rights. There is no
difficulty about that. The next step that must
inevitably be taken is that of asking the
Department of Justice to deliver an opinion
as to whether the bill is constitutional or unconstitutional. If that department says that
the bill is unconstitutional, then for all purposes the bill in its present form bas had
it. If that department says that the bill is
constitutional, then the House of Commons
will go on to a consideration of it. But, certainly, the question will be asked-you can
rest assured of that. If that bouse finds the
bill unconstitutional, it may amend it in that
respect and send it back to us. In any event,
the Department of Justice must give its
opinion before the bill is dealt with in the
other place.
If the bill passes this Parliament and someone still does not like it, be can challenge
it in the courts to his heart's content. What
more can anyone want with respect to the
question of constitutionality?
Honourable senators, let me say that the
purpose and intent of this bill, despite the
fact that one honourable senator has referred
to it as my petHon. Mr. Bruni: Isn't it?
Hon. Mr. Croll: That honourable senator
also said that I thought it was a great bill.
Truer words were never spoken. The idea
behind the bill is not even original. Other
people with more understanding and more
competence than I have given this problem
a great deal of thought at the federal level.
Honourable senators, Mr. David Kirk, the
Secretary of the Canadian Federation of
Agriculture, has directed my attention to
some books which have been gathering dust
on my shelves for some time. He directed
me specifically to the report of the Royal
Commission on Canada's Economic Prospectsbetter known to us as the Gordon Commission-and more particularly to the volume
entitled "Financing of Economic Activity

in Canada". This volume was published
in 1958. I would like to read some of the
observations and conclusions. This will take
me a minute or so, but I must be sure that
the record is complete. At page 196 of the
volume I have identified, the commissioners
in discussing consumer instalment credit, had
this to say:
We are however concerned with one
aspect of this matter. This is the burden
imposed on the economy by the consumer's ignorance of the costs of the
money he borrows. We have contended
in this chapter that such ignorance is
very widespread. We have also contended
that one of the reasons finance companies
did not respond to the pressures of tight
money was because they could, to some
degree at least, pass higher interest costs
on to the consumer in the form of higher
charges. This was done in very large
measure by lengthening the terms of the
loans as charges were raised so that
the increase in monthly payments could
be kept to modest proportions.
Then, in the part of the volume entitled
"conclusion" at page 433 there are these
words:
We considered not only the sensitivity
of consumers as investors to the relative
yields of financial assets but also their
sensitivity as borrowers to the costs of
funds. We concluded that ignorance of
the costs of funds is very widespread
among consumer-borrowers. We contend
that if consumers wish and are able to
pay high costs of borrowed money in full
knowledge of these costs, it is a proper
function of the capital market to supply
them. We contend equally however, that
if consumers are unaware of the costs
of the funds they borrow, there is a presumption that to some extent (what extent cannot be stated) funds and resources
are misallocated. Suppliers of funds to
consumers do not usually state the costs
of the funds clearly. Indeed, consumers
could not know these costs in most cases
without making elaborate calculations
that are beyond the abilities of persons
not trained in mathematics of finance. In
many instances, other terms of the loan
contract apart from the cost of funds,
such as the monthly servicing charge,
and the proportion of the amount borrowed to the price of the real asset being
purchased, are given overriding consideration. In fact the possibilities of hiding
increases in costs by extending amortization periods for example, make it easier
for consumer finance companies to maintain or increase the volume of their loans

quote from the Financial Post, the apostle of
financial orthodox. The Post has this to say:
Loan sharks who operate on the fringes
of the lending business in this country find
in second and third mortgages extraordinarily fertile ground for gouging the
unwary and bleeding the naive.
But this is precisely the area of lending
excluded from the only constructive plan
for getting lenders to disclose the real
or "effective" interest rate that they
charge on loans-this year's version of
Senator Croll's perennial private bill.
The writer is angry with me because I left
out the mortgage companies, banks and some
of the other agencies from the present bill.
Perhaps I should not have diluted my latest
bill as much as I did. The writer goes on to
say:
Some Canadian lending firms have
shot into prominence and prosperity by
making second mortgage money available
at 12-14 per cent. The reason: Although
this is twice the going rate for first
mortgage money, it is still substantially
below the 18-20 per cent that is frequently
charged.
By the time the discounts, service
charges, special fees and other items are
totalled up, it's not much wonder that
some lenders say they can't tell the borrower, to the last decimal point, what the
effective interest rate is.
But we suspect also that fewer of the
shark-type deals would be entered into
if the lender had to say "we're charging
you a rate about 18-20 per cent per annum
for this money."
That would at least make it clear that
7-8 per cent nominal rate on the mortgage
is only a plain cover for a lurid tale, in
fine print, inside.
And here are the words I particularly call to
your attention:
Past experience suggests, lamentably,
that the Croll bill may founder again on
the rocks of senatorial indifference, partisan politics and special interests. But
it would be very much to the benefit of
all Canadians if the government were to
take up the Croll idea, expand it to include regulation of mortgage lending and
rap the knuckles of a business which, on
the fringes at least, thrives on widespread public ignorance and its own greed.

The Financial Post is by far the best financial paper in Canada, and is comparable
to the American Wall Street Journal; it is
recognized as the voice of big business. It
certainly can be assumed that this bill is
not a socialist plot to undermine private
enterprise. The Financial Post is to be commended for its courage in running counter
to the views of many of its subscribers.
Yet it predicts failure, saying that the measure
is likely to founder again on the rocks of
senatorial indifference, partisan politics and
special interests. What the public will be
asking is this: Is there truth in the charge
that the Senate is more concerned with the
protection of special interests than it is in
the public good? I am one of those who does
not believe it.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: I am happy to hear
that.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Let me put it bluntly.
The question may be asked, is there a
conflict of interests? I assure you that I
too am perplexed that in a measure of
this kind, a simple measure, really, with
no hidden gimmicks, so much of so little
substance could be said against it. This is a
sort of bill that transcends political considerations, and it should transcend any confiict of interest. This bill contains no half
tones. It is a black and white sort of bill
which says plainly what it is hoped to achieve
and why. I think it represents a challenge
to the Senate, inasmuch as the voice of
Bay Street and of St. James Street, in the
Financial Post had this to say:
Past experience suggests, lamentably,
that the Croll bill may founder again
on the rocks of senatorial indifference,
partisan politics and special interestsafter saying in the same breath that it
should pass. I have said that I do not
believe that statement. Nevertheless, this is
said by somebody of importance and consequence. It is well that it is denied here
on the floor, and in effect it can be proved
here to be wrong.

Hon. Mr. Choquette: Do you believe that
anybody who would vote against the bill
would have such interests in mind as mentioned in that newspaper? Supposing somebody just believes that the bill will not
help the consumer at all. If that is his only
reason for opposing it, surely we are not

one can give is ta show that it is wrang,

Hon. Mr. Bouffard: The only way ta show

Hon. Mr. Croil: I did not say that, but
it is a first-class way of showing it.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: But it would nat be a

Hon. Mr. Croll: I answer my friend by saying that if hie does not in conscience believe
in it, I have no complaint. However, the publishers of this article do not themselves think
much of the Senate's conscience.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Who wrote the article?
Hon. Mr. Croll: There appeared in the Toranta Star for March 23 last another report
from which I should like ta read.
Interest rates are being "ceither hidden
or stated in a misleading fashion" in many
contracts signed by Canadians, the Saskatchewan government said today.
It asked the Porter Royal Commission
on Banking and Finance ta recommend
ta the f ederal government that financial
institutions be required ta disclose fully
and clearly the eff ective rate of interest
being charged on variaus kinds of personalloans.
I stili have a few more witnesses here. The
Canadian Register, which will nat be unf amiliar ta memibers af the Senate, on March 3
of this year, in an editarial entitled "lThose
-Hidden Charges," had this ta say:
Reasanably enaugh, the purchaser was
expected ta pay extra for this extension
of service, at least enough ta, caver the
risk of loss involved; on the other hand,
he was usually offered a discount for
paying cash.
Now ail this bas been changed. Credit
flnancing has become a well-organized
business in itself, and ail the loopholes
have been plugged, s0 that the possibility
of loss to the seller bas been almost

entirely eliminated. This new measure of
security, coupled with additional revenue
frorn accumulated interest, has conditioned business firms ta prefer selling on
credit rather than accepting cash payments. In fact, sorne refuse ta accept cash
in full at the Urne of purchase, which
indicates that the firm in question is receiving more money through the transaction than the original sale price of the
article and normally accrued interest.
This the purchaser is paying in addition
to the charges levied by the finance coinpany.
This would be bad enough if the purchaser knew exactly what he was undertaking when hie makes a purchase on
credit. But in many instances he is not;
given a complete picture of the additional
charges that will be added ta the sale
price of the commadity, through the
financing operation.
At the time of writing a bill is before
the Senate of Canada which if passed
would compel ail credit financiers ta
make the compiete cost of such a business operatian known in writing ta the
persan receiving credit. By the time this
appears in print, the bill may have becorne law, or it may have been rej ected.
Whatever its fate, discussion of the
problem should alert the unfortunate victims of credit financing ta some of the
liabilities they are Incurring iri such
transactions. Whether or not credit financiers are required by civil law ta reveal
the full implications of the proposition
they offer the purchaser, the people concerned should be sufficiently alert ta demand such accurate information before
doing business with them, otherwise they
deserve ta suifer the consequences. And
probably the shock of the full cost involved in credit transactions might prevent some people from buying on credit.
I also have before me an editoriai fram
the March 1962 issue of CanadianChurchman.
I think it speaks for the Anglican Church
of Canada. The editarial bears the caption,
"Support the Senator". I would have preferred it ta say, "Support the Senate". However, this is a church organ of much consequence, and I will read the editorial
somewhat extensively:
A private bill introduced in the Senate
of Canada for the second year in a raw
by Senator David Croil is deserving of
every type of support the Christian
churches of Canada can bring ta bear.
The bill deais with the misuse of consumer credît through the sharp practices
of unscrupulaus money-lenders. The

SENATE
legislation would require persons extending consumer credit to reveal in writing
exactly how much the credit will cost
in any particular transaction. It will not
apply to cash loans or mortgages on real
estate.
The Senator claims this legislation is
necessary to protect the unsuspecting
purchaser. Many people among the general public who have learned the facts
of consumer credit the hard way will undoubtedly agree. Not every individual
who must purchase on credit has either
the time or the ability to fully understand the maze of complicated figuring
with which he is often confronted.
Through the work of the pastoral ministry
the clergy are aware of the effects of
the present uncontrolled situation on
family life.
One might think that a bill of this
nature, a benefit and protection to so
large a section of the general public,
would pass very readily in an enlightened parliamentary concern for the
public good. Well-think again!
It would seem that the Senator could
do with more support from the grass
roots. He claims that "-in too many
instances the borrower is deceived into
paying a higher cost for credit than he
has been led to suspect". Is not this the
type of social problem which concerns
the churches?
Now would be a good time for the
social service boards and councils, as well
as individual Christians and other concerned peoples to speak out in support
of this bill. A few sermons on the subject would not be out of place and if a
text is needed, try the following: "He
that worketh deceit shall not dwell within
my house: he that telleth lies shall not
tarry in my sight." (Psalm 101: 7).
Undoubtedly
our
parliamentarians
would be encouraged to hear from their
constituents on this matter. It would be
a welcome relief from the public apathy
which surrounds so much of the nation's
business.
This bill is no fit subject for party
strife and each individual, inside or outside of the Parliament buildings, should
feel free to express himself in support of
Senator Croll's action. There is no great
debate on opposing economic systems and
policies involved here. It is a clear case
of protecting the unsuspecting from the
unscrupulous who at present can operate
within the limits of the law.
If tbe bill shauld again be defeated,
then we should carefully study the

grounds for the defeat so that it might
receive an easier passage the next time
round.
I have some more editorials which honourable senators gave me but there is not time
for me to read them into the record.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Go ahead; you are doing
all right.
Hon. Mr. Croll: There was a very interesting bit of byplay in the house a few days
ago. Some senators have received a booklet
from the Federated Council of Sales Finance
Companies. The booklet was prepared in order
to oppose the Douglas bill in the United States
Congress. I presume that some left-over copies
were mailed to members of this house in
order to get fringe benefits. Reference has
been made to the booklet in this debate.
Then, of course, some reference has been
made in this debate to the monthly letter of
the First National City Bank of New York of
March of this year. In it there was an article
on the complexities of simple interest calculations, and it indicated that simple interest
was not so simple. This was followed up by
an article on the financial page of the Toronto
Daily Star, of March 28, in which it is said:
Simple interest is far from simple. It's
downright complicated and confusing,
according to Federated Council of Sales
Finance Companies.
That was the first booklet I indicated. Then
the article goes on:
Says the March monthly letter of First
National City Bank, New York: "Any
prudent borrower can and should inform
himself of the exact amount of finance
charges. He can make any kind of calculation he wishes of what the simple
interest rate might be.
But neither he nor the lender will have
the exact answer. Simple interest is too
complicated."
I merely call attention to this. I do not
want to cast any reflection on the Toronto
Daily Star because it has given this bill full
support from its inception, and also editorial
support. That paper has also reported the debates in this house very fairly. I presume the
writer was filling the column that day and,
not being too friendly to this bill anyway,
he got in both those jabs at me.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think you ought to
report him.
Hon. Mr. Croll: No. That is not unfairit is his point of view.

awa this morning
there was on my desk a copy of a letter addressed to the Financial Editor of the Toronto

APRIL 3. 1962
Daily Star dated March 30 and signed R. G.
Stanton, head of the department of mathematics at the University of Waterloo, Waterloo,
Ontario. When I read the letter I called the
professor, who is a stranger to me, by telephone. I asked him if I could use the letter,
telling him that I had not seen it in the newspapers. His reply was, "Yes, you can use
the letter because I intended it for the
public".
I will say this, honourable senators, I do
not know who wrote the article for the
Federated Council of Sales Finance Companies, or who wrote the article in the March
letter of the First National City Bank of
New York, but I now know something of the
man who wrote this letter. The information I
have on him is from a biographical sketch
printed in a book entitled, American Men
of Science, The Physical Sciences, ninth
edition, page 1842. Professor Stanton went
from the University of Toronto to the University of Waterloo when that university
opened its doors, and he has been head of
its department of mathematics ever since.
Perhaps the Toronto Daily Star may not yet
have time to print this letter he wrote,
but I shall read it.
March 30th, 1962.
The Financial Editor,
Toronto Daily Star,
80 King Street W.,
Toronto, Ontario.
Dear Sir,
It is perhaps unnecessary to write you,
since others have probably already
pointed out to you the incorrect picture
given on page 14 of the Toronto Star for
March 28. The article on simple interest,
far from being an impartial survey,
merely publicizes incorrect or misleading statements made by the finance companies. In particular, the impression that
the mathematical equation given cannot
be solved, is absolutely incorrect; it is
a matter of the most extreme simplicity
to make a table giving the solution for
various values of the symbols involved.
Any car dealer who is capable of reading a table (such as the present tables
giving sales tax) would likewise be
capable of reading off the effective
interest rate from a table giving effective
interest rates.
Whatever may be the merits or demerits of Senator Croll's bill requiring
disclosure of effective interest rates, inability to compute these effective interest rates is not a failing of the bill, and

any pretense that there is a mathematical difficulty involved has no basis in
fact.
Yours very sincerely,
R. G. Stanton,
There is another aspect I wish to talk
about for a few moments, and perhaps this
is as good a time as any to do so. I refer to
the matter raised by the honourable senator
from St. John's East (Hon. Mr. Higgins) the
other day. He quoted some words which indicated that someone had said there was a
lobby against the bill when it was defeated
the last time. I was the one who was quoted
on it, and quoted correctly. I said at that
time that there had been a very heavy lobby
against the bill. I looked up the definition of
the word "lobby" in the dictionary, and I
think it is necessary to give it in order tc
have a clear understanding of the term. It is:
Persons who haunt lobbies for the
purpose of accosting or soliciting legislators in order to influence legislation and
secure advantages to one's own interest.
In this day and age lobbyists are more
likely known as trade association representatives, fiscal consultants and, sometimes, parliamentary agents. In the yellow pages of
the Ottawa telephone book honourable senators will find there listed pleaders who are
better than you have heard in many courts.
In Washington they register and recognize
such individuals, and I have seen it reported
that they have spent as much as $4 million
a year on lobbying. As a matter of fact, in
Washington money spent on lobbying is recognized as deductible expenses for taxation purposes-if you can believe that. However, there
the legislator knows to whom he is talking.
Here in Ottawa lobbyists do not wear badges;
for all purposes they remain faceless. I know
of their existence, influence and practice, and
I have known this for many years. I can say
to my friends that if you do not know what
you are looking for, you are not likely to
find it.
When this bill was introduced here for
the first time, in 1960, no one paid much
attention to it, except the members of the
Senate. Nothing like this had happened before; the Senate had not been in the habit
of originating legislation. To all intents and
purposes it appeared to be an exercise in
futility. Then, to the great surprise of many,
the bill received second reading in this house
and went to committee. In committee we had
a hearing and were awaiting the opinion of
legal counsel when that Parliament came to
an end.
Last year it was a little different. There
were constant calls made to the committees

branch to find out when the bill was to be
proceeded with. Such cails were a daily
occurrence. These lobbyists were crawling in
the corridors; they did their job ail too well
and helped defeat the bill. I knew they were
active, but I could flot assess their effectiveness. That is why I said what I did at the
time.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: Is the honourable senator suggesting that these lobbyists called on
senators?
Hon. Mr. Croil: I did flot suggest that.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: You did not suggest it;
you actually said it.
Hon. Mr. Croli: I said that the lobbyists
were here; I did flot say they called on anybody.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Then what were they here
for?
Hon. Mr. Croli: I said they were crawling
in the corridors-perhaps taking exercise.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I neyer saw one.

Hon. Mr. Croli: As I have already stated,
if you do not know what you are looking for,
you cannot find it.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: How do you know who
they were?
Hon. Mr. Croli: I know them.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Describe them.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I do flot wish to describe
them.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I received fifty letters
in favour of the bill hast year, and nobody
ever approached me personally.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I got letters frorn people in
British Columbia who were trying to high
pressure usHon. Mr. Croli: I arn coming to that in a
moment.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I think there was an
excellent lobby for the bill.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: I was lobbied by the
fifty letters I received.
Hon. Mr. Croli: That is the mistake you
make, when you talk about a lobby for the
bill. I have just read a definition of "lobby".
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is flot an ahl-indlusive definition.

Hon. Mr. Buchanan: It is propaganda.
Hon. Mr. Croll: No, it is representation.
You ought to be happy if the consumers,
farmers or labour write and ask you to do
something about a matter. That is a representation made to you in the best democratie
fash ion.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: That is propaganda.
Hon. Mr. Croli: By whom?
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: By you.
Hon. Mr. Croli: The only propaganda I
have been responsible for was in this house.
With the exception of a speech I delivered
in Winnipeg, I have not spoken once on this
subi ect outside this house.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Do you mean to say a
group cannot lobby?
Hon. Mr. Croil: No, a public group cannot.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Have you ever heard of
the farmers' lobby un Washington?
Hon. Mr. Croli: That happens to be a
special interest group.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Do you mean to say they
cannot conduct a lobby?

Hon. Mr. Croll: Yes, but there is a difference between a lobby and representation.
Hon. Mr. Monelie:

Would that not be a

special interest group, when they appeared
here to speak? Do you not cali them lobbyists when they are a special interest group?
Hon. Mr. Reid: They are lobbyists, whether

they are for or against the bill. When I get
letters from British Columbia, to me that is
lobbying.
The Hon. the Speaker: One question at a
time, please.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I have always thought that
one of the things a member of Parliament,
whether sitting in this or the other place,
appreciaýtes and encourages is contact with his
constituents, because he likes to know how they
feel about matters. When the terni "lobby"
is applied to a consumers' association, a labour
organization or the Canadian Welfare Council,
it is improperly applied because they are not
special interest groups. They a-ppear in the
public interest; that is the difference.
Hon. Mr. Moneiie: And is there no special
interest in this whole aiffair?

Hon. Mr. Croll: When you use the word
Hon. Mr. Croli: There cannot be a special
"lobby" in describing a public body you are interest exhibited by these people. They
misusing the word.
have no axe to, grind, but they are prepared
to share the benefits with everybody.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: On your definition onhy.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: If the finance companies
Hon. Mr. Croil: A lobby is a special interapprove the bill as a group, is that a lobby?
est group.

APRIL 3. 1962
Hon. Mr. Croil: They have a speclal lnterest
-in
making as much money as tbey can.
Since when have they been a public body?
What interest do they serve but their own?
Hon. Mr. Bauffard: Have flot; they the right
to make their own representations?
Hon. Mr. Croll: Yes, they have the right to
make their own representations, but when
they make those representations, recognize
tbem for what they are, a special interest.
That is the difference: one is a public interest,
and the other a special interest, and we are
flot here to serve special interests. I arn asking
this house to distinguish between them.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: It is only a figment of
the honourable senator's imagination that
there was lobbying in this house. No one is
interested in lobbying, and I do flot think it
is right or proper for the bonourable senator
to pass that remark. I was not asked about
the bill and I could find no senator who was.
How does the honourable senator know that
this lobbying occurred, if it did? Did he see
the lobbyists, and how did he know that
they were here in such numbers?
Hon. Mr. Croil: The honourable senator will
forgive me if I do flot give names. It might
embarrass him.
Hon. Mr., Dupuis: May I ask, Mr. Speaker,
that the honourable senator from TorontoSpadina (Hon. Mr. Croll) be allowed to
proceed?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: He does flot need any
help on that point.
Hon. Mr. Croli: In the light of some of the
things I have said, it is time the tables were
turned. It is time that the principle of
caveat emptor, "let the buyer beware", is outmoded; it is socially destructive in the light
of the present day. It should be changed to
caveat venditor, "let the seller beware",
I do flot think it is possible, in the light of
this whole debate, for honourable senators
to say that there is no grievance to be remedied, no evil to be avoided and no action
necessary. This bull, or one very similar to it,
is as inevitable as tomorrow. I would like to
see this house pass it. Almost everyone agrees
that it is a good idea; some say that it should
be done another way but they do not say
what the other way is.
Hion. Mr. Pouliot: Hear, hear.
lion. Mr. Croil: It is hard for me ta corne
to the conclusion that we are unable to solve
this problem. Most of us are able finally to
answer the questions on the icorne tax form.
Han. Mr. Bruni: It is very simple, compared to this bull.
Hon. Mr. Croil: It is pretty bard to imagine

that the country across the way, which has
been able to send a man into orbit and is
aiming at the moon, would not be able to
solve a matter of matbematics.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: They have not been able
to do it yet.
Hon. Mr. Croli: Their president says they
can, and I would take bis word against that
of the honourable senator. I would take also
the word of the professor against bis. In fact,
I would be prepared to take almost anybody's
word against that of the bonourable senator.
The Opposition bas narrowed down now to
saying: "This is a mathematical quagmire;
the calculations are impossible".
Who bas been doing ail tbe calculations
from time immemorial? Businessmen bave
been making calculations for hundreds of
years.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: WThy did tbe bonourable
senator not put tbe calculations in tbe bull?
Hon. Mr. Croil: The calculations will be
put in by the responsible people.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: In my speech I put
four questions as to tbe impossibility of the
calculation. Could tbe bonourable senator
give an answer to any one of tbe four?
Hon. Mr. Croil: I fear tbat putting questions
to me on matters involving finance is not
very rewarding, as I arn not; good at figures.
In tbat respect I share witb some other people
some of these incapabîhities. 0f course, the
answers will be given in committee by campetent people.
However, I would like to point out that tbe
Earl of Birkenhead, in The Officiai Life of
Professor F. A. Lindemann, Viscount Cherwell, points out that during the war Lindemann was one of Cburcbill's closest advisers.
Birkenhead explained that Lindemann's ability to tbink matbematically greatly simplified
Cburcbill's wartime tasks, tbe Prime Minister
baving no head for figures.
In tbat respect, most of us share that incapacity. As I bave said, tbe answers will be
given in committee by competent people. I
tbink tbe answer wbicb Professor Stanton
gave, and whicb I read, was a pretty complete
answer that this is not a quagmire, as bas
been suggested.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: wrn be corne before
tbe committee?
Han. Mr. Croli: We will see about that in
good time. There are other people who bave
opinions on tbis and wbo may sbare this view
rather than some of tbe views expressed here
by persans wbo know less about mnatbematics
tban these people.
I thinx tbat legisiation in tbe form I
bave suggested must corne to an aroused

SENATE
society whose conscience and whose pockets
have been seared by an injustice which has
continued for a long time. The time bas come
to toll the bell to mark the end of this
economic cancer which we can tolerate no
longer.
I realize that there are other questions
which need to be answered. They will be
answered in due course. We should not speculate on what will happen to this bill when
it gets to the other place. Let us get it there.
Then we can see what happens.
I have answered as many questions as possible, and I would ask honourable senators
to forgive me if I have omitted to answer
some.
I ask this house to endorse this bill, and
I shall then propose that it be sent to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. White: The honourable senator
has read into the record again the opinion
given by the former Deputy Minister of
Justice. If my memory is correct, when the
first bill was before the Senate, it went to
the committee and at a meeting of the committee Mr. Varcoe gave an opinion that that
first bill which the honourable senator introduced was unconstitutional. Is that not
correct?
Hon. Mr. Croll: At that time, yes, but for
certain reasons. The honourable senator has
not stated the matter fully. He should remember what Mr. Varcoe said, that it was
unconstitutional because of the preamble,
not because of the contents of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Monette: May I as politely as
I can, and with all due respect to the honourable senator, ask a question? Has he read
and studied the decision of the Privy Council
upon the reference re the Natural Products
Marketing Act which came before the courts
in 1936 or 1937?
That act was passed by the federal Parliament to govern the preparation, sale, and
disposition of Canadian products in the provinces. Naturally, it was felt that this was
of provincial importance. The act, however,
provided that any violation of its provisions
was a criminal offence. There was no doubt
that jurisdiction as to criminal offences belonged to the federal Parliament. Why was
that provision put in the act? The act dealt
with matters of trade within the provinces.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is the honourable senator making a speech, or asking a question?
Hon. Mr. Monette: I want to ask a question.
If I am out of order, His Honour will
rule on it.

The Hon. the Speaker: The question seems
to be rather extensive. The honourable senator may ask a question in order to obtain
information, but he seems now to be imparting information to honourable senators. I
ask the honourable senator to put his
question.
Hon. Mr. Monette: I am making some remarks preliminary to my question.
The Hon. the Speaker: Are the remarks
being made so that we may better understand the question? It is a preamble to the
question?
Hon. Mr. Monette: It is difficult for me
to put my question intelligently without making a few preliminary remarks. I wish to
state what is behind my question.
The Privy Council had decided that the
matter of criminal law was within federal
jurisdiction in another case, but the question
before it with respect to this particular act
was whether the element of criminality, thus
giving jurisdiction to the federal Government, was put in the bill genuinely, or to
colour other parts of the bill which were
decidely within provincial jurisdiction? That
question was raised, and it was decided thatThe Hon. the Speaker: I am sorry, but I
shall have to rule that the honourable senator
is not asking a question, but is making additional remarks.
I warned honourable senators that if the
honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina
(Hon. Mr. Croll) spoke again in this debate,
his speech would have the effect of closing
it.
Hon. Mr. Monette: I will put my question
immediately.
The Hon. the Speaker: If the question is not
put immediately I shall have to rule the
honourable senator out of order.
Hon. Mr. Monette: Did the honourable
senator (Hon. Mr. Croll) know that the case
to which I have referred decided that a
matter may by itself be within federal jurisdiction if its main object bas criminal importance, but if that provision is placed in
the bill to colour something which is not
within federal jurisdiction, then the criminal
enactment in the bill is not constitutional?
Can the honourable senator tell me
whether this bill is designed to determine
only the interest, which is the amount that
the lender exacts for lending his money, or
whether it is intended to colour the charges
which are not interest but which the borrower has to pay? That is my question. It is
my hope that when the bill is before the
committee the honourable senator will be
able to answer my question, if be cannot do
so tonight.

APRIL 3. 1962
Han. Mr. Crofl: The only answer I can give
at the moment is that there is nothing colourable in this bill. I considered that aspect
when I presented it.
Hon. Mr. Monette: There is nothing in it
to be coloured?
Hon. Mr. Crofl: Nothing at ail.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: I should like ta ask the
honourable senator a question. Why did he
flot include the discount finance companies,
referred ta by the honourable senatar from
Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt), in this bill?
Hon. Mr. Croli: Is the question, why does
the bill not caver those finance campanies?
Hon. Mr. Higgins: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Crali: They are cavered if they
came within the definitian.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: The honourable senator
from Hanaver said that they were separate
organizations and were acting really as agents
for the department stores. Ordinarily the arrangement operates s0 that two parties are
involved, namely, the department store and
the consumer, whereas, when the finance
company is joined, three parties are involved,
namely, the finance company, the department
store and the consumer. In the first place
the consumer goes ta the department store,
which has the contract executed by the consumer, who then is given the goods. In the
latter case the cantract is drawn Up by the
finance company and the money is given by
the finance company ta the consumer who
then buys the goods from. the departmient
store. Should not the consumer be protected
in that sort of transaction?
Hon. Mr. Croil: I could not agree with
yau mare. I would point out that even before
this bill goes to the cammittee, people are
trying ta think af ways of getting around
its provisions. That is one way of getting
araund themn. If the honourable senator

would move an amendment ta the bill ta
prevent such a thing I shahl be delighted
ta support it.
Hou. Mr. Higgins: I arn not a member of
the Standing Committee an Banking and
Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Croli: I invite the honourable
senator ta attend the meeting, in any event.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: The provisions of this
bill will be bypassed unless an amendment
is made.
Hon. Mr. Croil: What Senator Brunt said
is disturbing but it should not frighten anybody, because 99 per cent of the consumer
finance business of this country is done in a
fashion other than that mentioned in the
article from which he read. Senator Brunt
read fromn an article which also appeared,
if I am not mistaken, in the Financial Post
with respect ta some method that may be
used ta avoid the purpose of the bill. However, the amount of business transacted in
that fashion wauld be infinitesimal when
compared with the whole consumer credit
business of the country.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by the
Honourable Senator Croli, seconded by the
Honourable Senator Roebuck, that this bill
be now read a second time. Is it your pleasuire, honourable senatars, ta adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: On division.

TOURIST TRAFFIC
AUTHORITY TO PRINT COMMITTEE
PROCEEDINGS

Hon. R. B. Horner, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Tourist Traffic, presented
the following report of the committee.
Your committee recommend that authority be granted for the printing of 800
copies in English and 200 copies in French
of their proceedings.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this report be considered?
Hon. Mr. Horner: With leave, I move that
the report be adopted now.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, the report of the Tourist Traffic
Committee recommends that authority be
granted for the printing of its proceedings
in English and in French. I am wondering

what took place at the meeting. Perhaps if
the chairman of the committee would tell
us something of what took place we would
be better able to decide whether the record
of the proceedings should be printed.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators, as
chairman of the Tourist Traffic Committee,
may I just say that at the meeting this
morning, the honourable senator from Halifax
North (Hon. Mr. Connolly) made a good
suggestion. Perhaps he would say a few
words to the house now along the lines of
his suggestion.
Hon. Harold Connolly: Honourable senators, the committee met this morning under
the able chairman, the senator from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner).
The Director of the Canadian Government
Travel Bureau and several of his assistants
were heard, and a lengthy discussion ensued.
The committee was well supplied with charts,
pictures and pamphlets illustrating tourist
activities in Canada. If I may presume to
speak for the members of the committee,
I think it was generally felt that the Canadian Travel Bureau is doing a first-class
job.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Halifax North): The
suggestion to which the honourable chairman, (Hon. Mr. Horner) referred as having
come from me was briefly that various governments have treated the Canadian Government Travel Bureau as a sort of orphan
child, being moved from one foster home
to another.
In my judgment, that treatment operates
against the efficiency of the men who direct
the activities of the bureau, because they
never quite know where they are.
At the moment the travel bureau is under
the direction of the Department of Northern
Affairs and National Resources. Without being
facetious, and certainly without any thought
of attaching blame to anyone, may I suggest that of all the departments of government that is the one most unlikely to have
the travel bureau under its jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): What
about Arizona Charlie's?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: What about National
Revenue?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Halifax North): It
seems to me that the bureau has now moved
from the home hearth into the outer wilderness, and I submit now as I did this morning, that it could probably function most
efficiently under the Department of Trade
and Commerce, which is concerned with
bringing dollars into this country and generally directing the economy. Since the tourist

APRIL 4, 1962
bureau attracts a great many dollars to this
country, I think it is a natural ally of the
Department of Trade and Commerce and
should be incorporated within the framework
of that department.
Honourable senators, I am quite surprised
to be called on in this fashion, but I defer to
the friendship of the chairman for the opportunity to say these things. Since 1934
this department which now directs the tourist
bureau has graduated or, in the reverse
sense, bas deteriorated from the Department
of Railways and Canals to the Department
of Transport, to National War Resources, to
Trade and Commerce, to Reconstruction and
Supply, and finally to Northern Affairs and
National Resources.
I suggest to this chamber, as I suggested
to the committee this morning, that the direction of tourist traffic is far too important
a function to be switched around from foster
home to foster home, that it should finally be
brought back into the bosom of the family
and attached to the department where it can
operate with greatest efficiency.
Motion agreed to.
MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE
INQUIRY AS TO ANY REQUESTS OR REPRESENTATIONS FOR AMENDMENT OF
BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT WITH
REFERENCE TO LEGISLATIVE
JURISDICTION RE MARRIAGE
AND DIVORCE
On the notice by Hon. Mr. Pouliot:
That he will inquire of the Government:
Referring (a) to the first seven words
of section 129 of the B.N.A. Act, 1867,
about the continuance of pre-Confederation existing Laws, Courts, Officers, etc.,
namely, "Except as otherwise provided by
this Act",
-(b)
to "the exclusive legislative
authority of the Parliament of Canada"
extending to marriage and divorce in
virtue of subsection (26) of section 91 of
the said act, with the exception of the
exclusive powers of Provincial Legislatures to make laws "for the solemnization of marriage", in virtue of subsection
(12) of section 92 of the said act, and
-(c)
the interpretation of the said law
by the Supreme Court of Canada and
the Privy Council on appeal from the
Supreme Court of Canada in the matter
of a reference to the Supreme Court of
Canada of certain questions concerning
marriage, (1912 A.C., p. 880)1. Did the Government receive any
formal request from any province or any
specific representation from any one to
the effect that the B.N.A. Act, 1867,

should be amended by repealing subsection (26) of section 91 of the said act?
2. If so, from whom and when?
3. In view of the Statutes of Canada:
45 V., (1882), c. 42;
53 V., (1890), c. 36;
13-14 Geo. V, (1923) c. 19;
22-23 Geo. V, (1932) c. 10;
and the Revised Statutes of Canada:
c. 105 of 1906;
c. 127 of 1927: and
c. 176 of 1952, the latter being intituled "An Act respecting Marriage
and Divorce",
did the Government of Canada receive
any specific representation or any formal
request from anyone to the effect that the
Parliament of Canada, in virtue of the
exclusive legislative authority conferred
upon itself by subsection (26) of section
91 of the B.N.A. Act, should repeal article
1301 of the Civil Code of the Province of
Quebec and the second paragraphs of
articles 1265 and 1422 of the said Code,
and amend articles 179 and 180 of the said
Code concerning the rights of married
women in the Province of Quebec?
4. If so, from whom and when?
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, may I inquire of the leader (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) as to when I may expect an
answer to my question on the Order Paper?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I am not sure. I have
followed It up day by day but the Minister
of Justice is very busy with legislation of
one kind and another and has not had time
to give me the answer. I want the honourable
senator to know that I have not forgotten
the matter and that I shall provide the answer
at the earliest possible moment.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I thank the honourable
gentleman and, as I have always done, I continue to put my faith in him.

is "supreme court"?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: In Ontario it is known as
JUDGES ACT
the Supreme Court of Ontario.
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING
Hon. William R. Bruni moved the second
reading of Bill C-84, to amend the Judges
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, once again
I have the honour and pleasure of introducing
in this chamber a bill to amend the Judges
Act, known in this instance as Bill C-84. I
believe that similar bills have been introduced
in this chamber for many years. Usually
amendments to the Judges Act deal with the
simple matter of appointing additional judges
for one or more of the provinces and to
provide for the payment of the salaries of
the additional appointees. This particular bill
makes such a provision with respect to the
province of Ontario, and in addition it provides for the naming of one of the district
or county court judges to the position of
chief judge of the county and district courts
in and for the province of Ontario. In other
words, it creates a new title for one of the
district or county court judges.
I am sure that all honourable senators are
aware that by section 92(14) of the British
North America Act the provinces have jurisdiction over the constitution of the courts
within their boundaries. By section 96 of that
act provision is made for the appointment by
the federal Government of judges of the
superior, district and county courts in each
province. Finally, by section 100 of that act
the federal Government is charged with the
payment of salaries, allowances and pensions
of all judges.
The province of Ontario has passed the
necessary legislation which provides for the
appointment of certain additional judges to
both the high court and the county and district courts. The amendments which are proposed by this bill are required in order to
give effect to these new appointments.
If honourable senators will look at the bill
in question they will note by clause 1 that
provision is made for twenty-two other judges
of the high court at an annual salary of
$16,900 each. By the Judges Act "other judges
of the high court" are defined to be trial
court judges, so that this particular section
provides for the appointment of two additional trial court judges for the Supreme
Court of Ontario. At the present time there
are twenty judges, and this bill provides for
twenty-two.

Hon. Mr. Croll: It is the term used in the
act.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: It may well be. In the
province of Quebec it is known as the superior
court; in Ontario it is the supreme court; and
in the western provinces I think it is called
Ithe Queen's Bench. I think "high court" is
the term used in the original Judges Act and
that wording is incorporated into this bill.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Does this bill provide for
any increase in salary?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No, it remains exactly the
same. No salary increase is provided in this
bill for any judge.
At the present time there are seventy-two
county and district judges and junior judges
in the province of Ontario, who receive an
annual salary of $10,500 each. By clause 2
of this bill the number is increased to seventynine by the appointment of seven additional
judges, each of whom will receive the salary
specified in the bill.
In addition, honourable senators will note
that under clause 2, one of such judges shall
be known as the Chief Judge. Whoever is
designated will be known as the Chief Judge
of the County and District Courts in and for
the province of Ontario.
I understand that the province of Alberta
has a similar system, except that there are
two chief judges there, one being the Chief
Judge of the northern district and the other
being the Chief Judge of the southern district.
The Chief Judge can be chosen from among
the present judges or from among the new
appointees. There is no restriction in any way
as to his being chosen from either one group
or the other.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Will he get a higher salary?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes. The Chief Judge under the Ontario Act is entitled to an allowance
at the rate of $5,000 per annum, payable by
the province.
Hon. Mr. Power: That is, the province of
Ontario?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is right. I might add
that all of the county and district court judges
who will be appointed as a result of this bill
being passed will be known as judges at large.

APRIL 4. 19B2
1 understand that none of them will be named
in and for any specific county or district.
Hon. Baller A. Hayden: Honourable senators, this bill gives me an opportunity to say
a few words ini relation to the changes which
have been taking place in the province of
Ontario in the constitution and operation of
our county court system.
We have been wedded for a 11fetime-I
might say for the lifetime of many peopleto a system under which we have so many
designated counties, each with a county court
judge, and certain districts, each with a
district judge. In each case, whether there
was a lot of work or very littie work, at least
one judge was appointed. Over the years, as
business and population concentrated in the
larger areas, the net result was to put great
stress on the administration of justice in the
county court in centres such as Toronto,
Ottawa, Hamilton, Windsor and Sudbury. On
the other hand, there were other areas in
Ontario where judges had difficulty keeping
themselves busy.
In later years the practice has developed
of inviting judges in certain areas where
there is littie county court business to work
in one of the larger centres for two or three
months, thus relieving to some extent the
judges there of the work, the onus and the
responsibility, and also increasing: efficiency
in the administration of justice.
A few years ago some recognition was
given to these problems, and with respect to
Ontario there was a succession of amending
bills to the County Court Judges Act. Under
our system, as mentioned by the honourable
sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr. Brunt), the
province constitutes the court in the sense
of the number of judges to function in a particular court, and the federal authority provides the salary.
Clause 1 of this bull speaks of twenty-two
other judges of the high court, or the Supreme
Court of Ontario, but it is actually providing
for an increase of two in the number of such
judges presently appointed ini Ontario. Therefore the total amount of salary provided by
this bull is twice $16,900.
In like fashion clause 2 of the bill speaks
of one chief judge and seventy-eight; judges
and junior judges of the county and district
courts, while it actually provides money to
pay the salaries of seven additional judges.
To the extent that this measure will relieve
the burden in the more populous areas of
Ontario, these increases certainly are justified., The idea behind this bill with respect
to the setting up of what mlght be called
roving judges or judges on circuit is an
excellent one, because the chief judge, whose
position is a new one in Ontario, will be
able to assign judges, who. have not been

appointed to specific county or district courts,
to various places where the pressure of work
is great.
The Attorney General for Ontario, when
he was explaining the bill to amend the
County Court Judges Act and the County
Court Act, said that of the six new judges,
other than the chief judge, for whose salaries
we are now providing money, two will be
assigned to Ottawa because of the pressure
of work here, two will be assigned to Toronto,
and the remnaining two will go to a number
of places where they are needed. They will
go on this circuit within the county court
system. In addition, the plan envisages the
chief judge being the director or the administrator of the judicial force ini the county
courts. He will be able to request a judge in,
say, the Manitoulin Island area, where there
is little work to be done, to go to Toronto,
for instance, for two or three months. When
a county court judge is assigned to a particular county or district hie cannot be
assigned anywhere else without his consent,
but the procedure I have mentioned of inviting a judge to another centre has been going
on for years.
Judges are anxious and willing to move
into areas where they can exercise their
talents and where they f eel they are accomplishing something; therefore, in my view
this scheme that is envisaged, and this bull
for the provision of moneys to pay the
salaries of six additional judges and junior
judges, is to be commended. Last year I
think we received a request for the appointment of two judges, and the year before
a request for the appointment of six judges,
of this roving nature, but they are judges
of the county and district courts and are
assigned to particular territories.
In principle the plan is a good plan,
and 1 do not want to be critical of it. I
would rather use this occasion to make some
suggestions. In my view there is no reason
why we should remain wedded to the basic
county court system. We are moving away
from it in many directions. For instance,
the Ontario Legislature is increasing the
jurisdiction of the county court, and that fact
by itself is a justification for the appointment of more judges. Generally speaking,
the jurisdiction of the county and district
courts has been at least doubled and in many
cases more than doubled.
As an illustration I would point out that
until very recently the county and district
courts of Ontario had jurisdiction in actions
arising out of contract only where the sum
claimed did not exceed $1,200. Under the
legisîstion that has now been given royal
assent in Ontario-I am referring now to
Bill 61, to amend the County Courts Actthat jurisdiction is increased to $3,000. In

SENATE
personal actions, except actions for criminal
conversation and actions for libel, the jurisdiction was $1,000, and that has been increased to $3,000. So we go on down the
line finding substantial dollar increases
which raise or extend the jurisdiction of the
county and district courts.
There is a provision that has been in our
County Courts Act for many years to the
effect that an action for personal damages
may be brought in the county court for
sums of money very much in excess of the
jurisdiction of the court. The defendant has
the right to challenge that, in which event
the case must go to the supreme court.
However, if the defendant does not challenge
it the question of jurisdiction cannot thereafter be raised, and the case can be tried
in the ordinary way in the county court.
That occurs very frequently. People, for a
variety of reasons, bring their actions in the
county court even though the dollar amount
of the damages claimed is in excess of the
limit of the jurisdiction of that court, and
many such actions are tried by that court.
The county court is charged with the administration of law in Ontario, and its jurisdiction is being extended. The appointment
of more judges will enable that court to do its
work more efficiently and reduce the backlog
of work that exists in many of the larger
centres. The amount of work that a county
court judge is called upon to do is considerable.
Having said what I have, and having commended the province of Ontario for taking
this course, I would like to say that there is
still opportunity for further improvement if
we get ourselves away from the method of
assigning judges to a county where there is
very little work to do. It may be that the
method to be followed there would be to
group these counties together and thus reduce
the number of appointments or, possibly, establish a circuit in relation to those areas
where a judge, instead of being resident in
one locality, could move around the circuit.
The number of judges required could thereby
be reduced. It is possible that for the same
expenditure of money we could provide ourselves with a very efficient judicial force in
the county courts.
So far as the Supreme Court of Ontario is
concerned, while it appears that we are appointing two additional judges-which is true,
because there are at present twenty appointed-we are actually appointing only one
additional judge. At present there are only
nineteen working because one has been given
leave of absence to accept an appointment in
Cyprus. It is an honour to Canada that a
Canadian judge has been invited to participate

as a member of the highest court of that
country for a tern of, I think, five years.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I think it is six years.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: In Ontario we will have
a working staff of twenty-one supreme court
judges until this judge returns from Cyprus.
Supreme court judges are certainly called
upon to do a tremendous volume of work,
more than even twenty-one judges can do
without leaving a backlog from time to time,
and the volume of work is increasing.
This brings me to the question of judges'
salaries, and the fact we are not increasing
them. The present annual rate is $16,900 for
supreme court judges and $10,500 for county
court judges. Those have been the salary
rates since 1955. When we increased the
salaries of supreme court judges from $14,400
to $16,900 in 1955 we were, for the moment,
being penurious because we provided that
the judges' pensions would be based upon
the salaries they were then receiving and
would not reflect their increased salaries; in
other words, their pensions were and still
are based upon an annual income of $14,400
and not $16,900.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: That is not so now.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No; that situation has been
corrected.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: When?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Last year.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Then, I stand corrected.
In any event, a salary of $16,900 is totally
inadequate.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Do judges receive expense
allowances in addition to their salaries?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, when a circuit
judge travels from Toronto, which is his place
of residence, to Sudbury, Windsor, or whereever it may be. He is subject, however, to a
prohibition in the Judges Act to this effect:
He may not undertake any extra-judicial employment; he must devote himself exclusively
to judicial duties; he must not engage in any
business or occupation other than his judicial
duties, and he must not be paid any extra
remuneration. When it comes to accepting
outside appointments on a board of arbitration or some other bodyHon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): A commission.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: -or a commission, he
must receive permission from the Governor
in Council. If the Governor in Council, or the
Lieutenant Governor in Council of a province,
nominates a judge to serve on a commission
or a board of arbitration, and he accepts the

APRIL 4. 1982
nomination, he is not entitled to remuneration as such, only to travelling expenses
and what is called, under the statute, a living allowance. If you have had any experlence
with this type of living allowance you will
understand that no person can accuniulate
money from it. As a matter of fact, I would
think that in most cases a judge would spend
more money than he would receive by way
of expenses and living allowances.
Hon. Mr. Hîggins: Until last year a judge
received a living allowance of $12 or $15 per
day in a large community and $10 in a
smaller one. These regulations were changed
last year, and he now puts in for his actual
expenses. When a judge is appointed to a
board of arbitration does he now put in for
his actual out-of-pocket expenses or is there
a set allowance?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I would be guessing if
I were to try to answer my honourable
friend's question, for I have not looked it Up.
What I have said refiects what has been reported to me by those who have engaged in
such activities, and I have no reason to disbelieve what I have heard, that the living
allowances plus the travelling expenses are
flot intended to be ini any sense extra remuneration.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. H-ayden: These allowances are flot
meant as remuneration in the sense of a
salary or payment for services but are intended to keep the judge from being out of
pocket. Let us put it that way.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: Well, up until a year ago
the judge was out of pocket when performing
those duties.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes. It is a matter of
degree. Let us put it this way: if he is now
out of pocket, then he was more out of pocket
previous to a year ago.

Hlon. Mr. Hayden: No; I don't want to be
negative. There are so many persons here
from places other than Toronto, I must not
at any time be negative. That would be a
horrible suggestion, to be negative and say
that y.ou are not any worse off. I would say
that a judge would be better off if he stayed
in Toronto and presided there.
I arn satisfied from the judges I know ini
various parts of Canada that by and large we
have in Ontario an exceptional bench as to
quality, integrity, devotion to duty and recognition of the traditions of judges. Yet we ask
them to perform their duties for $16,900, less
incomne tax, which every person must pay,
and at the same time we ask them to maintain
the standard that their position demnands.
There is a standard which a supreme court
judge in Ontario, or anywhere else in Canada,
must maintain so as to uphold the dignity
o! the court and the administration o! justice.
I say that, in relation to the times, we are
entirely out of focus when we talk in terms
of a salary of $16,900 for a supreme court
judge. The answer may be, "Well, they don't
have to accept the position". Ail I can say
is that we can be extremely grateful 50 many
men who were good lawyers and outstanding
men in their profession have been prepared
to accept the cail to public service and go on
the bench.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Could
the honourable senator tell us the salary now
paid to county court judges in Ontario?

Hon. Mr. Hayden: A county court judge
receives a salary of $10,500. The senior county
court judge for the county of York receives
$2,500 a year in lieu of judge's fees provided
under all the acts of the Legislature o! Ontario. The other county court judges receive
$1,500 in lieu of these fees-at least they
did Up until a year ago-and they get a percentage of the surrogate court fees.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I thought they received
Han. Mr. Bruni: But because of the amendments made last year he is no longer out o! a lump sum now.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: You will notice I said

until a year ago. In lieu of that change they
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It depends on how you may get a lump sum now. Certainly the
analyse it. As a judge I would have certain county court judges who are being appointed
living expenses in Toronto regardless of any "6at large"ý-by which expression I mean that
living expenses I would have while in Ottawa, they are flot attached to any particular county,
Windsor or Sudbury, but the only expenses and therefore not attached to a surrogate
I could charge under the regulations would be court in a county-receive a lump sum. By
those incurred in the place in which I amn virtue of an amendment this session to the
performing my duties as a judge.
Ontario statute, they get $2,000 a year. The
average county court judge, therefore, might

earn something o! the order of $13,500 or
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, outside of Toronto. $14,000, and the supreme court judge would
If I stayed in Toronto I might be better off. get $16,900.
Han. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): You would
Hon. Mr. Higgins: Honourable senators, if
not be any worse off.
you do flot mind the interruption, and since

SENATE
we lawyers are supposed to stand by each
other, I would call to your attention that
newspapers have recently commented on the
fact that some deputy ministers receive far
higher salaries than supreme court judges.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I intended to make that
point, but since my friend bas done so I do
not need to. However, if we study the scale
of earnings in business at the level of the
educational and professional qualifications
of our judges, it will be found that the scale
is much higher for business than for judges.
In my view, we have not moved along with
the times. We have been fortunate in finding
men who are prepared to go on the bench,
who are happy in the discharge of their
responsible duties, and who discharge them
not only creditably but with dignity and
good sense. However, at some stage we must
face the situation that there should be a better relationship between the quality of the
men we seek and so far have been able to
get on the bench, and the remuneration we
are willing to provide for them. I say that
because, in my view, to be a judge, to be the
interpreter of laws standing between subjects, and to make a determination of the
rights and liabilities as between the subject
and the Crown, and to define those rights and
liabilities, is one of the most important functions in our system of society. To make
myself clear, those men should be properly
remunerated and put in the position that they
can apply themselves to the work they have
to perform with dignity, integrity and respect
for the law, and be able to maintain themselves and enjoy a mode of living consonant
with the dignity of their position. I do not
want it to be said that I have suggested
that judges are not doing that now, for indeed they are. I am only saying that it is
unfair that we should continue the disparity
existing between what we require of and
demand from them, and what we are paying
them now.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, I am one of the senior members
of the bar of the province of Ontario, a fact
I am not boasting about, because members
of the bar become seniors with the inexorable
march of time, and that is true for me.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): May I
remind the honourable senator that he is also
a Bencher?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thank you. Not only am
I one of the senior members of the bar of
Ontario, but I am also a Bencher of the
Law Society of Upper Canada. So perhaps
something is expected of me at this moment.
It is also a cause to which I would like to
contribute.

I feel the increase in the number of judges
is justified. I have joined many times in asking that the number be increased because the
work load had become greater. I think the
idea of the itinerant judge, or to quote the
appellation we now use, "at large", is thoroughly justified. When I became Attorney
General of Ontario we had the local magistrate
at that time, and he was paid by fees, in part
at least. One of the very first things I did
when I came to office was to order the
abolition of the fee system, dispensing with
the local magistrate, and the appointment
of the itinerant magistrate, so that when a
magistrate came to town from an outside
point, he was not prejudiced by prior knowledge of the cases to be tried. I think the
same principle applies to county court judges.
That is all in the nature of progress, honourable senators.
The question I wish to raise now is that
of remuneration. I join very heartily with the
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
in saying that the remuneration of our judges
-I
refer particularly to our county court
judges, although I include supreme court
judges-is totally inadequate.
The senator from Toronto has spoken about
the increase in the jurisdiction of the judges,
that their work has become more responsible
and has grown very greatly in recent years.
This is in keeping with the automobile age
but, unfortunately, in the matter of remuneration of the judges, we are in the horse
and buggy age. A salary of $10,500, even with
the supplement that the provinces contribute,
is quite inadequate. The provinces made that
contribution in my time in the Ontario Legislature. The provinces wanted to be "part boss",
as it were. "He who pays the piper can call
the tune", you know.
I join with the senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) in his remarks with regard to
the importance of the work of the judges.
Holding the balance fair as between individual and individual, and as between individual and the Crown, is most responsible
work. As I read not long ago, abolish that
justice and you might as well abolish everything.
Honourable senators who saw the front page
of the Toronto Globe and Mail this morning
no doubt read the statement with regard to
the remuneration of members of Congress in
the United States. There is a certain analogy
between the remuneration of senators and
that of judges. Both senators and members of
the Commons are inadequately paid. It is because of that analogy that I mention the
statement in the morning press, that a member of the House of Representatives in the

APRIL 4, 1962
United States is paid $22,000 a year. We get
$10,000. They get a $3,000 allowance for living
in Washington.
Hon. Mr. Hnatyshyn: We get $8,000 on that
basis.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think we thoroughly
earn $3,000 for living in Ottawa-that is the
way a person from Toronto feels about it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): We are
not all from Toronto.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is true. Except for
those who live here, other people probably
will feel the same way about it.
Then, the Congressman gets $20,500 for
office help, $600 a year to maintain an office
in his home district, and $400 a year above
his ordinary franking privilege for air mail
and special deliveries, telegrams and telephone messages. So it adds up to a very considerable sum. I do not say that we should
follow slavishly the pattern of pay to members of Congress across the international
boundary, but it is an interesting comparison.
I am sure that United States judges are paid
far more than ours.
Now, I hesitate to urge further spending by
this spending Government, and I am not
going to go into small criticisms or appear
to be captious about it today, but I do think
there are many things that could be reduced
in cost. Without going into details which may
be offensive to members on the other side of
the house, there are many places where we
could cut down a little in order to pay
adequately for what is genuine maintenance
of our economic system.
I have here, honourable senators, some correspondence which I think you will find
interesting. One of the very vigorous members
of the bench of Ontario is Judge J. M. Cooper
of Sudbury. He is the President of the Ontario
County and District Court Judges' Association
and so he speaks in his official capacity.
I would like to quote some of what he bas
said. For instance, he says that the county
court judge is more of a target in his community for subscriptions, and that be is
obliged to keep up a standard of living that
is not required of the high court judges in
the city.
Now, that may be very true. These judges
are leading citizens in the locality in which
they live; they take part in all public proceedings of a highly creditable character, such as
welfare, good business, good citizenship. You
usually find the local judge taking an active
part in all of these, and to do so costs money
as well as effort.
Judge Cooper tells of efforts made by the
association to induce the Government to increase judges' salaries. As the honourable
26211-3-29

senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) has
said, they have not been advanced since 1955.
And we all know that there have been vast
changes in our community since that time.
Judge Cooper says that the Prime Minister:
... advised us that we had proved our
case beyond a reasonable doubt, that he
was satisfied of the necessity for an
increase.
But somehow it has not been effected. He
continues:
You will note from this reply that a
meeting with the Prime Minister was
held on August 16th last. At this meeting
a brief was presented and I may add it
is quite factual, realistic and convincing.
The Prime Minister apparently expressed
himself that a case on our behalf had
been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
He goes on to say:
At one time a judge was recognized
as a person of prestige in his community
and the Judges' Act provided relative
remuneration for his services sufficient
to justify such recognition. However, the
time has come when every person of any
position in the community is earning
much more money than the judge and
this yardstick may be applied to school
teachers, police magistrates, civil servants
of many categories, insurance agents and
even salaried employees of used car lots,
etc., etc.
The Hon. the Speaker: Does he suggest any
amount?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, Mr. Speaker, not
in this correspondence which I have before
me, but that point I know has been discussed
between the authorities and the judges'
association.
Judge Cooper comments, as has the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden), on the fact that there is no lack of
applicants for these positions. He also says,
if the condition complained of continues, the
position will attract two categories of applicants, firstly, those of independent means
and, secondly, those who have been unable
to successfully compete in legal practice.
That, of course, honourable senators, will be
the consequence in the not far distant future
of paying these men less than we should pay
them.
My honourable friend has suggested that
these judges take part in arbitration proceedings and conciliation boards at expense
to themselves. Well, I have served with
judges a good many times and for many
hours on conciliation boards, over many
years, and that is not my impression. I think
the judge is forced into such positions in

SENATE
order to supplement to some extent his
meagre salary. I know that to be the case.
It is unfortunate that it is so and it is most
unfair. The man who gets extra remuneration of that kind frequently leaves his home
duties to be attended to by another judge
who kindly helps out in the carrying on of his
official duties, or he neglects his work, or it
may be that the work in that particular district is sufficiently moderate to allow him to
accept outside appointments. How unfair
that is to the man who works in a community
where all his time is taken up by his duties.
Just because he has to work hard in his own
locality he is unable to supplement his salary
in the way that others can do who have less
arduous duties.
There have been discussions in recent years
about judges leaving their work to take part
in extramural activities. I think the time has
come, with the growth of judicial work and
the expansion of our economy, when judges
will have to remain at their posts. There is a
proposal now before authorities of the province of Ontario to constitute a panel of men
experienced in negotiations, in conciliation
work and industry, men willing and capable
of filling these positions, to act as chairmen
of conciliation and arbitration boards.
Perhaps it will come to pass before very
long and judges will then be prevented from
participating in industrial disputes. However
that may be, we should not allow that progress to be influenced unduly by the poverty
of the judges whom we appoint and to whom
we entrust important judicial duties.
Judge Cooper refers to the salaries paid to
deputy ministers:
(They) have been raising the salaries
from time to time of the deputy ministers and other civil employees so that
now they range from $18,000 to $21,000
a year. The basic salary of the judges is

$10,500-

Then he says:
... if your judicial system breaks down,
nothing else matters.

That is very true.
The passage I now wish to read is contained in a letter written by a judge, who
shall remain anonymous. He says:
It is with great regret that I must decline your very kind invitation to attend
at Kingston for the opening of the new
Collin's Bay Penitentiary Farm Camp.
This judge had been invited by the federal
authorities to attend that ceremony.
... I had looked forward to the pleasure of meeting you-

That is, the Minister of Justice
-However,
my absence will be due
to two main reasons:
Firstly, my agendaHis agenda would not permit his attendance.
Secondly, it is with hesitation that I
admit to the lack of necessary money to
cover the expense of such a trip. My
family obligations are such that it takes
more than my salary as a judge of the
district court to make ends meet. I have
two dependents at university level and
one who attends secondary school. Over
the twelve years next July, during which
I have been on the bench... I have practically exhausted all the savings I had
made before I was appointed. Further,
I am not favoured with extra judicial
work, such as the very remunerative
and conciliation
arbitrations
labour
boards, and even if I were I could not
find the time to accept because of the
heavy case load in this District, one of
the busiest in this Province, outside of the
City of Toronto.
Now, honourable senators, that state of affairs should not exist. No judge should
be required to talk like that. Notwithstanding
the Government's financial condition, I submit
to the authorities-the Minister of Justice, the
treasury board, and so on-that it is time
we change that situation and paid these men
a proper living salary, one in keeping with
the times in which we live. We must assist
them in maintaining a decent standard of
living in these communities. We have been
forced to do it in other cases, but the judges
are a little like ourselves, very backward
in urging their own financial condition. Indeed, there are many among us-myself excluded-who are living in penury here, in
the city of Ottawa, with two houses to maintain and insufficient monetary reward for the
work we do to pay our necessary expenses.
The judges are in much the same position as
we, and, perhaps, they are even worse off.
We are in authority and can protect ourselves.
They cannot; they are not in a position to
scream aloud about their own financial plight.
It must be left to their friends to take care
of their cause. I think there are enough of
us here who are their friends, who are interested in good government and decent
justice, to see that these men are properly
paid.
Hon. Malcolm Hollet: Honourable senators,
I just want to add a few words to what bas
already been said and put my weight, whether
little or much-and I think it is little at the
moment-behind the two members who have

APRIL 4. 1962
just spoken, the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) and the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck). I wish to congratulate them on
laying before this august body the conditions
in which the judges of our courts find themselves at the present time.
I was neyer a judge, but I was a magistrate
for twenty-five, years, and 1 know what it
entails. Even a magistrate has to take a ieading place in the community, attending rnany
functions, contributing to appeals for charity,
and Sa on, and yet hie cannat earn additional
income. I must say, though, that while I was
a magistrate I once sold sorne life insurance
on the side, enough to earn me about $178
in two weeks. It was soon pointed out to me
that I could either stay on as a magistrate or
seli insurance, but not both. I gave up selling
insurance, although now I think I rnay have
been unwise in doing Sa.
A judge is an individual whom everybody
must respect if freedom and justice, for which
many of our friends and sons gave up their
lives, is to be maintained. If the right type
of man is flot appointed to, the bench we know
that justice will be defeated. The cornmunity
is flot always going to get the right type of
man on the bench, unless it protects him
from the conditions in which judges naw find
themseives, and which were mentioned in
the extracts the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity has just read. We are not
paying our judges a respectable salary.
If we are going to continue our present
system. of justice, which has been and always
wil be fought for, and if we are going to
maintain it at a high level, we must have
judges with a high degree of morality and a
high sense of duty. Therefore, it is up to us
ta see that they are paid sufficient to, keep
them fromn having to state such facts as were
stated in the particular letter which has just
been read by Senator Roebuck.
I do not agree with one of the honaurable
senators who, I think, used the wards, "despite our fInancial. condition". I would say,
"because of our financial condition". We are
spending this year over $6 billion or $7
billion. If we cannot pay our judges sufficient
ta enable them to maintain the dignity which
they must present ta the world, there is
something wrong.
If a motion were put forward naw, from
either side of this house, recommiending ta
the Governiment that an increase be made
in the salaries of judges ta bring them up
ta a just and honest figure, I believe that
every member of this assernbly would vote
f or it. We have nat gat such a motion, but
we can make aur voice heard, sa that it
rnay inspire the members in the ather place
26211-3-29J

ta do their right and proper duty by increasing the salaries of judges.
In that connection, I shauld like ta, refer
alsa ta the salaries paid ta members of the
other place. I can assure honourable senators
that whiie they may not be starving, they
are close ta the line. Every year they spend
seven or eight manths here in Ottawa, they
have ta go back and forth ta their homes,
and they rnust be the top boys in the ridings
they represent.
Han. Mr. Roebuck: May I suggest that we
substitute "we" for "they"?
Hon. Mr. Holleil: I do nat understand
where that goes in the context, but I will do
Sa if the honourable senator sa wishes.
The Hon. the Speaker: It means, including
the senators.
Hon. Mr. Hollei: Very well. Let it go on
the record that the hanaurable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Raebuck) has suggested that we substitute "we" for "they".
In recent tirnes I have talked over the
matter of pay with some members in the
ather place wha were hanest and just. They
tald me their situation with regard ta salary.
Honourable senators, if we are ta expect the
best type of men ta corne from across Canada ta spend seven, eight or more months
here, as the case rnay be, ta maintain a home
also in the place from which they carne, we
rnust be prepared to spend sufficient money ta
allow them ta live decent and respectable
lives, fram the financial. point of view.
If I were permitted-which, of course,
I arn nat-to make a recommendation in
regard ta the members in the other place, I
would suggest that they, too, be given consideration as ta increased remuneratian by
this Governiment and the next which, of
course, wîill be this Government. For example,
I know three judges in Newfaundland, and I
arn quite sure that the amaunt which they are
being paîd does not allaw them ta do that
which we would wish aur judges ta be able

INQUIRY AS TO INSCRIPTION ON

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, as this house seems to be in a happy
disposition, I compliment the Government
for its expeditious answer to the question put
by the honourable senator from Sorel (Hon.
Mrs. Jodoin) concerning an appropriate inscription on the marble statue of the late
Senator Wilson. Some day I might put on
record the inscription which was made according to the instructions of the Prime
Minister.
I have something else to add, which is not
what you would expect me to say. It is that
I distinctly remember that when the late
Honourable Cairine Wilson was appointed
to the Senate she gave some small Australian
pines to the Government of Canada to plant
on both sides of the main stone steps in front
of this building. It was a personal gift to

her country, to show her appreciation of her
appointment to the Senate. No one seems to
remember that gesture, and now that those
pines have grown up I take the liberty of
reminding honourable senators that the memory of the late Senator Wilson is perpetuated
in many different ways in this capital city
of Ottawa for which she has done so much.

ports is scheduled for completion by June 30.

APRIL 5, 1962
I have explained that four votes require
an additional one-sixth of the main estimates.
Vote 40 and Vote 45 have to do with House
of Commons legislation and estimates of the
Sergeant-at-Arms during the session. The
monthly expenditures exceed one-twelfth for
these two items. Vote 125 has to do with the
Canadian Government Travel Bureau. The
bulk of the advertising placed by the bureau
appears in April and May in the magazines
and newspapers. The agencies must pay
promptly for space in order to get cash discounts.
Vote 190 is an appropriation for one-sixth
of $1 million required to complete any projects undertaken in previous fiscal years and
for which no specific provision is made in the
fiscal year 1962-63. By its nature, this vote
is subjected to heavy expenditures during the
early months of the year as projects begun in
previous years are completed.
There is an additional one-twelfth in
Schedule C of three votes. The National Research Council requires this, since a steady
increase in the research awards program in
the early months led to more than usual
requirements during April and May.
Vote 25 bas to do with the taxation division of the Department of National Revenue.
April and May constitute the peak period of
operations from this vote, as the bulk of the
seasonal staff is employed during that lime.
Vote 20 has to do with general administration in the Department of Trade and Commerce. Expenditures from this vote are
heavier in the early part of the fiscal year
because the inspectors of weights and measures, and electricity and gas, cannot travel
in the rural areas during the winter months.
Honourable senators, that is a brief explanation of the purposes of this supply bill.
As I have already stated, the bill will furnish
all of the money required for the public
service during the months of April and May
1962. I hope the bill will receive the unanimous approval of the Senate.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators are all aware of the short notice we have
had to consider these items. The Leader of
the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) did not tell us the total amount covered
by the bill, which runs into a very high
figure.
The general public, in recent years, have
been very critical about the time spent in
the other place in the consideration of estimates. I think it should be carefully pointed
out to the public by TV and radio programs
that it is almost impossible for the Senate
to give adequate consideration to estimates of
this size on such short notice. Of course, we
know there has been deficit after deficit
since this Government has taken office. Every
26211-3-30

year, without exception, the deficit bas been
growing, which means a larger debt in Canada. When the former Government was in
power matters were quite different: it made
a point of reducing the deficit, thus cutting
down the interest and lessening the charges
against the public by that method.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The Government lived
within its means.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Yes. As the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) says, that Government lived within its
means. I think that is a very reasonable statement to make.
I feel that the honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine), having presented four supplementary estimates in various amounts, should
have given us more detail in respect to these
items. He stated that the first item, 2(a),
amounted to over $600 million. That represents a total of more than $3 billion.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is one-sixth of
the total estimates that have to be voted.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: You should have given
us the total.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators
have had the estimates in their possession
for a long time, and it is stated very clearly
on page 5 what they are and what they
amount to. It shows that they are $5,397,271
less than last year.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I am very glad the Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) quoted
that figure. I have in my hand a copy of
the estimates, and I was going to give that
figure and ask him how he reconciles the
figure he gave earlier with the total of the
estimates. Perhaps he will do that.
I was about to say that the first item represented a gross amount of $3,333,375,354.96.
He passed very quickly over paragraph (b)
stating that Votes, 5, 125 and 25, in Schedule
A amounted to $614,700. I think we could
give the country a somewhat better idea
of these three items if he said that for the
full year they amounted to $1,844,100.
I have only had this memorandum in my
hands a few moments and I have had to
make some very quick calculations.
Then, when the honourable leader came
to paragraph (c) he mentioned Vote 190,
Public Works, but he did not tell us the
exact amount that was to be spent in the
few months ahead. He told us that the total
for the three departments amounted to
$1,302,483.34. I want to make the point that
that amounts to $7,814,900.04 for the full
year.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: What figure are you
quoting?

458

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Isnor: I am quoting paragraph
(c). I am multiplying $1,302,483.34 by six,
and the resulting amount is $7,814,900.04.
The honourable leader passed over the
vote for Public Works, saying that Vote 190
referred to public works which will be
undertaken in the next few months.
As to the last item, paragraph (d), he also
passed quickly over it. This includes the
amount to be voted for the Department of
Trade and Commerce. We would like to know
the amount proposed to be spent by that
department, and a little more detail as to
how it is to be spent in advancing the trade
and commerce of this country.
Then the all-important item is described
as the usual authority to borrow up to $1
billion for public works and general purposes.
I think we are all pretty familiar with the
procedure followed by this Government in
voting large amounts for public works, particularly at this time. I will not be so unkind
as to say this $1 billion is perhaps to be
used for election purposes. No doubt some
of it will be used to good advantage in
different parts of the country, to carry on
needed repairs to breakwaters and so on.
But a billion dollars is a lot of money,
and we should be given more detail as to
what the Government proposes to do in
the next two, three or possibly more months.
The Prime Minister has said that the next
election is to take place soon, but he is
very careful not to say how soon. I am
wondering if $1 billion is all that will be
required for public works, or whether there
will be another $1 billion or $2 billion spent
on public works, perhaps to create more
votes for the present Government.
However, I am particularly concerned about
that item regarding the Department of Trade
and Commerce, for that is an expenditure
which, if properly invested, can make a return of our country instead of being charged
as a deficit.
Honourable senators, I make these few brief
remarks at this time, having had the estimates in my hand for only a matter of
minutes. May I ask the Leader of the Government if he would be good enough to comment on some of the points I have made, and
to reply to the questions I have asked. He
might try to reconcile the total of the four
items, contained in clause 2 (a), (b), (c)
and (d), by multiplying them by the various
factors, to see how the result compares with
the estimates to which he referred on page 4.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The total amount to be
voted in the general estimates, including
loans, investments and advances, is $3,999,375,955. Honourable senators who have their
estimates for 1962-63 before them will find
these figures in the first column. If you divide

that total which I have just given by six you
will find it amounts to $666,562,659.16,
which is the amount asked for in this bill.
As I have already stated, it is one-sixth
of the total amount required. I think that
answers one of the questions the honourable
senator asked.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Would you carry out the
same procedure with respect to paragraph (b),
make a comparison, and see how it works
out?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: To what (b) are you
referring?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: To clause 2 (b) of the bill
you have before you, which you introduced
for first reading today.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I have just explained
clause 2 (a). Now the honourable senator
asks me to explain how the additional onethird of the total amount of the several items
in the main estimates is made up. Is that
the question? I have that information here.
It is $614,700, being one-third of $1,844,100,
which is the total amount of these three
votes, Nos. 5, 125 and 25.
I thought that I had explained briefly the
purpose for which one-third of those votes
was required. Vote No. 5 deals with atomic
energy. I explained that it was usual to pay
50 per cent of the grant to the universities
early in the fiscal year. Vote No. 125 relates
to Mines and Technical Surveys. Vote No. 25
relates to the Privy Council, and I read virtually all of the explanation for that vote.
In regard to clause 2(c), honourable senators will note that it provides for an additional
one-sixth of four votes. Votes 40 and 45 relate
to the House of Commons. I explained that
during the early months of this session the
expenditures were greater than in later
months. Vote No. 125 is for the Canadian
Government Travel Bureau, which is a branch
of Northern Affairs and National Resources.
The bulk of the advertising there is done early
in the year. I went on then to deal with
Public Works, and I thought I gave an explanation as to why one-sixth of that vote was
required.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: What does one-sixth of
Vote 190 amount to?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It is one-sixth of $1
million. I have not divided it, but I have
divided the total.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: What is the total?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The total of those four
votes is $7,814,900. If you divide that by six,
you get $1,302,483.34.

in this bill for the borrowing of $1 billion for
public works and general purposes. The honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) says that this money is to be used
in part to enable the Government to sell
Canada Savings Bonds. I cannot understand
why in April the Government should ask for
power to sell Canada Savings Bonds when
the bonds do not go on the market until next
October. Probably the honourable leader could
explain why the Government is asking in
April for authority to enable it to borrow
money next fall by means of Canada Savings
Bonds.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: And treasury bills.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): There
may be something else to it, but it does make
one a little suspicious when one hears so
much about a possible general election and
the Leader of the Government is asking for
authority to borrow $1 billion for public
works and so on.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: $1 million.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): As I
understand it, this $1 billion is required for
public works and general purposes. Let me
just read Vote 190 under the item Public
Works in Schedule B:
Balances required to complete any
projects undertaken in previous fiscal
years and for which no specific provision
is made in the fiscal year 1962-63.
Now, by the first clause of the bill the
Government asks for one-sixth of that
amount. In a later clause it asks for an
additional one-sixth. I do not want to be
too suspicious, but it does appear strange to
me that first they ask for $1 million in all,
and then for authority to spendHon. Mr. Aselline: They are asking for an
additional one-sixth of $1 million.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Oh, no.
They ask for one-sixth, and then they ask
for another one-sixth.
Hon. Mr.
altogether.

Aselline:

That

is

two-sixths

Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Branîford): That is
right. Now my friend is answering my question. Two-sixths is one-third. They want
one-third of this amount, for some reason
or other, to be spent during the next two
months. I do not think we have had an
adequate explanation. However, we can come
to our own conclusions. I do not think the
Government has asked in previous supply
bills for one-third of an item for public
works to be spent in two months. I will not
press that any further, but I am wondering
why it is being done.

I want to ask the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) about another
item which the honourable senator from
Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) raised. I
refer to paragraph (c) of clause 2. The leader
was kind enough to hand this to me. I
refer to Votes 40 and 45 under Legislation,
found on page 4 of the bill. I notice that the
estimates of the Sergeant-at-Arms in the
other place amount to $1,056,800. Under the
general bill the Sergeant-at-Arms is voted
one-sixth, so that he can carry on the work
required to be done in connection with administration of the House of Commons during
the next two months. Similarly, our Clerk and
Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod are voted
one-sixth, but for some reason or other the
House of Commons administration is voted
an additional one-sixth. If they need an additional one-sixth over there, I cannot understand why we do not need it here. I do not
suggest there is anything wrong about it, but
it seems strange that they should ask for an
additional one-sixth and we do not ask for it.
It may be on account of the skilful and efficient administration we receive here at the
hands of our Clerk and the Gentleman Usher
of the Black Rod that we do not need the
additional one-sixth.
Hon. A. J. Brooks: Honourable senators, I
might say a word in connection with this
amount of $1 billion. My understanding has
been, and is, that every year $1 billion, or
whatever amount is necessary, is authorized
to be voted for the purpose of carrying on
public works, as set out in the Public Accounts. If you will review the Public Accounts you will find that about $1 billion
is estimated for public works during the year.
This is early in the year, and the Government has not yet collected sufficient taxes
for those purposes. It has been the practice
to issue treasury bills, and so on, for the
payment of this and other work which is
carried on during the year.
That is the reason for the request that is
now being made for authority to borrow
$1 billion.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Canada
Savings Bonds are not sold until the fall.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: Honourable senators, I
would like to give a further explanation.
Borrowing authority is not an expenditure
authority. It is exactly the opposite. It is
for the purpose of allowing the Government
to finance, as required, all of its operations
throughout the year.

APRIL 5, 1962
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Certainly, that is the
idea; it is done every year.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: For example, it is to
make sure that the Consolidated Revenue
Fund is in a position to meet the charges on
it from time to time, to float any loans
that are necessary, and to redeem bond issues
which come due. Canada Savings Bonds are
sold in the fall, but planning arrangements
for the campaign, and printing of the
bonds, etc., proceed many months ahead of
the selling period. This bill is intended to
give borrowing authority before the Government starts on that work.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): It is well
in advance.
Motion agreed to, and bill read second
time.

between now and the end of the month, and
if the cheques are not prepared for mailing
the people who are looking for the money

JURISDICTION RE MARRIAGE
AND DIVORCE

On the notice by Hon. Mr. Pouliot:

That he will inquire of the Government:
Referring (a) to the first seven words of
section 129 of the B.N.A. Act, 1867, about
the continuance of pre-Confederation
existing Laws, Courts, Officers, etc.,
namely, "Except as otherwise provided
by this Act",
-(b)
to "the exclusive legislative
authority of the Parliament of Canada"

extending to marriage and divorce in
virtue of subsection (26) of section 91
of the said act, with the exception of the
exclusive powers of Provincial Legislatures to make laws "for the solemnization of marriage", in virtue of subsection
(12) of section 92 of the said act, and
-(c)
the interpretation of the said

law by the Supreme Court of Canada and
the Privy Council on appeal from the
Supreme Court of Canada in the matter
of a reference to the Supreme Court of

Canada of certain questions concerning
marriage, (1912 A.C., p. 880)1. Did the Government receive any
formal request from any province or any
specific representation from anyone to

the effect that the B.N.A.

Act, 1867,

should be amended by repealing subsection (26) of section 91 of the said act?
2. If so, from whom and when?
3. In view of the Statutes of Canada:
45 V., (1882), c. 42;

53 V., (1890), c. 36;
13-14 Geo. V, (1923) c. 19;
22-23 Geo. V, (1932) c. 10;
and the Revised Statutes of Canada:
c. 105 of 1906;
c. 127 of 1927: and
c. 176 of 1952, the latter being intituled "An Act respecting Marriage
and Divorce",
did the Government of Canada receive

any specific representation or any formal
request from anyone to the effect that the

Parliament of Canada, in virtue of the
exclusive legislative authority conferred
upon itself by subsection (26) of section
91 of the E.N.A. Act, should repeal article
1301 of the Civil Code of the Province of
Quebec and the second paragraphs of
articles 1265 and 1422 of the said Code,
and amend articles 179 and 180 of the said

APRIL 10. 1962
Code concerning the rights of married
women in the Province of Quebec?
4. If so, from whom and when?
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I do not wish to delay the deliberations of the Senate unduly. However, Inquiry
No. 1 has been on the Order Paper since
March 22 and if I have no answer tomorrow
I will be obliged to make some precise

statements in order to make the answer easier.
The expected answer to the inquiry is: 1.
Nobody; 2. Answered by No. 1; 3. Nobody;
4. Answered by No. 3. That is the answer I
expect, but I would like it from an official
source, for then I will be in a position to
elaborate on the matter to the satisfaction of
honourable senators.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The honourable senator
from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) is
better informed than I am. What I said a few
moments ago about the inquiry of the honourable senator from Halifax-Dartmouth
(Hon. Mr. Isnor) applies equally to this
inquiry.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I know very well that
my honourable friend is doing his utmost to
obtain an answer, and I would like to help him
so that the file may be closed.
The Hon. the Speaker: Do I understand that
the honourable senator already knows the
answer?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I am guessing. I never
ask a question before guessing what the answer will be.

before us. However, I am very much concerned about what has appeared in the press
with respect to conversations that have taken
place with some other parliamentarians about
changing the procedure with regard to divorce petitions. I am not now asking the
question of the honourable senator from
Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw), for whom
I have great respect, but I want to know
what is going on. I give notice that I will
ask the question at the first possible opportunity, so that the whole matter may be
elucidated and we will know where we stand
with respect to divorce bills and what will
happen to these bills when they go to the
other place.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
divorce cases are referred to the Standing
Committee on Divorce, and the committee
feels it has an obligation to hear the evidence and make a recommendation in each
case. It cannot endeavour to predict what is
going to happen to the bills but, as I say, its
duty is to carry on and deal with each case
that comes before it.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Honourable senators, I
have great respect for the honourable senator from Medicine Hat, but I want the Senate to understand my point of view. I
appreciate the work that the Standing Committee on Divorce is doing. The work is
hard and painstaking, as I have said repeatedly in this chamber. However, I do want to
know what will happen to these bills, and I
will ask the question when the matter comes
again before the Senate.

Motion agreed to and bills read second time,

a request for relief under this Article, have
regard to the importance of the exporting
country's maintaining the principle stated

datum quantity of an exporting country is
reduced under paragraph (4) of this Article,

the light of the circumstances, the Council
shall determine whether any adjustment shall
be made, and if so in what manner, for the
purpose of establishing the datum quantities
of importing countries in such subsequent
crop years as a result of the operation of this
paragraph.
(8) If the entitlement as represented by the
datum quantity of an importing country is
reduced under paragraphs (5) or (6) of this
Article to offset the relief granted to an exporting country under paragraph (4), the
amount of such reduction shall be regarded

concerned from that exporting country for
the purposes of establishing the datum quantity of that importing country in subsequent
crop years.
ARTICLE 10
Adjustment in Case of Necessity to Safeguard Balance of Payments or
Monetary Reserves

and extent of the necessity referred to in
paragraph (1).

the Council shall have regard to its actual
commercial purchases from exporting countries or to the extent of its obligations under
Article 4, as may appear appropriate in the
circumstances.
(3) No action taken by an exporting or importing country pursuant to a recommendation
made under paragraph (1) of this Article shall
affect the datum quantity of any exporting or
importing country in subsequent crop years.
ARTICLE 12

Other Adjustments
(1) An exporting country may transfer part
of its balance of commitment to another exporting country, and an importing country

may transfer part of its balance of entitlement

to another importing country for a crop year,
subject to approval by the Council by a
majority of the votes cast by the exporting
countries and a majority of the votes cast
by the importing countries.
(2) Any importing country may at any time,
by written notification to the Council, increase
its percentage undertaking referred to in paragraph (1) of Article 4 and such increase shall
become effective from the date of receipt of
the notification.
(3) Any importing country which considers
that its interests in respect of its percentage
undertaking under paragraph (1) of Article
4 and Annex A is seriously prejudiced by
the non-participation in or withdrawal from
this Agreement of any country listed in Annex
B holding not less than five per cent of the
votes distributed in Annex B may, by written
notification to the Council, apply for a reduction in its percentage undertaking. In such
a case, the Council shall reduce that importing
country's percentage undertaking by the proportion that its maximum annual commercial
purchases during the years determined under
Article 15 with respect to the non-participating
or withdrawing country bears to its datum
quantity with respect to all countries listed in
Annex B and shall then further reduce such
revised percentage undertaking by subtracting
two and one half.
(4) The datum quantity of any country acceding under paragraph 4 of Article 35 shall
be offset, if necessary, by appropriate adjustments by way of increase or decrease in the
datum quantities of one or more exporting or
importing countries, as the case may be. Such
adjustments shall not be approved unless
each exporting or importing country whose
datum quantity is thereby changed has consented.

AND OBLIGATIONS
ARTICLE 13
Maximum Price Declarations
(1) As soon as any of its wheat other than
durum wheat or certified seed wheat is made
available for purchase by importing countries
at prices not less than the maximum price,
an exporting country shall notify the Council
to that effect. On receipt of such notification
the Executive Secretary acting on behalf of
the Council shall except as otherwise provided
in paragraph (4) of this Article and paragraph (4) of Article 16, make a declaration
accordingly, referred to in this Agreement as
a maximum price declaration. The Executive
Secretary shall communicate that maximum

APRIL 10, 1962
(2) As soon as all of its wheat which has
been made available at not less than the
maximum price, other than durum wheat or
certified seed wheat, is again made available
for purchase by importing countries at prices
less than the maximum price, an exporting
country shall notify the Council to that effect.
Thereupon, the Executive Secretary, acting

declaration to al exporting and importing
countries as soon as possible after it has been
made.
(3) The Council shall, in its rules of procedure, prescribe regulations to give effect
to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article,

failed to make a notification under paragraph
(1) or (2) of this Article, or has made an incorrect notification, he shall, without prejudice
in the latter case to the provisions of paragraph (1) or (2), convene a meeting of the
Advisory Committee on Price Equivalents. If
at any time in the opinion of the Executive
Secretary an exporting country has made a
notification under paragraph (1) but tbe facts
relating thereto do not warrant a maximum
price declaration, he shall not make such a
declaration but shall refer the matter to the
Advisory Committee. If the Advisory Committee advises either under this paragraph
or in accordance with Article 31 that a declaration under paragraph (1) or (2) should
be or should not be made or is incorrect, as
the case may be, the Executive Committee acting on behalf of the Council may make or refrain from making a declaration accordingly,
or cancel any declaration then in effect,
whichever may be appropriate. The Executive
Secretary shall communicate any such declaration or cancellation to all exporting and importing countries as soon as possible.
(5) Any declaration made under this Article
shall specify the crop year or crop years to
which it relates, and this Agreement shal
apply accordingly.
(6) If any exporting or importing country
considers that a declaration under this Article
should be or should not have been made, as
the case may be, it may refer the matter to
the Council. If the Council finds that the
representations of the country concerned are
well founded, it shall make or cancel a declaration accordingly.
(7) Any declaration made under paragraphs
(1), (2) or (4) of this Article which is cancelled in accordance with this Article shall be

regarded as having ful force and effect until
the date of its cancellation, and such cancellation shall not affect the validity of anything done under the declaration prior to its
cancellation.
ARTICLE 14
Action at or Approaching the Minimum Price
(1) If any exporting or importing country
is making wheat available for purchase by
exporting or importing countries at not
greater than the minimum price, or if such
a situation appears likely to arise, the Executive Secretary shall, after bringing the matter to the attention of the Advisory Committee
on Price Equivalents and communicating as
that Committee may advise with the country
concerned, report the situation to the Executive Committee.
(2) If the Executive Committee, after
studying the matter in the light of the advice
which the Advisory Committee shall give
under paragraph (1) of this Article or under
Article 31, considers that the country concerned may be failing to carry out its obligations under the Agreement with respect to
the minimum price, it shall so notify the
country concerned and may require that such
country furnish a statement respecting the
matter for the Committee's further consideration. If, after taking into account any explanation offered by the country concerned, the
Executive Committee is of the view that such
country is failing to perform its obligations
with respect to the minimum price, it shall
so inform the Chairman of the Council.
(3) Upon receiving such information from
the Executive Committee, the Chairman of
the Council shall convene a session of the
Council as soon as possible to consider the
matter. The Council may make such recommendations to exporting and importing
countries as it considers necessary to meet

(4) If the Advisory Committee on Price
Equivalents, in the course of its continuous
review of market conditions under Article
31, is of the opinion that, by reason of a
serious fall in the price of any wheat, a
situation has arisen, or threatens immediately
to arise, which appears likely to jeopardize
the objectives of the Agreement with regard
to the minimum price, or if such a situation
is called to the Advisory Committee's attention by the Executive Secretary on his own
initiative or at the request of any exporting
or importing country, it shall immediately
inform the Executive Committee of the facts
concerned. The Advisory Committee shal in
so informing the Executive Committee give
particular regard to circumstances which
have brought about, or threaten to bring
about, a serious fall in the price in any

market of wheat in relation to the minimum
price. The Executive Committee shall, if it
considers appropriate, inform the Chairman
of the Council who may convene a session
of the Council to consider the matter. The
Council may make such recommendations to
exporting and importing countries as it considers necessary to meet the situation.
(5) In advising and informing the Executive Committee under paragraphs (2) and (4)

importing countries with regard thereto. The
Council shall also make provision for the
amendment of any records or statements
maintained by it, including provision for the
settlement of any dispute arising in connection therewith.

of the measures taken by them to secure
compliance with the principles that the solution to the problems involved in such disposals should be sought, wherever possible,

orderly manner, and that where excess wheat
supplies are made available on special terms,
such arrangements should be made without
harmful interference with normal patterns of
production and international commercial
trade.

exist.
Any exporting or importing country may submit to the Council information which it considers relevant to the attainment of this purpose.
(2) Exporting and importing countries, recognizing the special problems of developing
countries, shall pay due regard to the principle that excess wheat supplies should, where
possible, be effectively utilized in raising levels
of consumption and in assisting in general
economic and market development in developing countries with low levels of individual
income. Where such wheat is made available
on special terms, the exporting and importing
countries concerned undertake that such arrangements will be made without harmful
interference with normal patterns of production and international commercial trade.

SENATE
of the Government in the Senate and two
senators to be named by him from time
to time be authorized to act for and on
behalf of the Senate in all matters relating to the internal economy of the Senate
and that two of the members so appointed
shall constitute a quorum of this
authority.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: With leave of the Senate, I
move that the report be considered now.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I did not
catch the names of the senators to be
appointed.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No one has been named
as yet. The Leader of the Government in the
Senate (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) has authority under
the report to name two senators to act with
him on this intersessional committee. The
members of the committee may change. If the
two members originally named are not available when the Senate is not sitting, the
Leader of the Government has the right to
name two others to take their place. I might
point out to honourable senators that anything done by the intersessional committee
is eventually approved by the full committee.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Does the
honourable senator recall the names of the
members of the committee for last year?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes. They were the
Leader of the Government in the Senate
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine), the honourable senator
from Ottawa West (Hon. Mr. Connolly) and
myself.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Is this the usual procedure?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes, it is done each year,
usually near the close of the session of Parliament. I do not know how close we are to
that now.
Report adopted.
FIFTH REPORT

Hon. Mr. Bruni presented the committee's
fifth report.
Report read by the Clerk Assistant:
Your Committee have examined the
expenditures and revenues of the Senate
for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1962,
and have found them correct.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I move, with leave, that
the report be adopted now. I might say that

these accounts were audited by a Senate committee of which the honourable senator from
Provencher (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) was the
chairman. At the meeting this morning he
advised us that, in order to make sure that
his audit was correct, the Auditor General
had also audited the accounts.
Report adopted.
INQUIRIES NO. 1 AND

NO. 2

STAND

Hon. Walter M. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I have been unable on account of the
absence of the Minister of Justice to obtain
an answer to Inquiry No. 1, by the honourable
senator from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr.
Pouliot). I expect to receive an answer to
Inquiry No. 2 'by the honourable senator
from Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor)
this afternoon or tomorrow morning. Having
regard to these facts, I am obliged to ask
that these inquiries stand in the meantime.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Thank you
very much.
INTERNATIONAL WHEAT AGREEMENT
On the Order for Motions:
That it is expedient that the Houses
of Parliament do approve the International Wheat Agreement to be opened
for signature at Washington, D.C., on
April 19, 1962, and that this House do
approve the same.
Hon. Walter M. Asel±ine: Honourable senators, I would like to have this motion standing in my name held in abeyance so that
item No. 3 on the Orders of the Day, the
second reading of Bill C-38, to provide for
the reporting of financial and other statistics
relating to the affairs of corporations and
labour unions carrying on activities in Canada, may be proceeded with now.
I ask for this indulgence because the honourable senator from Hanover (Hon. Mr.
Brunt), who is the sponsor of this bill, is
now ready to proceed, and he has to leave
later this afternoon. When that order has
been completed, I will then ask leave to
revert to motions so that my motion with
respect to the International Wheat Agreement
can be considered.
(See p. 499.)
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The honourable Leader
of the Government will have no objection
to the first item on the Orders of the Day
being proceeded with? It is the third reading
of a number of divorce bills.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No objection.

APRIL 11, 1962
SENATE REFORM
NEWSPAPER

ARTICLE-QUESTION

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators, I would like to refer to a news item
which appeared in the Ottawa Journal of
Friday, April 4 with respect to a meeting
held by the Conservative Party at Strathroy,
Ontario, at which the Prime Minister was
the main speaker and at which the honourable Deputy Leader of the Government in
the Senate was also present. I wish to ask a
question of the honourable Deputy Leader
of the GovernmentHon. Mr. Bruni: May I ask when the
meeting was held?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I will be very pleased to
quoteHon. Mr. Bruni: When was the meeting
held?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: This item appeared in the
Ottawa Journal of Friday, April 8. If I am
wrong in that date the honourable Deputy
Leader can correct me.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The 8th of what month?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: April.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Friday was April 6.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I will take your word
for it. You were present, nevertheless.
Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): If the
honourable senator would ask his question we
would all know what is going on.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: You will have the question
before I sit down. I am quoting from the
issue of the Ottawa Journal that I mentioned,
which reads as follows:
Sen. William Brunt (C-Hanover), who
was travelling with the prime minister,
said this would mean that 35 present senators would be retired. Only three of them
would be Conservatives, he added, and
appointment of Conservatives to fill the
vacancies would give the government a
solid majority in the Senate.
The honourable Deputy Leader of the Government will have an opportunity to deny
that or not, as he wishes, but my question
is very simple and one which he can answer
without the least hesitation.
Is it true, as implied by the honourable
Deputy Leader, that the proposed reform of
the Senate is a political move to gain Senate
control for the Conservative Party?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: My answer is very simplyNo.
26211-3-32

Hon. Mr. Isnor: Then, honourable senators,
may I be permitted to ask the honourable
Deputy Leader whether he made the statement attributed to him, and as it appears in
the Ottawa Journal?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I was not at any meeting
in Ottawa on Friday night, and therefore I
could not have made any statement.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I did not say the meeting
was at Ottawa. I said it was a report in the
Ottawa Journal of a meeting which took place
at Strathroy at which the Prime Minister was
present and spoke about reform of the Senate.
It also stated that the Deputy Leader of the
Government in the Senate, the honourable
senator from Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt), was
present and made the statement. If the honourable senator wishes to contradict the statement which appeared in the newspaper it will
satisfy me.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I was not present at any
meeting held in Stratford or in Strathroy.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Nor did you make the
statement?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I do not recall making a
statement in words as appear in the Ottawa
Journal.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: In substance, of course.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I think I have answered
the honourable senator's question.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: We have to draw our own
conclusions and take it for granted that if
the report did not correctly reflect the statement of the honourable Deputy Leader, it
was correct in substance.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Halifax North): May I
ask whether the article in the Ottawa Journal
appeared under a by-line?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: It appeared under the byline of Mr. Gordon Dewar of the Ottawa
Journal. I might add that practically the
same statement appeared in the Toronto
Globe and Mail and in one or two other
newspapers that are friendly, of course, to
the honourable senator from Hanover.

Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I would like to ask the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) if he has any idea of what will
happen to these bills in the other house as
a result of the informal talks that have taken
place between a few members of both houses.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I have no responsibility
for what will happen in the other house. My
position in regard to the divorce committee
is-and in this my colleagues agree-that we
will do our duty to the best of our ability and
carry on as though Parliament will continue
in its normal and proper way. We are carrying on and sitting as frequently as four times
a week to deal with divorce bills and, as I
say, doing our duty. We leave the other
house to do its duty, or answer for not doing it.
The Hon. the Speaker: May I inquire how
many cases are still on the rolls?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There are about 225
divorce bills now on the Order Paper of the
other house. I have had the honour to present
614 divorce petitions to the Senate, so we
are a long way from concluding our labours.
We have been working hard and rapidly,
disposing of something like fifteen uncontested cases on Fridays and Mondays and
hearing contested cases on Tuesdays and
Thursdays.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: If the honourable gentleman would permit me, I would like to ask
him in his capacity as chairman of the divorce
committee if his committee could handle the
approximately 6,000 divorce cases which are
before the provincial courts in eight provinces
of Canada?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I know of no province
which deals with 6,000 cases a year. In the
province of Ontario, if my memory serves
me right, the average is about 1,500 a yearI may be wrong on that. However, that is
not an answer to my friend's question. He
asks if we could handle a very large number
of cases. The question is an academic one, and
I suppose I could very well say that I am
not called upon to answer academic questions.
However, his question is of some significance,
and my answer to it is: Yes, the Senate
Divorce Committee can handle a very large
number of cases.

APRIL 11, 1962
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I have a practical question to ask the honourable gentleman. What
is the maximum number of divorce cases that
the Divorce Committee of the Senate can
handle during one session?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Now that is an academic question, and one which I am not able
to answer. I would not suggest a maximum
number, because if it was our duty to handle
a very large number of cases, we would
do so.
Hon. Mr. Poulioi: That is not an answer.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, that is not an
answer. I cannot state the maximum number
of cases we could handle.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: That is a theoretical
question.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, that is a theoretical
question. When my friend asks me if the
committee could handle a specific number of
cases, namely, 6,000 a year, my answer is
yes; but when he asks me the maximum
number the committee could handle, I cannot answer that.
Motion agreed to and bills read third time
and passed, on division.
CORPORATIONS AND LABOUR
RETURNS BILL

UNIONS

SECOND READING

Hon. William M. Bruni moved the second
reading of Bill C-38, to provide for the reporting of financial and other statistics relating to the affairs of corporations and labour
unions carrying on activities in Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, Bill C-38
provides for the reporting of certain financial
and other statistical information in connection with the affairs of corporations who do
business in Canada and in connection with
the affairs of labour unions who carry on
their activities in Canada. The bill makes no
reference of any kind to businesses as carried on by individuals in Canada, and therefore I can only conclude that so far as the
business world is concerned it relates only
to corporations.
I do not propose to discuss this bill in
detail by going through it clause by clause,
but rather to make only a few general remarks concerning the bill, since I am quite
sure that when it is considered by the Banking and Commerce Committee each individual clause will receive close consideration and
scrutiny by the members of that committee
and a full explanation will be given with
respect to the various clauses.
With respect to corporations it should be
pointed out that the bill applies to both
private and public companies, whether they
26211-3-32J

are controlled by Canadians or foreigners,
and in each case the company is required to
disclose the same information.
It should be pointed out at the outset
that the bill does not apply to or affect any
company whose Canadian operations gross
less than $500,000 a year or whose Canadian
assets are less than $250,000. Furthermore,
the bill contains a rather extensive schedule
listing no less than fifteen different types of
companies such as banks, insurance companies, trust companies, small loan companies, co-operatives, credit unions, fraternal
societies, and crown corporations, which are
exempt from the provisions of the bill. In
addition, the schedule further exempts municipalities, agencies of foreign governments,
charitable bodies, broadcasting companies,
air lines, railway, telephone and express
companies. I understand that a majority of
these companies have been made exempt because they now furnish the Government with
special reports in connection with their activities and business operations.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Will the honourable
senator permit a question? The $500,000 and
the $250,000 which you have mentioned are
two qualifications that the same corporation
must possess at the same time in order that
it may be exempt from the provisions of this
act. Is that not right?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I believe so.
The act provides that corporations and
unions must furnish to the Government two
types of returns, which may be identified
as returns as required by Section A and
returns as required by Section B. The information which corporations are required
to give under Section A returns must be
filed with the Dominion Statistician and will
be available to the general public through
an office of the Department of the Secretary of State designated by that department
for that particular purpose.
Briefly, the Section A statement must disclose the following: firstly, the corporate
name and address of the company; secondly,
the address of its head office and the manner in which the company was incorporated
and the date and place of incorporation;
thirdly, the company must set out the
amount of its authorized capital, the number
of shares issued of each class into which
the authorized capital is divided, plus a short
description of the voting rights that attach to
each particular class of shares; fourthly, the
number of shares held by non-residents of
Canada and, further, the number of nonresidents holding more than 5 per cent of the
total shares of any particular class of stock.

SENATE
Furthermore, the bill requires that the
corporation set out the names and addresses
of other corporations holding 10 per cent
or more of the total shares or of any class
of shares of the Canadian company.
It should also be pointed out that under
Section A a company is required to set out
in its return the names, addresses and manner of incorporation of any company holding
more than 50 per cent of the shares of the
Canadian company. Also, this return must
disclose the total amount of debentures issued
and outstanding.
The final requirement is to the effect that
the name, address and nationality of each
director of the company and of each officer
of the company resident in Canada shall
be set out.
As all honourable senators will realize,
information as asked for in Section A is of
a very general nature. None of it can be
classified as being of a confidential nature.
It will be available to the general public
upon the payment of a fee of $1 to the
Secretary of State for the return of each
company that a person desires to inspect.
However, the information which a corporation is required to furnish under Section B
of the bill is of an entirely different nature.
There is no doubt that the information as
asked for is of a very confidential nature,
and hence will not be made available to the
public. To furnish this information will require much more extensive accounting than
any now required under the dominion Companies Act or under any provincial act.
The basic intent of Section B is to make
available to the Government information
which it requires for policy making, and also
to furnish to the Government a statement
of all payments made by Canadian companies
to people living outside of Canada.
First of all, Section B requires disclosure
with respect to the basic financial operations
of the company. A balance sheet showing the
assets and liabilities must be included in this
part of the return. A statement with respect
to income and expenditure and surplus for
the operating period must also be included.
Furthermore, there must be included such
other statements relating to the financial position of the company as are required by the
company's bylaws to be placed before any
annual meeting of the shareholders.
Secondly, Section B requires that a separate
statement be included in the return showing
the total amounts paid or credited to persons
not resident in Canada for any of the following: dividends, interest payments, rentals paid
on property or equipment, royalties, and
similar payments made in respect to each of
the following: copyrights, patents, industrial
designs, trademarks and trade names, payments made for production, distribution and

sale franchises and similar rights, for advertising and sales promotion, for and in respect of
scientific research, payments made with respect to management and administration fees,
salaries, fees and other remuneration paid to
officers and directors.
There will also have to be included in this
particular statement amounts paid for annuities and pensions and other similar payments with respect to officers and directors
including former officers and directors, and
with respect to persons holding more than
5 per cent of the total issued shares or of
any class of stock.
This return will also have to set out the
fees and charges paid for professional services
with respect to each of the following services,
namely: engineering, architectural, legal accounting, auditing, consulting, and any other
consulting fees or charges not specifically
mentioned.
The form on which this information is to be
set out will be filed with the Dominion Statistician, and the information as contained
therein will not be available in detailed form
to the public. The facts as contained in Section
B of the form will be put together in summary
form in such a way that it cannot be related
to any particular company. However, summaries are to be made public annually. I
presume that by "summaries" it is intended to
take all the industries of one particular classfor instance, the textile industry-put them
together and prepare a summary with respect
to that class, so that one cannot identify any
specific industry about which information has
been filed.
Finally, material filed under Section B of
the act cannot be revealed or used in connection with any civil proceedings. However, the
information can be revealed if criminal
proceedings depend upon it and arise under
the act itself and not otherwise. In other
words, on an investigation under the Combines
Investigation Act none of this information
would be available for an investigation, and
none of it could be used on a prosecution.
Furthermore, if an investigation is conducted
under any taxation act I understand that none
of this information is to be made available on
the investigation and none of it can be used
on any prosecution instituted under any such
act. That is all I wish to say on corporations,
for the moment.
Honourable senators, with respect to labour
unions, they are required to prepare and file
the type "A" disclosure and the type "B" disclosure. The type "A" disclosures are to be
made available to the public, while the type
"B" are to be available only in collated
form, not with respect to any particular
union. Both types of statement must be filed
with the Dominion Statistician.

APRIL 11, 1962
Hon. Mr. Reid: With regard to clause 9(b)
(ii)-(B) members dues per capita-will provision be made to separate the dues paid for
political purposes and those paid for the
running of the union?

Furthermore, the bill provides that each
statement required to be flled shall be certified by the president or vice-president and by
the secretary or treasurer or such other officer as may be authorized only by the corporation or union.
There is the further requirement that each
statement made up under Section B of the
bill shall be accompanied by the corporation
auditor's report and/or the union auditor's
report. In each case such report must be
signed by the respective auditor.
This bill provides penalties for companies
or unions who fail to file returns. They may
be fined $50 a day for each day the return
is in arrears. The bill contains an identical
provision for corporations and unions whereby
the minister can demand by registered mail
the filing of returns as required under this
bill.
It should be pointed out that each confidential employee of the Bureau of Statistics is
entitled to pass along to any other confidential employee of that bureau, without hindrance, any information which is ffled with
the bureau under Section B of this bill. Further, such confidential employee of the Bureau of Statistics, under section 14(5), may
pass along any information to any official or
authorized person to be used for any purpose relating to the determination of policy
in connection with the formulation of any
law in Canada or the ascertainment of any
matter necessarily incidental thereto.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Is that what section
14(5) says? Does it not say exactly the opposite?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That was my understanding, but I shall check it. Is that not what it
says? It makes an exception regarding other
persons, for purposes stated.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: May I indicate the point
of my question. Section 14(5) is an exception
in connection with the communication of information. It comes under Section B information. It says in this exception that "any official or authorized person" may for certain
purposes "communicate or allow". I ask how
the information gets to an official or authorized person under this bill so that he would
have it and therefore could communicate it?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: My understanding of the
working of the bill is that it gets to that
person from a confidential employee of the

Hon. Mr. Bruni: I am coming to unions
now. I think I have set out in fair detail
what they have to disclose.
In connection with the type "A" disclosure
which must be made, a union is required to
make the following disclosures: the name
of the union, the address of its headquarters,
its constitution, the name and address of each
oficer of the union and the position in the
union held by each officer, the name, address
and nationality of each officer and employee
of the union resident in Canada, with an
exception being made for those persons who
are primarily engaged in clerical or stenographic work. The union must also set forth
the manner of election or appointment of such
officers. The return must also disclose the
name and address of each local union or
branch of the union in Canada and, further,
the name and address of each officer of such
local union, the number of its male members
and the number of its female members.
Unions will also be required to furnish
the name of each local union in Canada
which is under a trusteeship and, in addition,
the union will have to provide the date of
such trusteeship and the reasons for its
existence.
The last requirement in the type "A" disclosure is that all unions shall furnish the
name and address of each employer or association of employers residing in Canada
with which .a union has a collective agreement.
In addition to this type "A" Information, as
I call it, unions, like corporations, are also
required to make a disclosure under Section
B, and as far as unions are concerned this
information is confidential.
The first information a union has to file
under this section is its financial statements,
including assets, liabilities, income and expenditures, such statements to be in the form
prescribed by the regulations which will be
passed under this act. Secondly, with respect to international unions which are defined as unions having headquarters situated
outside of Canada, they are required to disclose the total payment made by Canadian
members for the following: Initiation fees, Bureau of Statistics.
members dues, health and welfare assessHon. Mr. Hayden: Where does the bill

union's financial statement, is confidential and amended, if it is not correct.
will not be made available to the public.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: It does not say so.

SENATE
I should like to ask one other question at
the same time. Al this information goes to
the Dominion Statistician, but the bill does
not say what he is to do with it. Has the
honourable senator found out what be is
supposed to do with it?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I understood that nonconfidential information would go over to an
office set up by the Secretary of State.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I am talking about Section B information.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Like all other confidential
information it remains with the Dominion
Statistician.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Then he has no authority to communicate.
Hon. Mr. Davies: The honourable senator
has referred to broadcasting stations. Item 13
in the schedule says:
A corporation that is licensed under
the Radio Act to establish a broadcasting
station.
Does the phrase "licensed broadcasting
station" include a television station?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes, I presume it does,
since that is a form of broadcasting.
Hon. Mr. Davies: They also operate under
the Canadian Broadcasting Act?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes.
I should point out that in all other cases
any civil servant who passes on any information filed with the Dominion Statistician
under Section B of the bill runs the risk of
being charged criminally in a summary way
and, if convicted, can be fined in any amount
not exceeding $1,000, or imprisoned for a
term not exceeding three months, or punished by both fine and imprisonment.
There are two final points I should like
to mention. First, the Minister of Trade
and Commerce is the minister designated
under this bill, and he shall report annually
to Parliament with respect to all returns
which are filed.
Secondly, the Governor in Council may
make regulations for the carrying into effect
of proposals and provisions outlined in this
bill.
In order that there may be no misunderstanding, honourable senators, may I say that
if and when the bill receives second reading
I intend to move that it be referred to the
Comnittee on Banking and Commerce, as
I mentioned earlier, so that a very thorough
study of the whole measure can be made
there. This seems to me to be an important
bill and I feel that a thorough study should
be made of it.

Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard: Honourable senators, may I compliment the honourable senator from Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt) who,
in his usual efficient way, has very competently and very clearly explained the bill
to us. I understand that be is leaving for
some other place-I hope it is not western
Ontario-and I might assure him before he
goes that I propose to support this bill on
second reading.
I have no quarrel with the principle of
the bill. My remarks will be addressed to
two aspects, one being the practical application of the bill and the other being the policymaking decisions which may follow at some
later date after this bill has been in effect.
When this bill was introduced in the other
place, the Minister of Justice quoted on
second reading from an address given in
1960 by the Right Honourable the Prime
Minister to the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Great Britain. I should like to
quote some of the remarks made by the
Prime Minister. He said:
We have made it clear that we expect
foreign concerns operating in Canada,
or Canadian subsidiaries of foreign companies, to carry on operations as Canadian businesses. We expect them to make
available a fair portion of their equity
securities for purchase by Canadians; to
include Canadians on their boards of
directors; to make proper disclosures of
their Canadian operations; to employ
competent Canadians in senior management and technical positions; to conduct
a fair share of their research in Canada;
to purchase their requirements within
Canada if those are available on competitive terms; and not to be denied by
those in control a fair opportunity to
sell their Canadian products in export
markets.
On the whole, most Canadians will agree
that these are desirable goals to pursue, provided we pursue them by proper methods
and not in any spirit of zenophobia or distrust or dislike of the foreigner, but in a
spirit of fair play and in the maintenance
of a favourable investment plan for our
future development.
Indeed, I think that most of the suggestions
contained in that quotation from the remarks
of the Right Honourable the Prime Minister
followed similar suggestions in the report of
the Gordon Commission, which made a very
careful analysis of the whole position of
Canada with respect to our foreign investments. Certain conclusions were reached and
certain recommendations were made by Mr.
Walter Gordon and the members of that
commission.

APRIL 11, 1962

I should like to point out, in the first place,
that this bill has not carried out ail those
matters referred to by the Right Honourable
the Prime Minister. I think there were altogether some seven points in that quotation.
This bill fulfils only one of them, namely, the
making of proper disclosure of Canadian
operations.
If it is conceived by anyone that this bill
was designed to implement the policy set out
by the Right Honourable the Prime Minister,
one might reasonably feel that indeed the
mountain had laboured and brought forth a
mouse. All this bill does is require the disclosure of information. It does not deal with
the matter of directorships and equities, and
as f ar as I am concerned I am quite happy
that it does not, because I do not think the
present situation requires any legislation. It
certainly requires no legislation of a discriminatory character, or legislation that
would be displeasing to foreign capital in
those respects.
This bill, in so far as it requires the disclosure of information, is not new or revolutionary in principle. Similar powers to obtain
information now exist under the Statistics
Act and various statutes dealing with different
kinds of companies. I do not think any individual company or person can take serious
objection to the principle involved in this
bill or to the disclosure of the information that
is required, any more than the filing of income tax returns to the proper department of
government can be objected to.
However, the practical application of the
bill is another matter. Of what use will be
the information that is obtained? There is
also the possibility of further legislation
resulting from this bill. The first thing that
strikes me is that, even though the avowed
purpose of the bill is to obtain information
as to the foreign-controlled sector of our
economy, it applies, nevertheless, to al companies doing business in Canada with the exceptions that have been stated by the honourable senator from Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt),
which exceptions have no relationship to the
question of foreign ownership or control.
The exceptions, if I may deal with them for
a moment, are, in the first place, certain companies, such as the honourable senator from
Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies) referred to, from
which this kind of information can already
be obtained and where it is readily available. Such companies are not required to
file this information. The other class of excepted companies comprises those the assets
of which indicate that the information to
be obtained would be of no value. All other
companies doing business in Canada, whether

private or public, whether incorporated under
a provincial act or a federal act, must file
these returns.
It is estimated that approximately 25,000
companies will have to supply this information, although at the time of the Gordon
Report rather less than 5,000 companies were
deemed to be in the category of foreignowned or foreign-controlled companies. Even
though that figure were set as high as 6,000,
and the purpose of the bill is to obtain information as to this kind of control in our
country, nevertheless, some 25,000 companies
will have to make a return. There will be
thousands upon thousands of companies,
purely local in character and having no foreign ownership, no foreign interest and no
foreign business, which will be required to
make out these returns, compile them and
have them processed, and so forth. In a
way, we do seem to be using a sledge hammer
to swat a fly. It seems to me to be a very
costly and cumbersome way of obtaining
the information required, and it is my opinion
that before many returns are filed-perhaps
after the first year-the Government will
find it necessary to increase the exemptions.
The lower level, for example, should be
raised, and the figures of $500,000 of business and $250,000 of assets should be doubled
so as to eliminate all those companies whose
figures wil be of no real value or concern.
My next observation is with respect to the
use of the information. It will have to be
filed, analysed, put through electronic machines, checked and summarized. It is at
that time that the question of any further
action or any further policy making will
come up. Here I should like to make some
remarks as to the kind of approach we should
make towards dealing with this question of
foreign investment.
Canada, throughout its history, has depended largely upon foreign capital for its
growth and expansion. We could not have
made the progress we have, nor could we
enjoy the standard of living that we now do,
had it not been for the help of money from
abroad. A country such as ours, although
having very great wealth in natural resources, is still comparatively young and
cannot generate the total volume of savings
required to carry the capital investment
needed, and of necessity we have had to depend on foreign capital. Foreign capital has
been good to us, and we have been good
to it. We have provided a favourable climate
for it, and it has come here and helped us.
Foreign investors also have done well.
This has been the case throughout our
history, and it will continue to be the case
for a great many years to come. Even though
we have made considerable progress in the

SENATE
repatriation of our foreign debt and the ownership of our Canadian assets, we shall not be
able to find enough capital in Canada to
maintain the growth that we must maintain
over a considerable number of years ahead.
We have made some progress. For example,
back in 1939 the total amount of our net
foreign debt was about equal to our gross
national production for one year. Our net
foreign debt now is something less than onehalf of our gross national production. So,
looking at it from that angle the problem now
is less serious, and we are moving in the
direction of the repatriation of our foreign
debt. However, there is a right way of going
about it and there is a wrong way.
As an example of the wrong way of going
about it, one has only to look at what has
happened recently in Brazil. One of the states
of Brazil has seized a Canadian company, and
had it not been for the intervention of the
State of Brazil itself a step would have been
taken which would have been most unfair
to Canadians.
The policy we should adopt, in my opinion,
is a policy based upon the maxim of doing
unto others as you would like them to do
unto you. In that connection we must remember that we Canadians now have a large stake
in other countries. We ourselves have considerable foreign investments, and we have been
increasing them quite rapidly. Some $8 billion
or $9 billion belonging to Canadian governments, Canadian businesses, and Canadian
citizens is now invested outside Canada. Not
only is it a good, sound moral philosophy to
do unto others as you would have them do
unto you, but there is a great deal of practical
wisdom in it when it comes to our treatment
of foreign capital invested in Canada. We
should treat it so that there will continue to
be a favourable investment climate for it in
this country.
I mentioned an improper way of going
about repatriating, by the arbitrary seizure
of a company, and I deplore anything in the
nature of discriminatory legislation. There
are proper ways for increasing Canadian
ownership of our important assets. For
example, we Canadians can increase our own
savings and to that extent finance a good
deal more of our capital requirements out of
such savings. We have not yet reached the
maximum amount that we could and should
put away in savings each year.
Another thing is that possibly we have
been too prone to invest in the safer classes
of securities-and I am speaking now not
only of individuals but of investing institutions as well-in Government bonds and corporation bonds, and not participating sufficiently in equities, particularly in Canadian
growth companies. We have to have faith in

our country and invest in those equities
which will help build up Canada. There is
a happy medium, of course, between ultraconservatism in investment on the one side
and speculation on the other, and I think
that that happy medium is the goal we ought
to pursue.
Enlightened self-interest on the part of
these companies will cause them gradually
to recognize the value of having more Canadians paorticipate in their ownership, management and directorates. It is a desirable thing
that by the combination of increasing our
own ability to play our part in these companies, and in the repatriation of the foreignowned assets, and by the enlightened
self-interests of foreign companies and,
finally, in so far as legislation is required
that it be by way of incentives, for there
are desirable ways in which legislation
by way of incentives, without penalizing
foreign investment, can encourage the gradual repatriation of foreign-owned Canadian
companies and enterprises into Canadian
hands.
Honourable senators, that is all I have to
say with respect to this bill in so far as it
applies to Canadian companies. There is also
a part dealing with labour unions but I have
not touched upon it because there are others
in this house who are better qualified than I
to speak on this subject. I would only say
that it does seem to me, based on information normally obtained from companies, that
it is well within the scope of labour unions
also to furnish the information required here;
although, again there is some question in
my mind as to what might be the practical
use of such information. For example, I
wonder why in a bill designed to obtain
information from labour unions as to their
foreign and international aspects, information
is required as to the difference between male
and female members of the union. I would
have been inclined to let the matter rest with
the words of the member of the Chamber of
Deputies in France who said, "Vive la différence", but for some reason or other the
information is required.
Honourable senators, I am happy to support the bill on second reading and am glad
that it is going to committee for consideration and study.
Hon. Salier A. Hayden: Honourable senators, there are just a few comments I would
like to make about this bill. First of all,
I cannot oppose it because in so many aspects
the information which the bill requires is
information which substantially is given
under existing legislation or could be obtained by simple amendment to existing
legislation. Since it is quite likely that during
the period I have been a member of the

APRIL 11, 1962

Senate some of these bills to which I shall
refer have been before us, and I have in
some fashion joined in their passage, it would
be foolish for me now to speak against the
principle of the present bill.
May I say that it is desirable this bill
should go to committee for, in some respects,
in the language it employs, it provides exactly the opposite to what the sponsor of
the bill explained was its intention, purpose
and operation.
May I point out to you that under the
Statistics Act, which bas been in force in
Canada for a long time, and which is a subject
matter that belongs to the federal authorityso that there can be no question of constitutionality-there is the widest power in
the world for the collection of information.
The Dominion Statistician, wha is appointed
by the Governor in Council, is given exceedingly broad powers under the direction
of the Minister of Trade and Commerce to
organize and maintain a scheme of co-operation in the collection, classification and publication of statistics as between the several
departments of government, to supervise
generally the administration of the Statistics
Act, to report annually to the minister, and
to advise on al matters pertaining to statistical policy.
The minister himself has the broadest
power under section 5 of the Statistics Act.
He may employ from time to time, in the
manner authorized by law, such commissioners, enumerators, agents, and so on, to
collect for the bureau such statistics and information as he deems useful and-note these
words-in the public interest, relating to such
commercial,
industrial, financial, social,
economic and other activities as he may
determine.
There you see in the Statistics Act the
broadest power vested in the minister and
in the Dominion Statistician, under the
minister, in connection with the gathering
and the compilation of information.
I am not particularly concerned with the
Section A information, but in looking at the
Section B information, which is supposed to
be confidential, I think some of the purposes
of the original bill were not fully studied
when it was decided to change the set-up of
the bill and produce this division between
Section A and Section B information. Under
the Statistics Act all information is confidential and only compilations and reports,
more general and without any individual
statements, are made available to Parliament.
Under Section B the information provided
for in this bill goes to the Dominion Statistician, and unless he operates under the provisions of the Statistics Act there is nothing in
the bill before us that tells him what he is

to do with the information. The bill, however, provides that an official or an authorized
person may communicate this confidential information to another person for any purpose
related to the determination of policy in connection with the formulation of any law in
Canada or the ascertaining of any matter
necessary and incidental thereto. Now, both
an "official" and an "authorized person" are
defined in this bill. An official means any person employed in, or occupying a position of
responsibility in, the service of Her Majesty,
and includes any person formerly so employed or formerly occupying such a position.
I assume that would apply at any time to a
major, a colonel, or a general in Her Majesty's
forces, who is still living, and that such person would qualify under the definition of an
official. The term "official", in this definition,
is much broader than that of an official in the
Statistics Act, where the information goes to
the Dominion Statistician. Under this bill, information may be exchanged among officials
in the Bureau of Statistics but I have not
been able to ascertain how the information
could get to an official who is not in the
bureau.
So you have what I suggest is not the best
draftsmanship in the world. If the purpose is
that the Dominion Statistician is to receive the
confidential information, he would treat it in
the same way as he treats information in the
regular performance of his duties under the
Statistics Act. He releases no particular information in relation to any particular individual, but he does submit summaries or
compilations to the minister, if the minister
requires them, and they are presented to
Parliament.
May I for a moment indicate how much
information is obtained now. The sponsor of
the bill (Hon. Mr. Brunt) indicated what
information is sought under this bill. Section B of Part 1 of the bill requires a financial statement consisting of a balance sheet,
a statement of income and expenditures and a
statement of surplus. Section 121 (1) (a) of the
dominion Companies Act requires all that information in relation to public companies.
The Dominion Statistician under the Statistics Act uses the provincial authorities as his
agents for the compilation of any information he wishes to get, so that the machinery
already exists for getting at provincial companies.
Another provision of the bill deals with
total amounts paid or credited, divided into
separate categories as listed in the bill, to
persons not resident in Canada. The Dominion
Bureau of Statistics' schedule MF.1, which is

SENATE
entitled, "Movement of funds between Canada and other countries", covers all individual items in this bill from (A) to (N), except items (C), which deals with rent on real
property in Canada, and (D) rent on equipment used in connection with the business
carried on by the company in Canada.
With regard to dividends, which is another
bit of required information under the bill,
the Dominion Bureau of Statistics' schedule
15 requires to have reported the payment of
dividends. That will also be found under the
Dominion Bureau of Statistics schedule MF.1.
Interest will also be found under this schedule.
Rent on real property, and rent on equipment-there is no provision for these. However, it would be simple to add two lines, and
there is authority in the Statistics Act to
do so.
So far as unions are concerned, you may
say, where is the authority to get information from unions now. Under the Statistics
Act the authority given is broad enough, because it is in relation to individuals and
corporations. While the authority is broad
enough that the information could be required, it will be noted-and I think this will
be made clear in committee-that as a matter
of practice the information is gathered under
the Department of Labour Act, is then referred to the Bureau of Statistics, and the
Dominion Statistician has the authority to
collect or collate that information under the
Department of Labour Act. Section 4 of that
act, under "Statistics" says:
With a view to the dissemination of
accurate statistical and other information
relating to the conditions of labour the
Minister shall collect, digest, and publish
in suitable forms statistical and other information relating to the conditions of
labour, shall institute and conduct inquiries into important industrial questions upon which adequate information
may not at present be availableAnd so forth. It also provides for publication
in the Labour Gazette. So if you are looking
for the basic authority to gather the information required to be furnished under Sections
A or B of this bill, it now exists under the
Statistics Act and the Department of Labour
Act. Furthermore, as to dominion companies,
it exists under the dominion Companies Act.
We are therefore creating another piece of
legislation to do what could very well have
been done, in my submission, by an amendment to the Statistics Act and/or the Department of Labour Act. This will entail additional
questions or the preparation of another form,
because the information, either under this bill
or the Statistics Act, goes to the Dominion
Statistician. Therefore, it is going to the same

place, and to that extent we are providing for
some duplication. Perhaps that will become
clearer as the bill starts to operate. It will be
realized that to the extent that companies
are required to prepare additional sets of
forms, there is in a sense duplication of much
of the information they are already furnishing
to the Bureau of Statistics. This means additional expense and more paper work, and
that should not be required of them because
all these elements add to the matter of cost.
Hon. Mr. Croll: May I ask one question?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Croll: You specified certain acts
which require information. Is that information
not supplied on a voluntary basis?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Under the Statistics Act?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No. There are penalties
provided. For instance, section 35 of the
Statistics Act provides:
Every person who, without lawful
excuse (a) refuses or neglects to answer,
or wilfully answers falsely, any question
requisite for obtaining any information
sought in respect of the objects of this
Act or any regulation, or pertinent thereto, that bas been asked of him by any
person employed in the execution of any
duty under this Act or any regulation; or
(b) refuses or neglects to furnish any
information or to fill in to the best of his
knowledge and belief any schedule or
form that he has been required to fill
in, and to return the same when and as
required of him under this Act or any
regulation, or wilfully gives f alse information or practises any other deception
thereunder;
is, for every such refusal or neglect, or
false answer or deception, guilty of an
offence and is liable, under summary
conviction, to a fine not exceeding one
hundred dollars, or to imprisonment for
a term not exceeding three months, or to
both fine and imprisonment.
So that, as one would expect, the Parliament of Canada has, under the act, jurisdiction over the question of statistics, and if
it requires information to be furnished pursuant to the authority vested in it, and that
information is refused, that refusal creates
an offence and a penalty is provided.
Honourable senators, I wanted to bring
other matters to your attention at this time.
However, the bill bas been thoroughly discussed, and many of the points I wished to
raise may be more properly dealt with when
the bill goes to committee, at which time the

APRIL 11, 1962
information may be forthcoming. However,
the big question in my mind is, why a separate bill? If I may make a comment, for the
reasons I have stated, the bill has not the
importance that would merit its being placed
on a pedestal as one of the great and memorable pieces of legislation of all times, because
the authority this bill purports to provide
exists now and, in my submission, could be
exercised under the present legislation with
practically no amendments thereto.
I say we should look carefully before we
saddle business concerns with the responsibility of doing more paper work, filling out
more returns and duplicating information
which is already available either in the
Bureau of Statistics or in the Department of
Labour, or which could quite easily be collected on some of the forms they are now
using. In that way a lot of this duplication
would be avoided, as well as a lot of expense.
Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourable senators, I rise to make a plea for the businessman. I have listened this afternoon to three
speakers touching on different points of this
legislation, and as I sat here I wondered if the
members of this Parliament realized that
every time an act is passed asking for further
information from Canadian businessmen, an
additional load is placed on them, making it
harder for them to carry on.
I am sure anybody who is at all familiar
with business in this country is conversant
with the complaints that one hears regarding
the amount of office work involved in completing Government returns. I sometimes
wonder if we forget that these concerns are
in business primarily to make a profit, and
think that they are simply in business for
the purpose of filling out Government returns. Quite a portion of the clerical staffs
of Canadian business organizations are engaged almost full time filling out Government
returns.
First of all, they have to file returns with
the municipality; then they have to file numerous returns with the provincial Government, and on top of that they have to file a
great many returns with the federal authorities. I am sure that my honourable friend
from Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor), or
any other member of this chamber who is
engaged in business, will verify what I have
said.
It is al very nice to have this information,
but I just want to warn the Government that
every time legislation is passed which requires
business people to file more returns, the Government is not increasing its popularity with
the business world. It is putting shackles on
business. The freer business is to conduct its
operation the better it is for al concerned.

Honourable senators, on behalf of Canadian
businessmen today I want to protest against
all these requests for multitudinous returns.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Aseltine, for Hon.
Mr. Brunt, bill referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
INTERNATIONAL WHEAT AGREEMENT
Leave having been given to revert to
Order for Motions:
Hon. Walter M. Aseltine moved:
That it is expedient that the houses
of Parliament do approve the International Wheat Agreement to be opened
for signature at Washington, D.C. on
April 19, 1962, and that this house do
approve the same.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker (Hon Mr.
Choquette): Honourable senators, is it your
pleasure to adopt the motion?
Hon. Arthur M. Pearson: Honourable senators, at the Senate sitting last evening,
it was moved by Honourable Mr. Aseltine,
and seconded by Honourable W. Ross Macdonald, that it is expedient that the Houses
of Parliament do approve the International
Wheat Agreement to be opened for signature
at Washington, D.C. on April 19, 1962, and
that this house do approve the same.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I don't
think I seconded the motion to approve it.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No. Yesterday I just
gave notice of the motion that is now before
uS.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): I am not
objecting to it, but I do not want to be credited with seconding the motion.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The motion that was
seconded by the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Brantford)
had to do with the printing of the agreement
in Senate Hansard and in the Minutes of the
Proceedings of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Pardon me, I stand
corrected.
Honourable senators, this is the fifth International Wheat Agreement to be negotiated, the first being, as you will remember,
in 1949, the second in 1953, the third in
1956, and the fourth in 1959, each for a term
of three years ending on July 31 of the third
year.
The maximum price in 1959 was set at
$1.90 per bushel, and the minimum at $1.50

SENATE
per bushel, in Canadian currency, for No.
1 Northern wheat f.o.b. Fort William-Port
Arthur. There was a meeting called to consider a new wheat agreement on July 31
last at Geneva. Some sixty countries took
part in these negotiations. A number of them,
of course, were there as observers and took
no part in the actual negotiations. These
negotiations came to a successful conclusion
on March 9, 1962 and the resulting agreement is now presented to this house and to
the other place for ratification.
Honourable senators will note that approval
of this agreement by both houses has been
asked before this instrument is signed on
behalf of Canada by our ambassador at
Washington.
This agreement bas the support of the
heads of all the producer organizations in
western Canada.
The chief members of the Canadian delegation were J. H. Warren, Assistant Deputy
Minister, Department of Trade and Commerce; C. F. Wilson, Consul General for Canada at Chicago; and W. C. McNamara, Chief
Commissioner of the Canadian Wheat Board.
Other important members were producer
advisers: A. W. Runciman, President, United
Grain Growers, Winnipeg, and J. S. Stevens,
Director, United Grain Growers, Winnipeg.
The heads of the three wheat pools were
present: W. C. Gibbing, Saskatchewan Wheat
Pool, Regina; Gordon L. Harrold, Chairman,
Alberta Wheat Pool, Calgary; and W. J.
Parker, President, Manitoba Wheat Pool, Winnipeg. A. B. Gleave, President, Saskatchewan
Farmers Union, was also present. The last six
I have mentioned are on the advisory board
of the Canadian Wheat Board.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I ask the honourable senator if any of the private trading
organizations in the Winnipeg Grain Exchange were represented there?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: I do not have that
information.
Our thanks is due to these men for the
successful conclusion of the negotiations. I
might say, honourable senators, that the Canadian delegation bas considerable influence
in these negotiations. If honourable senators
will refer to Annex "B", at the end of the
appendix to yesterday's Senate Hansard,you
will find that Canada and the United States
each have 290 votes. The second most influential countries are Australia and Russia,
each with 125 votes.
There were certain revisions included in
the International Wheat Agreement which
has just been negotiated. The main provisions
of the new agreement are summarized in the
appendix to this memorandum. From a Canadian point of view, the first and main
provision is represented in an improvement

over 1959 of the higher price range, the
maximum now being $2.025 and the minimum
$1.625 per bushel in Canadian currency, as
compared to last year's figure of $1.90 maximum and $1.50 minimum.
Secondly, there is the heavier obligation
of the importing countries and the improved
safeguards for commercial marketing. Thirdly,
there is in addition the strong prospect that
the U.S.S.R. will ratify this agreement. If it
does so it will widen the membership to
cover all the important exporting countries.
Under the present agreement there are nine
exporting countries, the principal ones being
Argentina, Australia, Canada, France and
the U.S.A., plus the occasional exporters, Italy,
Mexico, Spain and Sweden. There are 30
importing countries and, subject to ratification, one more will be added, namely, Poland.
This agreement will be for a period of three
years, ending July 31, 1965. The objectives
remain the same as those set out in the 1959
agreement, but there is greater recognition of
the importance of commercial sales of wheat
to the economy of certain exporting countries
and of the need to encourage consumption in
the less-developed countries where the potential is greatest.
At this point I might set out the objectives.
They are:
(a) to assure supplies of wheat and
wheat-flour to importing countries and
markets for wheat and wheat-flour to exporting countries at equitable and stable
prices;
(b) to promote the expansion of the
international trade in wheat and wheatflour, and to secure the freest possible
flow of this trade in the interests of both
exporting and importing countries, and
thus contribute to the development of
countries, the economies of which depend
on commercial sales of wheat;
(c) to overcome the serious hardship
caused to producers and consumers by
burdensome surpluses and critical shortages of wheatwhich we sometimes have, notably this
year in western Canada.
(d) to encourage the use and consumption of wheat and wheat-flour generally,
and in particular, in developing countries,
so as to improve health and nutrition in
those countries and thus to assist in their
development; and,
(e) in general to further international
co-operation in connection with world
wheat problems, recognizing the relationship of the trade in wheat to the economic
stability of markets for other agricultural
products.

APRIL 11 1962
There was introduced for the first time
in the 1959 agreement an obligation by individual importing countries to purchase annually, at prices within the price range, a
specified minimum percentage of their commercial requirements from member exporting
countries. These percentage obligations under
the 1962 agreement have been raised. I would
refer honourable senators to Annex "A" at
the end of the appendix to Senate Hansard
of yesterday, where is set out the percentage
that these countries import. They have been
raised in keeping with the past performances
of the importing countries.
In the case of non-participation in or
withdrawal from the agreement by an exporting country, provision is made for a
proportionate reduction in the percentage
undertakings of importing countries. In other
words, these percentages that the importing
countries agree to buy will be reduced proportionately if one of the exporting countries
withdraws from this agreement.
Provision has been made for the recording of all commercial sales-and this is quite
an added feature-to importing countries to
the international council in order to determine
whether countries have met their percentage
undertakings, and also for the purpose of
establishing the quantitative obligations of
exporting countries. In addition to commercial
transactions, provision is made for the recording of special transactions, including surplus
disposals, defined as those which depart from
normal practice as a result of Government
interference. These special transactions are
not part of the rights and obligations of the
member countries but, together with commercial transactions, are subject to examination
by the council at the annual review of the
performance of the various countries.
Honourable senators will remember this
annual review was one of the most constructive features of the 1959 agreement, being the
introduction of a comprehensive review of
developments affecting the world trade in
wheat. This practice will be continued under
the present instrument.
The review relates to national production,
stocks, prices and trade, including surplus
disposals. For the purposes of the review on
surplus disposal, member countries are required to inform the wheat council of measures taken by them to increase consumption,
to ensure that the disposals take place in an
orderly manner, and to ensure that these
special terms will not be harmful to normal
patterns of production and international commercial trade.
If honourable senators will refer to Part
VII of the Agreement they will note that
Clause 5 of that Part provides as follows:

Part I and Parts III to VII of this
Agreement shall enter into force on 16
July 1962 and Part II on 1 August 1962,
between those Governments which have
by that date deposited instruments of acceptance or accession under paragraphs
(2) or (3) of this Article, provided that
such Governments hold not less than
two-thirds of the votes of exporting
countries and not less than two-thirds of
the votes of importing countriesI trust honourable senators will approve of
this agreement.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, I note that my honourable friend
from Lumsden (Hon. Mr. Pearson) in his
presentation indicated that this wheat agreement was adopted at the final plenary session
of the United Nations Wheat Conference held
at Geneva on March 10. I wonder if that
Wheat Conference was under the auspices of
the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: That is quite right.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Ever since the United
Nations organization was formed, FAO has
been attempting to rationalize the distribution
of wheat throughout the world. As the honourable senator has stated, we have now had
over ten years, experience in connection with
international wheat agreements. Having scanned this present agreement rather hurriedly,
I have not had an opportunity to compare it
closely with the previous agreement, but
obviously it consists of a series of very flexible
clauses dealing with the old and tremendous
problem of distributing supplies of wheat
available in exporting countries to those
countries which may be considered as importing countries.
In our past experience under the International Wheat Agreement the whole outcome
has been subject to varying conditions, due
to different economic factors affecting the relations between the exporting countries and
the importing countries. For example, one
year Great Britain withdrew from the agreement, and in another year we had the rather
irritating experience of our neighbour selling
wheat, contrary to the understanding of the
agreement, at forced sale prices.
We have, therefore, to consider the whole
question of subsidization in the United States
to the extent of billions of dollars today, in
support of wheat prices, and the effect of that
fact on the working of this agreement.
I do not intend to go closely into the provisions of this agreement now, but I think it
would be very important to have it referred
to the Natural Resources Committee, or to
the Banking and Commerce Committee. In

SENATE
that event, we might receive some more enlightenment regarding the performance of the
International Wheat Agreement, for example,
in relation to the Wheat Board, which is
charged with the sale of Canadian grain
abroad.
Having taken an interest in this subject
for some time, I feel that nothing definite
can be said yet regarding this experiment in
international co-operation in the marketing
of these vast surpluses of wheat. As the
honourable senator from Lumsden (Hon. Mr.
Pearson) pointed out, one hopeful feature of
this agreement is that the minimum-maximum price is increased by 12 cents per bushel
over that of the previous three-year period.
This would suggest that the surpluses from
the exporting countries are gradually being
dissipated and that the demand for wheat
estimated by this conference will be greater
in the next three-year period than it has
been in the past three-year period. If that is
so, everyone here will agree that it is welcome news.
In view of the problem of increasing surpluses, which we have had to face for so long,
it is fortunate if the wheel seems to be turning the other way now. We all know that the
results of last year's crop are disappointing
and that the prospect for this year is none
too good as yet. However, that may apply to
other countries as well and may enable the
parties to this agreement to arrange a 12-cent
advance in price, on the basis of No. 1
Northern, delivered at Fort William.
While complimenting the honourable senator from Lumsden (Hon. Mr. Pearson) on
the information he has given us, I would
suggest that some of the officials who have
been closely connected with this matter
should be able to enlighten us further. I
would mention particularly Mr. Wilson,
whom I have known for a good many years.
There is also Mr. McNamara, who is located
in the west. Furthermore, there was an official of the Department of Trade and Commerce present at the Wheat Conference. I
think these people should be present at the
meetings of our committee to give us more
enlightenment on the details of this very
flexibly-worded document.
Hon. Austin C. Taylor: Honourable senators, I should like to say a few words on this
bill. I am familiar with the groundwork
undertaken with the original International
Wheat Agreement when it was arranged and
consummated. I recall quite vividly the work
of the farm organizations in Canada, and
more particularly that of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture in the presentation to
the Government of that day.
We all recognize that no act of Parliament
is foolproof and that there probably are some

loopholes in every act. However, this seems
to be a good agreement. It is an agreement
that is supported by all farm organizations
in Canada, both east and west. So far as I am
concerned I would like to see more international agreements on agricultural commodities. The international wheat agreements have
brought a degree of stability to the wheat producers of western Canada that did not exist
before, and it is my opinion that if we had
more such agreements there would be still
greater stability in agriculture across Canada.
I support the agreement in full. As I have
said, it is probably not perfect, but then I do
not think any agreements are. It is another
attempt to reach an understanding between
importing and exporting nations.
One thing that confuses me is the relationship of the votes. What happens when those of
the exporting countries and those of the importing countries are equal and there is a
tie vote? I do not suppose that will ever
happen, but I wonder what would be the result. I do not know whether the honourable
sponsor of this agreement knows the answer.
However, I do wish to repeat that I support
the International Wheat Agreement, and I
hope that it will be referred to the Standing
Committee on Natural Resources for further
study.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Honourable senators,
may I mention one further point that I
omitted? In Annex B there is a record of
the votes of the exporting countries, but
naturally there is no estimate of the supply
of wheat available for export in terms of
millions of bushels. While I realize it is
impossible to obtain an accurate figure, I
think it would be very interesting to have
the best information as to the surplus available from the exporting countries at the
end of this crop year in prospect for next
year.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Honourable senators,
I was unavoidably absent from the chamber
when the honourable sponsor (Hon. Mr.
Pearson) explained this agreement. Would
he advise me, with respect to the minimum
and maximum prices, what is the f.o.b.
shipping point?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Fort William.

Halifax would be without proper recognition.

SENATE
It is for this reason the bill seeks to change
the name of the riding from Halifax to
Halifax-Dartmouth and County.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators, I am very pleased to be associated with
the distinguished senator from ColchesterHants (Hon. Mr. Blois), who presented this
bill. I was born in Dartmouth and naturally
I am proud of the continued growth and
success of the city of Dartmouth.
This bill is not a Government measure.
It was introduced by a private member in
the other place who no doubt had in mind
the approaching election. I am glad he introduced it, although he did so at a time
when perhaps his chances of representing
this constituency in the future are somewhat dimmer than they were a short time
ago. Naturally he wants to do what he can
for the riding he has been representing.
There has been a marked growth in both
Halifax and Dartmouth. The sponsor has already mentioned that in 1941 the riding of
Halifax had a population of 122,656. By 1956
this population had increased to 197,948, and
finally to its present population of 225,723,
an increase in twenty years of 103,067, making it the third largest riding in Canada.
Halifax alone has a population of 92,511,
while the city of Dartmouth has a population
of 46,966.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): Is this a
dual member constituency?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Yes; and I am just wondering whether the sponsor in the other
place had in mind eventually dividing the
two, Halifax and Dartmouth, and calling
one Halifax West and the other Dartmouth
East.
As the sponsor of the bill in the Senate
has said, the combination of names, HalifaxDartmouth and County, is rather confusing.
It would be strange, for instance, if I referred
to the sponsor here as the honourable senator
from Truro-Colchester-Windsor-Hants,
involving the use of four names to designate
two fine communities, Truro in the county
of Colchester and Windsor in the county of
Hants. I don't know whether people are
going to like the three names, Halifax-Dartmouth and County, or whether it would have
been better for the sponsor in the other
place to have advocated that Halifax be
represented by two members and that Dartmouth be represented by one member. Had
he wished to pay recognition to the wonderful growth in population and prosperity of
that section of the eastern side of Halifax
harbour, he could very well have suggested
Dartmouth be given representation in its own
name.

The bill before the Senate is, of course, a
little prernature at this time for, as you all
know, there is under consideration an electoral distribution of seats according to population and boundaries. I was wondering
whether the introduction of the bill should
not have been delayed, although I certainly
do not propose to advocate delaying its passage at this stage. I want to see Dartmouth,
with its population of 47,000, given proper
representation, and if it cannot have a representative of its own I at least want to see it
joined with Halifax and have the electoral
district described as Halifax-Dartmouth and
County.
Honourable senators, that is all I have to
say about this bill. I am in accord with what
the honourable senator from ColchesterHants (Hon. Mr. Blois) has said and I am
pleased to support the bill on second reading.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, perhaps I should not intervene in a
matter which concerns only the Halifax electoral district, but while I agree with all the
nice things said by the sponsor, the honourable senator from Colchester-Hants (Hon. Mr.
Blois), and the honourable senator from
Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor), I think
there are a few other remarks that should
be made about the bill.
As I understand it, the present electoral
district is Halifax, which includes the city of
Halifax and the city of Dartmouth. The name
Halifax is an old and honoured one in the
province of Nova Scotia and it certainly
means something to everyone in that community. The purpose of this bill is to give
electoral recognition to the status of Dartmouth as a city, and to call the electoral
district "Halifax-Dartmouth and County". I
presume "County" means that portion of the
county of Halifax which is not included in
either Halifax or Dartmouth. If it is becoming desirable to change the names of the
constituencies, then we should go further.
After all, the cities of Halifax and Dartmouth are not the only ones in Nova Scotia.
If we are going to change the names of electoral districts to pay compliments to certain
cities, then we should go the whole way and
change the name of Cape Breton South to
include the city of Sydney. Perhaps we
should go even further and change the names
of all our constituencies so as to include the
names of the various towns located in each
constituency. The proposed name of HalifaxDartmouth and County might be altered to
Halifax-Dartmouth and County of Halifax,
or perhaps the words "and County" should
be left off altogether and it should be simply
Halifax-Dartmouth, so that Halifax could be
taken to mean either the county of Halifax
or the city of Halifax.

APRIL 11, 1962
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Why not include Sable
Island?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Cape Breton): That
is a fairly good suggestion. Perhaps the name
of the riding should be Halifax-Dartmouth,
the County of Halifax and Sable Island.
However, there are some objections from
other parts of Nova Scotia in connection with
this bill, and therefore I would like to see
the bill referred to the Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills, so that the matter can
be discussed further before it is passed.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, before the bill is referred to a committee I would like to say that when one
looks at a list of the constituencies represented
by the members of the House of Commons it
is quite surprising to note how much it has
become the fashion to use hyphenated names
to describe them.
I have great admiration for the city of
Halifax and for the sister city of Dartmouth.
However, I fnd that this bill is unfair. It
mentions only Halifax and Dartmouth. My
honourable friend, the senator who just spoke
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Cape Breton), said
something very sensible when he said that
Sable Island should be included in the name,
and all the townships and parishes surrounding Halifax should also be mentioned, because
if you are to mention Halifax and Dartmouth,
why not Sable Island? Why ignore the bay
that is near Halifax and all the small municipalities that surround the city of Halifax,
which is like a diamond with encrusted pearls
around it?
It is the fashion at this time to give to the
constituencies of Canada names similar to
those of grandees of Spain, which are so
numerous that there is an overcharge on telegrams when they sign them with all their
names. It is very easy to flatter a municipality, or a township, or a city. If Dartmouth
is an important enough city, with a population of 45,000, there could be a county of
Dartmouth-it is a good name-and the city
of Halifax should be divided into two, as has
been suggested, one side according to one of
the cardinal points, and the other side next
to it, and they would be separate counties.
Why should we have just one constituency to
elect two or three members of Parliament?
The county would be better divided. There
should be no constituency represented by two
members of Parliament; the riding should be
one constituency.
However, on account of the esteem that I
have for my honourable friend, the sponsor of
the bill (Hon. Mr. Blois), I will not insist
on it. I have said what I wanted to say, and
I will not insist on calling a division on this
bill.

Hon. Mr. Higgins: May I ask the sponsor
of the bill what is the population of Sable
Island?
Hon. Mr. Blois: I believe it has the large
population of five.
Hon. Mr. Higgins: Not counting the horses.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Ponies.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: May I add just a word that
I forgot to mention? When in 1950 I was
honoured by being appointed to the Senate
I chose as my designation, Halifax-Dartmouth. I must have anticipated this bill.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

REPRESENTATION ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND

READING

Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson moved the
second reading of Bill C-46, to amend the Representation Act.
He said: Honourable senators will, I am
sure, have observed during this session that
this matter of renaming or adding to the
names of various constituencies of Canada
has assumed almost epidemic proportions.
This bill seeks to rename one of the ridings
of Canada, this time in the very far west, in
contrast to the bill discussed a few moments
ago which concerned itself with a far eastern
territory of Canada.
The present name of the riding that is involved in this bill is "Nanaimo" which, as I
am sure all honourable senators are aware, is
a small city on the east side of Vancouver
Island. "Cowichan" is the name of a small
city somewhat further north along the coast
of the island. The constituency also contains
various smaller islands, largely cluttered
around the north of Vancouver Island, called
the "Gulf Islands". It is now proposed to
change the name of the constituency from
"Nanaimo" to "Nanaimo-Cowichan-The Islands".
I think that is all I need to say to honourable senators in regard to this bill, except
perhaps to add that the reason for the change
is that Nanaimo originally was the main population centre of the riding, whereas now
these other parts have assumed a greater importance by virtue of enlargements of population, business, and so forth.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I wonder if I should not convey to
you some views I have about representation.
Naturally, when the election comes there will

SENATE
be someone who will be elected for the constituency of Nanaimo-Cowichan-The Islands,
and it will be either a man or a woman. If
it is a man, he will represent all the women
of the constituency, even those who voted
against him, and all the men of the constituency, both those who voted for him and
those who voted against him; but the member
will represent nobody else outside the limits
of the constituency, unless he or she receives
a special power of attorney to do so. Therefore, the elected member for that constituency
will represent only that constituency. It would
be absurd to say that if a man is elected
there, he will represent all the men of British
Columbia, or if a woman is elected there that
she will represent all the women of British
Columbia, or vice versa.
There is a distinction to be made between
the elected members of Parliament and senators. A senator may be appointed as a tribute
to a certain group of persons, for instance,

new Canadians. A senator so appointed has
much greater representation than a member
of Parliament. There are lady senators who
are appointed to represent a section of the
country-and they do it very well-but on
account of that, they represent a larger area
than any member of Parliament.
That is what I wanted to say. I have said
it, and I am sure that I have been well
understood.
Motion agreed to, and bill read second
time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson moved that the bill
be placed on the Orders of the Day for third
reading at the next sitting.
Motion agreed to.

VETERANS' LAND ACT
BILL TO AMEND-FIRST

READING

The Hon. thie Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bull C-80, to amend
the Veterans' Land Act.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READlING

The. Hon, thie Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Walter M. Aseltine: Honourable senators, copies of the bill have been distributed,
and the honourable senator from Royal (Hon.
Mr. Brooks), who is a former Minister of
Veterans Affairs, wishes to explain the bll
this afternoon, if possible. If that is agreeable,
I would ask permission to proceed with second
reading now.
Borne Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. A. J. Brooks, with leave, moved the
second reading of Bull C-80, to amend the
Veterans' Land Act.
He said: Honourable senators, my statement
in regard to Bill C-80 will be brief. The bill
was very fully discussed on two occasions
in the other place, and was studied thoroughly
and approved by the Standing Committee on
Veterans Aiffairs. Veterans organizations have
examined it and witnesses fromn the Department of Veterans Aiffairs have given
evidence. All have expressed themselves as
being strongly in favour of the bull as it now
stands. No amendments have been suggested.
I may say, honourable senators, that this
does not surprise me, as the legisiation is
simply an extension, or a bringing up to date,
of the provisions contained in a bill passed
in 1959 amending the Veterans' Land Act.
It is also in conform.ity with the established
principle of amending and bringing up to
date ail veterans legislation as contained ini
the Veterans Charter.
May I review briefly the amendments to
the Veterans' Land Act of 1959 and point out
the changes made by this present bil.
Before doing so, I should like to divert for
a moment to pay what I consider a well
deserved tribute to the man who was chiefly

responsible for the great success of our
veterans under the Veterans' Land Act.
It is flot necessary for me to say that I
refer to Brigadier Thomas J. Rutherford, who
recently retired from his position as Chairman of the Farmn Credit Corporation. During
the time I was Minister of Veterans Affairs
I had much to do with Brigadier Rutherford,
and I can say that I have neyer met a civil
servant who was more devoted to his work
or who brought more knowledge and practical ideas to the administration of the particular branch for which he was responsible.
It is no exaggeration to say that the success
of many thousands of veterans under the
Veterans' Land Act ahl across Canada was
due to bis help, wise advice and encouragement.
I also point out, honourable senators, that
it was he who was responsible for the training of an efficient staff of inspectors under
the Veterans' Land Act, a staff which was
later taken to assist in the work of the Farin
Credit Corporation, and which has been doing the same excellent work there that it
did under the Veterans' Land Act.
I shail say no more. The record of this
man in two world wars is well known, and
I did want to pay this tribute to him for the
splendid work he has done la helplng veterans.
Honourable senators wml recall that the 1959
amendments to the Veterans' Land Act greatly
extended the principle of supervised farmn
credit and made available to farmers who
needed it a substantiel amount of additional
capital, thus enabling them to extend their
f arm businesses and lacrease their net returns.
The feasibility of, and the need for, this
type of faim credit had been effectively tested
and demonstrated by the Veterans' Land Act
administration, and the Government was so
impressed with the value to our agricultural
economy o! this f orm of financing that it was
made available to ail farmers through the
Farmn Credit Act, as well as to veterans under
the Veterans' Land Act. The latter act provided assistance to qualfed farmers up to
$20,000 or 75 per cent of the security held
by the director, whlchever was the lesser. The
security included basic herd lvestock and
farm equipment, as well as real property and
at least 60 per cent of the security was la
land and buildings.
Under Bil C-80 the interest rates have not;
been changed; they are 3j per cent on Part I
contracts and 5 per cent on Part III loans.
However, the repayment period for the latter
becomes thirty years instead of twenty-five
as before.

SENATE
Small holders and commercial fishing veterans could borrow under the 1959 amendments, at the time they were settled, $6,000
under Part I and $3,000 under Part III of
the Veterans' Land Act.
Previous to 1959 the limit under Part III
was $1,400, and the veteran was required to
put up $1 of his own for every $2 borrowed.
Under the 1959 amendments he put up $1
for every $3 borrowed. Under the present
bill it is $1 for every $4 borrowed, and the
amount under Part III is increased from
$3,000 to $4,800. Furthermore, the loans may
now be made not only at the time of settlement, as had been the case previously, but
also to veterans already settled.
The combined effect of these proposals increases from $10,000 to $12,000 the maximum
amount available to small holders and commercial fishermen at the initial cost of only
$200 more than they were formerly required to pay.
The amount of assistance available for
home construction under Part Il of the act
is also increased from a maximum of $10,000
in 1959 to $12,000 under the present bill.
In conjunction with this increase the minimum security which a veteran must furnish
to the Director of the Veterans' Land Act
before a contract is entered into is $1,000,
whereas previously it was $800.
Changes made in 1959 in general were
satisfactory to the full-time, well-established
farmer on the so-called economic farm unit,
but it did not meet the needs of veterans
settled on the so-called small family farm,
which constituted about one-third of the total
number of farmers under the Veterans'
Land Act, about 6,000 farms. These people
usually had to supplement their incomes from
off-farm activities, that is, by doing other
work. It was found that being well established
in the matter of years, they did not wish to
amove off their farms, but they remained in
the community, and many required additional financial assistance.
To meet the credit requirement of these
veterans, Bill C-80 contains a new section
under Part III providing for loans, the maximum amount of which would be the lesser
of $6,000 in full, or $12,000 less any indebtedness outstanding on any contracts under
Parts I or III of the act. The amount loaned
cannot exceed 75 per cent of the market value
of the farm land. Interest is charged at 5 per
cent, with a repayment period of 30 years.
It is considered that this provision will greatly
assist this type of farmer.
Another new section in the bill provides
for insurance protection on the life of the
settler under the Veterans' Land Act. It is
a proposal which will enable the Director of

the Veterans' Land Act to arrange on satisfactory terms a group life insurance plan on
a voluntary participating basis. This is a
splendid idea.
Honourable senators will recall that in the
recent legislation amending the War Service
Grants Act the major change was to extend
the period of time for the application from
September 30, 1962 to October 31, 1968. Similar provision is being made in the Veterans'
Land Act, which is now amended, establishing
October 31, 1968 as the deadline by which
veterans must be qualified to make application to participate in the benefits of Part I
of the act.
Another provision in the old act required
veterans to be honourably discharged to
qualify for the purposes of the Veterans' Land
Act. This is now being amended. Veterans
of World War II and Korea who re-enlisted
in the armed forces without being discharged
are now deemed to have been honourably
discharged on September 30, 1947 for World
War II, and October 31, 1953 for those who
served in Korea.
It has been found that in some instances,
without endangering the security position of
the Director of the Veterans' Land Act, better
use can be made of the proceeds from the
sale of oil and minerals, or other property
which is now confined to permanent improvements. Under the new provisions these proceeds may also be used for the purpose of
purchasing livestock, farm equipment and the
payment of debts.
These, honourable senators, are the principal amendments to the act. As was stated
by the Minister of Veterans Affairs in the
other place, an endeavour bas been made to
accomplish two things: first, to bring the act
into conformity with other related acts by
extending the date of the application of the
measure to 1968, so that veterans who have
not been in a position to take advantage of it
may have plenty of time to do so; and, secondly, to introduce certain other amendments
which would make the act better suited to
changing conditions over the past few years.
As I stated at the outset, this bill has
been before the Committee on Veterans
Affairs, and has been approved by them
unanimously.
I will now take up some of the sections of
the bill, and will explain some of the new
sections in particular. May I say in this connection, honourable senators, that explanation
is hardly necessary as far as this and many
other veterans bills are concerned. I do not
think that any bill which has come before
the House of Commons or before this honourable body has contained more complete

APRIL 12, 1992
explanatory notes than those found in veterans legisiation and, 1 might say, particularly
in this bil.
Hon. Mr. Burchili: Did you set the pattern?
Hon. Mr. Brooks: No, I do not claim that
credit.
Hon. Mr. Croil: But you followed it very
well.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Yes, I followed it and, I
hope, improved on it.
Clause 1 is a new clause. As you will see
from the explanatory note, it carnies out
what I mentioned a few moments ago,
namely, the provision that veterans who
served in the Second World War and in the
Korean War, and who enlisted with the
active forces without being discharged, may
now be considered honourably discharged, ini
1947 for Second World War veterans, and
1953 for Korean veterans.
Clause 2: The purpose of this amendment
is to extend the maximum repayment period
from 25 to 30 years.
Clause 3 is also new. The purpose of this
amendment is well explained here: to inicrease the number of uses that a veteran may
make of money he receives for subsurface
rights in land. Previously it had to be applied
to the payment of new land purchased, payment for improvements on his f arm, or to
reduce the amount owing to the director.
Under the amendment it may be applied to
the purchase of cattie, sheep, swine or other
livestock to be used on the farmn, the purchase of f armn equipment, and the payment
of reasonably incurred debts.
Clause 4: The purpose of this amnendment
is similar to that of clause 2, to extend the
Urne from 25 to 30 years.
Clause 5 is a new provision, and a very
important one. Its purpose is to enable the
director to arrange on satîsfactory ternis a
group life insurance plan on a voluntary
participation basis for the protection of those
veterans who have contracts with the director.
It might be asked why is that flot done under
the Veterans Insurance Act. It was very well
pointed out in the veterans committee the
other day that individual insurance policies
taken out under the Veterans Insurance Act
would require a premniumn of approximately
$64 a year for a $10,000 policy for fifteen
years, whereas under group insurance, the
same as they have now under the Farm. Credit
Act, the annual payment would be only $30.
So you can see the great advantage group
insurance will have for veterans, as compared
with the other provision.
Clause 7 is not new; it is merely an extension.
Clauses 8, 9, 10 and il are not new.

Hon. Mr. Pearson: Might I ask the honourable sponsor a question on clause il? The
amount of $10,000 is increased to $12,000, as
the maximum financial assistance to a veteran
in the building of his own house. Would a
veteran who has already received the $10,000
in assistance be entitled to a further $2,000
under this bill or would his having received
the $10,000 originally debar him?
Hon. Mr. Brooks: I think that would debar
him. Most of the veterans have already paid
for their houses. 0f course, this increase takes
into consideration the fact that the cost is
more now than it was when $10,000 was set
as the maximum figure.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask if there is also
a change in clause 10, because the explanatory note reads:
... to increase the maximum financial
assistance by two thousand dollars.
Whereas clause 10 says:
one thousand dollars, whichever Is the
greater.
Would the honourable sponsor mind explaining why it is "one thousand dollars" in
the clause and "'two thousand dollars"~ in
the explanatory note?
Hon. Mr. Brooks: There is an increase of
$200-from $800 to $1,000. Previously the
amount which the veteran could receive was
$10,000. Under this amendment hie can receive $12,000, but instead of putting up $800
he is now required to put up $1,000.
Clause 13 is new. This clause has to do
with the small family farm. Under the old
provisions it was found that where loans
could only be made on farms which were
considered economic units, there were many
small farmers-I think 6,000 is the number
estimated in the Veterans' Land Act-who
had to do other work besides farming in
order to make a living. They have lived so
long in their communities that they do not
wish to move out, and they wish to retain
their f arms. Provision is now made for boans
to this particular group of farmers, which
I arn sure will prove of great help.
Clause 14 is an amendment to section 65,
and I can do no better than read the explanatory note.
This amendment has three purposes:
First it provides that additional boans
under Part III may be made to parttime farming and commercial fishing
veterans at a time when they are already
settled, and not only at the time of their
settiement.
Previously, a veteran who was a small
holder or fisherman could get the loan only
when hie first settled on the land. Under

The success of the act has been due to
the devotion of civil servants and public servants who operated it.
We are very happy to support this bill.
Han. Austin C. Taylor: Honourabie senators,
in my former position in connection with
land settiement, particularly under the
Veterans' Land Act, and because of my
responsibility in my own province, it was
my privilege, pleasure and duty to associate
myseif with and to follow very closely the
administration of the Veterans' Land Act and
the work done by the officiais of the board.
The explanation which has been given by
the sponsor of the bill, the honourable senator
from Royal (Hon. Mr. Brooks) pretty wel
clarifies the situation and explains the need
for the present amendments. As in the case
of many other acts, amendments are required
fram time to tîme. Most of such amendments
are improvements, and we can safely say that
is so ini this particular case.
The honoura-ble senator's familiarity with
the work of the Land Settiement Board, the
Veterans' Land Act Board, his personal interest in veterans and his background as a
Minister of Veterans Affairs demonstrates to
us his knowledge of the situation and the
need for these amendments.
I should like to join with the two previous
speakers in paying tribute to Brigadier Rutherford. Over the years, I have known something about his work, particularly during the
years since the new Farm Credit Act came
into operation. I can see a tremendous improvement under that act. It is true that it
is flot the same as the old Canachian Farm
Loan Act. It has been improved and brought
up to date, and meets a great need in Canada.
I know something about it, as it came under
his administration. Brigadier Rutherford, not
only had the ability to become, and, to remaîn
a great admînistrator, but he has had the
ability to, instil confidence and trust in those
people who get loans and acquire farms under
that board. It has been rare over the years
for anyone ta complain in any particular in
regard to the administration, or the treatment
received from Brigadier Rutherford. Theref ore, it is a great pleasure to join with other
honourable senators ini paying a weil deserved
tribute to him.
There is one point in clause 7 of the bill
which is not very clear to me and which
does not appear to have been explained
thoroughiy. This bill may go to a committee
but, even so, I amn not too clear li regard
ta that clause.

The explanatory note says:
The purpose of this amexidment is to
increase, from three and one-haif to five
per cent, the rate of interest chargeable
by the director subsequent to the date
of rescission of a contract...
I would be obliged for an explanation of
that.
Hon. Mr. Brooks: Honourable senators, I
can explain that particular point. It was introduced to clear up an anomalous situation.
It deals with cases where a farm has been
taken over by the department from a veteran
and later sold. When the veteran took the
farm under Part I he paid 5 per cent interest on his money, as honourable senators are
aware. Later on, if he needed money under
Part III, hie paid Si per cent on his Joan.
Furthermore, if there were any taxes or
items of that nature overclue, he was supposed to pay 5 per cent lnterest on them.
Under section 31 of the act, when the farm
is taken over by the director, ail indebtedness-that is, ail that the veteran owes-wil
bear interest at Si per cent.
The officiais of the department were of
the opinion-and I am sure everyone wil
agree-that the Joan and other indebtedness
on which the veteran was paying 5 per cent
previous to rescission of the contract should
not have been included subsequently at Si
per cent and continued until the property
was resold, but should continue at the rate
of 5 per cent. The point is a rather involved
one and difficuit of explanation. I hope I
have made it clear.
Hon. Mr. Taylor <Westmorland): I am
grateful to the honourable senator for his
explanation.
Motion agreed to and bill read second
time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shahl this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Brooks moved that the bill be
placed on the Orders of the Day for third
reading at the next sitting.
Motion agreed to.

Hon. Mr. Beaubien (Bedford) reported that

AND DIVORCE

On the notice by Hon. Mr. Pouliot:
That he will inquire of the Government:

APRIL 12. 1962
Referring (a) to the first seven words
of section 129 of the B.N.A. Act, 1867,
about the continuance of pre-Confederation existing Laws, Courts, Officers, etc.,
namely, "Except as otherwise provided
by this Act",
-(b)
to "the exclusive legisiative
authority of the Parliament of Canada"
extending to marriage and divorce in
virtue of subsection (26) of section 91 of
the said act, with the exception of the
exclusive powers of Provincial Legisiatures to make laws "for the solemnization of marriage", in virtue of subsection
(12) of section 92 of the said act, and
-(c) the interpretation of the said law
by the Supreme Court of Canada and
the Privy Council on appeal from the
Supreme Court of Canada in the matter
of a reference to the Supreme Court of
Canada of certain questions cancerning
marriage, (1912 A.C., p. 880)1. Did the Government receive any
formai request from any province or any
specific representation from any one to
the effect that the B.N.A. Act, 1867,
should be amended by repealing subsection (26) of section 91 of the said act?
2. If so, from whom and when?
3. In view of the Statutes of Canada:
45 V., (1882), c. 42;
53 V., (1890), c. 36;
13-14 Geo. V, (1923) c. 19;
22-23 Geo. V, (1932) c. 10;
and the Revised Statutes of Canada:
c. 105 of 1906;
c. 127 of 1927: and
c. 176 of 1952, the latter being intituled "An Act respecting Marriage
and Divorce",
did the Government of Canada receive
any specific representation or any formai
request from anyone to the effect that the
Parliament of Canada, in virtue of the
exclusive legislative authority conferred
upon itself by subsection (26) of section
91 of the B.N.A. Act, should repeal article
1301 of the Civil Code of the Province of
Quebec and the second paragraphs of
articles 1265 and 1422 of the said Code,
and amend articles 179 and 180 of the
said Code concerning the rights of married women in the Province of Quebec?
4. If so, from whomn and when?
Han. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, with respect to this inquiry I beg
leave to give a few explanations in order
to make the answer ensier for the department
cancerned.
I should mention, in the first place, that
the Montreal Star of yesterday contained
this news item:
26211-3-33

Equality for Women
Atm of Quebec Plea
The Canadian Women's League, in a
brief it will present ta Premier Lesage
tomorrow, cails for a complete revision
of the province's civil code so that
women can receive f ull legal equality
with men.
I will flot take Up the Urne af the Senate
by reading this news item in full, but I
must say ta those anonymous women-there
is noa individual named in this article-that
they are knocking on the wrong door, and
trying ta sit in the wrong pew, for the
very reason mentioned in this inquiry about
the exclusivity of jurisdlction in matters
af marriage and divorce given ta the Parliament ai Canada by the British North America
Act.
In order ta give thase who are flot familiar
with the law an idea of what is meant by
the references ta the Statutes ai Canada
in Na. 3 ai this inquiry, 1 will say that
they have made permissible, since 1882, marriage between a widawer and a sister ai his
deceased wife; since 1890, marriage between
a widower and his niece, the daughter af the
deceased wife's sister; since 1923, between
a widower and his niece, the daughter af
his deceased wife's brother; since 1932, between a widow and her brother-in-law, the
brother af her late husband, or her nephew,
the son af a brother or sister af her late
husband.
The Hon. the Speaker: That is getting very
close ta incest.
Han. Mr. Pouliat: I do not know, but such
marriages are contrary ta the provisions ai
the Civil Code ai the province ai Quebec
and af similar legîslation that existed in other
provinces. I hold in my hand a copy ai the
Civil Code af Lower Canada which came into
force'in 1866. Article 125 reads as follows:
In the collateral line, marriage is prohibited between brother and sister, legitimate or natural, and between thase
connected in the same degree by alliance,
whether they are legitimate or natural.
Article 126 reads:
Marriage is also prohibited between
uncle and niece, aunt and nephew.
The point I want ta make is that a complete change was made by the Parliament ai
Canada at various intervals, which is found
in the Revised Statutes of Canada (1952)
chapter 176, an Act respecting Marriage and
Divorce.
Honourable senators, I do not abject ta the
federal power ta legisiate on matters ai marriage because, by virtue ai the British North
America Act, they are matters which are

SENATE

within its exclusive jurisdiction, and what
the provinces enact in that regard is ultra
vires.
It seems to be clear that the women are
knocking on the wrong door, and that if they
want a change with respect to the rights of
married women they have either of two
courses to follow. Either they can make
petitions to have family rights, especially
those of marriage and divorce, transferred by
the Parliament of Canada to the provinces by
an amendment to the constitution, or they
can take the train to Ottawa and ask the
Mînister of Justice or the federal Government
to make the change that they have the power
to do. Women have been led in error for a
long time. The first thing those who make
themselves the champions of women's rights
have to do is to learn the ABC of the law,
which they will find in the constitution of
this country, namely, the British North
America Act of 1867.

NOTICE

LAURIER

OF INQUIRY AS TO RUMOURED
CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT

Hon. Percival G. Burchill: Honourable senators, I would like to inquire of the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) whether there is any truth to the
report which has been circulated that it is
planned to turn over the management of the
Chateau Laurier to American interests. Those
of us who for many years have made the
Chateau our home when in Ottawa are somewhat disturbed by this rumour. The Chateau
Laurier is a Canadian institution; I think it
is to Ottawa what the Chateau Frontenac is
to Quebec. It has character and atmosphere,
and we would be very sorry to see anything
happen that might destroy its Canadian
identity.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I will take the question
as a notice, and will make inquiries.

LAWS

Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson inquired of
the Government pursuant to notice:
1. Has Canada received from the Secretary General of the United Nations a
"Questionnaire on Inheritance Laws as
they affect the Status of Women" which
the Status of Women Commission, following its 14th session in March, 1960,
requested the Secretary General to have
circulated and a reply prepared for the
16th Session of the Status of Women
Commission, which questionnaire was
circulated by the Secretary General to
the governments of States members of
the United Nations, members of the
specialized agencies and parties to the
Statutes of the International Court of
Justice under date of June 17, 1960?
2. If so, when was the questionnaire
received by Canada?
3. Has Canada replied to the questionnaire and, if so, when?
4. In view of the fact that other federal countries such as Australia, Austria,
Brazil, India, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, besides the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (which
forwarded replies for England and
Wales,
Scotland,
Northern
Ireland,
Guernsey, Jersey, and Isle of Man as
well as on behalf of Aden, Bermuda,
British Guiana, British Honduras, British

Islands, Grenada, Hong Kong, Jamaica,
Malta, Mauritius, Sarawak, Seychelles,
Sierre Leone, Singapore, St. Vincent,
Swaziland, Tanganyika, Tonga, Trinidad

to forward to the Secretary General answers to the Questionnaire in time for
their replies to be included in the report
dated January 4, 1962, prepared by the
Secretary General for study at the 16th
Session of the Status of Women Commission which convened in New York on
March 19, 1962, why was Canada's reply
to the Questionnaire, if any was made,
not included in the report of the Secretary General?

SENATE
As honourable senators have had these estimates before them for at least a month, I
hope that we shall be able to deal with them
expeditiously tomorrow afternoon.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: May I ask the honourable Leader of the Government if these are
the supplementary estimates known as No. 4?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is correct. They
are theý,inal supplementaries for the fiscal
year whiêh ended on March 31 and which were
not passed before the expiration of the last
fiscal year.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Before my honourable
friend moves the adjournment, which I take
it he is about to do, may I inquire of him if
he has any information that he can give the
house as to when we are likely to receive
the measure for Senate reform?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I am surprised at the
honourable senator from Churchill asking me
that question. The bill has been introduced
and has been given first reading in the other
place, but it has yet to receive second reading. I have no information as to when it will

receive second reading, or when it will reach
the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If I may be permitted to
say a word on this, I mention the matter
because the first reading took place in the
other house more than a week ago. Some of
my colleagues and- I-though I have not been
here for reasons beyond my control-would
like to know what arrangements we can make
about moving homewards. One cannot obtain
reservations at this time of the year with a
24-hour notice.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I presume one reason
second reading of the bill bas not been reached
in the other place is that the available time
has been spent on these supplementary estimates.
I have learned by reading the press of the
country that the Prime Minister made a statement in the other place on Friday last to the
effect that he would make an announcement
early this week.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

were for the good of the community generally. He was forthright in his words and in
his actions.
He and I were closely associated for many
years. We served together in the Legisiature
of Nova Scotia. We became members of the
Government and were sworn ini on the same
day. He went on to become Minister of Agriculture and Marketing, in which position he
was eminently successful. He brought to that
position a college degree, a knowledge of the
f arm, experience in the mnarket place, and a
splendid ambition to serve the farmers; of the
province of Nova Scotia, in which task especially he succeeded to a marked degree.
Everyone who knew Senator McDonald
admired him for his fine qualities9. He was a
good man, and he was always on the side for
good. He advocated the ennobling things of
if e: culture, knowledge, and the discipline
that enriches and strengthens a people.
The late senator and I entered the Senate
the same day, 17 years ago tomorrow, and
here he was a distinguished and faithful representative from our province. Hie was an
outstanding member of the Baptist communion, a leader in the church and devoted to
its missions. He was a good Nova Scotian
whose achievements and influence will long
be counted in that province. His memory wilU
remain green for many years to corne.
To his wife and son, I join with the leaders, and with all those who will think of them,
in extending our affection and our sympathy
in this their day of sorrow.
1 hope that as the years go by, and only
time will cure the bereavement to a certain
extent, they will again be happy in the memory of so grand and so good a man. The son
had a splendid father and the wife had a
devoted husband for whom everybody in the
province of Nova Scotia had great admiration.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable
senators, may 1 also add a word of tribute
to Senator John A. McDonald. I join with
those who have spoken in expressing our
regret at his passing and in extending sympathy to his widow and son.
Senator John A. McDonald had a long
and distinguîshed career in public if e. I
suppose that he is best known in Nova Scotia
for his work as Minister of Agriculture and
Marketing in that province. He became minister at a very difficult time, when the depression was most intense, but with his expert
knowledge and under his guidance, his department was able to do much to assist the
agricultural industry in Nova Scotia.
Senator McDonald was a dedicated man,
whose principal interest was to assist those
engaged in farming, especially the small
farmer, so that they might enjoy a better

standard of life. I have always f elt that it
was a great tribute to him, when he gave up
hîs department, that a testimonial banquet
was held for him in Nova Scotia and that
hundreds of small farmers travelled many
miles to be present and to pay their tribute
to this fine man.
When he came to this chamber, he could
speak with great authority on agricultural
problems affecting not only the Maritime
Provinces but the whole of Canada.
Apart from. his public career, we from
Nova Scotia like to remember Senator McDonald in his private capacity. Hie was a
man of high prînciple, an upright and honourable man in ahi his dealings, in both his
private and public life. He earned for himself
the trust, the affection and the respect of
those who knew him, especiahly of the people
who knew hima best, the people of Nova
Scotia.
He was always a kind man, patient and
courteous. Hie was that type of man who
was quick to see the virtues of others and
who found it difficult to see their faults.
This was a distinguished son of Nova Scotia
and the people of that province will mourn
his passing.
Hon. Austin C. Taylor: Honourable senators, I wish to share in the tributes being
paid this afternoon in memory of our colheague, the hate Senator John A. McDonald.
I do not think there is anyone in this chaxnber, other than his former associates in the
Legisiature of Nova Scotia, who knew hini
better than I did. From the time I becamne
a minister in the Government of New Brunswick, until 1945, when "John A.", as I knew
him and calhed him, was summoned to the
Senate, he was ahways available for advice.
I can assure you that throughout my politica]
experience and public ife I neyer met anyone
who gave me as good advice or whose judgment 1 regarded more highly.
Senator McDonald worked hard for the
peophe he represented. 1 can recahi the many
fights he and others put up on behaîf of
the farmers of the Atlantic provinces. I
should like to refer to two achievements for
which he was probably more responsible than
any other person, and which to my mind
stand out as a tribute to his endeavours.
The first was the development of the Maritime Marshland Rehabilitation program, and
the second was the bringing into effect of
the feed-freight assistance program which
has been supported by the western farmers.
Those are two of the outstanding contributions he made to Canadian agriculture.
John A. McDonald was a man of integrity,
honesty and determination, possessed with a
quality of friendliness seen in few men. To
me, a friend is the most wonderful asset any

APRIL 17, 1962
human being can have, and John A. was a
real friend ai mine. It can well be said ai
hlmn that he builded better than he knew.
Certainly his endeavours will long be remembered.
Honourable senators, I want ta associate
myseli with those who have spoken in paying tribute ta John A. McDonald, and ta say
that I share ta a large extent the loss of this
great Canadian. I join with others in extending ta Mrs. McDonald and their son my
deepest sympathy.
(Translation):
Han. Cyrille Vaillancourt: Honourable senators, I should like ta pay a humble tribute ta
the deceased. The Senate has just last a member who was more than a hard-worklng man.
Some people dlaim that senatars do nathing.
I wauld have liked those people ta see our
late calleague in action; they would have
tound out that he was always where duty
ralled him.
The greatest tribute I can pay ta aur friend,
the late Senator McDonald, is ta say that not
only have the Eastern provinces lost a praminent figure, a man who got things done, but
the whole agricultural industry in Canada
has been deprived ai one ai its greatest
experts. His knowledge was extensive not only
ini regard ta farm.tng, but also with respect ta
the econamic aspects of agriculture.
I had been a senator for a year when
Senator McDonald was appointed ta the Upper
Hause. 1 got in touch with hlm because we
shared the same views on many questions.
He was sa conversant on matters ai agriculture and agricultural ca-operatives that we
understood each other perfectly even thaugh
his English was perfect and mine very poor.
We understood each other because there is
only one language in the field of ca-aperatives, that of the heart, which any man can
understand.
Senator McDonald was the farmers' frîend.
He renovated agriculture in Nova Scotia and
throughaut the Maritimes. Not only do I owe
hlmi a tribute, but the expression af my deepest gratitude, for more than once he guided
me thraugh paths whlch personally I found
well-nigh impassable.
Another thing whlch ail those who spoke
before me mentioned was that Senator
McDonald practised what hie preached.
His whole lufe through, he set the example
ai a sincere believer. We aiten discussed
certain moral aspects ai the life ai some
people, but he kept repeating that when one
follows the straight and narrow path, one
26211-3-34

always achieves one's goal, whatever difficulties have to be overcame. In addition, on
certain days Senator McDonald was good
enough ta give me English lessons, thus enabling me to improve samewhat, for it is f ar
from perfect, my knowledge of the English
language. This 1 did while warking with hlm.
on a subject in which we were bath interested,
that is agriculture.
Another thing which impressed me was the
affection that this perfect couple had for
one another. They were always seen here
together like two young loyers and it
could have been said that as in the early
days of their marriage they were having a
perpetual honeymaon. And when you met
them together, you could feel, not only that
affection, but that love that husband and
wif e should have for each other.
I have no daubt that the Master who knows
how ta recompense thase who have done good
on earth has already given aur friend, Senator McDonald, the reward he s0 richly deserved: everlasting happiness in His paradise.
(Text):
Han. F. Esile Inman: Honourable senators,
as a feilow Maritimer I should like ta pay
tribute ta a very distinguished colleague and
outstanding citizen af the Maritime provinces.
Senator John A. McDonald was a gentleman
in the finest sense of the word. Understanding and considerate, he was ready ta give
advice whenever It was sought. In his passing
we have lost a valuable member of this
chamber.
Oi his services ta his country, athers have
spoken. I thought of Senator McDonald, as
did so many others in the Senate, as a loyal
and dearly beloved friend. We praise him and
thank God for men of his calibre. His friendship enriched life for us and strengthened
aur iaith in hlm as in God. To his widow and
ta bis son, I join with those who have already
spoken in heartfelt sympathy.

CUSTOMS ACT
BILL TO AMEND-FIRST

READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-79, to arnend
the Customs Act.
Bill read fIrst time.
SECOND READING

Hon. Lionel Choqueite, with leave of the
Senate, moved the second reading of the
bill.
Hle said: Honourable senators, this is a bill
ta amend the Customs Act, and its purpose
is ta extend the time limitations irnposed
by sections 43, 56, 57, 58, 62 and 113 of that
act.
Since the enactment of section 43 in 1955,
the department has received repeated representations tram importers that the time
periods-sixty days for making a request ta
a Dominion Customs Appraiser for a redetermination or a reappraisal of goods, and
thirty days for a request ta the deputy minister for a review of a Dominion Customs
Appraiser's decision-are so short that those
campanies which operate nationally, but have
centralized records and accounting systems,
have difficulty gathering within the allatted
time the information and documentation required ta support their request.
In light of those representations, it is considered that the present time limits of sixty
and thirty days respectively should be extended to ninety days.
With regard to reporting instances of damage, destruction or misdescription of gaods,
importers have camplained that the present
time limit of fourteen days is tao short,
since frequently it is impossible for them ta
examine their gaods carefully within that
period af time..
Many companies shut down completely for
annual vacation periods of up ta two weeks.
Moreover, companies that clear goods at
variaus ports across the country, but whose
purchasing and accaunting records are kept
at head offices, on occasion do not learn of
discrepancies until it is too late ta report
them. It is teit that thirty days is a more
realistic time limit, in view of present day
business practices.

The anly prapased changes in the present
act are in the five sections mentioned In this
bill. Where there is sixty days, it will read
ninety days; where there is thirty days, it
will read ninety days; and where there is
fourteen days, it will hencefarth read thirty
days. It is merely a pracedural matter.
To summarize, this new legisiatian is Introduced because of the requests af several
companies over a periad of years. The time
limits for appeals and for launching pratests,
being toa short, should be extended tram
thirty ta ninety, tram sixty ta ninety, and
tram fourteen ta thirty days, as set out in
the bill.
Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Hanaurable senatars, the sponsor of this bill (Han. Mr. Choquette) bas given a very satisfactary and a
very clear explanation of it. It is the kind of
legisiation I like, because it represents an
amelioration in tax matters. In dealing with
the Dominion Customs Appraiser, the time
for getting ta him in cannectian with any reappraisal is being extended. That is a goad
teature. The rights of persans should nat be
circumscribed by prescribing taa short a
periad of time within which those persans
may act.
The same principle applies in connection
with applications for abatement in the
amaunt of duty which bas been paid or ta
which the gooda may be subi ect on the basis
of an ad valorem value because of the tact
that the gaods may have been damaged in
transit.
The extension af time for such purposes
marks a great impravement. In modern business many points of difficulty may arise.
For instance, the gaods may not be removed
tram. the original packages until they get ta
their ultimate destination, which wauld be
the customer. It is a wise mave and in the
interest of business people ta extend from
faurteen ta thirty days the time limit tor
making a dlaim in those cases wheme goads
are damaged in the course o! transit by railway or other land or watem conveyance.
Section 3 af the bill alsa extends tram
taurteen ta thirty days the time in which an
importer may decide whethem ta accept goods
in their damaged condition, paying duty on
a lower evaluatian, or abandon them ta the
customs authomity. This change is in the intemest of the importer.
Then theme is a section which deals with
the matter of mefund a! duty on goads damaged while they may be said ta be in the
possession o! the customs authority, whether
maving in bond or being held in bond. The
time limit for filing a dlaim bas been extended tram faurteen ta thimty days. If a
businessman had only one transaction ta, deal

intelligence to the act we re-enact. I do not
think this is very intelligent; I think it is
rather foolish. Why should we pass a bill
just changing the number of days? Why
not apply a little thought or make some
explanation that would justify our accepting
this in re-enacting the section?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: May I be permitted to
make a comment? I suggest that consideration be given by the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) to submitting this
suggestion to the customs department, that
there might be an additional subclause inserted in this section which would provide
for condemning the goods as a necessary
prerequisite step, in order that they might
then be given away for some charitable purpose; but first of all condemn them, and
then give them away as an alternative to
selling them for the amount of duty and
cost.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Sell for anything you
can get, as long as you can get something.
Why should the department not have a
discretion in this matter? The section does
not say the goods "may be destroyed"; it
says they "shall be destroyed", if they cannot
be sold for a certain sum sufficient to pay
duties and charges, and that sum may be
very considerable.

Honourable senators, after giving my blessing to this bill I cannot help but take one
little parting thrust at my honourable friend
from Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Choquette). I
congratulate him that his sights in regard
to time limits for appeal have suddenly been
adjusted to what I would call normal, and in
the interests of the taxpayer. It was not so
long ago in this place that we were attempting to provide even a teeny-weeny opportunity for appeal, and my friend was vigorous
in his argument that there was no need for
it.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I should like to raise a question with
regard to section 3 of the bill, which reads
as follows:

4. If so, from whom and when?
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I would like to know if the honourable Minister of Justice has returned to fulfil his duties as such.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I
understand, after inquiry, that the Minister of
Justice is still absent and I have not been
able to get the answers to the honourable
member's inquiry.
QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE

Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Honourable senators, I
now rise on a question of privilege. The place
of the Minister of Justice-and I have known
several ministers of justice-is in his seat in
the House of Commons of Canada during the
session, except when he is called away from
Ottawa or out of the country on national
business.
I regret this very much, for I have a great
deal of esteem for the present incumbent of
that position, who is a distinguished confrère,
a fellow member of the bar. But I cannot conceive why it is, when there are important
matters to be looked after, that a senior minister such as the Minister of Justice runs
away from his official duties as guardian of
the law. I remember Mr. Lapointe; I remember Mr. Guthrie, who was most impressive as
Minister of Justice. When he spoke he said
what was the law, and everybody listened to
him with great respect.
I regret honourable senators, that I am unable to repeat to you what I have been told.

I will not tell you that, but what I know and
what I am sure of is that I have the right
to presume that the Minister of Justice has
left Ottawa in order not to answer the very
inquiry which is on the Order Paper in my
name.
Hon. Mr. Aselfine: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: And at the request of the
various provincial attorneys general in Canada. A copy of my inquiry has been sent to
the chief justices of all the provinces of
Canada. A copy has not been sent to the
Supreme Court because the justices of that
court receive the Senate Hansard. For the
same reason it has not been sent to honourable senators, but it has been sent to the
lawyers in all parties in the House of Commons. It has been sent to the Press Gallery,
not for publicity, but to inform them about
this most important matter. I know what was
the reaction. Apparently, the telephone wires
have been alive with requests that the inquiry should not be answered. There have
been telephone calls from coast to coast to
beg the Prime Minister and each member of
the Cabinet, including the Minister of Justice himself, not to answer it. He chose the
easiest manner in which to avoid answering
officially those questions I have the right to
have answered. He has gone, gone with the
wind. What will the people in the western
part of Canada who have an interest in this
think of it? They are looking after the
electionHon. Mr. Aseltine: I object to the statement being made by the honourable senator.
What he says is absolutely unfounded. The
Minister of Justice never left Ottawa, except
on business, and that has nothing to do with
his not answering the inquiry of the honourable senator.
Hon. Mr. Pouliol: The honourable senator
is loyal to his minister, and I congratulate
him for it, but as there are telephone wires
between Ottawa and every part of the country
it would have been easy for the Minister
of Justice to give instructions to his department to answer these very questions. His
voice must be familiar to his deputy minister;
his voice must be familiar to his parliamentary assistant or secretary; his voice must be
familiar to his own office. It would have
been easy for him to telephone the appropriate one and give instructions as to how these
questions should be answered.
That they have not been answered I regret very much, not for myself, but for the
Minister of Justice and the Government. The
Prime Minister has a copy of these questions, as has the Leader of the Opposition
and the Leader of the New Democratic Party.

APRIL 18, 1962
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of Bill C-89, copies of which have just been
distributed to honourable senators, is for
granting to Her Majesty certain sums of
money for the public service for the financial
year ending March 31, 1962. It provides for
the sum of $138,416,981, being the final supplementary estimates for the fiscal year ended
March 31.
The bill is in the usual form. with the exception of section 4, which it was necessary to
include because these supplementary estimates
were not passed prier to March 31 last. That
section reads as follows:
Notwithstanding the provisions of the
Fînancial Administration Act, the amounts
appropriated by this act may be paid at
any time on or before the thirtieth day
of April, one thousand nine hundred and
sixty-two, and such payment shaîl be
deemed to have been made in and be
chargeable to the fiscal year ending the
thirty-first day of March, one thousand
nine hundred and sixty-two.

The items I have mentioned amount to a
total of $121,358,776, and make Up the greater
part of the total of these final supplementary
estimates.
I will now give te honourable members
some information about the total amount
which will have been voted when these supplementary estimates are passed. That
amount wilI be $4,235,769,488. The balance
of the total expenditures for the fiscal year
1961-62 is made up of statutory items which
do not require to be voted.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): What do
they amount to?

SENATE

I do not want it thought that I am critical
of the Canadian National Railways. In fact,
I want to pay tribute to the organization.
Anybody who travels as much as I do on the
Canadian National Railways, and in particular on the wonderful Ocean Limited,
must be proud that we Canadians have such
a superb train. I feel that it is a great credit
to Canada. I want to say that its whole crew,
its conductors, porters, and in fact everyone
connected with it, have been most courteous
and helpful, and have endeavoured in every
way they possibly could to make our travelling comfortable and pleasant. I am sure
all who travel on that train will support that
tribute.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I do not want to take
anything away from the Canadian National
Railways, as far as rail operations are concerned. The management has a difficult job
on its hands. Transportation in this country
is a challenging responsibility, and the difficulties are not made any easier when the
system is being operated for the Government. I have always believed in the doctrine -and my belief has been confirmed
since coming to Ottawa as a parliamentarian
-that any area in which private enterprise
will operate should be free of Government
competition. In fields where private enterprise is willing to risk capital it should be
allowed to do the work. The Government
should operate only in endeavours which
private enterprise will not enter, and which
can better be served by Government operation. In that connection, we find that the
Canadian National Railways system, in order
to provide rail service, is building hotels,
but in its great wisdom it then turns those
hotels over to management people to operate and manage, as has been done in the case
of the Queen Elizabeth Hotel.
In the light of that policy, with which I
agree, it is most difficult to understand how
that organization can justify embarking upon
a project which involves spending $40 million
to build a microwave system from Halifax
to Vancouver and go into competition with
the large telephone companies of this country.
As honourable senators know, there is a
highly efficient microwave system serving
the nation at the present time, operated by
the Trans-Canada Telephone System. That
system consists of the following telephone
companies:
The Avalon Telephone Company of
Newfoundland;
Maritime Telegraph and Telephone
Company, operating in Nova Scotia and
Prince Edward Island;

The New Brunswick Telephone Company Limited, operating in New Brunswick;
The Bell Telephone Company operating
in Ontario, Quebec, Labrador, and parts
of the Northwest Territories;
Manitoba Telephone System of Manitoba;
Saskatchewan Government Telephones
of Saskatchewan;
Alberta Government Telephones of Alberta; and
British Columbia Telephone Company
of British Columbia.
The Trans-Canada Telephone System was
established in 1931 to co-ordinate and develop
long-distance services on a national scale.
Each member of the system is responsible for
providing local telephone service in the communities within its territory. In addition, each
member is responsible for making available
long-distance services to interconnect these
communities and, through the facilities of its
associates in the telephone industry, to provide access to other parts of Canada and the
world.
The first coast-to-coast telephone network
using wholly Canadian facilities was opened
by the system in 1932, thirty years ago. As
the national economy expanded the demand
for long-distance communication services increased, and the decision was made to construct a microwave radio relay system. This
was completed in 1958 at a cost of $40 million.
This system now carries between 250 and
1,000 telephone circuits. It also carries network television programs for both the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the CTV
system.
The capacity of this system can be increased
to some 20,000 telephone circuits and three
two-way television channels. This increase
will be made whenever demand for service
justifies it. The point I want to emphasize is
that the cost of making this increased capacity will be very much less than the building of a new system. The potential capacity
of the system is more than sufficient to meet
ail foreseeable requirements, including those
of the railways and of the Canadian Overseas
Telecommunication Corporation. The system
has offered to provide Canada's railways with
all the communication systems they require,
at rentals which are far below the cost the
railways would incur if they built the facilities themselves.
Since its foundation, the Trans-Canada
Telephone System has improved the scope
and quality, and reduced the cost of its services. In 1932, for example, some 32,000 calls
were completed over the system's facilities.
By 1952 the number had risen to 796,000, and

APRIL 18, 1962
by 1960, following completion of the microwave system, it exceeded 2,250,000 per annurn. Along with this, long-distance telephone
rates have been voluntarlly reduced, providJng an important stimulant to the Canadian
econorny.
Since the system was formed there have
been seven rate reductions, and another is
planned to take effect in May this year. To
illustrate the progressive lowering of rates,
one can consider the cost of a three-minute
daytime station-to-station eall between Halifax and Vancouver. In 1932 it cost $9.75; in
1952 it was $4.90; today it costs $3.70; and in
May the proposed cost will be only $3.35.
Similarly, the cost of a three-rninute nightUrne station-to-station caUl between these two
cities has dropped fromn $5.75 in 1932 to $2.80,
today. Honourable senators can at present
talk between Halifax and Vancouver for three
minutes at nighttime for $2.80.
It is anticipated that within a few years
the growth in east-west telephone traffie
will make desirable a more direct connection
than that provided at the present time by
the trans-Canada microwave system, and it
15 expected that an alternate trans-Canada
microwave system will be fully cornpleted
within five years.
Honourable senators, I think I have said
enough to convince you that the proposai
of the railways to construct a parallel system
is not sound. For the foreseeable future, Canada will no more need three parallel networks competing with one another than she
wi]1 need a microwave system to the moon.
Apart fromn the expenditure of capital
moneys, which is important, the construction
o! another network would mean a loss of
business to the present systemn and this, in
turn, would undermine the financial health
of its memibers. Another network would
affect every individual member of the telephone system in Canada and would ultimately have the effeet of raising telephone
rates. Therefore, this proposae if it materializes, will affect every telephone user
in this land.
The announcement was made in the press
flot so very long ago that the railways intended to spend $40 million for the construction of this microwave systern, which I
say is not required, and which will only do
damage to the Trans-Canada Telephone System. The present systemn is doing a wonderful
Job for us in Canada and is taking good
care of our economnie requirements.
Honourable senators, I have presented this
Information at this time under this item
of our legisiative business because I feel
that it is a matter of great national concern
about which honourable senators should be
informed.

Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Can the honourable
senator say if there has been a corresponding
reduction in short distance rates by the individual telephone companies?
Hom. Mr. Burchiil: In sorne instances, yes,
but not generally.
Hon, Mr. lanor: May I inquire as to the
purpose of this move by the C.N.R.? I think
there are two very important questions to
be answered.
Hon. B. B. Hornor: Honourable senators,
I should like to say a few words about this
subject. After we held a meeting of the Standing Cornmittee on Tourist Traffic I received
a pleasing letter from Donald Gordon, President of the Canadian National Railways. He
enciosed a number o! attractive advertising
brochures and posters published by the
C.N.R. These posters display wonderful Canadian scenes, and if any honourable senator
wishes to see them I will, make thern available.
It occurred to me that perhaps the Canadian Travel Bureau could work more
closely with the publicly-owned C.N.R., and
the president did inform me that his cornpany was conducting an extensive advertising
program throughout the United States and
elsewhere. In reply to his letter I told him
I had heard many complaints about the new
symbol "CN" being used on Canadian National Railway equipment. In my opinion,
the new monogramn "CN" looks like a twisted
piece of wire, and apparently it is not proving to be as popular as the old C.N.R.
monogram.
I just wanted to mention that Donald
Gordon has shown an interest in the work
o! our Tourist Traffic Comrnittee, and to inforrn honourable senators that these folders
would be available for their perusal.
I should like to say how pleased I arn that
the C.N.R. hotel in Ottawa finally built a
parking lot and new entrance on its west side,
which was a project I suggested be undertaken rnany years ago. I think the time has
corne for the hotel to add more rorns. With
Canada's rapid growth in population, the
railways have seen fit to enlarge their hotels
in such centres as Edmonton and Toronto,
and this should also be done in Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): Are you
proposing that 500 rooms be added to the
Chateau Laurier?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yes. I arn speaklng of
ordinary guest rooms. Sorne of the present
rooms in the Chateau Laurier are too large
to be profitable, but the hotel is well equipped
with convention and banquet moims. It is a
beautiful building but 1 think an additional
500 moins could be added at the back without

SENATE
detracting too much from the general appearance of the present structure. I am sure this
addition is bound to come, and it should not
be too long delayed.
Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators, the Chairman of the Standing Committee
on Tourist Traffic, the honourable senator from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner), has referred
to criticism made of the new monogram or
design "CN". I have heard similar criticism
but I should like to say-and I think I know
a little bit about this-that it is a simple design, modern in every sense and, in my view,
is very much smarter in appearance than the
old initials "CNR". While it may take a little
time to become accustomed to the new monogram, it represents a step in the right direction, that of streamlining and smartening up
the C.N.R. organization to meet the standards
of the twentieth century.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators,
the discussion which has just taken place in
connection with one item illustrates how
desirable and necessary it is to bring in a bill
such as this long before the dying hours of
Parliament.
I should like to say something about the
activities of the Canadian National Railways.
If I were to do so I would have to disagree
with my honourable friend from Banff (Hon.
Mr. Cameron), who, of course, is much better
informed than I am about art and designs.
However, I look at it from a practical business point of view.
For many years we have seen boxcars
standing in railway yards all over Canada,
and the United States as well, bearing the
emblem of the maple leaf on each side. In
the centre of that green maple leaf were the
white initials CNR. This has been a familiar
advertising symbol for the Canadian National
Railways for some 50 to 75 years. Now my
well-versed friend in art, the honourable
senator from Banff, says that this monogram
"CN", which I say you can hardly recognize
as you see it on the side of a train as it
passes, is smart, simple and modern in design.
I agree with the Chairman of the Standing
Committee on Tourist Traffic that it looks
like a twisted piece of wire. I doubt very much
that it has resulted in an improvement so far
as business is concerned.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: The company could
restore the maple leaf.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: That is fine. Write to Mr.
Gordon about it. I wrote to him about this
very point, and he sent me a long letter telling
me how times have changed, and so on.
Realizing that I am 77 years old, I say
nothing more.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Braniford): We are
going to put the maple leaf on the flag.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I think that the Canadian
National Railways are to be complimented on
their recent endeavour to create more business, particularly from Montreal to Halifax,
by the lowering of rates. That, I believe, is a
good move. Business firms do it in the form
of clearance sales once or twice a year. It
brings them many new customers and millions of dollars of additional revenue. I think
Mr. Gordon and the C.N.R. are to be congratulated for their endeavour to increase
traffic, especially on the Ocean Limited.
Honourable senators, I repeat that it is a
mistake for this or any Government to bring
in estimates in the closing hours of Parliament. As senators, we cannot do justice to
them, and I do not think the public appreciates the thought of our rushing through
billions of dollars of supply in the short time
we have at our disposal. I know that if we
were to raise a question on one of the External Affairs items and ask the honourable
Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) to explain, for instance, how
Canada's contributions to the Congo compare
with those of other nations, whether we are
doing more than our share, and whether we
are enjoying the prestige we should by our
increased support, it would take him some
little time to answer such a question. There
are questions one would like to ask about
other items, but we have not the time to deal
with them. I think that is a deplorable situation. Not only that, but we are asked to pass
items that should have been passed by March
31, 1962. The honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), who introduced
this bill, has brought to our attention these
various items of expenditure, but there is
not sufficient time to discuss them.
Now, it is a good principle to attempt to
pay off our debts, but I wonder if the Government's expenditures now being provided
for will be added to the deficit it has been
building up ever since the day it assumed
office. I believe Canada is losing the prestige
she has always enjoyed in the past, and also
her good reputation for credit.
Honourable senators, we have had four
supplementary estimates placed before us
involving large expenditures. Let me read
from an editorial in the Montreal Gazette
of April 12 last-a publication that is fairly
friendly to the present Government:
The situation now is that the country
has overspent itself. And the time has
come to switch the emphasis away from
what governments can give, or people
would like, to what government and

APRIL 18, 1962
people must undertake together; namely,
the hard, steady, determined task of earning.
That is what must be done ta balance the
budget. Instead, we are incurring a deficit of
$745 million this year, as weil as the extras
which wiil accumulate, as they dld iast year
and the year before.
Here is another paragraph tram the editonial which, by the way, bears the appropriate heading: "There's Hope in Facing
Facts":
Every province in Canada is budgeting
for a deficit. The pressure of these regianal needs is nat ta be withstaod, especially in education, and health, and
other services ta expanding communities.
Well, that is ail right, but the tact is ail ten
provinces are budgeting for a deficit, and lIf al
are to follow the example of the federal Government, where will this country be, fram a
pure business standpoint, 10 or 20 years hence?
Will we in future enjoy the position of financial prestige which we have enjoyed in the
past? These are matters to which we must
give seriaus cansideration. In this program of
spending, spending, spending, we must give
same thought ta meeting aur financial obligation, flot by creating paper maney, but by
earnings, and by developing ail of aur resources.
With regard ta, the deficits created by the
present Governrnent alone, we cauld, as a
straight business proposition, go ta the city
of Toronto with the amount of thase deficits
and purchase the entire assets of that city.
This is an alarming situation.
Honourable senatars, 1 do nat want ta talk
electian, but I arn sure that the working man,
the man in business, and indeed people in
ail wa]ks of life, are agreed that the unemnployment situation created by this Government is shocking, as also is the huge deficit
it has created. It is a seniaus situation, and 1
hope the Leader of the Gavernment (Hon. Mr.
Aseitine) wili give consideration ta the points
I arn trying ta make. The Minister of Finance is less experienced in financial niatters,
but I arn told he is a good lawyer. Perhaps
the leader will try ta get the minister ta present another budget at the next session-if
he has the apportunity of doing sa-ta see if
he cannot work towards a balanced budget.
I have one particular question ta ask the
Leader of the Government with regard ta
Vote 764, for $8,500,000, the loan ta the Central Mortgage and Hausing Corporation under
the National Housing Act. Just what is the
purpose of that particular loan?

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: 1 have the breakdown
in the records before me, but it would take
quite a long time ta give the full explanation.
However, I shaîl endeavour ta answer the
honourable senator.
In Newfoundland, $98,535 was spent, of
which the carporation's share was 75 per
cent, or $73,901; in New Brunswick, $526,538,
of which the carparation's share was $394,904;
Nova Scotia, $3,383,243, carporation's share,
$,537,432; and s0 on. This is the expianation:
In compliance with subsection (3)(a) o! section 36 of the National Housing Act, 1954, the
Minister of Public Works may advance ta the
corporation for the purpose of meeting the corporation's share of the capital cast of projects
undertaken under this section such arnounts
as rnay be requested by the corporation. The
arnount drawn from the speciai accaunt as
advances ta Central Martgage and Housing
Corporation for housing and land assembiy
projects undertaken jaintly with provincial
governments during the caiendar year 1961
was $8,500,000. 1 have the breakdown, and it
covers three or four pages of my blue book.
Hon. Mr. Isnar: I do nat think honaurabie
senators are particulanly interested in the
breakdown, s0 far as dollars and cents are
concerned. I think they would like ta know,
and the country would like to know, the
flnancing pnincipie by which it is proposed ta
deal with this matter on the books, and if the
intention is ta pass it over ta the trust
companies of Canada ta carry on in future
respecting individual boans. If so, is it the
intention ta advance loans ta the trust companies or ta individuai hoiders?
Hon. Mr. Aselfine: I cannot answer that
question.
Han. Mr. Isnar: Again, one sees how difficuit it is ta get information when these estimates corne ta us at so late an hour.
I have another question ta ask the Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine). Can
hie make a comparison on a percentage basis
of the contributions made by Canada, the
United States, and Russia, for instance, ta
Vote 704, with respect ta the Congo?
Han. Mr. Aselin e: I have all the items

hour ta tell what are the contributions of
those three countries.

twa assessments. I understand there are 64

full. To list all of those countries that are in
arrears would be too big a job for the time
we have at our disposal.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Thank you. Senator Fergusson, who sits on my left, remarks that we
should have more time, and I agree.
The question I asked can be summarized
in this way: What was Canada's contribution,
Russia's contribution, and the contribution
of the United States? I want to see Canada
given full credit for its fine work in the
United Nations.
A few years ago Canada's prestige was
very high all over the world. I recall that in
1952, and I am just trusting to memory now,
Canada's contributions ranked second, or perhaps it was fourth-at any rate it was high
-among all the nations represented in the
United Nations. I am wondering if we have
maintained our position, and what Russia
has been doing.

explanation on that point when I introduced
the last supplementary estimates. This is Vote
766.
I have a long explanation of increases and
decreases in amounts originally provided for
by way of general items: the Lachine section,
the Soulanges section, the St. Francis section,
and so on. In some cases there is a credit and
in other cases there is a debit, and this is the
amount that is calculated to be required to
pay the outstanding claims. For instance, in
the Lachine section provision is made for
claims and contract settlements, amounting to
$3,116,995. In the International Rapids section
it is $1,490,900. In the Thousand Islands section, there is a credit of $177,400, and so on.
That is how these amounts are arrived at.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Thank you very much.

amounts to $1,666,406,647.92, and with the additional amounts being requested for summer work and seasonal payments the total
is $1,704,710,347.93.
Honourable senators, I wish to give the
same undertaking as the honourable Leader
of the Opposition gave when he, as Government Leader, introduced a similar bill

the usual !orm for interim supphy bills, he
said this:

B3USINESS 0F THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Honourable senators, I
move that the Senate do now adjourn during
pleasure, to reassemble at the caîl of the
bell.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald (Brantford): May I
ask the acting Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Brunt) if he can give us sorne idea
of when we rnight be recalled? It is now
approximately half-past six. Is the intermission likely to be long enough for us to have
dinner?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The Clerk has advised
me that the members are returning to the
other place, and we have not been advised
what they are going to do. However, I amn
led to believe that the other house is going
to give further consideration to divorce bis,
and I amn quite certain we will not be calied
back here for at least an hour. Perhaps I
would be safe in saying an hour and a hall.
Hon. Mr. Cannally (Ottawa West): Can
the honourable senator say whether there
wlll be another royal assent tonight?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Bruni: If the divorce bis are
passed, I think it is the intention to give
royal assent to those bills.
Motion agreed to.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

At 6.50 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Mr. Assumie: Honourable senators,
I move, with leave of the Senate, that when
the Senate adjourns today it do stand adjourned until Thursday, April 26, 1962 at 8
o'clock in the evening.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Explaîn. I think we
are entitled to an explanation. If there is
no explanation, I shall vote against it.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: When we adjourned earlier
I made the statement that we would adjourn
for an hour or an hour and a haif, and would
resume to consider some divorce bis. Now,
we are back in 25 minutes.
Hon. Mr. Aselume: I understand that the
other house did flot get anywhere with the
bis.

Hon. Mr. Raebuck: We are entitled to some
sort of explanation.
Hon. Mr. Asellie: I understand the other
house brought the matter Up again and ut
did flot get anywhere; and that house has
now adjourned.
Han. Mr. Roebuck: Brought Up what matter? Divorces?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Divorces.
Han. Mr. Roebuck: Then the other place
has given the divorce bis what is tantamount
to a six-months hoist.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I would say that that is
correct. The matter was brought up and it
was found that they could not overcome
the opposition, so they adjourned.
Hon. Mr. Power: Until when?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Until the same day as
we propose to adjourn to, April 26.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And dissolution may
corne at any moment, irrespective of that?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes.
Motion agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until April 26, 1962
