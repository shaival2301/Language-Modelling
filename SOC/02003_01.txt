His Excellency was pleased to command the

that House being come, with their Speaker,
His Excellency was pleased to open the
Third Session of the Twentieth Parliament
of Canada with the following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
Since my arrivai in Ca-nada, 1 have visited ail
fine provinces. Today, for 'the first time, I meet
wi-th you at the opening of a session of
paxliament. I should like at once to say how
greatlV I value thýis mew association. I prize it
thie more in that it permits, if a time of
peace a continuance of the memorable association i had with Canada's armed forces at a
time of war.
This new year bas happily been marked by a
lessening of international tension. During 1946,
despite many disappointments, a notable advance
was made towards world recovery. In the
m.aking of peace and in the .tasks of woirld
recoïnstruction, Canada bas assnined a full
share of responsibility. No country holds, todýay,
a higher place in the esteem of other nations.
The establishment of enduring peace continues 'ta be the first concern of aIl nations. It
is the corner-stone of our external polie .
Unsettlýed worl conditions, following7 inevitablv in the wake of war, have randered the
making of the peace exoeedingly difficult. Some
progress has been made. After prolonged conferences, treaties of peaee with I.taly, FinI.an,
Roumania, Hungary and Bulgaria have been
*agreed ýupon, and are about to be signed. You
wall be asked to approve the treaties to which
Canada becomues a signatory.
The Allied Nations have now entered -upon
the task of determining the future of Germany
and Austrda. Canada bas recently made clear
our constructive attitude with regard to these
settement.
In international action for the relief of the
destitute, and for the rehabilitation of areas
desolated during the war, Canada lias been
much te the fore. We rnay indeed be grateful
that our country has been able -to take the
part it has in the relief of human suffering, in
the provision of food for the hungry, and in
the (restoration of devastated. cunti-ies. Canada
is joining with other nations in seeking te salve
the perplexing problem of the displaced parnons, and in the deavelopment of international
co-operation in many fields.
It is the policy of -the goverinent to have
Canada give whole-hearted support ta the
United Nations. Speci-al attention is being given
to -the deliberations respecting atomie energy
and the regulation and rekucton of armaments.
My ministers are also following with interest
the activities of the United Nations with.

regard to the question of human rights and
fundamental freedoms, and the manner in which
those obligations accepted by all members of
the United Nations may best be implemented. It
is the intention of the government to recommend
the appointment of a select committee of members of both bouses to consider and report
upon these matters.
The General Assembly of the United Nationà
concluded, last month in New York, its first
session begun in London a year ago. Canada's
delegation both in London and in New York was
representative of the government and the opposition, and of both Houses of Parliament. The
Canadian delegation took an active and constructive part in the work of the Assembly, the
Economic and Social Council, the Atomic Energy
Commission and other international organizations. You will be invited te consider legislation to enable Canada to carry out our country's
obligations under the United Nations Charter.
and 'to approve other agreements arising out of

Canada welcomed the action of the United
Nations in convening a World Conference on
Trade and Employment. It is hoped that the
conference nay bring into being an international
charter which, by the removal or reduction of
restrictions. will result in the continnous expansion of world trade. During the autumn, preparatory trade discussions among the nations of
the Commonwealth were held in London. Discussions are being continued with other of the
United Nations. Canada's delegation to the
conference will be instructed to further to the
utmost this combined effort on the part of the
United Nations to liberate trade and thereby
to assist in the maintenance of a higb level of
employment.
In our own country, the change-over from w-artime conditions bas proceeded rapidly. The
repatriation and demobilization of the armed
forces have been practically completed. Almost
all dependents of veterans have now arrived in
Canada. The three armed services have been
brought under the jurisdiction of one minister
of the Crown. The navy, army and air force

1946 Canada's external commerce reached
The
heights unprecedented in peacetime.
national income is at its highest peacetime
level. The outlook for trade and employment
for 1947 is most favourable.
Despite the high volume of output in all the
primary indust-ries, the demand for the natural
products of the farms, the fisheries, the mines
and the forests continues to exceed production.
Through marketing agreements, the government
is seeking to give security and continuing stability to the incomes of primary producers.
Many of the controls and restrictions in force
during and immediately after the war are no
longer in existence. Others have been considerably relaxed. Controls over wages and salaries
and over many prices and commodities have been
removed. Other controls are being removed in
an orderly manner.

The policy of the government is te maintain
only such price and commodity controls as may
be required to protect consuners from a sudden
and drastic rise in the cost of living, and to
ensu're the fair distribution of essential goods
and sevices which are in short supply. You will
be invited te consider what measures nay be
necessary to continue this policy after the expiry
of the National Emergency Transitional Powers
Act. Where it may appear advisable to continue these or other transitional measures, the
required legislation will be submitted for your
approval at the earliest possible date.
Where measures enacted under wartime
powers imay be required for a considerable
period. bills necessary to give statutory form
to their provisions will be introduced without
delay. This procediirc will bring under your
review a number of menasures relating, among
other inatters, to labour relations, agriculture,
marketing, immigration, defence, finance and
export trade.
Progress is being made in overcomîing the
shortages in building supplies, thereby accelerating the provision of additional housing. Despite
all obstacles. the number of housimg units completed in 1946 approximated the objective set
by the government. The co-operation of provincial and municipal authorities greatly contributed to the provision of emergency shelter.
Since the last session of parliament, negotiations for tax agreements have been carried on
iith certain of the provinces. In the course
of these negotiations, modifications were made
in the Dominion proposals to meet problems of
individual provinces, and to ensure comparable
treatment for all.
Tax agreements have now been reached vith
several of the provinces. The government is
prepared to conclude agreements on a similar
basis with the remaining provinces. You will be
asked to approve such tax agreements as may be
concluded.
Once suitable financial relationships have been
arrived at with the provinces, my ministers
have undertaken to seek, in a general coníference
or otherwise, to work out satisfactory arrangements with the provinces in regard to publie
investment and social security measures. Amendments to the Old Age Pensions Act will be
introduced at the present session.
You will be invited to consider a measure to
provide for the readjustiment of representation
in the House of Commons. in accordance with the
provisions of the recent amendennt to the
British North America Act. Amendments to
the Dominion Elections Act will also be sub.
mitted for your consideration.
In the course of the session, additional
measures will be submitted for your approval.
Members of the House of Commons:
The public accounts for the last fiscal year
and the estimates for the coming year wili be
laid before you. The estimates will disclose
substantial and gratifying reductions in public
expenditures.
You will be asked to make financial provision
for all essential services.

establisi a just and lasting peace.

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators. I regret very much that

it is my duty to remind you that since we last

colleagues.
The Honourable Robert Francis Green died
on October 5, 1946, at Victoria, British
Columbia, after a lengthy iliness, at the age
of 84. Be had been a senator for twenty-five
years. Born November 14, 1861, at Peterborough, Ontario, of Irish parentage, bis father
was Benjamin Green and bis mother Rebecca
Lipsett. Be was educated at public and high
school in Peterborough. At the age of nineteen he went to Erie, Penosylvania, and two
years later moved west to work for the
C.P.R. at Winnipeg.
In 1885 he left the
C.P.R. to fight in the Northwest Rebellion,

serving on the commissariat of General
Strange's contingent. After bis discharge from
the army he opened a general store in Revelstoke, British Columbia, toward the end
of 1885. In 1889 he returned briefly to Penasylvania,

STEWART

MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXcELLENCT:

Wfe, fis Majesty's most dutiful and loyal
subjeeýts, the Senate of Canada, in parliament
assembled, beg leave to offer oui humble thanks
te Your Excellency for the gracious speech
whieh Your Excellency lias addreosed te both
bouses of parliament.
Hie said: Honourable senators, I am conscions of the fact that the place cf honour
assigned to me, in being given the privilege of
înoving the address to His Excellency the
Governor General. does not arise from the

FEBRUARY 4, 1947

recognition of any special merit in myself, but
rather, that my selection for this honourable
role arises from conformity with a long
established custom that this function shall be
assigned to the newest member of this bouse.
I am, however, deeply sensible of the honour
of having been invited to participate in the
deliberations of this august assembly, and I
hope that I may be able to make some modest
contribution to good government in days to
come.
If I had had to choose an occasion on
which I would especially appreciate the privilege of having my name associated with the
traditional resolution which I have just
moved, I can think of no year, and no
session, that would have given me greater
gratification than this session of 1947, for the
resolution which I am moving is addressed to
a new Governor General, whose achievements
had earned the admiration of ail Canadians
long prior to bis appointment by His Majesty
the King to bis present vice-regal office.
I am indeed gratified that my first duty
as a member of this chamber enables me to
assure His Excellency that this resolution is
no mere empty forrn of words, but expresses
the deep and heartfelt gratitude of the people
of Canada, not only that this country bas
been honoured by bis appointment here, but
aiso for the great interest which His Excellency bas already shown in the affairs of
Canada.
In the short period that bas elapsed since
bis arrival on these shores, His Excellency
bas visited every province of the dominion,
and bas entered whole-heartedly into the life
of its people. We honour him as a soldier
who commanded Canadian forces in some of
the most glorious chalpters in the history of
Canadian arms. And now, as His Majesty's
representative in the senior dominion, be bas
earned the goodwill, and even the affection,
of our whole people, through the kindly and
obviously sincere interest which he bas displayed in every aspect of our Canadian life.
I am sure honourable senators would wish
me, as the first speaker in this session, to
associate the Senate with the cable that His
Excellency sent to the Royal Family just
before they left for a tour of South Africa.
I shall read that cable:
On behalf of the people of Canada I extend
to Your Majesties our warm and loyal greetings,
wishing you and Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret Rose a safe journey and a happy
visit to the Union of South Africa.
I know, honourable senators, it is the wish
of us all that the Royal Family will return
from South Africa with the same affection

from the people of that country as Their
Majesties carried from the people of Canada
at the end of the Royal Tour in 1939.
Honourable senators, may I also refer to a
very special feeling of pride that I experience
in sitting in this chamber under the presidency
of one of the most distinguished citizens of the
province which I represent.
Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MeKEEN: The Speaker of the
Senate bas had a public and a private career of
service to Canada that is almost unique. He
was the pioneer medical practitioner in that
rich and beautiful part of Canada known as
the Crows Nest Pass. Indeed, I am reliably
informed that bis exploits and experiences in
those rough and crude days were the basis for
Ralph Connors' delightful novel The Doctor.
His shrewd and kindly interest in the welfare
of bis patients is remembered with deep and
abiding affection by the old-timers in the
Kootenay.
His record of public service is no less
remarkable. He was first elected to the Legislature of British Columbia in 1903, and bas
been a member of either the federal or the
provincial parliament, with only one short
interruption, for the last forty-four years. In
thanking him for the cordial welcome which
he extended to me on my appointment, I
should like to add that nothing could have
been happier than the spirit in which, during
the past few days, all the members of this
chamber, regardless of party, have greeted my
two newly, appointed colleagues and myself.
In reviewing the gracious message in which
His Excellency bas laid before us the outlines
of the business which will require our attention
in the present session, I note that questions of
an international character occupy a larger place
than bas been customary in former years. This
fact is undoubtedly a reflection of the outstanding position in world affairs which bas
been earned for Canada by the valour and
genius of lier fighting youth.
In order that the voice of Canada in the
councils of the nations may be worthy of the
sacrifices of the war, and of the economic and
military strength of our country, it bas become
more than ever necessary that there shall be
an intelligent and an informed public opinion
upon all matters of international concern. It
is a matter of gratification, therefore, that our
government includes for the first time a Secretary of State for External Affairs who is able
to give bis full time and attention to that
important subject.

SENATE

The Prime Minister and the country are
fortunate, indeed, that there should have been
available a gentleman of the great learning and
high character possessed by the minister to
whom this portfolio bas been entrusted.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MeKEEN: It bas been said that
Canada's external affairs will in future years
tend to become more and more conoerned with
matters of trade and commerce. As one who
represents British Columbia and whose daily
life is spent in direct association with the shipping activities of the seaport of Vancouver, I
welcome this trend. Even more, perhaps, than
those who come from the interior of the
country. we on the western coast appreciate
the vital importance of foreign trade. Our
three great basic industries in British Columbia
-lumbering, mining, and fishing-depend for
their success, te a very large extent, upon
exports.
During the war years British Columbia's
production, and more specially its productive
capacity, was tremendously increased. The
population of the province bas increased by
almost fifty per cent in the past decade. The
future welfare and prosperity of our people
there depend upon our ability to foster and
develop markets for the output of their
industry.
British Columbians are especially concerned
with the development of markets across the
Pacific. No country in the world is more
deeply concerned with the solving of the
complex problems of our great ally and
neighbour, China. Only with the restoration
of peace to that troubled land can its people
raise their standard of living and improve the
communications throughout their vast territory. In that development Canada is peculiarly
equipped to play an important part, and I
sincerely hope that, in our concern with the
more widely publicized problems of Europe,
our Department of External Affairs will not
overlook the vital importance of extending
every possible aid to China.
At this moment in our history it is gratifying
to have the assurance in the Speech from the
Throne that the million young Canadians who
interrupted their carcers to spring to arms in
the defence of freedom, have vcry largely
been restored to their homes, to take their
places in the social and economic life of the
country.
In my opinion. the government is to be
complimented on the specd and dispatch with
which our overseas forces were returned to
their homeland, and rehabilitated in industry.
I am informed that onily a few hundred. con-

cerned primarily with staff duties and the
settlement of accounts, remain abroad. The
complete lack of friction in the demobilization
and rehabilitation process is due, not alone to
the seven years of planning which began in
1939, but reflects the highest credit and honour
They have
upon the troops themselves.
returned to civil life with the same high
spirit of public service as they displayed in
response to the recruiting appeal.
There had been discharged to civil life
from the Canadian armed forces, up to
December 31, 1946, no fewer than 976,229
members. On that same date the number of
veterans registered with the National Employment Service of Canada for employment,
including veterans of both wars, was 47,696. It
is an amazing tribute to the spirit of the veterans and to the economic resiliency of Canada
that the number of unemployed, veterans on
December 31, in midwinter, was less by 6,000
than the number in the midsummer month
of June, 1946. Since VE Day in May, 1945,
this country bas absorbed into civil life no
fewer than 723,782 members discharged from
the armed forces.
The government's programme of rehabilitation, so carefully planned
throughout seven years of extensive study
under the guidance of the Minister of
Veterans Affairs. has made a tremendous contribution to this accomplishment.
Without going into the subject exhaustively,
it may interest honourable senators to know
that 247,584 veterans have received direct
assistance through the five benefits of the
Veterans Rehabilitation Act. As of November
30, 1946, 66.184 veterans had been awarded
vocational training courses and 46,711 had been
awarded courses in our universities and professional schools. The number of veterans
entering upon business, professional and farming careers, who have been assisted through the
early non-productive months by the benefit
called "Awaiting Returns", is 33.158.
Aside altogether from the war service gratuities, which were paid to discharged members
of the forces without any conditions attached
to them, we find that nearly 400,000 veterans
have drawn upon their re-establishment credit
to the extent of $78,000,000 for the purpose of
acquiring homes, repairing their homes. and
purchasing furniture and equipment for their
homes. Another $21,000,000 of re-establishment
credit bas been used in the form of working
capital for business enterprises or the purchase
of a business or the purchase of tools or equipment for a business or profession.
I draw attention to the fact that these large
sums were paid out to veterans, not in the
fori of loans, but in the form of direct grants.
in mot cases, as in the case of the acquisition

FEBRUARY 4,1947

of homes, they represent merely a down payment, and are an indication that many more
millions of dollars of the veterans' own savings
have been invested in Canadian homes and in
Canadian business by the former members of
our armed forces. They are today among our
most substantial citizens.
Assistance has been rendered to another
important group through the provisions of the
Veterans' Land Act. The number who have
been established on farms and small holdings
under this aet is approximately 23,000. Of
these 11,663 have been established in full-time
farming on properties purchased through the
facilities of the act. Another 9,536 have been
established on small holdings. Some 4,000
farmers have been assisted with loans on properties which they already owned and operated.
A few days ago another great stabilizing
influence was brought into being with the
proclamation of the Business and Professional
Loans Act, which will enable thousands of
veterans to obtain capital for the purpose of
setting themselves up in business and in the
various professions for which they are either
qualified or have been trained under the provisions of the Rehabilitation Act.
It was gratifying to note in the Speech from
the Throne that the process of industrial conversion, which in prospect seemed so formidable, has to a very large extent already
been completed.
There is still, of course, an urgent need for
new housing, as a result of the great shifts in
population which took place during the war,
and, let us not forget, due to the greatly
ihcreased spending power of the Canadian
people. Last year 60,000 regular housing units
were built, and another 3,000 or 4,000 emergency units were made avail.able. This has
made a marked improvement in the situation.
These units will take care of approximately
a quarter of a million people; and the prospective schedule for the coming year is for
80,000. The target for last year was 60,000,
and 60,000 units were built; the target for
this year is 80,000 units, and I have been
assured by the minister that 80,000 will be
built. This should go a long way to alleviate
our housing problem.
The industrial plant which during the war
was fostered and developed by Canadian enterprise, under the guidance and direction of
the Minister of Reconstruction and Supply
has, to a very large extent, been adapted to
the production of the goods and supplies of
which.we all have been deprived during the
long weary years of war.

The making good of deficiencies in our
wardrobes, our houses, our household equipment, and the thousand and one items which
have been in short supply during the war, has
been an important contributing factor to the
speed of industrial reconversion and the rapid
absorption of our demobilized fighting forces.
This back-log of unsatisfied demands is still
a vital factor in our industrial life, but it is
not a factor upon which we can rely to maintain for any great length of time the present
high level of employment. Our hope for the
future years depends upon the recovery of
the devastated countries and the return of
world trade on a vast scale. Canada is in
a fortunate position with regard to her future
aspirations in this regard.
The government is to be greatly commended
for the research work that it has had carried
on. During the war our scientists made great
contributions to the prosecution of the war.
Their efforts were particularly helpful in the
fields of radar and the atomie bomb. The men
working on these problems were mostly young
men, and it augurs well for the future of our
country that we have so many young men
of such great capabilities. We do, of course,
have to see that we keep these men in Canada,
so that we have the benefit of their brains.
This research work did not stop with the
war, and much is being done today to assist
industry in its conversion from war to peace
and in providing new products and new processes that will do much to enrich our country
and enhance our standard of living. One
branch of this research that is being actively
carried on is that of atomic power, and I
believe we will be proud of the fact that
Canada is not behind the rest of the world in
the development of atomic energy.
The assistance which this country extended
to Britain, France, Russia, China, and our
other allies under the heading of mutual aid,
was laid before us the other day in the report
of the Mutual Aid Board. The total amount
of mutual aid furnished by Canada was shown
to be approximately four billion dollars. This
factor will build up good-will for Canada
throughout the countries to which it was given.
At the end of the greatest and most destructive war the world has ever known, this
young country can look back upon a truly
amazing record of achievément. Not only did
we raise a million fighting men, and out of
our own resources arm and equip them to
the point where they were regarded as about
the best-equipped among the forces of the
United Nations; but we went beyond that and
through mutual aid to our allies contributed

8

SENATE

an amount of material, the cost of which was
fully equivalent of all that we paid out on
behalf of our own forces.
And now may I, in speaking again about
our defence forces, compliment the government upon the decisive steps which have been
taken in recent months to reorganize the
permanent defence forces of this country. In
these modern days we have high ideals for the
organization of international peace and world
government. Great strides have been made,
but grea:ter steps have still to be taken before
we can be assured that the United Nations will
be able to carry out that lofty mission.
From the earliest days of tribal history the
first responsibility of organized government has
been the defence of the community. Under
modern civilization we have learned in our
national life the efficacy of the rule of law in
preserving internaI peace. Humanity aspires
to the establishment of a rule of law by the
nations, and I hope that Canada will always
be, as it has been to date, in the forefront of
the effort to organize international peace.
Until that goal has been attained, we must still
think of the problems of national defence.
If there is one lesson that we have learned
in recent years, it is that the problems of
defence are one and indivisible. There is no
separate problem of army defence, or navy
defence, or air defence. All these various arms
and weapons minister to the same fundamental
purpose.
The programme initiated by the recent Minister of National Defence, now the Minister
of Finance-and which has been formally acted
upon by his successor, the present Minister of
National Defence-of bringing the three fighting forces into loser co-operation and union,
is of the highest importance. Each of the
armed services has its proud traditions, and
these will never be forgotten; but there must
be trained experts in the service of the nation
who are competent to appreciate the combined contribution that navy, army, aviation,
science and industry can make to our national
defence. The programme of co-ordinating and
unifying our services, which has been begun, is
one which I hope wil be carried much farther.
And now may I return for a moment to some
3f the more immediate problems to which our
attention bas been directed in the Speech from
the Thiene?
For reasons to which I have already referred,
it is gratifying to note that the government
is giving major consideration to the promotion
of trade. During the war years the value of
our experts attained phenomenal proportions,
and already, as was inevitable, the statistics

show a substantial decrease. But it is well to
remember that the productive capacity upon
which our phenomenal war experts were established is still in our possession. It is gratifying
to note that although the shipments of war
materials have been completely eut off,
Canada's exports for the year 1946 were more
than double her average exports in the five
years preceding the war. For that five "years
our average exports were 884 million dollare.
Last year they were 2,312 millions.
As to the peacetime record, I feel that the
government is to be commended on their
wonderful accomplishment in maintaining
business and employment during the first postwar year. The change-over from war to peace
conditions is reflected in the character of these
experts. Our exports of wood and paper
products increased from 488 millions to 625
millions. Aluminum and chemicals fell off
sharply; but it is a healthy sign that even
some of our mineral exports were greater in
1946--a year of peace-than in 1945, which
was chiefly a war year. These increases were
in lead, nickel and zinc. Many of us looked
on nickel as purely a wartime product; but
it is interesting to note that in 1946, a year
of peace, nickel exports were greater than in
the years before the war.
It is pleasing to note also the wide distribution of our Canadian products. Thus, I
observe that our exports to China and to
Latin American countries are showing a rapid
rate of increase.
My own province of British Columbia is
vitally concerned in these matters of trade.
Our three great industries-lumbering, mining
and fishing-are all export industries. Indeed,
they contribute te Canada's volume of export
trade in a proportion far in excess of the ratio
of our population to the Canadian total.
To a very large extent the legislation affecting the lumbering and mining industries is
provincial in character. Deep sea fisheries,
however, come under federal jurisdiction, and
I wish to commend the Department of Fisheries for its consistent and progressive policy
of conservation. When we mine a mineral
from the ground, that reserve of wealth is
gone and, until prospecting discovers another
source of supply, the country is physically
poorer. When we eut down our forests, that
wealth is also gone. This can be replaced in
years to come by proper reforestation. When
we take the fish out of the sea in too great
quantities that resource is depleted; but by
wise fishing regulations this resource can be
preserved in perpetuity.
The value of the output of west coast fisheries for 1945 was more than $44,000,000. During
the war the British Columbia fisheries became

FEBRUARY 4, 1947

a major contributor to Canada's domestic tood
supplies, and provided vast quantities of fish
to meet the critical food needs of the United
Kingdom and some of Canada's other allies.
The people connected with our fishing industry have shown admirable enterprise and
skill in developing these resources. During the
war, for instance, canned salmon production
set a new high record. Canned herring production increased many hundredfold and, as
the need for vitamin oils increased, the comparatively small production was expanded into
a large-scale enterprise of great importance.
There is no need for us to turn back in this
regard, providing our resources are subjected
to sound conservation control and management.
Conservation involves more than merely
Canadian action. Joint administration by
Canada and the United States has already
saved and restored the Pacific halibut fishery,
and is at present rebuilding the famous sockeye
run of the Fraser River system. Similarly,
scientific research by biologists and technologists is yielding outstanding results, especially
in the field of vitamin oils, where there is
every prospect, under wise planning and direction, of notable developments in the future.
The Minister of Fisheries has already announced plans for a more effective administrative staff on both coasta to cope with the many
problems arising out of a more intensified and
diversified fishing operation. At the present
time a class of 44 probationary fishery inspectors, all young veterans of the war, is undergoing a three and one half months training
course in British Columbia, to fit them for the
duties that lie ahead in that field. I do not
know what further plans the Minister of
Fisheries may have in mind to stimulate the
progress of fisheries in British Columbia.
Whatever they may be, they must be judged
on ýtheir merits. At the same time, I am sure
that honourable senators will take a sympathetic attitude toward proposals directed to
this end. Canada's fisheries possibilities have
perhaps not yet been fully realized throughout
the country. One thing at least is certain: it
is in the national interest that we make the
most of these resources.
It is also within the power of the Parliament
of Canada to have a very profound effect upon
the preservation of such vital industries as
lumbering and mining, which seem to come
chiefly within the field of provincial regulation.
As a result of the recent trend to do away
with dual taxation, it will now be possible for
the dominion to place its taxation of industry
upon a much more scientific basis than has ever
before been possible. I sincerely hope that

. 9

opportunity will be taken to consider the effect
of taxation upon the long-range welfare of our
basic industries.
The perpetuation of mining depends upon
continued exploration and development of new
fields. Taxation of the earnings of the mining
industry can be so adjusted as to give encouragement to this development. There is already
an important policy in effect in this regard, in
allowing a depletion factor in calculating the
earnings of mining companies.
A very eloquent plea has been made for a
similar depletion allowance to the lumbering
industry, based on fair present-day values. I
wish to associate myself with this plea, and to
urge most strongly that the government no
longer delay action on it.
I should like to suggest also that in dealing
with this matter our taxation advisers study
the practicability of giving further allowances
to the industry itself for reforestation, something which up-to-date the Government has
not been able to do. Only by some such
policy as this, I submit, can our important
forest industry be preserved in the years to
come.
The prospect of the dominion being able
to play a more constructive role in taxation
policy has been greatly improved through the
successful outcome of the negotiations with
the provinces for taxation agreements. I am
more than pleased to know that six of the
nine provinces have -now entered into agreements with the Dominion Government.
It will be remembered that one of the
primary purposes of the programme of redistributing the taxation powers of the dominion
and provinces was to make it possible to
institute in this country a programme of social
services consistent with the principles of the
Atlantic Declaration. the Charter of the United
Nations, and the common aspiration of
humanity.
It bas been long recognized that, in a nation
so closely integrated as Canada, the introduction of social services piecemeal by
provinces is impractical. The extent to which
such a programme can be carried out on a
national scale depends very largely upon the
proportion of the national income which is
available to the national government for
taxation and distribution in this way.
As early as 1944 the present government laid
down a very broad scale programme of
domestic legislation, which has already been
largely implemented. The last session of
parliament was dominated by the great programme of veterans' rehabilitation. The great
remaining problems at this moment are the

SENATE

liquidation of emergency powers, the revision
of taxation consistent with the transition from
our direct war obligations to the less exacting
but still onerous post-war obligations, and
the new agreements with the provinces.
The policy of gradualness in lifting the
controls which served such a valuable purpose
during the war, bas been followed wisely. We
saw in other countries the extraordinary rise
and fall of prices caused by the sudden removal
It is well to remember that
of controls.
the burden of these violent fluctuations, both
up and down, falls most heavily upon those
least able to bear it-the wage earners and
the small shopkeepers. In Canada day by
day, week by week, and month by month, the
controls have been removed a little at a time,
with the result that extreme changes in the
price level have been avoided. At the present
rate of progress, I look forward to a complete
end to the system of emergency controls within
the current year.
It is gratifying to note that the programme
of social security to which the present government is dedicated is to bc further advanced
during the current session by way of an
amendment to the Old Age Pensions Act. In
the readjustment of taxation which is clearly
foreshadowed, I suggest that it may be possible
to attain the objective of a universal contributory old age pension system as well as a
reduction in the income tax, perhaps somewhat
less far-reaching than might otherwise be the
case.
Another most important item of legislation
foreshadowed in the Speech from the Throne
is the long-deferred Redistribution Bill, which
may not be of as much interest in this bouse
as in the other. It was perhaps wise, as well
as inevitable, that this measure should have
been postponed until the end of the war, but
we are glad to see it coming forward now. We
in British Columbia are especially glad to
know that the introduction of this bill is
bound to result in increased representation for
that province in the House of Commons. Our
experience with redistribution bills in the past
bas not been a happy one. British Columbia
always seems to be running far behind the
procession, and to receive a representation
much less than is warranted by her population.
Possibly the reason is that our population is
growing so rapidly that by the time the figures
are publisbed they are out of date.
Of the many functions of a senator, one is
to guard the rights of the province which he
represents. In the coming session it will be
one of my nost active interests and my humble
dut to render wbat assistance I am permitted
te ronder in order to insure Briti.l Columbia

the representation which is her just due. That
would give her more members in the other
bouse and more senators. We have nothing
te do with the number of members in the
House of Commons, but I would suggest that
the present population of British Columbia
entitles that province to at least six or seven
additional representatives in the Senate.
Honourable senators, I am sure that every
member of this bouse will welcome the opportunity foreshadowed in the Speech from the
Throne of participating in a joint committee
of the two bouses of parliament for tie purpose of considering how the preservation and
advancement of human rigbts and fundamental
freedoms may best be implemented. I believe
that here in Canada we have net only the
highest standard of living, but the most
admirable system of free institutions to be
found anywhere on the face of this earth.
Righteousness promotes the pursuits of peace.
Wickedness sows the seeds of war. It is only
by holding our moral standards high that we
can have real peace in our own country and
have a real effect on the peace of the world.
Freedom, however, can be preserved only by

Majesty the King, when he unveiled our
National War Memorial:
Without peace there can be no enduring freedom; and without freedom no enduring peace.
This year we shall celebrate the 80th anniversary of confederation. My remarks on this
occasion would be incomplete if I did net say
something about the way i'n which the hopes
and plans of the Fathers of Confederation have
been realized. Theirs was a vision of a great
new nation stretching from sea te sea across
the north half of this continent. Four years
after confederation my province of British
Columbia joined the union. The physical
framework of the new nation was there. We
now know there were natural resources
undreamed of in 1871, for many millions of
people to dcvelop.
But without statesmanship, natural resources
are not cenough. We have been fortunate in
ihse cighty years to have had four great
Prime Ministers: Macdonald, Laurier, Borden
and Mackenzie King. Macdonald bad the
vision and the courage to lay the physical
foundations of this nation. Laurier gave
Canada its soul, the moral foundations of
tolerance and freedom and unity of spirit.

I arn sure honourable senators on both siýdes
of the bouse share our pride in the achievements of Canada in war and in reconstruction.
Everyonb in this chamber, I believe, agrees
that Canada-the government having interpreted the views of the country in organizing
the utmost war effort without restrictionshould be entitled to an unrestricted share in
making peace.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hiear.
H-on. Mr. McKEEN: It is flot as tbough
Canada was seeking some selfish local advantage ont of the peace. We recognize, and the
government is insisting, t.hat since two wars
have proved that Canada cannot stay out in
isolation, we should have an effective voice in
making a peace which will last, more than one
generation.
The present Prime Minister bas occupied
that position for one quarter of the whole life
of this nation. H1e speaks with an authority
and experience unequalled among public men
in office in the world today. I believe the
Canadian people gcnerally are agreed that hie
is in a position to make a great contribution
to the establishment of a peaceful world.
In conclusion, I return to the subjeet with
which I beg-an these remarks, the importance
of Canada taking hier proper place in the
world programme for organizing international
peace. We can make a beginning at home by
cultivating the arts of friendly intercourse and
conciliation among ourselves. We cannot look
forward to international pence unless and until
we have the skill and the patience to preserve
peace among oursolves-peace betwcen province and province; peace bctwcen provincial
and federal authority; peace between capital
and labour; peace between the great races
which make up our country.
In this regard we have a proud history and
a great, beritage. The great statesmen wbo
have gone before us, members of both bouses
of parliament, have contributed much to the
strength. and unity of Canada. We should be
mindful of our great, traditions, but I am notsatisfied that wc should rest in the shadows
of our yesterdays. Rather. we sbould marcb

Sacrifices made by Canada to ensure final

of an enduring pence and in the drafting of
îreaties of world-wide importance.

'There are older countries, there are larger
countries, but no country bolda a higher place
in the estecm of otber nations".
1 also wisb 10 congratulate the Rigbt
Honourable the Prime Minister for having
placcd international polities above party politica, and for having expresaed a formula
whicb commanda the attention and respect
of ahl Canadiana, irrespective of party. Witb

will remain truly Canadian. Forever il will
stand above party lines, whicb are frequently
mean and unproductive.
The invitation extcnded to ail leaders 10
participate in international discussions, together witb the aceeptance by these leaders
in a truly.national spirit, will confer to aIl

characterizes the members of a free state.
Il comes at the very lime when Canadian
liberty is nsserting itself si dîstinctly. Canadians of both great races accept il without
anxiety, without mental reservation, but with
joy. On January 3 lnst, the Prime Minister

said: "Our nationhood is not built on the
superiority of a single race or of a single
language. Canada was founded on the faith
that two of the proudest races in the world,
despite barriers of tongue and creed, could
develop a common nationality. Without the
ideal of equality among men, without the
vision of human brotherhood, the Canadian
nation would never have come into being".

beliefs, its language and its tradition, will

It is through emulation and not
State.
through assimilation that citizens of Canadadiffering as to race, origin, language and
traditions-will best serve their country's
interests.
It is gratifying to note that the government
is gradually doing away with the restrictions
which, owing to the war, it bas been compelled
to enforce in nearly all spheres of economic
activities.
One needs but to go out of the country to
realize fully the value of the direction given to
production and distribution of goods. Canada
bas thus been able to avoid a staggering
increase in prices. She bas avoided the inflation and economie slump which greatly affect
people in other countries. Our economic situation is sucS as to be envied by more important nations, and it is admired by the whole
world.
If these measures were necessary during the
war, if it still is the duty of the government to
imaintain restrictions over the movement of
products which remain scarce, it is nevertheless undeniable that these measures must
remain exceptional and must be abolished as
conditions return to normal.
It is very gratifying to note that such is the
policy which the government proposes to
follow. Restrictions must disappear as soon
as possible. Bureaucracy, which was efficient
and necessary during the difficult period, must
make way for private effort. That is the policy
forecast by the Speech from the Throne. It is
a truly liberal policy for whicb the people will
be thankful to the government.
I have no doubt that the government will
soon lighten the still too beavy burden of taxation. The Canadian citizens have accepted
willingly and without recrimination the great
financial sacrifices which war bas imposed on
them. Repatriation and the maintenance and
substantial help that we must afford to our
veterans involve sacrifices which all are

measures which the country needed so mueh
cnt:ail liige expenditures. I an nevertheless

confident that the government will be in a
position ·to effect substantial reductions in all
spheres; that they will make a serious
endeavour to restore to family obligations the
priority they deserve, and that they will also
be able to lighten the burden of the people in
the higher income brackets so as to promote
the legitimate and necessary ambition which
alone will permit every citizen, in his particular sphere, to achieve a maximum effort.
Many years have already elapsed since the
governments of all countries have abandoned
the doctrine of economie liberalism or straight
capitalism, where competition was the very
basis of the economy. The systems which can
be adopted are not very numerous. Some
countries have gone from straight capitalism
to the socialization or nationalization of all
property. The state bas become the absolute
master of everything and everyone. The
citizens of those countries, from the ýmost
powerful to the lowliest, have seen their
individual freedom sacrificed to the ideals of
certain political groups. They have become
mere cogs in the state's machinery. Education, culture, literature and art are only given
the impulse which is useful to the policy
followed by the nation's leaders. Private enterprise is sabotaged and traditions are set aside.
From the standpoint of religion, the state becomes the golden calf before which each and
everyone must bow.
Such are the abuses which have been perpetrated by some national leaders who are
no longer living, and to which are still subjected certain nations which are endeavouring
to foist them on the rest of the world. What
a great lesson it would be for those who
criticize the freedom guaranteed by our constitution if they were, even temporarily, subjected to the demands of those totalitarian
groups! The misfortune of a too great number of people alone makes possible the establishment of such systems. The exaggerations
of economic liberalism had incited the masses
to choose political systems which seemed to
them an improvement.
Other leaders-our own--have rather sought
to remedy that situation by improving the
lot of the majority while leaving to all that
measure of freedom without w'hich no people
can develop and prosper.
The security measures which the leaders
of this country have implemented for the
benefit of the people, the relief they have
brought to the hardships which breed revolt,
have made possible an appreciation of the
basic principles of our domestic policy.
Undoubtedly, perfection bas not been achieved.
There are still some situations to be remedied
and evils to be cured. However. our policy

FEBRUARY 4, 1947
moves in a direction that will enable al
citizens of Canada to look for and Eind a
happy and honourable life.
Old age pensions, the improvement of which
is forecast in the speech from the throne,
were inaugurated by a Liberal government.
They constitute a security for aged people.
Pensions for the blind, invalids and indigent
mothers, advocated by Liberal governments,
protect the citizens against -the hazards of
nature.
Unemployment insurance, also introduced
by a Liberal government, mitigates the fluetuations in our economy. It means sccurity
for labour.
Family allowances, also inaugurated by a
Liberal government, ensure security for the
family. They contribute to a more advanced
degree of education which will allow individualis, whatever itheir social standing, to
dev'elop their natural qualities and gifts in
the best interests of ýtheir own families and
the state.
Here is an internai economy measure which
corrects abuses and contributes to the equitable distribution of wealth without infringing
on the pride and freedom of our citizene, which
should constitute the very foundation of
ambition.
This, honourable senators, is a policy which
It enables us to
commands our respect.
avoid obstacles which seem to be insurmountable; it alleviates miseries dependent on an
excess of freedom, and it leaves our fellow
citizens with the ambition and freedomn without which. individu-al developmnent within a
free and proud nation is unachievable.
Let us pursue the implementation of this
essentially liberal doctrine. Let us spread it
throughout the country so that our people will
forget those empty formulas which the freedom of speech we hold so dear causes to be
broadcasi; hither and yen.
After having won victory by the force of
arms and won the peace that ensued, we shall
have won the victory of democracy.
The Speech from the Throne tells us that
federal-provincial agreements will be submitted to us. We shall evidently have the
opportunîty of discussing tbem. after it lias
been possible for us to ascertain wbat they
are and examine themn in detail. These negotiations are of vital importance, for i the
next five years the whole internai economic
structure of both the dominion and the
provinces will be based on them.
I sincerely hope that ahl who will he party
to the discussions will have as sole object the
welfare of the Canadian people. I amn confident that not one of the representatives of
the dominion or the provinces will at-tempt

to inject party politics into such deliberations.
The object to be attained is far ton lofty to
allow party intercst and political. strategy to
enter the picture. The only factors to be
taken into account are the interest, welfare
and prosperity of Canadians in so far as they
do not conflict with the rights and privileges
granted each province under the constitution.
A constitution sucb as ours could not, of
course, foresee and settle each particular case.
It must be interpreted witb the same degree
of fairness, integrity and good-will which the
Fatbers of Confederation brougbt to its
preparation.
Thus only will it be possible to ensure that
every Canadian will enjoy the security to
which he is entitled.
It is only in this spirit. and by founding ahl
discussions of the subject on those principles,
that the real interests of our people will be
served.

Honourable senators, I have tried te point
out te you the high lights of Canadian politics
as outlined in the Speech from the Throne.
It is my conviction that the government
intends to submit for our consideration the
most appropriate measures for the proeperity
and happiness of Canadian citiziens.
I wish to express my gratitude for the kind
attention you have given me. 1 am dceply
touched by your warm reception to new members in thîs bouse, and 1 dare say that we
al.ready feel at home. We have the feeling
of coming into a family gathering, where we

COMMITTEES
APPOINTMENT

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, with leave, I desire to move:
That the senators mentioned in the report
of the Comrnittee of Selection as having been
chosen to serve on the several standing committees during the present session, be and they are
hereby appointed to forrn part of and constitute
the several committees with which their respective names appear in the said report, to inquire
into and report upon such matters as may be
referred to them from time to time, and that
the Committee on Standing Orders be authorized
to send for persons, papers and records whenever required; and also that the Committee on
Internai Economy and Contingent Accounts
have power without special reference by the
Sen ate, to consider any matter aifecting the
internai economny of the Senate, and such committee shahl report the resuit of such consideration to the Senate for action.
The motion was agreed to.
BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Before the orders
of the day are called, I miglit eay for the
information of honourahie senators that it ie
my plan at the present timne to ask the Senate
to consider adj ourning tomorrow afternoon
until Tuesday of next week. I ar nft yet in
a position to say, of course, what will be the
length of the debate on the Speech from the
Throne, or what public legielation, in addition
to the private bille which, are to corne before

17

us, I may be able to introduce into the Senate.
However, I shahl communicate that information
to the bouse at the earliest possible date.

As far as I can determine at the moment,
bearing in mind the urgcncy of legislation that

is being introduced in the other place, it le
likely that the Senate will sit continuously,
with longer adjournments than usual at the
week ends, if circumstances so dictate. I can
only project myscîf that far; but I thought
it might facilitate the plans of honourable

senators to indicate the situation.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD:

Does the honourable

leader contemplate any special legislation next
,week? It wouid be useless for those of us
who are going home for the week end to corne
baek next week if there were nothing to be
done here?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I can only say
to my friend that I have indicated to the
government the desire of the Senate to undertake the initiai stages of legishation which the
government is willing t.o entrust to us and
which the constitution makes it possible to
give us. If legisiation does corne to us, I hope
we shaîl deal with it as expeditiously as
possible.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The

Senate resumed

from

yesterday

the

consideration of Ris Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening ofthe session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. McKeen for an

address in reply thereto.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG:

Honourable mem-

bers, I joirn with the mover (Hon. Mr. McKeen) and tne seconder (Hon. Mr. Bouifard)
of the motion in offering My congratulations

to the Governor Generai and bis good lady
upon their visits across Canada in the past
year. I j oin with thema also in expressing to
yeu, Mr. Speaker, our delight that you are
able, ready and willing to preside over the
deliberations of this body for another year.

We welcome you, sir; we respect your decisions
and we will assist you in every way possible
to maintain the traditions of thie bouse.
I wish also te welcome the three new members of this chamber. Untii Thursday I knew
only one of them, the honourable senator from,
Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon), and naturally

I shall epeak of him first. He is one of three
senators whose fathers eat before themn in
this house. I do not need to mention the
othere by name. Their fathere distinguiehed
themselves in this chamber during many

SENATE
years, and so fai as 1 know the sons are
(arrving on the traditions of their fathers
in the x-ery best manner possible.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: We look to the honourable gentleman fromn Cariboo to carry oa
the tradition establisbied by his distinguishced
father. It was a good one.
The speeches of the mover and seconder
of the nddress were I say tlîis with alI
rrspect-tvpical of the provinces from which
t bese gentlemen corne. Ev erything is booming
nnd liumming on the Pacifie Coast, and the
iiew member from BritiAh Columbia did bis
province proud by bis first speech in this
bos.Living as I do haîf way betwcen
here and that province, and knowing a littie
bit about it I arn inclined to tbink he truly
represented the bcst aspirations of the people
out there. The bonourable gentleman wbo
seconded tbe address cornes fromn Qucbec
and bis speech was made in Frencbi. I understood soine of it at [ho time be was speaking,
but this morning 1 bad tbe pleasure of reading
-translation that was better than mine. It
wvas a speech typical of the province of Quebec,
i y a distinguished member of the legal profession in that province who probably had
nex er been in parliamentary life before and
who came here with ail tbe entbusiasm. of a
young man on bis first adventure.
I congratulate both the mover and the
seconder. If the day ever cornes wbcn the
p:îrty which 1 bave the bonour to lead bore
bas the rigbt to nominate members to this
liouse, I hope that its choices will be as good
as the three that the government of the day
bas made on this occasion.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
lIon. Mr HAIG: Now, bonourable senators,
1 arn going to toucb for a moment or two on
the Speech fro-m the Tbrone. Parts to wbich 1
niake no reference at this time will be dealt
witli under otber headings a littie later on.
The speech 'begins by referring to peace, and
says that the establishment of enduring peace
is the corner--stone of our external policy. I
sliaîl deal witb tbat later. Tbe next paragrapb
clealýs with world conditions. Then, tbere is a
reference to the General Assembly of the
United Nations. The speech goes on to mention controls, in an omnibus clause that refers
also to labour relations, a subject wbich I shaîl
discuss wlien labour legislation is before us.
1 do not. propose to deal with agriculture at
this time. I say quite candidly te, tbe bouse
that I amn vory mucb disturbed hy the attitude
that tbe present guvernient lias always maintainced towards agriculture. To my mind its
whale policy indicates a forgetfulaess of the

faet rlîat agricuire, and cspecial1y farm agriculture. is the basic industry of our country.
I do not believe the government bas ever given
ibat industry the rights that it ougbt to bave.
I arn not going to indulge in a long discussion
of this niatter. for it is coming up later, but
frankly 1 saxy that to contract to furnish wheat
to Great Britain at $1.55 a bushel wben it is
selling on the rnarket for $2.25, canriot ho
justified. That was the sole issue in the
Portage la Prairie by-election. The farmers
gave a most decisive vote against tbat pohicy.
turning a majority of nearly 1,900 into one of
700 the otber way. That shows conclusively
how the farmers in tbat part of the country
feît about the matter, and I believe that
farmers ail over Canada Ledl the saine way.
If we want to sell wheat to Great Britain at
$1.55, ail right; but let us all pay the, sbot and
give tie farmers a fair price.
We hear that the farmers are going te, get
botter prices for a year or two. If I read the
papers correctly, Britain is now engaged in a
life-and-deatb struggle to survive. And do
you mean to say that in two years fromn now.
if wbeat is worth on-ly 70 cents a bushel, wc
(an. make Britain .pay one dollar? Do not be
foolish! It cannot be donc.'. I will not touch
on that matter any further than this: mv
bitteieest charge against the present government, from tbe very start of the war to date,
bas bad regard to the way tbey bave dealt
with agriculture. You would think, agriculture being primary production, they would
bave been interested in putting it on a firrn
basis. The charge bas beýen made that after
the last war there was a great deflation. of
farm land values. Government policy bad
nothing to do with that. Tbe situation thon
cxisting in the western provinces was common
to ail Canada; the owners of simall parcels of
land wanted to buy more. That is not the
case at this time. The farmers learned their
lesson in 1921; every dollar they got they
devoted to paying off their debts. There bas
neyer been a greater reduction of debt than
bas occurred recently among the farmers of
our western provinces. But ail this bas notbing
to do witb the question of value. If I produce
5,000 bushels of wbeat, wby should I lose
70 cents a bushel on that crop? It cannot ho
.iustified, at any rate, unless you can prove
to me that in two years fromn now wheat will
be worth only 50 cents and BÉitain will psy
one dollar-which I know she will not do.
Marketing is mucb the same problem. 1
pass on to other subi ects.
As to immigration, I wonder if the bonourable senator for Toronto Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Robuek) is bore? I do not see bimt in the
boeuse just now.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Ho is bore.

FEBRUARY 5, 1947
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I want to thank him for
the investigation he made, undier the chairmanship of the honourable senator for Parkdale (Hon. -Mr. Murdock), into the subject of
immigration.
We need immigration to this country. I do
flot know the exact figures, but I believe
that during the last year we lost 24,000 of
our best men and women to the United
States. We are going to continue to suifer
frorn these heavy losses unless we do something towards increasing the population of
our country. Ail my life, except for a year
or two, 1 have lived in the province of
Manitoba. I was teaching school on June
23, 1896. when the Laurier Government came
into power. About four years later the Honourable Mr. Sifton, who was then Minister of
the Interior, brought thousands of people into
this country under an immigration policy. I
say quite candidiy to you that we can get an
equally good or an even better class of
immigrants at the present time owing to the
conditions in Europe. We can get many
people, not oniy from Europe, to, corne to
this country if we give thern the opportunity.
It is said that our soldiers must be empioyed
hefore we admit other people. Weli, I a.sk,
how is that going to, be done when it is
necessary to bring out 4,000 Poles to go on
the farms? Why were they brought here?
It was because our men would not go on the
farina. Why are those who are engaged in
the production of pulpwood clamouring for
mnen? Because our people will not go into
the bush. I do not biame the men who wiii
flot go into the bush. Do not rnisunderstand
me. I have found out that thie first, or certainily the second generation of those whom
the government of 1900 brought into this
country will not do the jobs which. the original immigrants did when they came here.
Take railroading, for instance. In the early
days the C.P.R. which was the principal railroad at that time, ernployed mainly continental Europeans as section men. Then
came the Englishman. Gradualiy the English
dropped out until only the boss was an
Englishman; ail the rest were men froin
Central Europe. Today the only men engaged
in that work are from central Europe, and it
has become so difficult to do this work by
sections that the rallroads have hiad to work
by gangs.
We need more people. Think of the
opportunities available in the country north
of Edmonton, in northern Saskatchewan,
and in northern Manitoba. It may be said
that it is coid there. Yes, it is coid; it was
cold when my father went to Manitoba, and
lie lived to be 92. H1e iived in thie West for

1

about fifty years, and other men have done
the same thing. I believe there are opportunities in our northern country. Take for
instance the minerai development of northern Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta;
and we find the same situation in Quebec
and Ontario. There are abundant opportunities for men who want to go into that
country and develop it. Our young men and
wvomen of ability will drift to where -the
opportunities are greatest; there is no doubt
about that. We have the machinery available.
Our two transcontinental systems
could, with very little additional extension,
handie a population of 25,000,000 people.
The same is truc of our munîcipalities, our
provincial governients and our dominion
governinent. AIl the work required to take
care of a large additional population could
be done with very littie extra expense. We
must take the opportunity when it offers,
hecause once the people of Europe settie
down and return again to their own ways
they will not want to corne to this country.
The only ones who will come wiil be the
wastrels. I arn therefore of opinion -that
the honourabie senator for Toronto-Trinity
did a real service to this house and to Canada
when lie brought forward this subject for our
consideration.
The next point which is deait with in the
Speech from the Throne is defence; and
reference is made to finance and to export
trade. These apart froin some special questions to which I wish to refer, cover the
Speech frorn the Throne.
I want to say a word about the political
situation in Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Good!
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It may not be what you
expect. I wîll deal with this more fuily
later.
Having had the honour of 'being in New
York recentiy at the meeting of the United
Nations, I came away with one thought uppermost in rny mind. I arn not going ta deai
witb general probleins, but with a point which
particularly concerns Canada. I amn impressed
with it after having been at the meeting of
the Canadian Bar Association at Winnipeg in
the Iast week of August, when a certain issue
was raised. This is an issue which is not
restricted to Canada or the United States;
but we people here, perhaps more than those
of any other nation, face a struggle between
communism and democracy. Make no mis
take a-bout it; it is a life and death struggle.
There is no use condemning the Communises:
t'hat wili not get us any place. What we
have to do is to show that under a systein of
democracy a young country like ours, with

SENATE
great natural resources, can give the indýividual
a better-rounded life than the Russian system
can provide. One bas only to read such a book
as I Choose Freedom, by Kravshenko, to be
assured of this. Had I not been in New York
I might have questioned the conclusions in
Kravshenko's book; but during those six or
seven weeks I had the opportunity of watching
delegates from Europe, whom I will mention
later, and of seeing what they did. They
believe in the system of dictatorship revolution. In Yugoslavia the government arrested
an archbishop and put him in jail. It was not
a question of religion; he was treated in this
fashion because he believed in a freedom which
th ey do not like. That is a common condition
in Europe. The spy business which we have
witnessed recently is only an offshoot of
activities which exist in every part of Canada,
where there are men and women who admit
that tbey have a greater loyalty to Communism than they have to Canadianism. I
much regret to see lawyers at Winnipeg, some
of them with Communist leanings, bring in a
condemning the governmentresolution
although, the Lord knows, I am not a supporter of the King government-simply
because they want to take a jab at democracy
through this attack upon the government.
And I am sure I express the opinion of honourable senators, and indeed of a great number
of people in Canada, when I say that when it
broke on our ears that we had men and
women in the public service of Canada who
were prepared, to put Russia before this
country, and Communism before civilization,
we felt the time had come to do something,
and do it quickly.
That is not an ideal situation, honourable
senators. The city of Winnipeg has ten members in the local legislature, and I am sorry
to say that one of them is the chairman of
the Communist party for Canada. On the
city council there are two Communist aldermen, and on the school board, of all places,
there is one member who is a Communist
and boasts of it. That is the challenge we
face in this country. Do not sit back and
think that you can change these people by
arguing against Communism, because you cannot. They do net listen to that. That does
net mean anything to them. We have to
provide a better system of government, of
distribution, and of dealing man-to-man in
our country than they have under their
system. So much for that.
Then we face a further problem. When the
Communists are eliminated, you have three
parties left-the C.C.F., the Liberal party and
the Progressive Conservatives. You have only
got to follow the day by day report from

Great Britain to notice that there-and that
is near te us-under Socialism, they are drifting gradually to control and regimentation.
You only have to live in Manitoba to know
what they are doing in Saskatchewan. It does
not matter what they say they do; it is what
they do. You have no right to vote for any
'ther party at all. While I criticize the present
government for the control system, and think
it should have been taken off after the war,
I admit that I voted for it during the war.
I thought it would help to win the war. If
you want controls to continue, vote for the
C.C.F. You have only got to read the speech
of the honourable leader of the party in the
other place te realize the underlying thought
in the speech.
That leaves the parties that stand for free
enterprise, for democracy, as I call it, in this
country. The people voting in the next election will have to choose which one of these
parties they intend to put in charge of the
business in this country.
The next question I wish to deal with, and
very briefly, is housing. I readily admit that
housing is the most difficult problem the government his had to face. I trace part of the
trouble to the inception of rent control. I
know that you will not agree with that; but
I wish to tell you that human nature, being
what it is, the minute rent control went into
effect all speculative building stopped. Nobody with any brains would build a speculative house if controls were on, because he
would have no idea of what would happen.
As a result of control, for two or three years
there was no building at all.
In
the second place, the government
adopted a system of part-control for the erection of some of its own buildings, and gave
part-supply te others. As a consequence, in
many cities across Canada, including Toronto,
Montreal, Regina and Saskatoon, as I happen
to know, there were hundreds of houses
started which are still not completed. There
is one development in the Fort Garry site in
Winnipeg where 214 bouses were started. I
believe they were started in the fall of 1945
or early in 1946. A total of fourteen of these
have been occupied up to the present time.
I am told that they lack this, that or the
other thing. You can go around in the cities
of Winnipeg, Saskatoon or Regina, street by
street, and find bouses that have been in the
process of construction for a year or a year
and a half, and that are not yet finished.
There is talk now of building a thousand or
more bouses in Winnipeg for soldiers; but
the only effect of such a programme will be
to prevent supplies froin going to other
bouses which have been commenced but not

FEBRUARY 5,1947
com-pleted. I feel that these thousand bouses
should not be started until the others are
finished.
In connection with the wartirne bouses in
Winnipeg-and I can speak of thern with
authority-the ones builV by the goverfiment
were without foundations or furnaces, and
were constructed of green lumber. That
lumber is ail shrînking, and I understand these
buildings cost $4,000 or 35,000 each. The other
day it was suggested that they be sold to the
people who, occupied, them, andi the iargest
oeffer received was $2,50W. That is very disastrous. These places are goîng to cost the
people of this country 50 per cent on all the
money put into them, and they are going to
make slum districts of the parts of the cities
where they are built. So mucli for housing.
Now I corne ta controis. I should like ta
say on contrais what I really think, 'but as
the honourable leader of the governrent just
said, bis dealing with this problcmn are
caming down next week. I wouid just have
to repeat myscîf ail over again, if I went into
it now. But I shall say this: I read the
announcernent of the Prime Minister yesterday in which lie saîd that there would be a
period of price controls, followed by a
.gradual removal. The controls may last for
several months, 'but they cannot be cut off toc
sgoan to satisfy -me. The sooner this is donc,
.the sooner we shall get back to major production. There is no doulit about it. Take, for
insstance, shirts. The prices on shirts were
regulated and it was said that a certain kind
of shirt woulcL cost $425 made-to-order. I was
nýever able to purchase a made-ta-order shirt
for that amount; I always had ta pay $5.00.
This year I could get a shirt with three
separate collars for 36.50. But the Wartime
Prices and Trade Board said, "No, sir, you
cannot have that shirt"; yet the manufacturer
was allowed to make a fancy shirt and- charge
$10.00 for it. That is the situation under prîce
control. The manufacturers do not make, the
articles that are under control-Why would
thcy?-but they do manufacture the articles
that are not under control, and that use up
just as much material. The bills relating to
controls will be coming to us in the near
future, and we shaîl then have an opportunity
ta deal with th-ese problemns.
1 arn disturbed about tbe 'trade situation
in which Canada finds herseif at -the present
time. The other day the Minister of Trade
and Commerce said that in 1946 Canada
had enjoyed the ]argest trade of any peacetime year in ber history. But what did we
do? We paid cash for the goods we houglit,
and at the same time we .sold our goods on
credit and we lent the inoney to those who

21

purchased them. I refer particularly to Great
Britain. Why should she not buy our goods?
We gave her the money. Lord knows, she
will flot pay it back! We also loaned two
millions to France. How much bas she got
left?
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: Is my honourable
friend opposed to the policy of loaning money
to Great Britain?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I thought that the
honourable member for Central Saskatchewan
would ask a question such as that, and I arn
prepared for it. I arn as willing as anyhody
to lend money to Great Britain, but I do
not think that it will do any good if the British
people are going to work forty hours a week
when we in this country have to work fifty or
sixty hours a week. I do not think that is good
business for this country or any other
coun'try. Great Britain 'las the money; she
is using it up. The other day Mr. Dalton,
Chancellor of 'the ExchequeT, said that Great
Britain was living on "tick". "Tick" is a
good old English word; I heard it first when
I was a boy and I do flot think I need to
explain what it ineans. If that -condition
does exist there is no reason under the sun
why we should walk into it. In Britain
they are trying out socialismn and if socialism
cannot be made to succeed in that coun'try or
in any other country except by borrowing
money-aud I do not thiak it can-it will
disappear. Experience the world over has
been that you cannot get as mucli production
out of industry under goverfiment control as
under private control. Honourable senators
will remember that during the First World
War the production of coal in BTitain fell
rapidly under government contrai but that once
the goverament control was lif'ted production
increased again. Tbey are concerned about
goverament control of coal over 'there now.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Tbey are freezing.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Tbey are not only freezing; tbey are starving. People in my city
are sending money through the Hudson Bay
Company and the Eaton Company to Denmark, for goods to be shipped to Britain to
heip pull themn through. I arn a Britisher,
and my boy fougbt for Canada, just as 'thousands of other boys did; but there is no use
doing something which at the very start you
know is going to fail. That is the kind of
thing we are doing now.
What is the government's policy regarding
trade? What is going to happen when the
lending of money stops? We can seil goods
in our own country, but we certaînly cannot
seli goods to European countries if we do net
lend themn mon-ey to pay their accounts. I

SENATE
read in the paper the other day that a British
M.P., on a visit to the United States, was
advising that country to keep on lending
money to the rest of the world. I have no
proof of this, but I believe that from 1920 to
1929 the United States lent billions of dollars
to Europe, during whieh period Europe purchased large quantities of American goods,
but that in 1929, when the United States
stopped lending money, Europe stopped buying. We are faeing the sane condition today,
and what I want to know from the leader of
the bouse is: What is the policy of the
government to be when we stop lending money
to European countries? We are told there are
going to be conventions in London and other
places. But what can trade conventions do if
people who want to buy goods have no money
to pay for them? It seems to me that some
of these people who need to be fed should
be brought over to our own country and be
fed here.
We in western Canada are much more
deeply interested in this trade problem than
are the people of eastern Canada. The western
provinces, like the Maritimes, are largely producers of raw materials. Outlets have got to
be found for our grain, or prices will go to
pieces. I am perturbed about the absence of
government policy. In another place the
Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime
Minister, "What is your policy for world trade
ance we have passed over the present period?"
That is the question we have to face in this
country. We members of this house ought to
be more interested in that problem than in
any other, and if the business men here cannot give a lead in reaching a solution, I do
not know where a lead can be found.
The next question I want to deal with-but
perhaps I am talking too longSome Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: -is dominion-provincial
relations. That is a very vexed problem.
There are four or five "have not" provinces
and three or four "have" provinces. Up to
1941 there was no federal tax on successions,
electricity, gasoline, pari mutuels, and various
other things from which the provinces had
always derived revenue. In that year the
dominion government made a deal whereby it
not only took over from the provinces personal
income taxes and corporation taxes, but also
went into the fields that I have mentioned
and a number of others besides. It bas
remained in all those fields ever since. The
only tax that it bas handed back to the
provinces-and this was done lately, under
pressure-is the ga olixne fax.

The premier of m'y province of Manitoba
came here to the dominion-provincial conference last May, and somebody has said-I hope
he hears this-that he strove to make the
conference a success. I do not blame him;
I should have done the same thing. The
sources of revenue that he was renting to
the dominion government would yield about
$4,000,000 to our province, and in a private
deal he go t about $11,000,000 from the federal
treasury.
Why should he not make that
deal?
And why should not Saskatchewan
make the deal that it has made? It will get
-bout $13,000,000 for giving up taxes that
would have brought in about $1,000,000 to the
province. Besides, very large sums for unemployment relief from 1930 to 1935 are thrown
off. Representatives of Alberta then came
here and made a deal. Why shouldn't they?
New Brunswick did the saine, and why not?
Unless you are foolish, you never look a gift
horse in the mouth. Why should not the
Prince Edward Island people have made the
deal that they did? They will get $2,000,000.
They are the "Johnny boys" of the whole lot.
But here is the situation. The two provinces
in Canada that control the House of Commons
have net made a deal with the dominion
government, and they say they will not make
one under present conditions. They may be
right or wrong, but there is the fact; and we
cannot carry on under a dominion-provincial
agreement into which the two greatest
provinces refuse to enter. I may be told that
the premier of Quebec, in the stand which he
bas taken, does not represent the views of
that province. Well, ever since he took that
stand he has won every by-election by a
larger majority than was ever polled before
in the respective constituencies.
No doubt the attitude of the dominion
government is that these two provinces will
be forced into an agreement because the
people do not like double taxation. That is
the dominion government's only answer. But
remember this, honourable senators: there are
two sides to that question as to every other
question. I do not believe that Ontario or
Quebec will want to be taxed in order that
big sums of money may be paid to other
parts of Canada. I do not believe the people
of Quebec will vote to transfer succession
duties to the dominion, nor do I believe that
the people of Ontario will; and I hate to see
Manitoba doing it. This is one tax that
shlould bave remained with the provinces, and
it was mst unfair for the dominion to take
it over. One of the chief uses that the
dominion makes of its succession duty law is
to trace the income of dead men and women
in order to sec whether they paid sufficient

FEBRUARY 5, 1947
income taxes in their lifetime. I repeat that
that has been one of the chief uses the
dominion has made of this law. You cannot
get succession duties approved unless you can
explain how a person who paid an income
tax of so much left an estate of a certain
value. In dealing with one estate the other
day the department said: "During the last
ten years this man reported an income of
such-and-such an amount. How is it that he
left so much money?" That is the difficulty
you face now. Canada can never prosper as
a united nation so long as that sort of thing
continues.
In my judgment-I believe I am expressing
the opinion of not only Manitoba but of the
whole country-there is only one way in
which our provinces and the dominion can
get together: that is by sitting around a table
until they have thresbed out their differences,
whether this takes a week or a month or a
year. When there is a dispute between labour
and industry the government says to these
people, "Why don't your representatives get
together around a table and come to an agreement?" Yet that very government refuses to
sit down with representatives of the provinces.
I sat in the gallery here and listened to the
discussions at the dominion-provincial conference of last May, and the federal government's attitude was strongly criticized by the
premier of Nova Scotia and other premiers.
It was clear that there was no attempt on the
part of the federal government to make a
deal then. In fact, the budget proposals
represented an offer of about $180,000,000 to
the provinces-I believe I am right in that,
but if not I will stand corrected. But now
if all the provinces come in on an agreement
on the terms that were given to British
Columbia, the total payments will amount to
I believe that the only
about $227,000,000.
solution of this matter is for the government
to get all the provinces together and stay
with them until they can reach an agreement
of such a character that the men who resist
it wil- be resisting for political reasons and
not on constitutional grounds or in the best
interests of Canada.
Hon. Mr. EULER: When you say $227,-

000,000, does that include Ontario and Quebec?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I understand so. That
is the last offer. The original offer was
$180,000,000, Uit the last offer was $227,000,000,
providing they come in on the same basis.
The Sirois report was founded on the principle
of fiscal need. I do not know that there is
much difference between what is recommended

and what is being done now; but the present
method is to count the heads and give the

23

old statutory allowance, and then to give 50
per cent of what was collected prior to 1941.
It happened that at that time British Columbia
had a very beavy taxation. I am reminded
of the time when the government froze rents.
I was somewhat of a grasping landlord. My
clients' rents were all up good and high, but
those of my next door neighbour, who was
not quite so grasping and was a very nice
fellow, were down low. He is still getting
his low rent and my clients are getting their
high rents. British Columbia had a very
high taxation of personal and corporation incomes, and a 50 per cent provision gives them
a much higher proportion than some of the
other provinces get. The minute that was
known, Manitoba came along and said, "You
are only giving us $11,000,000, you ought to
give us $13,100,000." So the government came
through with another $2,100,000. Saskatchewan
did the same thing, and I believe New Brunswick also.
In my view the only solution is the one
I have suggested. Although I am not invariably in agreement with Mr. Bracken, I
entirely agree with the stand taken by him
on this question in another place. Nb man
in Canada knows so much of this problem as
he does. He was engaged on it for ten years,
five years as premier of our province, and
he made a bitter fight in 1937 or 1938 to have
something done to improve the situation.
The problein is with us, and we should not
leave it as a festering sore in the public life
of this country. It will be solved some day,
and it must be solved right. We want Ontario
and Quebec to be in on the agreement, but
unless they get a deal which their premiers,
rightly or wrongly, believe they should get,
I do not see any hope for the success of the
present arrangement.
That, I think, pretty well covers the question of taxation. Our taxes are too high. There
is a theory that the people who have incomes
should be taxed; that taxation should be based
on ability to pay. I often question whether
that is the right formula. Let me illustrate
what I mean. In the city of Winnipeg are
two stores which have been in business there
for many years. During the period from 1930
to 1937 one made a large annual profit, I believe about $1,000,000 a year; the other one
went behind about half a million dollars a year.
The store which made a profit of $1,000,000
sold goods cheaper than they were sold by the
company which lost about half a million. This
was possible because of the buying ability and
knowledge of markets of the manager of the
$1,000,000 profit organization, as against the
inability of the other man to buy and to size
up the market. But who was taxed? Thev

24

SENATE

taxed the feliow who made the $1,000,000 and
who showed more enterprise and employed
far more people than the other man did. That
i.s the principle of ability to pay. Here is one
man whio makes a success of life. H1e engages
in a business and develops it, and employs a
large number of people and makes a profit. lie
pays heavy taxes. The other raseai on the
other side of the road makes a failure of life.
He emnpioys; only a few people, and does nlot
aiways pay them, and inl no way develops
industry. Under our income tax law the man
who makes the rnoney pays the piper. Taxation nowadays is so bigh and takes away so
much that enterprise-and I do not blame itis unwiliing to exert itself to make mioney.
This is true of professional men and iabouring
men alike. Reeently I met a professional man
on the street in Winnipeg, and I said te, him,
"What are you doing this afternoon?" Hie
,,aid, "I do not work on Fridays and Saturdays". I said, "Wby?" "Well," ho said, "I
would only have to give it back to Mr. Ilsley,
and if I .spend my time with the people at
home I won't have to do that." I asked
another man why he did not work on Saturday
at his fflace of business. Hie said "I arn making
enough money, and taxes are so heavy that it
doesn't pay me to corne and work."
That sort of thing applies ail through the
piece. I have flot exaggerated it at ail. Why
has the bacon production of our country
fallen? Because the wife and children of the
farmer are no longer willing to look after and
feed the pigs when the profit made by the
farmer bas to be paid out in
in-come
Production of milk and butter has fallentax.
in
our province for the same reason. What is the
use of putting in a hard week's grind when the
governrnent takes haîf the money? That is
how people argue. Tbey say: "AVe will restriet
ourseives to wheat so that we shall have to
work onîy four months, and wo will take our
share of the pr-oceeds." That is the situation
aIl across tbis country, more particularly in
the Prairie Provinces, where it pays botter
to produce wheat after you get into the
income*tax bracket. The small farmer is not
in the sarne position, because his exemptions
are highier.
I say that this country ought to reduce
income tax riglit across the board. I understand that some men favour bigher exemptions for single people wbiie others faveur
hig-her exemptions for rnarried people; but by
and large we need reductions right across the
board. 1 do nlot know what the United States
are going to do, but 1 understand that the
purposc of the Republican majority in the
Seate ai(l the flouse of Representatives is to
trx- te reach the objective of a 20 per cent eut

across the board. That is their judgrnent as
to what should be done, and whether it is
right or wrong, I do not think it is far out.
I have not yet touched on old age pensions.
I arn waiting for the government's bill. Anyone can suggest that old age pensions sbouid
be boosted and that the age should ho
reduced. But bonestly, I do not know bow old
people live today on $20 a month. I was
brougbt up in a hard sebool, on a prairie
farrn, and know sometbing about the problem
of subsistence; but frankly I do not know how
these old people live. In our province tbey
are getting.$25 a month, the provincial governiment baving suppleýmonted the federal
allowance by $5. But even witb that addition
I still do flot understand how they manage
to live. I arn not going to suggest any figure
to the government, but I hope that in bringing in tbeir bill they will remember that the
dollar today, as cornpared with 1926 or 1927,
when the first pensions were paid, is worth
onîy about 50 cents. 1 believe there should
be a real and substantial increase.
This beaves me the one question of the
New York meeting. I like to psy a compliment when I can to the Prime Minister of
this country. His decision in 1945 to send
te, San Francisco a Canadian delogation cornposed of representatives of the main parties
in the other bouse was a master stroke of
statesmanship, and bie is entitied to credit.
I nover realized this as rnuch as thîs la.st faîl,
wbon, upon the invitation of tbe government,
I witb the leader opposite bad the opportunity to go to New York to represent the
Sonate and Canada in the assembly. Let me
tell you the story.
We arrived in New York, and every morning tbroughout the six or seven weeks tbat 1
was there we mot at nine o'clock in a generai
committee roorn. Ail the delegates and officers
and specialists--I think there were about
twenty of them-sat around a table frorn
nino to ton and discussod ail the problems
that came before them, and ex ory msan spoko,
flot as a Conserx ativo, nlot as a Liberal, not
as a supporter of the C.C.F., but as a Canadian and only as a Canadian.
WVe nover
spoke or thought on any other lines. If I
may be pardonied a personal reference, 1 can
cite an incident which inay heip yeou to understand wbat I mean. That boy of mine wrote
me a letter from hlomle: 'Dear Dad: We xviii
be glad to see you back home; but don't
corne home uniess you eau make it so th'xt
I won't hiave to go to Europe again." That
expresses the opinion of the people of the
w id. Lt uis so shape things that our men
%oi
wii flot hut ot go to Europe again.

FEBRUARY 5, 1947
What did we do in New York? You may teill
me that the United, Nations is no good, that it
has failed here and failed there. I will admit
everything you say, but please tell me what
you would put in its place? I saw the representatives of fifty-one nations sitting around
a table. We sat in a horse-shoe: Canada was
here, Byelorussia was there, China was there;
and we sat there every day for weeks and
weeks and discussed the agenda. You may
say that we neyer got any thanks. Oh yes.
we did. Let me tell you what h-appened at
one committee. On the legal committee I sat
next to the Byelorussian delegate. We started
at three o'clocek in the afternoon to define the
word "meeting". This is a meeting; but
under the charter tha.t is flot the way the
word is used. According to the 'charter a
"(meeting" bas to fulfl some purpose; it may
sit twenty times, but it is stili the same meeting. For the election of a member to a
comrnittee it is necessary to have the votes of
flot less than two-tbirde of ail the members.
As there are fifty-one nations, thirty-four
votes are required before you are elected; if
only twenty-five cast their votes you cannot
be elected. In order to establish a definition
which would avoid misunderstandings we discussed the matter. Fifty-one nations--one
representative from each-took part, and the
discussion lasted from three o'clock until
twenty minutes after six, when wc agreed
unanimously on a definition, and acjourned.
We met the next afternoon at three o'clock to
approve the minutes. The secretary, or rapporteur, as they cail him-I caîl him
"secretary"ý-reacl the report, and it was
cxactly as we hiad agreed on. But would Russia
accept it? Oh no. The Russian delegate got
up and, for two hours pounded the table to
hammer home bis views. It was not two hours
of one continuous speech, but only one-third
of that time. The other .two-thjrds were taken
up by the Englisb and French translations.
Perbaps I sbould not say it, but to me the
speech did not mean much more than a device
for delaying time. Then the representative
of tbe "United Kingdom", as Great Britain is
cal-led. proposed an amendmen-t changing four
words. The amendmen-t did flot change the
meaning but merely improved the grammatical
construction. The amendiment was seconded
by the United States delegate, and after a
little more discussion, came on for a vote. I
turned to my advisers, three or four fellows
telling me what to, do. They said to vote for
the original motion, against the United Kingdom and the Uni.ted States. 1 saîd that I
agreed witb that. I knew that the United
Kingdom motion would carry and so d-id
everyhody else. It got about thîrty-one votes.
Then tbey asked for those wbo were flot in

25

favour, up went my band. The delegates from
Byelorusia always sit next to Canada, and one
of them turned, to me. He could flot converse
in English, but be said, "My God, you vote
against the United Kingdoml"
That describes the situation. However,
nothing that you could write between now and
doomsdýay could convince that man as to wbat
I did that day. I did not do it because I was
trying to convince him. That was not the
idea. I turned to bis interpreter, a young
lady, snd I said: "You tell your de.legate that
not only on this committee but on other committees, Canada votes against the United Kingdom or the United States or anybody else
when she thinks they are wrong, and that what
they propose is not in the înterest of this
organization". 1 give that as an illustration of
one of the benefits of meeting these men,
because they think of Canada as part of tbe
Britisb Commonwealth in the same way as
they do of Byclorussia or of the Ukraine,
countries wbich are part of Russia aud whicb
have their independence in everything except
in matters of war and armies and foreign
policy. Those men learned it the bard way
in New York. I saw it myseif every dayhow Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South
Afirica, India and Great Britain would vote
and do what tbey thought was best in the
interests of world peace. Naturally, we tried
to see eye-to-eye with the United States.
Naturally, we trîed to see eye-to-eye with
Great Britain and with Australia; aud w e
endeavoured to see eye-to-eye with ail democratic countries, hecause we knew that the
democratie countries had sometbing that the
dictator countries neyer bad. However, even
then sometimes we could not agree.
flonourable senators, let me go a littie
furtber. The next thing that strikes one at
that meeting is the number of coloured people
there are in the world. I did not know there
were so many coloured races until I went to
that meeting. I was very much surprised to
learu that the largest part of the world's
population is coloured. Wben the colour question comes up, believe me, it comes up; and
whoever is against it just goes downt
That brings me to the veto. Anybody can
argue in favour of the veto in principle, but
any practical person of understanding who bas
attended auy of those meetings will admit
that without the veto there would be no
United Nations. Ail would end ini chaos.
I wish to psy a compliment to my bonourable frieud, the leader of the government,
hecause he deserves it. There were six committees, and he was chairman of the Trustee
Committee. He made an address before that
committee which was a credit to Canada.
Some Hlon. SENATORS: Heur, bear.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. HAIG: You ask me how I know?
I know because he read the speech to us at
one of those nine o'clock meetings, and we
OK'd it.
I wish to fell you a little more about those
meetings. It is going on the record, but I
do not wish it to get to the ears of Mr. St.
Laurent. He brought in a speech that he was
going to deliver to Committee No. 1. It did
not have much kick to it. He went around
the room with it, and when lie saw me he
showed it to me and said, "What do you
think of it?" I said, "I do not like it."
Honourable Mr. Robertson said, "I agree with
Haig." Honourable Mr. Martin said, "I agree
with Haig", and Mr. St. Laurent said, "So
do I".
We were all very proud of what our boys
and girls did in the last war; we were likewise
very proud of what our people did at home;
but I was never more proud of Canada than
I was after what I saw in those six or seven
weeks in New York. I do not say this because
I was present at the meetings. Everybody
from Canada had the same spirit. We desired
to be worthy of our country and to give to
the rest of the world something that would
be of use and benefit to it. Man after man
with whom I went out walking during the
lunch hours said to me; "How is it that
Canada can send a delegation in which three
or four parties are represented. How do you
do it?" I said; "That is the policy of both
the government and the opposition, and if
the present Prime Minister were to go out of
power tomorrow and Mr. Coldwell were to
corne in, the policy would be the same policy;
and if either Mr. Bracken or Mr. St. Laurent
were to be put in power, that policy would
be maintained,
Now the world knows it.
That policy not only makes for peace but also
for stability of international relationships. We
act as a unit in every respect, and the world
knows it.
Hon. Mr. EULER: May I be permitted to
ask a question at this time? Perhaps it is
not a fair one. You spoke with considerable
ap provai of the fact that the delegates consisted of representatives from the various
parties, and that they did not speak as members of their respective parties but as Canad;ans. My question is this: Do you feel that
that would be a good practice to have in the
Senate of Canada?
Hon. Mr. IIAIG: Well, I thought I was
giving an illustration of that this afternoon.
The benefit that I saw from the United
Nations was self-evident, and although I was
unable to be present during the last two
week
I heard from men who were there

that Russia was drifting from the strong,
determined stand, which she took at the
start to a more conciliatory position. I arn
not one of those persons who predicts that
we are going to have war with Russia; I do
not think we are; but I do feel that if we
were ever to take down our defence we would
have war. The United States, net unlike
Canada, has a bi-partisan commission. The
magnificent contributions made by Senators
Vandenberg and Connally on behalf of
democracy were priceless. Malinski, the delegate from the Ukraine, was in the chair, and
Russia was opposing what was going on. After
five heurs of debate, Senator Connally got the
floor and he said: "Mr. Chairman, you have
talked most of the afternoon. As chairman
of this meeting you have no right to talk
ai all. This is a democratic meeting in which
you are only the chairman, and I demand
that you put the motion. We have talked
it up-hill and down-dale, and we want to
know what the conclusion is to be". The
result was a majority of thirty-seven to one
in favour of Senator Connally. I can give
you illustration upon illustration of the conmittees on which I sat. Generally the vote
was thirty-nine to four. The Russian satellites are, of course, Byelorussia and the
Ukraine, who with Yugoslavia always vote
with Russia. Poland generally votes with
Russia, but not always. Czechoslavakia votes
with Russia even less.
Perhaps I may relate a personal experience.
The Czechoslovakian delegates sit next to the
Canadian delegates in the General Assembly.
They have a public address system. When a
man speaks in English what lie says is translated into French, and when he speaks in
Spanish his remarks are translated into both
English and French. This takes time, and during this period one generally goes around and
visits his neighbours. As honourable senators
know, I am the visiting type. During my
rounds I visited Mr. Masaryk after he made
his speech, which was in good English. I said
to him. "In Canada we have the Niagara Falls,
and years ago men used to walk across the falls
on a tight rope." I said, "If you will pardon
my nentioning it, you were on a tight rope
today."
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I heard today on the radio
that a man is going over Niagara Falls in a
rubber ball. What about that?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Mr. Masaryk replied to
me, "If you had the United Kingdom on one
side of you and the United States on the other,
wxhat would you do?" He explained that with
Russia on one -ide. backed by millions of
men, he had cto watch his step.

FEBRUARY 5, 1947
I believe that the United States will never
let down her defence until she can get inside
Russia and see what is going on. I went to
the General Assembly with the feeling that a
great number of Canadians have, namely, that
we might have a war. I do not believe that
now. I believe that in these international
gatherings other nations will see what countries
like Australia, New Zealand and ourselves are
doing. And remember, we contribute more to
their understanding than do the United States
or the United Kingdom, because they know
we have not the strength to stand up against
them. I went out with the Iran delegate, and
he said to me: "How do you people live
opposite the United States? Do they not
dictate what you will do and what you will not
do?" I said, "No. Sometimes their politicians
think they get the better of us, but in all the
120 years that we have had the international
boundary they have never tried to dictate to
us. You can ask your American friends, and
they will give you the same answer." That is
the sort of thing that illustrates to these people
what democracy means. I shall go no further
than that.
Just one more word. I am sorry that the
ministers of the four great powers did not
invite Canada and other nations to take part
in the discussion of the peace treaty with Germany. I think they have made a grave mistake. I entirely agree with the government's
action in this regard. I do not believe you
can have a fundamental world-peace if you
cannot enter into the terms of the peace. Take
the countries that have made a great contribution. Canada is one of those countries and
I feel that we should be asked to take part
in making the peace. We more than any other
country except Australia and South Africaprobably South Africa more-could give Germany an illustration of how democracy can
work than anybody else. In New York there

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, the practice of expressing a word of appreciation to the mover and
seconder of the address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne is even easier to follow on
this occasion than it has been on many
occasions in the past. I want to join with
the honourable leader opposite in complimenting the honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McKeen) and the honourable senator from Grandville (Hon. Mr.
Bouffard) upon the speeches that they delivered in this house yesterday, and I do so
without in any way reflecting upon the
excellent speeches that I have heard on
similar motions since I have been a member
of the Senate. I admired the eloquence of
the honourable gentleman from Vancouver
and the logical manner in which he
marshalled his arguments; and I could not
but feel that in him the west coast of Canada
bas a great champion. I listened as well with
the utmost pleasure and admiration to the
speech of the honourable gentleman from

opposite, I am frank to say that I could not
follow it in every detail, but that I since
have had the opportunity of reading a translation, and wish to congratulate the honourable gentleman upon his splendid speech. I
admired and envied the facility with which
he moved from the French language to the
English.

We discussed, for instance, the Spanish situation, and we agreed upon it unanimously.

I confess to you, honourable senators, that
I never regretted anything so much as my
inability to express myself in the two official
languages of Canada while at the United
Nations meetings in New York. How I
envied our distinguished leader Mr. St.
Laurent, who moved so gracefully among the
delegates of all the countries represented
there! I envied not only his knowledge of
the French language, which was understood
by practically 99 per cent of the delegates,
but his ability to say the polite thing, the
nice thing, on the appropriate occasion. I
thought of -that as I listened to the seconder
of the address yesterday. To my English

acquire facility in the English language, but
urge them not te forget their French in the
process.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Facility in the
two languages is a great advantage, and perhaps one of the factors accounting for Canada's
high reputation at international conferences.
There are perhaps many subjects which
one with my responsibilities should discuss on
an occasion such as this, but which I shall
touch upon only briefly today. I realize that
the honourable leader opposite would have
liked to have more time to deal in some detail
with many of the matters that be mentioned.
It is to be hoped that later on there will be
opportunity to discuss some of these in more
detail, and if I hurry over them now it is
not because of lack of appreciation of their
importance but rather because I do not wish
to trespass unduly upon your time.
Let me say here that my honourable
friend's criticisms of thè government did not
strike me as being very serious. As I listened
to his remarks I more or less sympathized with
him, for I could sec that despite bis ordinary
good judgment and keen appreciation of public
matters he was somewhat handicapped by
the negative attitude of his party in dominion
affairs, and that after all be was only doing
the best he could in the circumstances. I know
it is customary to denounce controls in theory,
and I do not suppose there is an individual
in the country who bas net been in some
way inconvenienced by them.
It is easy
enough to criticize the administration of the
controls, but at this moment when we are
emerging from our tremendous war effort and
going through an almost unbelievably successful transition from war to peace, there is net
a business man in Canada who in bis heart
of hearts does not believe that one of the
outstanding accomplishments of the government has been the controlling of prices in
order that there might not be a boom and a
collapse such as followed the last war.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The more a man
bas been engaged in business, the more ho
bas to be thankful for in that respect. I
know that controls are unpopular, that the
government bas been criticized and ridiculed
because of them, but I believe honourable
senators will agree that when we get a proper
perspective we realize that nothing contributed more to the success of our war effort
and to a sound basis for the future success
of our country than tbose very controls.

Business after business and industry after
industry in this country can thank tieir stars
that controls were maintained.
My honourable friend opposite says that
grain growers cannot get as high prices for
wheat as they could get on a free market.
People in the lumber business can say the
same thing with regard to their products; so
can the manufacturers of steel, the manufacturers of farm implements, and so on. Our
producers and manufacturers cannot get on
the home market as much as if they were permitted to sell all their goods on a free expert
market. But wbat would happen if they could
do so? There would be a boom for a time,
and then a bursting of prices, bringing suffering to many a business and individual. A
peculiar corollary of the present situation is
that the industry which gets the highest possible prices for its products will be in the
most unfortunate -position of all if those ýprices
cannot be maintained in the post-war period.
The producer whose goods are selling at 50,
100 or 200 per cent above pre-war prices may
be temporarily benefited; but the fearful question that must be troubling bis mind at this
moment is: When these abnormal conditions
end, will my business be caughlt in a crash of
falling prices?
There may be some merit to the argument
of the honourable leader opposite. I am not
such an expert in these matters as he, or the
honourable senator who sits beside him, but
I do know that in general the controls have
It may be
been a great accomplishment.
that in certain details they have worked a
hardship to some people, but by and large
they have made a great contribution -to the
welfare of this country. I am proud to say
that the man who as minister was responsibl
for inaugurating and administering those controls came from Nova Scotia, the Right
Honourable J. L. Ilsley. During most of the
war he had the unenviable responsibility of
financing the country's war effort-which made
it necessary to impose heavy taxes-and of

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I am sorry te
interrupt, but would the honourable leader
allow me te ask a question?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Delighted.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: He bas spoken
in glowing terms of the advantages of controis, but will he b good enough to tell us

FEBRUARY 5, 1947
about the hundreds of millions of dollars that
have been paid by the taxpayers to hold
-ceiling prices?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: 1 think that is a
fair criticism. The auestion is whether or neot
the cost of the basic necessities of 111e should
lie spread over the whole country or be borne
by unfortunate individuals who were not in
as favourable a position as other people. A
whole mass of people ini this country, the socalled white-collar class, have gone through
some very trying times, and 1 think the
government is entitled to credit for having
realized that the only practical course was
to subsidize the production of certain basic
necessities of life, s0 as ta spread the cost over
the whole community. I believe that policy
commended itself to the right thinking people
of this country.
I know that business is heavily taxed; but
as I said to a friend of mine the other day
when hie was groaning about taxation, "I can
remember in MY business experience when
what we were worryung about was not our
income tax, but the fact that we .did not have
any income ta be taxed." Any member of
this house who was in business from 1929 to
1933 knows what I arn talkung about.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I submit, hionouralile senators, ýthat in this country business
has emerged, well Irom the war. I venture ta
say that throughout the length and breadth af
this land there is hardly a business which ia
nlot in better fi.nancial position today than it
was in 1939, in respect of its obligations, its
cash into the treasury, and every.thdng else.
True, business bas been taxed heavily, but it
has had a large incarne to be taxed. And
because of the controls that we have had in
operation, business faces the future far more
confidently than if prices had been allowed to
soar. Ail honourable members who are in
business know this just as well as I do.
It ia true that somebody else might have
acted differently during the war. Canada
handled its affaira in this war better than in
the previous war. This waa nat because of the
leadership oI one particular party; -the contribution was made by all the people of Canada.
If there should 'be another war-which God
forbid-we should. impravie on what we did
during this hast one.
Despite the criticisms of my hanourable
friend, I say that Canada is in a pretty good
position today and faces the future with a
great deal of confidence.
I want to pass on now and refer briefiy to
the United Nations meeting at New York. I
do not intend ta go into any great detai'. but

29

rather to give you ane or two impressions that
I brought back with me. That meeting was
eharged with two great responsibilities in its
search for future peace. One la the question
of disarmament and a world police force, and
the other la the removing of the causes of war.
T-hese were tackled with, I think, a fair degree
of success. I want ta say, honourable senatars,
that yau have reason ta be proud of the part
played by the leader of the apposition. H1e
was the chairman of a committee, and I assure
you that hie was keenly interested in it and
rendered a great service not only by'bis advice
in regard ta the various matters that hie took
up, but through the friendly way that hie had
in meeting the variaus delegates. Af ter all,
that is a very important factor and exercises a
very great influence.
As regards the prablem. of disarmament, as
yau remember, a long debate resulted in a
unanimous resolution that the Security Council
should undertake a plan of disarmament and
a wovrld police force, ooupled with the principle
of international inspection. Now that is a
great step forward. Even if it takes montha,
even though it takes a year or more ta work
out the details of it, 1 say it is a tremendous
step forward. Then, in the field of removing
the causes of war, 1 will only remind you
that bath in the pohitical field and in the social
and economie field there were saine very.
ticklish questions. There was the matter of
Franco in Spain, and of the complaint brought
by India against South Africa, which, as the
leader of the opposition said, raised the whole
question of colour. Then there was the
problem of post-IJNRRA relief, of food, af
matters which deal directly or indirectly with
the causes of war. I behieve that when the
report cames down the leader of the opposition and myself, your delegates there, shouhd
deal with this at greater length and invite
front hanourable senators a mare detailed
discussion, because neitther hie nor I have had
the apportunity to place it before you.
1 want ta refer ta some of my impressions.
In one of the comunittees, which had ta do
with the subject of post-UNRRA relief, there
was a very long and bitter debate. UNRRA,
whîch was largehy financed by the United
States, GIreat Britain and Canada, and provided assistance to starving countries, was
comung ta an end. The question was what
wouhd happen after it ceased at the end af the
past year. There was a very definite difference
of opinion. The United States and Great
Britain took the definite position that whihe
they were going ta contribute and would contribute whatever assistance was necessary, they
did nlot want ta bave it diatributed on what
might be called an international basis by an

30

SENATE

international organization which had no direct
responsibility to the contributors. Canada's
position was that we were prepared to assist,
and that the assistance should be international
in scope, because there was the criticism that
the United States and Great Britain had used
or intended to use relief as a political weapon.
As I say, there was a very heated discussion.
It went on for weeks and, so far as numbers
were concerned, the majority were in favour
of the international distribution; but the
United States and Great Britain were adamant
that they would not go into it on that basis.
A day or two before the assembly closed it
was apparent that it was going to close without any agreement whatever on this very
important question. Mr. LaGuardia, who had
been Director of UNRRA and was passing
out of office, on a particular day made a most
violent attack on his own government, suggesting that they had the intention of using
food as a political weapon, and in the same
conneetion he was none too complimentary to
Great Britain. So you tan understand that
the situation was a very serious one. It was
a tense moment when, on a certain Saturday
morning, Mr. LaGuardia, who is a very
emotional speaker, made a dramatie appeal
for something to be done on behalf of the
starving millions of the world, to reconcile
the serions impasse; and then he said "Somebody must present a solution. I appeal to
Canada to do it. I will accept any proposai
that Canada makes, 'sight unseen'". I tell
yen, honourable senators, I have never been
placed in a position where I was subject to
the emotion which possessed me at that
moment.
Sitting with my honourable friend beside me.
I could see the eyes of the representatives of
fifty-four nations concentrated on our nameplate; and I do net mind telling you that I
was never prouder in my life. There was a
pause. Then other speakers went on, and after
about an hour and a balf Canada made a
proposal. It was a compromise suggesting
that while the administration would be on
the basis which Great Britain and the
United States were insisting upon, an international body of experts siould determine the
food needs of the countries. This body had no
official status, it did not actually distribute the
money or the food, but it would recommend
where the need was, and relieve to that extent
at lcast the political aspect. The chairman
adjourned the meeting over the week-end, and
on Monday inorning the committee was called
together again. Immediately the representatives of the United States, of Great Britain
and of the Soviet Union, and ýMr. LaGuardia,

announced tiat they agreed to Canada's solution. The only reservation was thsat they did
not think it was as good a plan as theirs.
Now honourable senators. I want to say
that this seemed to nie at the time something
of dramatie significance. You know how your
mind travels on occasions of this kind. After
ail, I reflected, ours is a country of 12,000,000
people, and, as the leader of the opposition
said. we are dealing with the representatives
of bundreds of millions of people,-340,000,000
in India, 100,000,000 in China, 200,000.000 in
the Soviet Union. How comes it that Canada,
with its 12,000,000 population, exercises this
influence? It cannot be a matter of numbers.
Wel, what does it come te? I suppose you
cannot be dogmatic and ascribe it to any
particular thing, but I can mention some circumstances whieh I think are factors.
I
remember sitting and thinking the next day
about it. To begin with, I believe the first
factor is the great effort that our boys and
girls made in the last war. Of 12,000,000
people, 1,000,000 were in the armed forces of
this country. Then there was also net only
the matter of what they did, but of what the
people at home did in the way of providing the
materials for them, and an equal amount for
our allies. Particularly. I think, our influence
arose from the fact that we, unlike any other
eountry in the world except the United
States, financed our effort without one dollar
of assistance from any other country.
I
think that impresstd the nations.
Also, I believe there are other things. I
remember one day when, on coming back
from a meeting where there had been a bitter
discussion about South Africa, the leader
of the Opposition said to me, "My, Robertson,
how happy I am that I live in Canada". And
when I heard of these bitter religions disputes
in India and the race and colour disputes in
South Africa, I recalled that one of the reasons
for the position we occupy is that we are not
a country of one particular people. Had this
been a country exclusively Anglo-Saxon in its
racial origin, we would not have been up
against any difficulties. We would not have
been up against difficulties if everyone in this
country was of the French racial origin. We
would not be up against any particular difficulties if ail were of one religion. The agelong problems of this world have arisen because
there are differences arising between majorities
and minorities. I believe from the bottom of
my heart that one of the factors which bas
made Canada outstanding is that we have
made an outstanding success in respect to
these age-long problems of religions and racial
differences. and that these problems in other
parts of the world are ten times as serions as

FEBRUARY 5, 1947
ours. What impresses others is our accomplishment in this regard; it is to the credit of this
country that we have done as well as we
have. So do flot let us think that we are
doing se poorly; think rather of how well
we are doing, and that we are blazing a trait
for the world, because half the age-long problems of this world corne from these questions.
I repeat, think flot how poorly we have
handled this situation, but how well we have
deait with it.
I believe, honourable senators, that we are
in a position to exeroise an influence on the
future of the world far out of proportion to
our numbers. 1 believe also that there will
corne te this country in increasing numbers
representatives of other nations to sec how
Canada hias been able to surmount bier difficuliha. It behooves us to take stock of our
situation and see te it that the problems
which are before us are deait with as sensibly
and on as far-sighted a basis as the ones that
we have deait with in the past. As we know,
problems stili have to be faced. The leader of
thre opposition bias pointed te one of them.
0f ail the nations represented at the United
Nations there is net one, with the possible
exception of South Africa, which hias net on
trial, in varying dcgree, a different economie
systemn from that of Canada and the United
States. Our system is going te be on trial
and sublect. to tlle influences of the others.
and the manner in whicb these influences will
affect us in the future depends on the extent
of our ewn success. My friend the leader of
the opposition is absolutely right on that
point. It is an interesting subjeet, and one
of which we must take cognizance.
In this con-nection we may note the
famous theory which bias been worked out
in varieus countries, namely, that because
the United States bias haîf ýthe national incorne of the world it should continue to pay
'haif the expenses of the United Nations. As
Senator Vandenberg said, Russia and other
countries were paying a compliment in asserting that the United States had haîf the
income of the world, and in continuing te
insist on this despite the fact that in se, doing,
they were disparaging -their ewn econornie
systerns, and that it would be natural for
someone in the United Sta-tes te suggest and
te urge the other countries under these cir-

cumstances te adopt the economie system
of the United States. However this rnay be,
the United States and Canada have a higher
standard of living than probably any other
nation. The question remains, to what extent
is t-his due -te our superior ability and intelligence and te what extent is it due to our
natural reseurces.
Remember we bave a

tremendous asset in that we, 12,000,000
people, occupy haîf a continent which is
literally bulging at the seams with the greatest of natural reseurces. Se it should be witb
seme degree of humility that we take
justifiable pride in Canada's achievement.
Let us Det ferget that. Let us ho sure that
we make the best of ýthat with which Nature
lias endowed us. Mind you, frorn the point
of view of the man outside there is a great
deal te be ridiculed in our econemie system
of today. There is the question of private
enterprise being on trial. Wýhen you get down
te a consideration of it, you discover a great
deal of rnuddled thinking in this country in
regard te priva.te enterpTise. I find that in
the province of Ontario people forget that a
Conservative gevernment brought in hydre
tweîîty-five years ago, and it bias been operating ever since. In the province of Quehe,
where some people are endeavouring te secure
provincial eperatien of hydro-electrie pewer,
this is called rank Socialism. Ia the town of
Truro in -the province of Nova Scotia, -the
leading people would be the Stanfields, the
Lewises and se on, and they would consider
thernselves
the pe.rsonification ef private
enterprihe.
If yeu were te go down there
and try te buy into their power cernpany.
you would net have enough rneney te do se.
In the city ef Halifax, Senator Deanis'
Halifax Herald hias fer sorne years been demanding that the oity ef Halifax ceasider
the distribution of electrie light. This idea is
called rank Socialism in Truro, only sixty
miles away. An outsider ceming in here and
a4king yen where yen stand en thýese matters
would think yon were pretty rnuddled ip
your thinking. Knowing what the trend is
going te bie, we ýshould de something in -the
interests of future security and of people in
buýine--s.
I do net believe that the Liberal party, or
the Conservative party if they got into power
tornorrow, would seli the Canadian National
Railway to the C.P.R. or te a company or
individuals. I have net heard it mentioned
in the platforrn of the Conservative party.
We ought te re-move some of these cobwebs,
or people ceming here will ask us some
ernbarrassing questions that will be difflcult te
answer. Our economic systern is something
which we should consider, because it is going
te be on trial.
There are diffleuit problems too in regard
te our social services programmes. Take, for
instance, the question of old age pensions.

The present government lias said that if the
relationships with the different provinces are
suceasfully accomplished, it would consider
a programme of universal eld age pensions,

SENATE
without a means-test, of $30 a month beginning at the age of seventy. I do not know
what attitude the Conservative party is taking,
but the C.C.F. suggested raising the ante to
$50 a month at the age of sixty-five. The
Labour party said it would cost $300,000,000
or something like that; somebody else came
along and said it would cost $600,000,000. It
may be that the Progressive Conservative
estimate will be between those given by the
others, or that they will raise the ante of the
C.C.F. It is claimed that a large amount of
money will be required to pay old age pensions. This is true, honourable senators, but
J will say that I would hate to think that
when I reach the age of sixty-five I should
have any less than $50 a month to live on.
J doubt if anybody in this Senate will disagree with that viewpoint. At least, that is
my impression. I should like the sound of
ten times that amount. Make no mistake
about it, you will not brush the matter aside
by just waving your hand and saying that the
cost is too much. I doubt if there is any
issue that will be more vital to this country
in the future than the old age pension. How
much or how little it is to be, or at what age
it is to be paid or how it is to be financed,
are all matters of detail, but the main problem
is going to be in everybody's mind to a greater
extent. I am no authority on labour matters
in this country; but show me the industry in
this country which bas incorporated in its plans
of social welfare a programme that gives a
retiring allowance to employees at the age of
sixty or sixty-five, and broad-and-long I will
show you a concern that has lad the least
labour unrest.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, iear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I shall tell you
this, moreover, that the people of this country
are approaching the time when they no longer
will be divided into the rich and the poor.
Tleir future is being taken care of partly by
their own efforts and partly by the efforts of
the public. Every man on the railroad contributes to his pension. It is made up partly
from his own income and partly from the
contribution made by the railroad. This practice is also carried on in the federal government, in banks, and in some private coinpanies, but there are very many people outside of this category, who have to provide for
themselves in their old age. All they have is
the pleasure of contributing to the old age
pensions of those persons who are fortunate
enough to be included in the plans made on
that basis. I am told today that the Annuitics Branch of the Department of Labour is

simply deluged with applications from companies all over this country who are seeking
to take advantage of annuities.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: May I ask lthe
honourable leader if he is in favour of a
contributory old age pension scheme?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I should tell my
honourable friend that there will be no old
age pension schemne unless it is contributory.
A man pays $6 a month out of his pocket, or
he pays $5.95 in income tax. He will pay the
whole cost, because money does not come

out of the air.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: That is not what
I mean. The wage carner should contribute
when Le is earning money, but not by way
of income tax.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I happened to
look up something in regard to the $600 a
year which was the last proposal made by
the C.C.F. party as opposed to the $30 a month
suggested by the Liberals and the "question
mark" of the Progressive Conservatives.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Perhaps my friend can
say what the figure proposed by the Progressive Conservatives is. I am in favour of $30.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Suppose a man
at the age of sixty-five decided to buy an
annuity.
It would cost him about $6,000
to buy himself an annuity of $600 a year for
the rest of his life. The rate for females is'
much higher, $6,960. If a young man at the
age of twenty-one wanted to provide for a
pension, he would have to pay $51.54 yearly
to obtain $600 a year beginning at age sixtyfive. In the case of a woman the annual
payment would be $59.76 or $111.30 for the
two of them.
The government rate of 4 per cent is higher
than prevailing insurance rates, but for the
sake of argument what happens with respect
to the railroads and the banks and the Imperial
Oil Company, for example, is this: the employees contribute five per cent of their wages
and the public pays the rest.
An Hon. SENATOR:
the rest.

The company pays

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: But the companies get the money from the public; the
federal government gets it from the companies in the form of taxes. It is incorporated
into the general programme so that perhaps
40 per cent or half of this money is paid by
the individual and the balance by my honourable friend and all the rest of the people as
a whole.

FEBRUARY 5, 1947
The question may be asked: If this is done
for part of the community why is it flot
done for al]? Is there any difference hetween
a man who works for the federal government
or the railroad or the in8urance company and
the general public? If the principle is sound
why does it flot apply to the great mass of
Élie people? This ia a great and serions problem, honourable senators, and I hope that my
honourable friends will give some thought
to it. It is most important, and should flot be
brushced aside.
Honourable senators, I have other matters
upon which I should like to speak but I shall
confine myseif to a brief remark ini regard
to one specifie 'point arising out of the reinarks
made today by the leader opposite. One of
the clauses of the United Nations charter
contains a principle to which we in common
with the rest of the fifty-one nations subscribe,
and which I personally should like to see
realized. It is this:
To achieve international co-operation in
solving international problemns of an economic,
social, cultural or hiumanitarian character, and
inpromoting and encouraging respect for
humait rights and for fundamental freedoms
for ail without distinction as to race, sex,
language or religion.
One of the important debates at the United
Nations conference was the debate on the
racial treatment of Indians in South Africa.
I have great sympathy for them. Their difficulties are not over. There are some three
million whites in South Africa, and approximately eight million coloured people. Honourable senators, there has been a bitter discussion on this subject. Some people considered that the United States, Great Britain
and ourselves ;took a too legalistic point of
view, and said that the problem. should be
turned over to the International Court of
Justice to be deait with. Mind you, it is on
a par wit-h any legislation we may pass in this
country that removes a vote from a man
because of his colour. That is the principle
of it.
Hon. Mr. EIORNER: May I ask a question? Was the Caxnadian delegation asked
nny embarrassing questions with regard to
the treatînent of Indians in this coulitry?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I arn glad the
honourable senator has raised that point. The
question I arn speaking of came up at the
General Assembly,. and General Smuts, one of
the great statesmen of the world, made a
speech in which lie said it would be wrong for
the United Nations to assume that they had
the right to discuss this matter without referring it to the International Court of Justice,
and the Indian delegate got up and swept the
83168-a

assembly. It is a difficult matter, because there
are eight million coloured People in India.
I amn not referring to Indians. There are about
250,000 people of Indian descent, and the
remainder otf the eight millions are natives.
I suppose grave difficulties would arise if certain privileges.were given to these natives and
withheld from the people of Indian descent.
One result of that discussion was that India
broke off trade relations with South Africa,
and these have flot yet been resumed.
When I was at New York I could not help
feeling that the terni "Big Six" should be
substituted for "Big Five"; that is to say, that
India should be added to the present list of
big powers: the United Kingdom, the United
States, France, China and Russia. I do flot
believe we can overestimate the influence of
340,000,000 people on the future of the world.
For my part I amn proud of the tolerance that
we have in this country, and I hope that
whatever racial discrimination stili exists under
our laws will be given very serions consideration in Parliament.
When I returned to our country, with its
relatively smaîl population of twelve millions,
I could not help being impressed by the
immensity of the problems in those eastern
countries with their billions of people. I
wondered what we as members of our parliament could do to help along the general cause
of world peace. Just before I left New York
I fclt that, after alI, the responsibility rests
not entirely on governments, but on aIl
peoples everywhere. I thoughit in particular
of three delegates with whom I became as
closely associated as was possible in view of the
difficulties of language. On my left was Mr.
Shmigov of Byelorussia, who spoke no
English but a little French. A gentleman with
whom I became very friendly was Sir Maharaj
Singh, fromn India. He is a graduagte of
Cambridge University and highly cultured.
He had very strong opinions on sanme que,tions, but nevertheless lie was a delightful man
to taIk to. and very broad in his viewpoints.
Then there was Mr. Liu, the Chinesel ViceMinister of Foreign Affairs. I liked these
gentlemen.
It happened that the honourable senator
from Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) sent
to me at New York some small boxes of maple
sugar. Honourable memabers have seen these
one-pound boxes, made up in the shape of the
maple leaf. I restrained the natural impulse
to use the sugar myself and asked my wife to
make the same sacrifice, and I sent one box
each to, those three representatives of Byelorussia, India a.nd China. Accompanying each
box was a letter, in which I said I was sure that
the people of my country, Canada, desired to

courage and vision. Though they did their
best to proteet their berds against prowliag
bands of Indians, cattle thieves and wild
animais, at times they suffered great loases.
But the pasture was good and tbey produced
large quantities of, beef.
Conditions have greatly changed since those
days. There is no longer the open range with
runniag streams and natural waterinig places.
Raaching bas loat much of its glamour and
its romance. Grain farmers bave come in to
settle on the best areas, and the cattlemen
have been forced back into territory where
grass is not so plentiful and water cannot be
easiby found. Why is water scarce there?
Largely because the streama, creeks and sloughs
have drîed up. Due to the sunsbine and
Chinook winds, the streamns and lakes have
been losing an average of tbirty inches off
their surface during a season by evaporation.
Furthermore. the forests on the castern slope
of the Rockies are being destroyed. Mr.
Robson Bfack, President of the Canadian
Fore9try Association, bas tbis to say:
The east slope watershed forest of tbe
Rockies is the most important single strip of
forest treasure in the whole dominion. And
the reason is that it governs the flow of virtually every river that waters the western plains
*...
The dominion Governiment's record for the
ten years 1930 to 1940 show an average debit
of 30,000 acres of annual fire damage.
One consequence of this tremendous loss is
that tiie forest covering is rapidly disappearing.
and with it the valuable water supply for the
Prairie provinces. The Dominion government
hias takcn ateps to save those forests, And il
is to bie hoped that in the near future thp
streama there will1 be gradually increasing
instead of decreasing as in the past.
In the south of the two provinces I have
mentioned there are about 30,000,000 acres of
rough and hilly land, which. is producing
some cattle but could be made to produce
many more. About 15,000,000 acres have been
classified as unfit for cultivation, and about
another 16,000,000 acres as marginal. In this
area the rainfail is very light, averaging about
11-6 inches in a year. Il bas been as low as
six haches, and in one year il was as bigh as
twenty-five inches. Tise water problemn is,
therefore, a very serious one, because cattle
must be watered within a short distance
of where tbey are grazing; if they have to go
more than a mile and a haif they will not
gain satisfactorily, and the boss to the cattle
producers will be very substantiaI.
The cattlemen bave met with other disastera
They find lately that costs are going up-costs of lumber, labour, posts, wire and thinga
of that kind. They have sustaiaed heavy

losses from such pests as the warble fly; and
from severe winters, such as the one we are
going through at the present time.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Would the honourable senator mind telling us what was the
resuit in the year they engaged the rainmaker
at Medicine Rat?
lion. Mr. GERSHAW: I well remember
that year. It was a great year for the people
of Medicine Hat. Tbey gave this gentleman
a big banquet to start with, and hie went out
a few miles and erected a tower. At this
banquet hie disagreed entirely with the weather
p~eople in Ottawa and Washington. H1e said
lie could make the heavens rain; hie had
done it before and bie could do it again. However, things did flot work out according to.
his prediction, and hie explained that the
clouds whieh were flying by were ail "empties."
Hon. Mr. QUINN: You gave him the
wrong stuif at the bânquet.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: How much did you
pay him?
Hon. Mr. GERSHAW: 11e wanted $8,000,
but hie let us off with $4,000. We got off
fairly easy.
Sometbing has been done by the government. Rigbt in the heart of that grass area,
aL Manyberries, Alberta, they have bujit an
experimental ranehing station. It was established when the late Mr. Motherwell was
Minister of Agriculture, and it has done good
work. It bas carried out experiments regardîng
the best ranching practices, the carrying
capacity of land, and the nutritional value
of various grasses; îndeed it bas investigated
ail branches of ranching practice. Great work
lias also been done under the Prairie Farm,
Rehabilitation Act, w'hich was begun by Mr.
Bennett and expanded by the ministers who
followed him. They bave constructed thousands of dug-outs, of stock-watering reservoirs,
of smali irrigation schenies to prevent the
water from flowîng on, unused, to the Hudson
Bay and the Arctic Ocean. What is needed
and urgeatly aeeded at the preserit time is that
this work be continued, that more reservoirs
and irrigation projects be completed-not
only the small ones but the large ones as well.
Cattle can be marketed as feeders or tbey
can be finished. The marketing of cattle as
feeders bas flot been very profitable. No
longer can cattle be sent to the United States
to 'be finished, on the corn and otber produets
there; and the Eastern feed lots are so, far
away that it is mucb better for them to be
finisbed at home. Where there is irrigation
the feed can be produced to fatten these cattle,
so that they bring top price, and where large

Wr find that some strrams risc in the

on a share of the water of those strrams. Just

and the government bas the completion of
those sebemes in mind. Negotiations are going
on between the dominion and the provinces,
and we hope that notbing will be allowed to
drlay the development of irrigation in that
country. These structures would be permanent, and would confer grèat blessings upon, the
people of this generation and of the generations yet to come.
Help and support for the cettle-raising
*-ndustry arc of great importance.
Figures
coliectcd and analysed by the Canadian
Federation of Agriculture show that the
annual net income per ferm in 196 was
81,020; in the period from 1930 to 1934 it
was only $352; during 1935 to 1939 it was
$542; in 1945 it reacbed, a bigh of $1,'370, and
in the wbolr period hetween 1940 and 1945 the
average was $1,238. What is wvorrying the fari
people is thet the prie of things they' have
to buy are going up, and tbry are fearful of
disaster as a consequence. Therefore, one of
the suggestions I would meke is that irrigation be continurd with aIl possible sperd.
I have just one other proposaI wbich 1
believe is of vital importance to the cettîr
industry, an industry about whieh wr down
brr do not bear very mucb, but wbicb neyertheless is a vcry important one. At the prescat
lime there j" an agreement witb Britein to take
our surplus bref. It bas about two yrars; to
rua. It is a good agreement, because it provides us with a market for procrssed bref
equivalent to about 500.000 cattîr a year,
whrreas at best the United States market when
open took only about 193,000. So for the
moment this market in Britain is a littîr
hetter. in two ways: it takes more bref, and it
probably takes the lower grade of bref that
is being procrssed. But the cattîr reisers are
frarful that whrn the money we have loaned
to Great Britain is rxhausted their market will
be gone. and they are most gnxioiis to get into
the United States market et aIl costs. Thev
fer that the people of Britain will bus- thenir
bref and tlieir mutton from other countrir'.-

from the Argentine. from New Zealand, from
Australia. They realize that they cannot compete with tbose countries where the grazing
airas are close to the seaboard and where
there is grass ail the year around, and that
they may be ief.t in a very short time "holding
the bag", without a profitable market.
Wlierever farmi organizations or cattîrmen
meet they pass resolutions regarding this
matter. It is important, because thry cannot
compete with those other countries, and Britain
will likely buy wherr slhe can buy much
cheaper. The Canadien cattiemecn haver this
to say:
Study has (lisclosed that under the terms of
the rccently signed Anglo-Argentina agreement the U.K. is seeuring beef of our coinmerciai quality for approximately 10 cents per
pound. The Argentine rancher or estanciero is
reeeiving approxirnately $60.00 for ecd export
steer which will weigh 1.100 pounds and will
dress red label, equiv.aient to about $5.45 per
cwt.
If Canadian cattiemen have to Ùnret a prie
such as that, they will be ruined. Therefore I
wish to make it cicar that the gov ernment
should in some way set macbinery in operation
to make sure that our live cattile can get inýto
the American market. If a token shipment
were made to keep the, channels cear, even
tbat would bnlp some. The United States
market is -only 500 miles f rom the gràzing
areas, wbiie Britain is 6.000 miles away. and
in years gone by Chicago bas proved to be the
only profitable market for our surplus cattie.
We bave ten million cattle in Canada now witb
a surplus of approximately two million, and
the people engaged in the cattie industry feel
that tbey are in a very dangerous position and
are anxious that nio stone be lcft unturned to
preserve for thema an entry into this profitable
market.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Do you mean in the
United States markct?
Hon. Mr. GERSHAW: That is correct. They
hope to get into the United Statcs market.
Experience bas shown that that is the profitable ma7ket. lIt is a nearby market and, one
which will give the bcst results. The basses
are less in shipping to that market.
Canada is a great country, anid we are lucky
to be living in it. We want týo make it an even
greeter country, a country of a wider distribution of wealtb; and assistance along the
lines of bclping the industries that nerd it
will bring us to that dcsircd position.

FEBRUARY 11, 1947
FEBRUARY 11, 1~47
Hon. IVA CAMPBELL FALLIS: Honourable senators, ini rising to say a few words in
this debate I wish first to associa-té mysei-f
with the speakers who bave preceded me in
extening congratulations to the mpver andi
the seconder of tihe Addiress upon the very
excellent speeches which tliey made in this
bouse. I should, like, to go further, if I may,
and have my congratulations include the
honourable leader of the government in the
Senate (Hon. M.r. Robertson,) and the honourable leader of this side of the house (Hon.
Mr. Haig) for the very interesting and informative addresses which they dielivered in this
chamber last week.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: I should like to refer
j ust briefly in passing to one question which
was discussed by the honourable leader on
this side, namely, that of dominion-provincial
relations. I agree entirely with the sentiments expressed by him, but ehould, like to add
a few more words along the same lýines. Wlien
listening to the very ineteresting accounts
which the two leaders -in this house gave of
their activities at the United Nations conference in New York, one could not help receiving the very definite impression that, the
resuits from that conference to date have
accrued mainly because represen-tatives of
more than, fifty nations met around a common
conference table and openly discussed the
problems whicli confronted them and honestly
tried to discover a solution of those problems.
It took nie -back in memory to the -time when
the late President Roosevelt launchedi his idbea
of calling the first conference at Sani Frar4cisco. Honourable senators wil1. recaîl that
at that time he enunciated -the theory -that the
world's only hope of laying a foundation
which would ensure lasting peace and securi-ty
depended upon getting representatives of ail
iiiterested nations to gather around a com-mon
conference table and endeavour openly, and
for ail the world to see, to reach a solution of
their problems.
That tlieory hias been
endorsed by practically every nation, certainly
by ail the democratic nations, and,' by none
more heartily than by Canada; and, in~ taking
that stand on behaîf of Canada the. Prime
Minîster of this country and bis government,
received the support of aIl parties i parliament and of Canadans as a wliole. There
was no theory advanced that Canada should
send delegates to one or two coniferrences and,
if these conferenees did not succeed, that no
more should be called. We would, have
thouglit such a proposai absurd.
So, honourable senators, I must confess to
you that on this question of dominion83168-4

provincial relations I cannot for the life of
me understand wliy in the eyes of the Prime
Minister of this country and lis government
the procedure followed with regard to the
nations is so right for settling the problems
of the nations of the world, and so wrong for
settling the problems confronting the provinces
of this country. That is the thought I wish to
add to those which my honourable leader
(Hon. Mr. Haig) expressed.
One matter which I sliould like to bring
to the attention of the house, and which has
not been discussed se far in the present
debate, is of deep interest and vital concern
to many of the women of Canada. I speak
of the legislation enacted last session wliereby
the amount of tax-free money which a
married woman might earn outside lier own
home was reduced from $660 to $250. When
that matter was before our Banking and
Commerce Committee 1 was one of those who
opposed the reduction. Since that time the
matter lias been discussed widely in the press
of the coun.try, and most of the editorials that
I have seen have been against the Tediuetion.
In addition to that, there have been letters
and articles from women aIl across Canada
telling of the liardships brouglit upon many
individuals by this legislation, and asking tlie
government to reconsider it.
1 liave studied ail these arguments pro and
con, and I mnust say that in the liglit of conditions existing in the country today I am
more strongly opposed to the legislation now
than I was wlien it came before us lest
session. I am opposed to it nlot only because
it is discriminatory legislation, based on sex
distinction, but also because I believe tliat
under present-day conditions it is detrimental
to the general welfare of this country as a
whole. It lias been freely predicted that the
effect of the legislation will be to drive hundreds of married women from certain branches
of industry and from certain professions back
into the home. Perliaps some lionourable
senators will say, "Well, so mucli tlie better."
It may well be that the motive of the government in introducing the legislation was tlie
hope tliat it would cause a great many married
women to give up tlieir jobs in industry and
the professions, go back to their liomes, and
leave tliose jobs for men.
Well, if at the present time we were passing througli a period of unemployment i
this country I could understand sucli a motive,
even thougli I miglit not agree with it. But
the government itself lies said tliat we are
in a period of almost full employment. Certaiuly the demand for women workers in
almost every field of activity in Canada far
exceeds tlie present supply. Unfortunately,

for one would flot be working if I could afford
to stay at home, but after ail, is tlîat any of
your business or mine? We each know our own
needs beat.
The third letter is from a young woman in
Vancouver, and it speaks for itself. She rep.
re-sents a great class of women entirely different
from the other two. She says:
I arn writing to you protesting against the
new taxation arrangement whereby inconhes of
marrjed women are deducted* from their hunsbands' exemptions by the amount they exceed
$2»0 per year.
Married women witli whom I have spok-en are
extrernely indignant about it.
My husband andI myseif are finding this particularly harsh. We are both ex-service personnel who were unable to build up a leserve
for the post-war period. and now we are endeavouring to re-establîsh ourselves.
As a married woman who wiIl he adversely
affected hy this legisiation, and as My reasonq
for working are prompted by necessity, I hope
that at the next session you may be able to
derive sometbing f romt this letter which might
serve as an additional argument as to why this
added taxation burden should be alleviated.
I have just ehos-en these three letters from
dozens that have corne in. through ibhe presq
and through my personal mail.
I do nlot intend to pose as an economist or
a tax expert, but I must confess that I agree
with those who say that the best taxation
polioy any country can have is one which wiii
encourage people, especially young peopie, to
use their energies and talents to the very
fuilest extent towards achieving the goal of
maximum production and progress for the
country as a whole. To my way of thinking,
that goal can neyer bc achieved by petty
discrimination against one section of the coinmtunity for, the Fake of adding a few dollars
to the national treasury. So, on behaif of
thos;e thousands of women ail across Canada
who today are adversely affected by this legislation, I wouid most respectfully urge the
government to reconsider thîs legislation
before the next budget is brought down.
Hon. W. RUPERT DAVIkES: Honourable
senators, I should like to heartily second the
tribute paid by the honourable senator, from
Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis) to the mover
and seconder of the Address in reply to the
speech of lis Exceilency the Governor
General, and I should like to associate myself
with bier tribute to the two leaders in this
house. Whben I listened to the two honourable
senators who had attended the Generai
Assembly of the United Nations, I felt that
we owed them a great debt of gratitude for
their illuminating addresses. They gave us
sonne extremeiy interesting sidelights on what
took place at those assembly meetings, and
I felt that tbis biouse had been most adequately
represented.
83168--41

I listened very carefully to the Speech from
the Throne and rend it through several times,
and this evening I desire te refer to one or
two of the subi ects touched on by it, and to
discuss one or two other matters which were
not mentioned but which I think miglit weIl
have been included in it.
Before I begin, however, may I say how
much we aIl appreciate the great interest which
the new Governor General, His Excellency
Lord Alexander of Tunis, has shown in this
dominion since his appointment last year. I
arn sure that it was most gratifying to alI of
us to learo that since coming here His Excelleney had visited ail nine provinces of Canada.
Last August lie visited the city of Kingston,
where lie attended the centenary celebration.
He was given a mnst enthusiastjc ivelcome.
While in Kingston lie vîsited our General
Hospital, where he laid the corner-stone of
a new wing, most of which wing bas been
given over to the hospitalization of war
veterans. He also was given an L.L.D. degrea
by Queen's University, at an open-air convocation in Queen's Stadium.
If I bave read the Speech fromn the Throne
correctly, it indicates to me that we are going
to have a very busy session of parliament týhis
year. It indicates to me aIso that the session
is going to be most interesting.
I notice that one of the matters touehied
uipon is that of controls. Last Thursday the
honourable senator from AIma (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) expressed himself as being opposed
to most of thé controls. I confess that I fe
rnucb the same way.
Sonîe Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: The systern of rationing and controls is not very popular with a
free people such as the Canadian people, and
I arn very g1ad to know that before these
vàrious controls expire tbe bouses of parliament are going to have an opportunity of
discussing them. I am pleased, also that we
are not going to have any more controls as
a resuît of orders-in-council. I arn ready to
admit that the government of the day probably knows a good deal more about such
matters than I do, and like the honourable
senator frein AIma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne),
1 have a great deal of confidence ini Mr.
Donald Gordon. Nevertheless, there is a
wealth of wisdom in. another place, and even
more wisdom in this honourable chamber. 1
feel therefore, that it is a very wise move on
the part of the governinent te give ail of us
a chance to discuss these controîs, find out
what tbey really are, and express ourselves
upon them. I do nlot think the government
will find the members of this bouse obstructive

SENATE

Neverthcless, there is nc
or toc critical.
douht that sorte cf us will net agree with ail
cf thc centrols. I se that already in aneother
place tliere lias been a certain amount cf
disagreement, but whien reading the newspaper
tenighit I observed that ail tihe centrols which
have been befere the other lieuse bave been
passed.
In this connectien I slîeuld, very much like
te have semeeone expiain the sugar situation
te me. Sugar is still severely rationed; yet
lieneurable senaters lave been rcceiving;
propaganda froma the sugar-beet industry whieh
indicates tbat pessibly the severe ratiening
is net necessary. Wc are infermed. by the
sugar-beet industry that should the gevernment de thus and se, it migbt be possible to
start up some cf tbe sugar-beet factories that
bave been idile fer some time, and that in thsat
w-ay sugar ratiening nîight be moderated.
In reading over seme cf the literature which
bas been sent te me, I find that for some
reason or other higher subsidies are paid to the
growers cf, tomatees, peas and green beans
than are paid te the grewers eT sugar-beets.
I do net knew why tbat, is.
It is discencertrsg also te note tise very
high price that is being paid for tobaeco at
the prcsent time as compared with the price
that is being paid for sugar-beets. The sugarbeet industry is a most important one, net
only in soutlswestern Ontario but also in some
cf the prairie provinces, and it wouid be very
gratifying, te me at any rate, te have semeene
ini autherity explain te us just what the situation is with regard te sugar.
In the Speech from tIse Tbrone we arc told:
Thte pelicy of thse governînient is te nîssintain
only snch price and coiiiiinedity centrels as inay
be required te preteet ensuniers fions a sudden

Not.hing could be fairer than that. My
soterpretatien cf this is that in the future we

Anotiier matter whiclî bas becît rcferred te

FEBRUARY 11, 1047 -45
As I said, the housing situation in Germany
is very bad. I have heard it estimated, that it
will take anywhere from thirty to fifty years
to rebuild; Berlin. F'rorn what I saw after
apending tbree or four days in diriving around
the city, it would see-m to me that fif'ty yeurs is
more like1y to 'ho correct. 1 might remark in
passing that in the midât of ail these ru-ins a
huge monument has heen. erected, in honour of
the great Ruesian victory, and three or four
Russian soldiers are parading up and diown in
front of it ail the time. The Russians certainly inteaid the Germans to k.now that they
were defeated, and who defeated them. However, I arn getting a littie away fromn the euhWet of housing.
In Berlin you wilb see people coming out of
the moat am'azing places. 1 diecided ta investigate a few of them. To do so I had to cllmb,
over piles of bricks here and over old doors
there, because up to that time, which was in
July, notbing had been dette towards clearing
up the rubble. Occagionall-y it is true, you
would see a few poor women, - wîth rags
wrapped around their feet, piling a few bricks
here and there. I was told that ail the
remuneration 'they got for this was a lîttIe
extra food ration. I went through scores of
ather cities which. had suffered destruction of
fifty to seventy-five per cent, and in whieh of
course there are tremendous housing shortages.
But I want to corne ta sometbing a littie
nearer home, sometbing whicb affects us a
littie more ciosely, and I wiIl come to that
by way of Great Britain. I looked into the
housing situation cf that country, and I found
that there, just as here, bouses are not being
erected speedily enougb to give gencral satisfaction. The newspapers are filled with letters
uf complaint, as they are in Canada. One of
the cities in wbich I made inquiries was York.
As hon ourable senators know, that city is the
home cf the grea.t Rowntree chocolate works.
I ordinary peace times twenty thousand
people are employed there, but in July I was
told the number of employees was between
eight and ten thousand. The .housing shortage
was of course acute. I looked over somne of the
prefabrîcated houses-commonly known as
"fpre-fabs"ý-which are being erected in that
city. On the outside they are not pretty;
they look like corrugated iron covered wi'th
ashestos, and they have flat roofs with a sligh-t
slope for draining off the rain-water. 'But
inside they are warmn and comfortable and
have every modern convenience. Even the
heating systern bas been im.proved in a highly
original way. I arn sure there is not an bioncurable senator wbo could not live comfortahly in one of those "pre-fab" houses, ugly
though they may look on -the outside.

Another deve-lopment that I inspected comprised fifty semi-d-etached bouses, whicb were
heing huilt on the aide of a alope facing the'
south. They were within the corporation
limits, and therefore had gas or electricity,
water and sewerage connections. The windows
werc large, with a steel saab, and a portion
opened outwards. There was a small garden at
the back and front, and the interiors of the
housca were planned to make housework as
light as possible. Thcy were a great improvement over the old4.ashioned bouses wbich
forty or fifty years ago were huilt in rows of
twenty or thirty, ail exactly the saine, in
industrial cities like York.
The bousing projects in British municipalities are controlled hy the municipal councils,
but the goverament puts, u-p or guarantees
the money. The rnunicipaiity builda the
bouses, rents tbem, collects the renta and
makes repayrnent of the loans to the government, flouses of the type that I have just
mentioned were well built, of brick, in pairs,
the cost Fer pair being about £2,000. 1 was
informed that they will rent for about twelve
shillings and sixpence per week, or rougbly
three dollars.
In Britain regulations with regard to bounsing are fairly strict. At the moment the country is in the hands of a socialist governrnent
and a very large bureaucracy, but fromn
investigation and through talking with friends
I discovered that the bureaucrats are very
reasonable. Tbey want to know what is gomng
on, but wherever possible tbey will help. For
instance, everytbing was being done to basten
tbe construction of those fifty bouses and
make themn ready for occupation. There is a
type of dwelling in Britain known as a "service cottage." A manufacturer, fer intstance,
might build ten or tweive of tbem for bis
executives, or a land owner miglit build haîf
a dozen of them for his gardener, wagoner,
and so on. On this type of bouse a builder
is net aliowed to spend more than £1,200
per unit. A friend of mine sent in plans for
a pair of these so-called cottages, whicb have
two, atonies, to be built at an estimated cost
of £1,500 eacb. The plans were sent back,
and hie was told to reduce bis coat to £1,200
eacb. I heard of a pair that had been built
for £2,400, and I went to look at them. Tbey
were very attractive, and I arn sure that
the people occupying them. wîll be quite
comfortahle.
Hlaving referred to Gerrnany and Britain,
1 now want to corne back to a weil-known
and good city on Lake Ontario-Kingston.
Sorne progress in bousing is being made there,
but admittedly, as in other places, it is slow.

sbould have the first opportunity to get bornes
for f bemselves.
Vet-erans; have a priorif y on materials at
pi-reiet, but tbere are difficulfies connected
xvitb tbis. As 1 undcrstand it, tbe governiment
xviii adixance up fo $6,000 to a veferan for
building a bouse. This sumi must coveýr the
co-'t of fhe lot. Tbc Department of Veferans
Allair, is prepared fo biid a group of 56

tbey cati be put up for' $6,000 eachi. I arn toid
tbat so far no0 contractor bias been secured
wbo will takze on tbe job. except on a cosfplus ba-'is. Tbe lots cost about $600. wlîich is
nof an unreasonable price. Thaf leax-es $5,400

Another maff or in connection with this bousîng qu-,sfion whicb gives nie soxue couceru
is flie type of luimber we are putting into
bouses. In looking tbrougb fbe Oitewe Journal
tonighf, I rcad that Bîitain is puirchasing 40
per cent of flic British Columbia lumber procduction. andi fbat because she is paying the
bigi piids. it is understood that she xxill get
încreased selcctivity-the choice of the best
lombex' British Columbia produces. I arn told
by coxnpetent confractors in flie city of
Kingston-cont-afos wbo, 1 rniglbt say, are
vol-y fax-ourable f0 the governrnent of the
- day
f bat what is going into the bouses wlîich
xve axe building for our veterans is second-class
lumber, and that we ai-e exporting ail aur best
lumber.
That, I maintain, is sornetbing we need flot
do. Canada is a riclb country, a country of
ti-emendous natural resources. \Ve are flot like
Brifain, wbich practically bias ifs back against
the wall and must export the vexy best it cati
produce in order ta get dollars. I thînk that
we sbould keep a great portion of the best of
our lumber ta build homes ini this country,
because t ho veterans for whorn we are building these homes are young people and are
going ta live in tbem a long tixne. 1 do flot
think it is fait- thaf we should put second
grade lumber int o flie homes we are building
for the vefex-ans. In case affer case in Kingston
they ai-c coxnplaining about ftle two-by-f ours
buckling, and ftle flooxs xvarping, and ail sorts
of similar defocfs. I oîîly mention this because.
while if is vex-y pieasing to read tlîat our

and thaf we ai-e exporfing a frernendous
arnaunt of lumber, I wonder if w-e are flot bcing

Now, hxonourable senaf ors, liaving discussed
tbe liousiag question I wanf ta touch for a
fcw moments, if you xviii bear wifh me, an one
or fxvo matters xvhiclî were not rnenfioned in
fixe Speech fi-rn the Tbrone. I want ta speak
of the cultural development af this country.
I arn quite sure that we are ail gratîfied ta
know fiat an expecfed deficit of some $300,000,000 will be, turncd into a surplus of
S300.000,000. That is very good news. I arn
xvotdering lîow we are going ta spend that
extra money wbich ivas flot expected by ftle
Tx-easury Departmetf, and 1 sbould like fa
put in a plea for one or fwo tbings in which
I arn very much interesfed.

FEBRUARY il, 1947
As you know, man cannot live by bread
alone, and if we are going to have a great
country we must, as we are building it up
materially, also built it Up culturally. There
are three matters to which I would draw
attention: the need for a National Library,
the need for a National Gallery, and the
promotion of the Little Theatre movement.
My thoughts have been turned towards a
National Library in Canada, honourable senators, by two things: one, the Joint Committee's report on the Library of Parliament, and
the other, this littie magazine called Wales,
which I received the other day, and which bas
a very fine illustrated article on the National
Library of Wales. Wales is a small country, a
little principality of thirteen counties, with a
population of two and a haîf million people.
But it bas its -own university, with colleges at
Bangor in the north, Aberystwyth ini mid&
Wales and Cardiff in the south. Aiso at
Aberystwyth there is a beautiful national library. I bzing this up, not because 1 expect we
shahl be building a national library next month
or next year, or even five yt-ars hence, but
because I tbiuk it is time we began to think
about these things. Unless we do briýng them
Up andL begin to discuss them, nothing wiIl ever
be dione. It was in 1873 that the idea of a
national library in Wales was put forward. It
was nlot until 1907 that a Royal Charter was
granted, and net until 1009 that the building
was begun. It is now completedt, and it houses
the literary treasures of the principality of
Wales. The building cost. £260,000. The
Treasury at Westminster contributed £80,000,
and the balance was raised by the people of
Wales. They took subsoriptions ail the way
from twopence up to £5,000. and there were
thousands upon thousands of subscriptions of
a shilling. That is how the National Library
was built ini Wales.
The capital city of Canberra in Australia is
less than twenty years old, yet they have a
National Library there. It is truc that at the
present time they are housing it in a building
which cost less than 8100,000, but they have -et
aside a grant of $750,000 to complete a
National Library in Canberra.
Now, honourable senators, I maintain that
what the littie principadity of Wales can do,
and what the Commonwealth of Australia can
do, Canada can do if w'e only put our qiindis
to it. I visualize -the day when a National
Library will be established here in the city of
Ottawa, fseing soine beautiful square. I do
net know where it willbe located; but we bave
engaged a very expensive town-planner to
remodel this capital city, and I ,ahould liJce to
Bee bere flot only a beautiful National Library,
but a fine National Gallery.

47

Now I should like to say a word or two
about the National Gallery. As you know,
the National Gallery was started by the
Marquis of Lorne in 1880, and ever silice it
bas been housed in a portion of the Museum
building. I have made it a rule ever sice
I have been a meinber of the Senate to go
to the National Gallery at least twice each
session. Every time I go I am delighted witb
the new purchases, sud I am more and more
amazed at bow the trustees and the officials
of the National Gallery do such a worthwhile work in such cramped quartera and with
such a smaîl grant. Before the war the
National Gallery was receiving about $135,000
a year. As you know, aIl expenditures had
to be eut down during the war-and quite
properly so-with the resuIt tbat for the last
two fiscal yeurs the National Gallery received
about 866,000 one year and 868,000 the next.
Out of those sumas had to be paid the salaries
and coets of administration, which left only
about $15,000 for the purchase of pictures.
Honourable senators who colleet pictures, and
I know some do, know very weI that you
cannot do very mucli with $15,000 when you
are trying to find pictures wbîcb are fit to put
in a National Gallery, because in a National
Gallery you must bave on-ly the very finest,
so that the young people wbo go there will
know tbat tbey are looking at art wbicb cannot in any way be questioned.
I maintain, therefore, that we should do
something about the National Gallery. I
would like to ses tbe govern'ment increase
the grant to at least $100,000 this year, and
next year restore it to $135,000 gîving the
trustees and, the officials who are working 80
bard in tbis connection, some encouragement
to do better work. It is amazing wbat they
are doing now. I find that st year there
were 125 loan exhibitions of pictures and
prints from the National Gallery in various
parts of the country, and that 163,000 reproductione of pictures from the National Gallery
were sold. There is a new process of printing
these reproductions on silk whicb I arn told
is very fine indeed, and they ssii for about
$5 e-ach. A great many of them were sent
overseas during the war. They were hung
in the verious messes of the officers and men
of the forces who were fighting overseas, and
I amn sure they did mucli to cheer tbem up
and, to remind them of borne.
As I said. the National Gallery was started
by the Marquis of Lorne when he was
Governor General. Wben Lord Willingdon
was here as Governor General he did a great
deal for music; and when- Lord Bessborough
was here lie founded the Little Theatre movement. For a moment I would like to say a

48

SENATE

word about that. In 1943 Lord Bessborough
founded the Dominion Drama festival. Colonel
Henry Osborne of this city became honorary
chairman, and he formed a committee with
Dominion-wide representation. We had festivals in every province; in some provinces
there were two regional festivals. The final
festival was held in this city until 1939, when
it was held in London, Ontario. But even
then Ottawa was very much to the fore,
because the festival cup was won by the
Ottawa Drama League with what the adjudicator called an almost professional production
of Terence Rattigan's "French Without Tears".
The producer of this play was Mrs. Dorothy
White, a very well known lady of this city.
During the war the Dominion Drama festival
had to be dropped, but it is being revived this
year. Just what success it will meet with I
do not know. The regional festival for this
part of Ontario will again be held in Kingston.
The city of Ottawa is sending three groups;
Belleville, Queen's Un'iversity, Brockville and
several other cities are each sending a group.
The finals will again be held at London,
Ontario.
This, honourable senators, is in
my opinion a very, very important cultural
movement. I am not suggesting for a moment
that we should have a National Theatre, but
I do think that the government of the day
might very well smile upon the effort to
promote the Little Theatre movenent across
this country and help in some way to finance
it.
It would not take very much money.
Heretofore the festivals have been financed by
wealthy men. But they have no money any
more; it is all taken away in income tax; and
gentlemen who in the past were willing to
give a thousand or two, they find it difficult
nowadays to make such contributions. Therefore I maintain that if the government would
in some measure help this National Theatre
movement it would greatly benefit our young
people, because the members of these groups
who go to Kingston, to Winnipeg, to Vancouver and who eventually get to London and
Ottawa for the finals, are doing a fine work
along this line, and I hope that something will
be done to encourage them.
Honourable senators I now wish to say one
word about a cultural organization which is
flourishing at the present time in this country
-the
Canadain Broadcasting Corporation. I
have heard many complaints about the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. I do not know
why. Some people in another place will advocate occasionally that there should be no radio
fee. Again I do not know why. The fee is
$2.50 a year, and for this amount you may
turn on your radio twenty-four hours a day,

if you so desire, and listen to the programmes.
On behalf of the CBC I wish to say that the
present chairman is one of the ablest young
men in this country. He was formerly in the
newspaper business, in which he was considered
to bo one of the most capable executives
throughout Canada. The general manager,
Dr. Frigon is a man who knows more about
radio than any other person in 'this country
that I have ever met. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is doing a splendid job,
and I am sure those honourable senators who
have been paying some attention to this
matter will agree with me.
At Christmas-time we had from the studios
in Vancouver a magnificent production of the
Messiah, and a short time ago, on a programme
called Stage 47, we had an excellent production of Maria Chapdelaine. The entertainment was excellent,' the acting first-class, and
I am very glad to know that the CBC is
doing such a fine job in the field of radio
entertainment. Some times over the radio I
hear political speeches with which I do not
agree; but in giving time to various political
parties and allowing them ta present their
ideas on different questions, the CBC is probably serving its listeners well. That is what
we want: we want to hear all sides of every
question. As I have said, honourable senators,
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has
been doing fine cultural work, and I hope it
will receive every encouragement.
I am sorry that I have spoken so long. I
thank you for giving me such close attention.
I do hope that my words in favour of a
National Library, the National Gallery, and
the Little Theatre movement, have not been
in vain.

BUSINESS OF TIE SENATE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Before the orders
of the day are proceeded with, for the convenience of honourable senators I should like

FEBRUARY 12, 1947
to say a word about the sittings of the Senate.
Honourable senators may recail that a littie
earlier in the session I said in a burst of
enthusiasm that I hoped the Senate wouid
sit more or Iess continuously during the month
of February, and I also expressed the hope
that honourabie senators would nlot be inconvenienced thereby. After a more careful study
of the situation immediately before us, I can
see no reason for asking the Senate to sit
during the next two weeks. Briefly, I see no
prospect in the immediate future of any legislation of a nature which could 'be introduced
li this house. As honourable senators well
know, in the other house the debate on the
Address bas been set aside until the week
after next, and the attention of the members
is concentrated upon the legisiation necessitated by the expiry at the end of March o.f
the powers granted under the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act. After that
matter ia disposed of I do nlot know what will
corne next. At the moment I can suggest
nothing which would require us to sit next
week or the week following.
If the situation with respect te geograpby
were a littie, different, an ad-jourrnent of one
week would perbaps suffice; but, in fairness to
honourable senators who live far distant from
Ottawa, I amn going to suggest a longer
adjournment. The Divorce Committee, which
has a large programme ahead of it, bas set
dates for hearings, commencing in the first
week of March. I arn going to propose that
we sit up te and including Friday of this
week, se that honourable senators who s0
de.ire may continue the debate on the Address
in reply to the Speech from, the Throne.
During that time the bilas that corne to us
wili be of a more or less non-contentious
nature, and they can be deait with ini this
ho.use expeditiously and without much difficulty. On Friday next, therefore, 1 shall move
that when the Senate adjourns it stand
adjourned until Wednesday, March 5, at
3 o'clock in the afternoon.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday, the
consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. McKeen for an
address in reply thereto.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators, I extend my apologies for taking up the
time of the bouse now, but I feel that there
are very many subjects which can be discussed
under this heading.

49

Firat, I wish to congratulate the mover and
the seconder of the address in repiy to the
Speech frou *the Throne (Hon. Mr. McKeen
and Hon. Mr. Bouffard) upon their excellent
speeches. I amn sure we ail appreciate tbe
very kind remarks of the seconder with regard
to bis predecessor from Grandville, the late
Senator Sir Thomas Chapais. The mover made
a slight crror in mentioning that bis party
was in office when unemployment insurance
was introduced. The fact is that unemployment insurance was introduced during the
Prime Ministership of Right Honourable
R. B. Bennett, now Viscount Bennett.
The mover also said that Canada was fortunate in baving bad four great prime ministers in the last eighty years. I thougbt, as I
heard him, that be was getting on somnewhat
dangerous ground, because te my mind far
more than four prime ministers have had conaiderable to do with sbaping tbe policies of
this country. Some people may taire the view
that the mere ability to maintain a certain
party in power is of very great moment to
the country. It may be that over a long
term of yeara very little of importance to a
country will happen, wbereas in a very short
time there may corne some deveIopment or
accomplisbment which will affect the nation
for decades. I wili mention by way of exampie one or two tbings that took place, for the
good or i11 of the country, during the Prime
Ministersbîp of the Rigbt Hon-ourable Arthur
Meigben.
He established the Canadian
National Raiiways. At the time a great many
people tbougbt this was the proper thing to
do. Perbapa no other man, and certainly not
the present Prime Minister, would bave taken
lus 'politicai life in bis banda to do what Mr.
Meighen, did in that matter. He also was
responsible for setting up the first Wbeat
Board Canada ever had, and as a result of
bis action pools and co-operative elevators
came into existence. That was during tbe
period of the First Great War, and in the
course of a debate li another place the question arose as to wbether the board and the
pools would continue after the war. Mr.
Meighen stated that from, bis experience of
western Canada some forra of a board or pool
was necessary. That was bad politics, I admit,
very bad politics, and when election time
came he was not forgiven by the grain men.
'Neither was he forgiven by the people who
favoured private ownership of railroads.
Looking back, I amn net prepared even at this
date te express myseif one way or the other
as te whetber Mr. Meighen acted wisely in
estabiishing tbe Canadian National Railways.

The incîcase iii price on the gold the banks
held amioiinted te $35.000,000, and the then

tbei e was a deprcssion throughout the world,
inclidinz Canada. My criticism of the banks,
and a certain bitterness 1 feît towards them
at that timie, was net a personal maffer at al.
I theugbt tbey had withdrawn credif in western Canada te a tee great extent. and conýsequentlv 1 was oppo-cd te their receiving tbis
extra price for thecir gold. If the samne tbing

different attitude. However, these were issues
on w1ien mon :,taked their political lives, in
eider te (10 something wbicli they .tbought

I do net know that if is necessary to apologize for hcing w'lat soîne inay regard as a littlc

Without frecdom te cî'iticize I would regar'd

the Tories". 1 i-an recail an instance in 1920
of howx w'ell thiey foughit the Tories, and in particular the Right Honourablc Arthur Mcigheon,
over the W heat Board. There were participation tickets, to be sold througliout w'estern
Canauda. In eider to fighit the Tories the
Liberals told the farmers: "You might as well
throw your tickets away; the Tories will nev er
give -you anything on these participation
tickets." Some farmers sold their tickets for
five cents each; somne even burnt them; others
used. tlier to paper their shacks. because they
believed this "hate the Tories, propaganda.
But those whio hiad faith collected 48 cents per
bushel on those tickets. I recail one incident
that occurrcd during the days of the winding
Up of the board. At that time a famous man
in Alberta, tie late Henry Wise Wood, was
president of the United Farmiers of Alberta. I
happencd to be going from Edmonton to
Calgary on a train carrying several carloads of
delegates who were deteî'mined that they were
going f0 "skin Wood alive". They intendcd
to eviet Ihim from the management of the
organization. I explained te them the points
about which I thought they were mistaken.
1 remained in Calgary foir a few days, and
thougb 1 did not attend their meetings I read
the reports in the paliers. Mr. Wood wvas
returned as president of the United Farmers
of Alber'ta with a larger mai ority than lie liad
ever received. before, because thiey were satisfied with lus explanation of what had been
accomplished at that time. But in only f00
many instances the "fight the Tories" slogan
cost the farmers 48 cents a bushel.
1 agrce with what some previons speakers
hiave said, that Canada, along with the rest of
the world, is facing a very serious situation.
The leader of the goverament hias assured us
that there is an immense amounit of money
in Canada today, and that everybody lias
money. Well, we have increased the debt of
this country since 1939 by soîne 14 billions
of dollars. Some vears ago we would have
fhought that an impossible situation. Now we
are selling goods without receiving any cash,
and there is îlot mnuch hope that we will ever
be paid. This does acf seemn te concerni ftle
governiment, se long as there is plenty of
money now; what they are miainly interested
in is that it shall last to keep times good
unfil affer the election.
We hear fronti time to trne about the
depression cf the 30's. That depression was
world-widc, and it did flot set in until elevea
or fwelx'e years after the first Great War. The
next dIr-,ssiun. if if corresponds to the
destruction w'hichi fook place during the recent
war, wilI he miueh groatfi' than the earlier one.

FEBRUARY 12, 1947
Meanwhile there is no sign of any Liberal
policy. I should like ta know how the gavernment proposes to farce the other countries of
the world ta trade with us and pay rnoney for
aur products when they have not gat it. These
variaus countries, when conditions go beck ta
normal, will have their land prepared ta
produce food. At the present time Canada is
a great producer af food, and western Canada.
particularly, is very rnuch interested in this
inatter.
What is the position at present? Wheat is
ta!ken from us and is sold. Yesterday, I believe,
rye an the open market was warth $2.79 a
bushel. Wheat ie selling over the twa-year
periad at 81.55. Next year. after the negotiatians, possibly the price wiil be 81. 1 cannot
believe that if the world praduction af wheat
increases, we in Canada. will receive mare than
the world price, in spite of the fact that
today we are taking a lass of 70 cents per
bushel as carnpared with what we could have
secured on the apen market. The farmers ini
western Canada are nat particularly selfish,
but they are cone-erned about the position
whieh the government has taken. First of ail
it did not want ta take any action with the
Grain Exchange or make any definite announcement, in case it might be hurtful politically.
The gavernrnent thaught that by rnsking a
faur-year agreemnent it could say, "Well, your
exchange cannat function anyway;- we have
sold the wheat at a certain price". The
governinent avoided rnaking any annauncement of polîcy and hoped that prices wauld
remain bigh. How have things turned aut?
We could have maintained a higher price. I
imagine the position was this. The governrnent, having given as rnuch inteiest-free
maney and as much in the way af goode as the
people in one part af Canada wauld allow,
said; "We will take the wheat and let it be a
gift from the western farmers; they wil put
up with it. Ail we need ta preach out there
is, 'Hate the Taries', and we will get away with
giving their wheat ta people eisewhere".
Honourable senators will rernember that a
year ago last Decernber I stated what would
happen, and what was happening-that brood
sows were going ta the market ta be sold
at prices which, because of the higher cost
of labour, were insuflicient. 1 disagree entirely with the statement whîch was rnade
in the press-I believe by tbe Minister of
Agriculture-that it was a question of shortage
of feed in the West, and I disagree with those
who have made their pleas on the ground
of the effects of incarne tax. But that was
only a small part of it. The great part of it
was this: The ordinary sinail farmer wha

was nlot in the incarne tax group, but who
could seil bis grain and get along without
raising pigs, decided to abandon the hog
business because there was no money in it. I
must point out te honaurable senators that
the price of pigs in western Canada bas been
four cents legs than the price in eastern
Canada. I have relatives who farm in this
part of the country and I have seen their
ledgeise. The western farmers get seven cents
a pound less for butter fat, and four cents
less for -their -hogp. The Minister of Agriculture muet have taken my advice, because lie
raised the price of hogs in December of last
year. As a resuit, the production will probably
increase. Here are the January figures of the
hog receipts at the Union Stockyards at St.
Boniface, Manitoba for the past three years:
59,919; 16,327; 7,575. I dlaim that we are
in this position because in the agricultural
industry returns are not sufficient as compared
with the price of labour. 1 think, honourable
senatars, that the farmers who are taking
care of pige in starmy weather of forty and
fifty degrees below zero are entitled to a
price uplift. I arn not speaking of the men who
talk of extra income tax, but of the farmers
who went out of business because they were
nlot receiving enough to pay them for their
labour.
Honourable senators, we are likely te lose
our Oid Coun*try mnarket for bacon, flot
through any lack in the type of aur bopa,
but because aur packers are careless and do
flot know how to cure bacon to suit that trade.
Certainly. the farrner has been penalized. Can
you imagine a condition such as tbis?-You
spend time and energy raising a pig, if it is
one pound overweight wben yau send it to
market, two cents is deducted from the price.
In any other business the persons selling
would nat be penalized in such a way. This
was -done with the idea of improving the type
of hogp; but the figures show that we have
been let down in this respect. So far as whea-t
is concerned, $1.55 is the price f.o.b. in Fort
William. Where I live it is 25 cents a
hundredweight. For grade 3, which. is our
best. the farmer receives only 81.07. Other
examples are barley; $1.18 to 81.25 in the
United States, and only sixty sorne cents ta
aur farmers in, Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Sixty-four cents
f.o.b., Fort William.
Hon. Mr. HQRNER: Yes.
With respect te incarne tax I feel that aur
policy is entirely wrong. Someone may cail
me a Social Crediter, but I think we ought
ta arrange -ta pay off aur entire debt. I should
rather be stuck for rny share of the national
debt naw. If it is good policy for a farmer

single men more t-han married men. What
is the effect of this? We arc preventiag them
from ever heng ale fa marry. because the
cost of getting married. like ce erything else,
lias gone Up.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh. oh.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: The young man today
whose father bas flot sufficient money to give
him a sfart in the business world. and who
lias to provide for fthe taxes that are taken
fromn him, is prevenfed fromn building a home.
Is that a desirable situation? These young
men start out in life under the handicap of
beavy taxes. If they are to marry, I do flot
think that under the present conditions they
should be taxed until they are receiving at
least $3,000. If at thirty years of age t'hey
refuse to marry, you can fake ail their wea.ith
front them.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Imagine meat rationing in Canadýa! I do flot. know how other
honourable senators feel, but I am ashamed
f0 tbink -that we are flot only una-bie fa fill
aur export contracts, but have to ration meat
in Canada-a country in whicli you can find
tliousands of miles of hay-stacks some three

and fbat we in tlic West are being prevented

We came now ta the question of butter.

I fully believe that if if were nat for contrais

dehate is tbat it makes if possible for members
of the Senate ýto discuss problems that affect
their own part of the country, tbereby f0
enlighten their colleagues with respect to
quc-tions whicb may be raised here, nlot
only in this session but in the years f0 corne.
I arn not a sectionalist, and do not want to
appeal to the Senate 'as such. I try f0 tbink
of Canada as a wbole, and to act on bebalf of
Canada as a wbole. 1 appreciate that we
cannof have national unity and contenfmenf
unless the problems of ail parts of Canada
are dealt with sanely and witb a vision of the
future. If is for that reason that I wish to
elaborate a little on a subject fbat already
bas been mentioned in this debate by my
esteemed colleague from Medicine Bat (Hon.
Mr. Gersbaw)-in a sense if is a fimc-worn
subject in this bouse.
I bave discussed here on many occasions
tbe question of irrigation, and I bave advocated the expenditure of public moneys on the
development of irrigation. Now I appear
before the Senafe to try to jusfify the expenditures wbicb are being made, and likely to
be made in the future, and to explain their
meaning to Canada as a wbole. If those
expenditures can be j usfified because of their
economie value not only to the people wbo
will be directly benefited, but to every part
of Canada, I feel that I shah bhave ser-ved my
purpose today.
Irrigation is sometbing wbicb is probably
new to most people ini Canada, but if is very
old in the world at large. We know that it
was practised in biblical fimes. We know that
if was applied in somne of the counfries of
Asia. We know wbat happened. in Mvesopotamia, which once was a very rich country,
due f0 fbe fact tbat if was able to. bring in
water and spread it over the land to produce
the fruits of the soul. We know also of tbe
vast sumas of money which bave 'been spent
on irrigation projeets in the United States.
I see here my bonourable friend frum Lincoln
(Hon. Mr. Bench). I know tbat he visits
what is commonly regarded as a very arîd
state, but wbich is productive of great riches
sîmply because it bas irrigation. I refer f0, the
state of Arizona. In the United States not
only millions but billions of dollars have been
spent on irrigation. They have carried water
f0 dry lands and have settled thema witb
people wbo are producing great wealth from
those lands. One only needs to mention the
Grand Coulee Dam, the Boulder Dam, and the
lafest development in that direction, the Fort
Peck Dam, in Montana-enterprises upon
wbich huge sums of money bave been spent.
If is truc that hydro-electric power may be

developed frorn these projects, but one of
their main pur-poses is to convey water to the
dry areas.
This story bas been told before in the
Senate. I mentioned on one occasion some
years ago a vibit that rny friend tbe Qenator
froîn Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) made f0
southern Alberta. I t.hink it was in the year
1919, a very dry year in western Canada, particularly in the province of Alberta. He was
then a minister in the federa] government.
and be travel-led; from Medicine Hat westward
to an area that is watered by the Canada
Land and Irrigation Company. 1 do not
know whetber it wvas he or bis companion, the
Rigbt Honourable Mr. Meighen. who said
that be vas in a desert fromn Medicine Hat
util lic reached the irrigation district. and
that after be passed -tbroughl it he wvas in
anotber desert until be reacbcd another irrigation district. That was very trîie in the
dry years.
Now we aie trying to overcome 'that desert
condition and to ýmake the wbole of tbat
area thrive. for if bas been proved that it can
thrive if the people there bave sufficient water.
Irrigation bas been practised in Alberta to
a certain, extent for many years-in a very
%mllway in the early 80's, and in a larger way
after the C.P.R. undertook developments along
the present main line. and when the Alberta
Railway and Irrigation Company's development in tbe extreme southern Alberta area
was initiated by a very higb]y esteemed citizen
of tbis country. Mr. C. A. Magrath. a former
mnember of the House of Commons and onetime chairmary of the International Joint
Commission. Tbese irrigation undertakings
transformed a pirticularly dry area into one
whicb produced wealtb in wheat and grain.s
of that character. It also produced hays and
'egetablcs, altliough only in a amall way,
because in tbose years there was commenced
a î'ast wheat development on what we in
tbe west call "dry Iands"ý-lands wbere people
at one stage thought there was no necessity
for irrigation any more, tbat there was going
to be p]enty of natural moisture, as ind-eed
there was in the vears 1915 and 1916. Some
of tbe farmer,ý abandoned tbe growing of
sugar beet and crops of that nature on irrigatcd. farms, and at one time tbere was a
feeling that there would be no furtber need
for irrigation. But conditions cbanged, and
we bad anotber period of dry years wbicb
drove people back to irrigation and inspired
thern to clamour for the extension of irrigation. Today in Alberta we bave a very
considerabie acreage wbicb under irrigation is
capable of producing varied cropa. tbus
creating a secondary industry and salvaging

SENATE
a *.ecttion of the country that otherwhse would
be a charge upon the province and uponi the
Loluiion itself.
?MLîv I say in this connection that the
expendjtures wbjch are being mnade and whieh
wiil be made in the years to corne are, in a
,seiîse. prompted by the fact that much of
the %vater for irrigation, purposes in Alberta
cornes frein streams wbich are international
in character. A treaty between Canada and
the UTnited States djvided those waters. The
United States vas using ail that had heen
given te them under the treaty. We were not
using our share.
The United States was
beginning to agitate for a revision of the treaty
because of the fact that Canada was net using
its share of those waters. I would flot say
that the decision to expend some millions of
dollars on the St. Mary',, and Milk River
development was due wholly to that situation.
but I will say that if we had not appropriated
menev, for that purpose we would have had on
ouir doorstep, a dernand. of which we liear even
now frorn the UnitedI States. for a revisien
of tliese treaties.
The money that is being appropriated noiv
is for the construction of a (larn an(l tunnels at
a site which the member frein Medicine Hat
(Hon. Mr. Gershaw) mentioned the other
day-the St. Mary's and Mlilk River reservoir
at Spring Coulee.
That reservoir is being

I have been living in seutlîern Alberta and
hiave been acquainted witli the irrigation preb]crm since 1905. 1 aie familiar with the transformation that is taking place in areas that
forinerly did net hav e irrigation but wvhich
have it teday. I cani recaîl when these areas
were dust-ridden and dry. when ne crops ,vere

some relief. The situation of those people
was bepeless, and the federal gex-ernment had
te corne te theiî' assistance.

iin the sanie nainrr as diY land, these areas
are as thicklvY settled as anm in western
Canada toda v, an(d more fariers are te be
f,)tnd on irrigatc d land tlhan on drY land.

Hon. Mi. ASELTINE: May 1 ask a question? Therc is sometliing tlîat bas been botherîng me for a long time in cenneetien with
irrigýation in southern Alberta.
In 1931 I
made a spc cial trip te tbat ares te investigate
strip farming.
When I got te Macleod 1
found that the irrigation ditches there were
filled xvith water and nobody was using it.
ln reply ýte questions I asked, the farmers
said that it cost tee muci rnoney te take
advantage of -the irrigation system. I believe
the cest n'as $4.50 an acre for the use of the
wvater, and on that occasion it was flot being
used. Is tliere any explanation of that?

Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: They have te pay
fer- the use ef the water, the water is net
previded free. I do net know what sectionHon. Mr. ASELTINE: North of Macleod.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: The main, irrigation ditelies run north of Maeleod from the
Old Man river down te the main reserveir of
tîxat streain. The water is net available te
the faiiiers nerth of Macleod unless they nsk
tlîat it be distributed in tlîeir area.
As a motter of fact, the very area about
whichi tbe honeurable senator speaks now
wants te coi-ne under the present irrigation
system. It is also a fact that tbe territory
which I amn tîying te describe now was
similar te that whieh hie nenýtioned, but it
was even worse. It bas heen served by the
Lethbridge Northern Irrigatien Systern.
It
xwas a country of xvaste and soit-drift, a
countr ' where people w-cie being helped eut
by the gýoverement.
Today it is a garden
iiplv because it lias irrigation.
Around
eVery home vou will find a forest of trees,
aýnd frequentlY a flewer garden will be found
in front of the lieuse and a vegetable garden
in the rear.
In that iitriet tîxcie was establi-,hed six or
seven years age a sugar-beet factory, in which
tbeie is an ix cstmnent of close te a million
and a liaîýf dollars. I exp'et tlîe sugar beet
industry of seuthern Alberta te produce this
ycar 110 million pounds of sugar from the
îrrigated areas. ail of whieh would have been
useless exeept for irrigation. That ýtransformation bas taken place within sight of people
wlio live in dry arcas and who are suffering
crep failures year after year. -Naturally thev
ask for the expansion of irrigation.
I think it max' interest Ixonourable senators
to hear what the transformation frem dry
land te irrigated land means in dollars and
cents. There is a smali irrigation district of
about nine thouisand acres known as the
Taber Irrigation District. Ie early da ' s it
wxaz ranehied 1w- a verY welcl knowxn citizen ef

FEBRUARY 12, 1947
Alberta, "Archie" MeLean, who was at one
time a member of the provincial government.
At that ýtime it was short range-grass l'and. 1
ar nfot an authority on the matter, but I have
heard it said that approximately forty acres
were required to feed one steer. 1 arn ad'vised
by someone who is a better statistician than
I arn bhat, on the basis of one "critter"ý- as
we call the animais that roam the plains--to
forty acres of land, those 9,000 acres -had they
remaineti as ranch land would have prod.uced
beef whjch at wartime prices would- have
been worth $5,625 gross. Those fine thousand acres are now irriga;ted:, and a year ago
produced from sugar-beets $111.50 an acre, at
a cost of possibly $50 or $60 an acre for labour
and materials, leaving a net profit of a litýtle
over $50 an acre to the farmer. You could
estirnate what that, woYuld amount to for the
total nine thousand acres as cornpared with
the live stock ranching profits in the same
area.
As the result of irrigation that landi Las
Sa grown in value that you cannot buy it for
less than $75 an acre, and $100 is the prevailing price for land that a few years ago was
quite useless. In some of the richer districts
land is beld as high as $150 an acre. Those
prices, which are fixed an the basis of what the
land can produce, are beyond anything asked
for dry land. What bas been accomplished
in the Taber Irrigation District andi by the
Lethbridge Northemn Irrigation System can
be done in any dry area if water is provided.
I have spoken about the irrigation systems
with which I arn most familiar; but there are
others with possibilities which are just as
great. I might mention an area immediately
west of Medicine Hat, wbere the Canada
Land and Irrigation system was established in
Vauxhaîl many years aga. They have dams,
ditches andi reservoirs. There is water there,
but if the systemn were expanded it would
change the whole countryside aloung the main
line of the C.P.R. ta Medicine Hat, just as
irrigation bas transforned the extreme southern part of the province. In offering these
illustrations ta you, I arn trying to canvince
you that these investrnents in irrigation are
worth-while nat only ta Alberta but to the
entire Dominion of Canada.
May I go further andi say that irrigation
bas ibrought about industrial development in
southeru. Alberta. We have now two sugarbeet factories in which there is an, investment
of some $3,000,000., Another factory is ta be
built in the Tabei' Irrigation District this year.
It wiIl involve investment of over $2,000,000,
because it will be a more modern plant anâ
the construction casts will be higher. In the
same area in soutbern Alberta we have four

or five canning factories. During the war
years, in my home city of Lethbridge, one of
those factories was shipping canneti peas into
Ontario. A few years ago we iti flot think
we coulti da anything like that in western
Canada. These factories are increasing in
number because the crops that are necessary
for the canning factories are being produced
in the West.
The farmers are also producing flhc rilk
necessary for creameries and cheese factories.

It -will interest those of my colleagues who
are acquainted with the live stock business to
learn that the live stock fecding, which goes
along with the bcet sugar factories, bas changed
the whole picture. If you go to one of the
sugar factories, particularly the one located at

Picture Butte, y ou wîll find large corrals into
which steers and lambs are moved in the
wintertime ant fed upon the by-product of
.the sugar factories.

Many of the steers in

western Canada will survive ithis hard winter
because they are in this favourable location,

where ýthey will have access to good feed. The
feed contains the richness of the sugar prod-

uct. I arn toIt that sugar beet by-products
mixeti with alfalfa makes an ideal fced. and
the feed industry is growing ithere at the -orne
time.
Perhaps it is rny own selfish attitude, but I
feel that the money expended in irrigation
projeots, particularly in the initial developments, bas been cornpletely justifiet.
The
provinces mnust participate in this development; the dominion does not undertake it
ail. There are other parts of Alberta which
could be benefited by bringing the water ta
dry landi.
The sarne is true also in the
province of Saskatchewan, where there are at
present some srnall areas benefiting by
irrigation.
I do not know how better to learn what
irrigation means than ta visit the few acres of
the Manyberries Range Experirnent Station in
southeastern Alberta located in a section of
country where cactus grows and all kinds of
prairie animais range; where homesteaters
neyer succeed. In that section of the country
which looks like desert until you reach this

little plot of ground, you will fint storage of
water that bas corne frorn snow that bas
accumulateti on the benches and meltet and
run off into this reservair. They grow apples
ant small fruit. They also grow alfalfa in. a
srnall way, and other bays. That is an illustration of what is passible when water is
placeti on dry soil, even in a part cf the
country that is supposed ta be trier than any
other section.

SENATE

Thcr is something else in connection with
irrigation which I should like to discuss, and
tliat is immigration. In order to explain what
I am going to say at the moment I should refer
you to the farms that produce sugar-beets.
The work on the farms is done by families.
An entire family contracts to look after the
seeding of beets, to care for them during the
growing season and to harvest them. On his
farm the sugar-beet grower has a home for
the family that he employs to do this work.
Around the house there will be a few acres of
land on which the faimily of labourers will grow
some vegetables for their own use; and they
will probably keep a pig and some chickens.
Whben the sugar-beet industry was revived,
about fifteen or twenty years ago, a considerable number of Hungarian families were
brought in and placed on sugar-beet farms.
A few weeks ago I was told by one of the
officers of the Southern Alberta Sugar-Beet
Growers that more than half of the Hungarians that came to the country as farm labourers
are now operating farms that they themselves
own; and that many of the others have leased
farms and are well on tbe way to becoming
owners of thein.
We hear much about our inability to
assimilate various peoples. My experience
shows that these Hungarians are being assimilated rapidly. Their children go to our schools,
where their standing is bigh. During the
Victory Loan drives those people who only
a few years ago came to Canada as labourers,
with practically no resources, subscribed for
the purchase of victory bonds. At present in
that area and in other areas of the West there
is a shortage of labour. I agree with the
bonourable gentleman from Saskatchewan
North (Hon. Mr. Horner) that there is a
shortage of farm labour, particularly in this
section where the farmers engage in intensive
cultivation. I am inclined to think that if
it had not been for the Japanese who were
taken out of British Columbia and placed on
beet-growing areas in Southern Alberta during
the war the beet-growing and beet-sugar
industry there would have collapsed. Prior
to the war those Japanese had probably worked
in the fisheries or forests of British Columbia.
yet in a very short time they became adept at

farmers in the area want to keep these people,
becau-e they give the utrmost satisfaction.
TI.ey are not competing with other labour
by working below the regular wages, or anything of that kind. On the contrary, they are
paid the regular rates. They spend their
noney in stores in neighbouring communities.

clothes of good quality. In short, they are a
fine class of people. I do not know what will
happen to the production of sugar-beets if
the Japanese are removed from Southern
Alberta this season. because at the moment
there are no people to replace them.
I repeat and emphasize that for the sugarbeet industry families are far more suitable
than individual workers. A single man who
is working with a farmer today may leave him
tomorrow or next month. The work bas
to be contracted for from the beginning to
the end of the season, and it has been found by
experience that under these conditions families
are far more suitable than individuals.
We have widened our immigration policy
a little, but not enough.
I am quite sure that in refugee camps in
Europe today there are many families who
would be only too happy to emigrate to
Canada and work on these farms. Just before
I left home for Ottawa I had a call from the
leader of a Mennonite settlement near Lethbridge, who said that if Japanese labour was
not available this year he did not know how
the crops could be cultivated. He told me
that the Mennonites in the United States and
Canada are giving financial help towards bringing Mennonites from European refugee camps
out to Paraguay, in South America. He said:
"We have had the Japanese living in our
houses, and if they are to go we could replace
them by bringing out distressed Mennonite
families from Europe." There is room for
these people in Canada and a demand for
them.
A meeting at which I was a listener yesterday convinced me that soon we may no longer
be able to get such people to come to Canada.
Those now living in refugee camps in Europe
do not want to go back to the countries from
which they came. Being fearful of what might
happen to them there they would like to go
to democratic countries, and at the present
time many of them would be glad to come to
Canada. But is there not a possibility that
within, say, a couple of years the Scandinavian
Peninsula, Holland, Belgium and France will
take much the same attitude that Britain is
taking today, that they cannot spare any of
their population? If that happens they will
do all they can to discourage people from
emigrating to other countries, and then our
opportunity to get certain classes of labour
that we so badly need will have been lost.
There is no question that those people who
want to move to freedom-loving countries
would make the very best citizens in Canada.
There would be no need of screening them

FEBRUARY 12, 1947
at aIl, except possibly in relation to healtb.
We need those people, and we should take
prompt steps to bring them here. They would
fit into our life and contribute 10 the wealtb
and development of the country.
Before closing I wish to take the opportunity of complimenting my honourable colleague from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies)
upon some of the remarks hie made at the
conclusion of bis address last evening. I have
been talking about the practical side of life,
a side that has to do witb the expenditure
,of money and the making of money. In that
portion of his address 10 which I arn now
referring my honourable friend from Kingston
urged the making of expenditures, not for
the purpose of getting a financial return, but
on projects designed to elevate the minds
of our people. We ail know tbat we have to
finance the construction and maintenance of
public works bo meet the needs of our coinmunities, but we are apt to overlook the
cultural side of our citizenship. I agree entirely
with the bonourable gentleman's statement
that we should bave a national library and
a better art gallery here at Ottawa, and tbus
set an example to the rest of the country. As
a malter of fact I tbink tbat in this respect
many parts of the country are setting an
example to Ottawa. 1 find that various small
communities have art exhbits by young
people, wbo probably are getting some training from teachers in local scbools. Also, the
littie theatre movement is spreading. In
many parts of western Canada you will find
groups entbusiastically supporting art and
other cultural organizations. They sbould be
giv en encouragement from the capital of
Canada.
I will not say more at Ibis time. My main
purpose in rising was to discuss tbe expansion
of irrigation in soutbern Alberta, witb a view
to giving tbe bouse some information as to
wbat bas been done in tbe past, wbat is being
dorne now and wbat is possible for tbe future.
Hon. Mr. Howard moved the adjournment
of the debate.
The motion was agreed to.
CUSTOMS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON
moved tbe second reading of Bill 6, an Act
10 amend the Customs Act.
He said: Honourable senators, Ibis is a
very simple bill. Under an order in council
passed in February 1943, the period in. wbich
an importer may make a cdaim for a refund

59

or remission of duties paid was extended from
fourteen to tbirty days. The only purpose of
Ibis bill is 10 give statutory effeet 10 that
extension.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I tbink the Act wilI be
greatly improved by Ibis amendment.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I hiope tbat tbere wil
be a similar extension in various other statutes. Usually tbe period in wbicb a person
must. act in order 10 escape a penalty is 100
short.
The motion was agreed 10, and the bill was
read the second lime.
FEEDING STUFFS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON
moved the second read-ing of Bill 7, an Act 10
amend the Feeding Stuifs Act, 1937.
He said: Honoura!ble senators, the purpose
of Ibis bill is to amend section, 4 of the act
so as 10 give statutory effect to a wartime
order in council wbicb authorizes the minister
to make regulations -requi-ring feeding stuiff
to be of correct composition, for the purpose
claimed by the vendor and preventing the
sale of feeding stuifs of wrong composition
for any specifie purpose. The amendment
enables tbe minister 10 provide, for instance,
that if feed is sold for catlle il mnust be suitable for caIlle only. Any sncb regulation would
be carried oui in co-operation witb feed
boards establisbed by the provincial governments and animal nutritionisîs of tbe dominion and provincial services and universities.
Under the present section 4 of the act, the
minister is required 10 register the particular feeding stuif for which application is made
and 10 set up requirements for il. Tbis has
led '10 manufacturers of feeding stýuifs bringing in a multitude of brands different only
sl.igbtly in. composition, for wbicb different
grades bave been set up and for which different prices could be cbarged. During the war
tbe minister was given autbority by order in
council 10 control the registration of these
feeding stuifs, merely 10 keep unnecessary
brands off tbe market, and the producers and
users of feeding stuifs bave asked, that Ibis
provision be continued in the act.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is ahl right.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I have not read the
original act. Would there be an appeal from
the decision of tbe minister?
Hon."Mr. ROBERTSON: I arn afraid, I arn
not in a position 10 say. We tbougbl perbaps that if tbere were any specifie questions

SENATE
we mighit Lave a committee meeting tomorrow, or if inquiries were limited to just one
question, perhaps in the meantime I might
obtain the information for the honourable
senator. I am afraid I am not conversant
enough with all the details to give him an
answer at this moment.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: It may be provided for.
I only got this bill when coming into the
chamber. I have not had a chance to look up
the act. If there is no appeal from the decision of the minister, I think there should be.
Otherwise it would be a bad situation.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I sec no particular reason why, if honourable senators
have any questions in regard to it, the bill
should not go to the committee and have the
proper officials there examine it.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: It may be that when
we have looked up that act it will not be
necessary to have anyone before the committee. I think we can settle that ourselves.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In any event I
can undertake this, that if second reading is
given, the bill could stand for third reading,
and if necessary or desirable there could be
a reference to a committee in the meantime.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: All right.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We shall be sitting on
Friday. It could go until Friday morning, if
the honourable member finds le needs some
further enlightenment.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I would like it
to stand in any event, because I am not sure
whether our Law Clerk has examined into
the minor details.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, he las.
me to that effect.

He wrote

The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
INSPECTION AND SALE BILL
SECOND READING
McL. ROBERTSON
Hon. WISHART
moved the second reading of Bill 8, an act
to amend the Inspection and Sale Act, 1938.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to continue the regulations
respecting the grade standards, grading and
labelling of flax fibre and tow, which have
been in effect for the last five years under
the War Measures Act. The bill lias the
unanimous support of the flax fibre industry
of Canada, which realizes that the grading of
their products must continue if the industry
is te survive. During the war we sold con-

siderable flax fibre and tow to the British
government, and we were asked te grade it.
The producers of flax think it would be a good
thing to continue this provision in the act.
It may be recalled that during the war there
was a considerable expansion of flax production in Canada, with acreage expanding from
8.306 acres in 1939-40 to 47,000 acres in 1942-3.
Since then, however, the price offered for flax
by Britain has fallen considerably, and we
have not encouraged farmers to extend their
flax production. Last year flax acreage had
declined to 15.762 acres, and the price for the
top grades of flax Lad fallen to 40 cents, 15
cents below the price paid for the 1945-6
crop. An agreement with Britain for the sale
of the 1946-7 crop has been entered into at
prices ranging from this figure of 40 cents for
top grades to 12 cents for lower grades.
I am advised that a question arose in the
other place as to the authority or the jurisdiction of the federal government to legislate
along these lines. The Minister of Agriculture
advised that the Justice Department had gone
over the bill and assured himu that it was
intra vires, since the regulation applies only
to flax for export. whether between provinces
or for sale in foreign countries.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I would like to ask
the leader of the government, las this bill
ut the request of the growers
heen amendii
of flaxHon. Mr. ROBERTSON: So I am informed.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: -or of the flax industry; or is it purely a government measure?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am advised that
the bill las the unanimous support of the
flax fibre industry in Canada.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Does the "flax fibre
industry" mean the people who grow the
flax?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I presume so.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
this development las taken place largely since
the war. which brought about the interruption
of the supply of flax fibre from other sources.
My purpose in rising is to draw attention to a
provision which seems te be a rather extraordinary one. It may Le quite all right. In
the first section, under 12A, I find the
following:
In this Part, unless the context otherwise
requires,
(a) "export"That is the definition of the terrn "export".
-means send out of Canada or out of one province to another province.

61

FEBRUARY 12, 1947
Further on, under 12C, it is -provided that
the government may make regulations for
various purposes in order to carry out the
intention of the act.
Now, the bill appears Vo me to put a
definite limitation on interprovincial business
in Canada in so far as flax fibres are concernied.
It is the application of a principle wbicb,
so far as I recail, bas not been in effect before.
If we send this bill to a committee, which
1 respectfully suggest Vo the leader of the
government forces here should be done, we
might get some information on that particular
point. I believe that on occasion certain
provinces have attempted by provincial action
to create conditions that interfered to some
extent with interprovincial trade. We should
be very careful, I submit, before we give
even a qualified approval. to that principle; and
if it meets with the views of the leader of
the bouse I would suggest that tbis point
sbould be consîdered fully wben the bill is
referred to a committee.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I heartily agree
with the suggestion of the bonourable senator.
I was just turning over in my mind the
question of what I would do about sending
this bill Vo committee. IV seems to me that
wbile this involves agriculture, it is perhaps.
a matter affectîng commerce as well. I think.
that for the time being we might refer this
bill to the Committee on Banking and Commerce. It is a border-line case. Therefore,
bonourable senators, if the bouse sees fit to
give the bill second reading I will move to
refer it to the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce..
Hon. Mr. WHITE: I would like Vo inform
tbe leader that the meeting of tbe Internal
Economy Committee is continuing tomorrow
at, il o'clock.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We could bave the other
committee on Friday.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I tbink there is
a possibility of one or two more bills reaching
us tomorrow, Thursday, Vo which the house
might give second reading. Perhaps we could
bave tbe Banking and Commerce Committee
meet on Friday morning, to take up this bill
and any others wbich honourable senators
tbink desirable Vo send Vo it.
The motion was agreed Vo, and the bill
was read the second tîme.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
bill be referred Vo the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed Vo.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. J. F. JOHNSTON moved the second
reading of Bill C, an Act to incorporate Conference of Mennonites in Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bul is to incorporate Jacob J. Thiessen,
clergyman, of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and
others, under the namne of Conférence of Mennonites in Canada. The bill provides that the
he-ad office of the corporation shali1 be at
Rosthern, Saskatchewan, or at such other
place in Canada as may be decided upon by
the corporation.
The objccts of the proposed corporation are
set out in clause 4 of the bitl. Other clauses
of the bill folktw the provisions of chapter 57
of the Statutes of Canada, 1944-45, incor.
porating the executive board of the Canada
Conference of the Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod of North America.
If the bill is read a second time, it is my
intention to move that it be referred Vo the
Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills,
where the promoters of the bill will be prepared Vo furnish any further information wbich
seems to be required.
The motion was agreed to, and the butý was
read the second time.
IIEFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON moved that the bilL

Miscelleneous Private Bills.
The motion was agreed to.
PUBLICATION 0F STATUTES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
readmng of Bill E, an Act teo amend the Publication of Statutes Act.
H1e said: Honourable senators, 1 have asked
the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) to explain this bill.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: This is a bill Vo
amend the Publication of Statutes Act, which
is Chapter 2 of the Revised Statu-tes of Canada, 1927. The amendments themselves are
not very important, but they are rather interesting because they arise out of and result
from the changed position of Canada as a fully
self-governing dominion under the Statute of
Westminster.
I shouhid like to refer honourable senators Vo
the section, of the British North America Act
which deale with the power of the Governor

SENATE
General whn a bill has becn jiased by the
Senate and the House of Comnons and is submittedi to hin for his sanction.
Under section 55, there are three courses of
action which the Governor General may take.
First of all, he can refuse his consent, which
of course kills the measure; secondly, he can
give the Royal Assent, and, thirdly, he can
reserve the bill for the signification of the
King's pleasure. In the, second case, if lie
gives assent to the bill, and it becomes law.
then under section 56 it is the duty of the
Governor General to send the act to one of
His Majesty's principal secretary's of state, in
Great Britain, and His Majesty has the right
within a period of two years thereafter to
disallow the measure. If. on the other hand,
the Governor General has reserved the bill
for His Majesty's pleasure, then under section
57 of the British North America Act, it is
provided that the measure sha.l not come
in-to force at all unless within a period of two
years His Majesty-that is the Imperial
Government-bas expressed his assent to the
neasure.
Honourable senators will see that those
provisions are obviously not applicable in the
present stage of the constitutional development of this country. Perhaps you will allow
me to give a short history of the developments
leading up to the introduction of this bill.
At the Imperial Conference of 1926 the
question of refe.rring bil-s from dominion
legislatures to Great Britain was raised, and
it was decided that the matter required further
consideration; but the conference went on
record to this effect:
Apart fron provisions confirmed in constitutions or in specific statutes expressly providing
for reservation. it is recognized that if is the
right of the governmîent of each dominion to
advise the Crown in ail natters relating to
its owii affairs.
Next. in, 1929, there was a conference held
in London on the operation of dominion legislation. That conference reached the conclusion
that the power of disallowance by His
Britannic Majesty could only be exercised in
tccordance with ·the constitutionial practice,
and upon the ad.vice of the dominion government concerned. That stand was confirmed
by the Imperial Conference of 1930.
As a result of those decisions, the procedure laid down in the British North America
Act for the referring of Canadian acts to the
British government was cbanged, and instead
of their being sent by the Governor General
to His Majesty's Se-retary of State, thev were
sent by our Minister of External Affairs to
the Minister for Dominion Affairs in London.
That practice continued iutil 1942 whien it

was completely abolished, and in April of
1943 the Prime Minister in another place made
this statement:
In 1942, in view.of the complete obsolescence
of the power of disallowance and in order to
bring the actual practice into conformity with
the constitutional position. the transmission of
bills and acts froum the Secretary of State for
External Affairs to the Secretary of State for
Dominions Affairs was stopped.
This bill simply amends the Publication of
Statutes Act to conform to that new position.
If honourable senators will look at section 3
of the act they will see that, among other
things, it refers ta bills reserved for the
signification of the King's pleasure, and
assented to or disallowed by the King in
Council. The amendment would remove that
reference,
which is now unnecessarv and
inapplicable.
Section 6, as it now stands, requires that
certified copies of acts passed during the
session of parliament siall be delivered by
the Clerk of the Parliaments to the Governor Generalh in order that he in turn may
transmit them to His Majesty's Secretary of
State in London for assent or disallowance,
as the case may be. Tbat provision also is
taken out of the act by these amendments.
There are one or two other inconsequential
amendments resulting from tle same train of
circumstances.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: Wbat is the
meaning of:
All the original acts passed by the legislatures
of the late provinces of Upper or Lower
Canada . . .
To wbat statutes does that refer?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: That would refer
to the statutes of the united provinces of
Upper and Lower Canada, prior to confederation-the present provinces of Ontario and
Quebec.
Hon. Mu. MacLENNAN: Why bave they
been resurrected to be certified?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: There is no queslion of their certification. It is merely that
those old statutes remain in the custody of
the Clerk of the Senate. There is no change
in that respect.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
ENITED NATIONS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART
McL. ROBER TSON
moved the second reading of Bill F, an Act
respecting Article Forty-one of the Charter
of the United Nations.

FEBRUARY 12, 1947
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) ta explain this bill.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: In presenting this bill, honourable senators, I should
explain that it is designed to enable the
Governor General ta carry out the obligations
of this country under Article 41 of the Charter
of the United Nations, which, as we ail know,
was duly signed ini San Francisco in June,
1945. After moving the second reading of
the bill I shahl request that it be referïed ta
the Senate Standing Committee on External
Relations, for inquiry and elucidation.
Before making that suggestion, however,' I
think it should be realized by honourable
senators that this bill represents the fgrst of a
series of realistîc features in the Charter ai
the UJnited Nations which were fully discussed at the time the subject was debated in
the chamber and in the other bouse, but
which, I submit, should be brought home ta
aur awn minds, and te those of the Canadian
publie whenever opportunity presents itself.
In order ta refresh the memory ai honourable senators, I would refer ta the Charter of
the United Nations, which was discussed at
some length in this chamber following the

conference in San Francisco. In Chapter 5,
which includes articles 24 and 2.5, full assurnption by the Security Council of responsibility
for the fundamental protection and security
of the world, was granted by the members of
the United Nations. Article 25 reads:
The members of the United Nations agree to
accept iand carry 'oct the decisions of the
Security ýCou-ncil in accordance with the present
Charter.
Based on that foundation, chapter 7 af the
Charter oi the United Nations, including
Article 41 which is the subject matter of this
bill, deals with procedure and action on the
part of tbe Security Council with respect ta
acts of aggression and tbreats and breaches of
the peace.
As I intimated in the beginning, Articles
41, 42 and 43 represent the real teeth of the
United Nations' Charter, and 1 think that we
should give full consideration ta these
articles, and particularly Article 41, which is
reproduced in full on the back page of the
bill naw hefore us. It is the first ai twa
measures involving, not the use ai armed
forces but rather the cmployment ai econamic
sanctions and the possible interruption cf
econornic relations by rail, sea, air, postal,
telegraphie, radio and other means ai communication, and the possible severance of
diplomatie relations.

63

In order that the full implications af this
bill rnay be brought borne. not only ta aur
rninds but indirectly ta the attention ai the
public oi Canada, I feel that further consideration sbould be given tao it in the Standing
Committee on External Relations, whcre
officers ai the dcpartment and, I hope, the
minister hirnseli, could appear and discuss
this matter fully.
One might objcctively. and in popuiar parlance, picture the situation in regard to the
United Nations' Charter and this bill in
particular. We werc privileged ýta engage in
the christening ai an infant horn of the hopes
and aspirations of this world in the canference
at San Francisco in 1945. Part of the christening ceremony took place in this chamber.
and the time bas now corne when one ai the
first tecth appears. I feed we should celebrate

the occasion by continuing the cerernony
before the 'Standing Comrnittee on External
Relations with ail the seriausness that the
circumnstances warrant.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: This is a very
important piece ai legishation, and is the
firat invoked ta put power inta the hands ai
the Security Council ai the United Nations
ta enable them ta carry out the terns af the
charter. We must face the situation seriously,
for it means that as soon as the peace treaties
are signed the next step will be ta caîl upon
the arrned forces ai the member nations. We
know what happened ta the League ai
Nations. We know that it failed because
certain people involved in it gave hip-service,
but did flot give actual service.
Not more than three months aga 1 beard
the very distinguished Foreign Secretary of
Great Britain say be neyer thought the day
would corne wben hie wouhd be a member af
a United Kingdom governrnent that voted
for conscription in peacetirne, but that bie had
ta support such a policy until it became clear
that the 55 members ai the United Nations
would give ta that arganization sufficient
power ta enfarce their united wihl an the
world as a whole. I arn wholly in accord with
this bill; I bave not anc reservation ta it. I
agree with what was said by the honaurable
gentleman frorn Ottawa (Han. Mr. Lambert)
in emphasizing how important the bill is, and
in urging that it should be sent ta a cornmittee. But I think everybody should understand that in this measure we are taking the
first step towards carrying out aur undertaking ta support the United Nations organization. In the debate on the Address in
Reply ta the Speech from the Throne I said
that I know ai no other machinery than the
United Nations organizatian which holds out

64

SENATE

any hope for maintaining the peace of the
worl.
But as practical men and women we
must give the organization power to maintain
peace.
J am entirely in favour of the general
principles underlying the United Nations
organization, and I think we all can be in
favour of those principles. But we must
remember that some day, maybe not this
session but perhaps next session or later, we
shall be presented with a bill calling upon
us- to guarantee that a certain number of
Canadian men will be furnished for the Army,
Navy and Air Force, or one of those forces.
When that day comes we in Canada shall have
to take proceedings to get the required number
of men into the Army, Navy or Air Force,
as the case may be. If the men are not
already enlisted, we shall have to get them.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: May I ask my
honourable friend a question? Has the veto
power got anything to do with this bill?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. I do not want to
bring a discussion of the veto power into
this debate. because for one thing I do not
know, and I do not believe anybody knows,
how far the veto power can go. I believe
wholeheartedly that without the veto power
we can have no United Nations. I am hoping
the time will come when some other means
wiil replace war for the settlement of disputes;
but at present-let us be candid-if the
Security Council decided to make war on
Russia, the vetoing by Russia of that decision
would make no difference: there would be war.
I do not like the wording of section 3 of
the bill, which provides a penalty for violation of any order or regulation made under
the act. It should not be left to the Governor in Council to prescribe what the fine or
tern of imprisonnent should be. I am not
saying this because of the wide powers that
have been exercised' by the Governor in
Council in recent years, for -if I had been
a member of the government during the war
I probably should have agreed with what was
done. But when we are passing a statute
authorizing the Governor in Council to impose
punishment, I think that a limit to the
amount of the fine or term of imprisonment
should be specified in the statute. In conmittee I will suggest that the section be
redrafted to specify -the limits of the penalty
that may be imposed.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, this appears to me to be an
exceedingly important piece of legislation,
and a we have been told that it is the

first of a number of bill.s of a similar character I must confess that I should like to see
what the other bills contain.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Excuse me, but I d'id not
mean that there would be other bills this
session. My point was that in time to come,
as the United Nations organization develops,
further bills will be presented to us.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I misunderstood my
honourable friend in that regard. Nevertheless,
my remark that this is an exceedingly important piece of legislation stands. I have seen
it for the first time just at this moment, and
what I know about it is what has been said
here, together with what I have been able to
make out from reading the bill ani' applying
my imagination to the words. J find here that
the Security Council of the United Nationsan organization of which the people of Canada
are a part, but over which they have no
control-may decide upon a measure to be
employed te give effect to any of the council's
decisions, and it may call upon Canada to
apply such measure.
That ýis, an outside
authority may call on us to do something,
to apply a certain measure, whereupon apparently the Government of Canada, that is te
say the executive, the Governor in Council,
shall apply the measure. Parliament would
be entirely sidetracked, and, the Governor in
Council could proceed to fine and imprison the
citizens of Canada in order to compel them
to carry out a decision made by some
authority outside our borders.
That may be all right, but I suggest to
honourable members that it raises a number of
very serious implications and! that, to say
the least, it is unique in the history of this
or any other British country. So I say this is
legislation of the greatest importance and
should be viewed by us with a great deal
of care and, I might say, even suspicion.
Moreover, this bill originates in the Senate.
If does not come from the other house, with
a mere request for our concurrence. So the
responsibility for it rests upon us in greater
degree perhaps than it would if we were
passing legislation which had been reviewed,
discussed and considered in another legislative
assembly.
I wonder whether this feature of the
situation as it appeals to me has been considered by the drafters of this bill. In this
country we have two classes of parliament of
co-ordinate jurisdiction, the parliament of
the dominion and the legislatures of the
provinces. In a treaty a government may
agree to do certain things, to take away or
to modify the rights of its citizens. A government may sign a treaty te that effect without

FEBRUARY 12, 1947
consulting parliament. But according to Our
constitutional. mies, when a government does
so it takes the risk of flot being able te, carry
ont its undertaking. Our country may enter
into a treaty with another country, a treaty
so]emnly signed under the Great Seal, with the
name of the Governor General or the King
attached to it, but those who sign it or
arrange to have it signed take the risk of the
parliament of this country refusing to carry
it ont. And if parliament does refuse to
carry it out, the treaty fails down. That is
the constitutional mile that applies to this
country.

An lion. SENATOR: The govemnment
wo-uld go ont of office.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: My hionourable
friend says the government would go out of

office. Not at ail. Undcr our constitution
the only resuit of the fallure of parliament to
ratify a treaty is ýthat the ýtreaty is not
carried ont, and those who have signed it cao
get ont of it as best they may. Parliament
is not bound to a treaty nnless parliament
accepts it.
Otherwise the sovereignty of
parliament could be abrogated by a more act

of the Exeoutive in the name of the Crown.
Now, what are we running into boere? We

have a treaty or something in the form of a
treaty-it bas at least the colour of a treatyentered into by the Govemnor in Council, that
is to say the Cabinet, with the United Nations,
that certain things shall be done in this
country. While that has been signed, thero
is no obligation on this country to carry it
ont nnless the parliaments of this country
agree.
And, as I have already intimated,
we have two classes -of pariiaments -one
parliament at Ottawa, with a general jnrisdiction thronghout Canada, and another series

of parliaments

of

co-ordinate

jurisdiotion

within the provinces, the rights of these
parliaments to legisiate within their own fields
of j nrisdiction being absolute and sovoreign.
So, honourable senators, in this bill are we
not running into this difficulty, that we are
agreeing, and in a way endorsing the attitnde
of the government in agreeing, to carry ont
something, we know not what? At toast, I
know not what. I do not know what it is
proposed that we shall carry out. It may be
within our jurisdiction or it may be within
the jurisdiction of the provinces. In this bill
we would give te, the government in the
federal division of the total jurisdiction in
Canada the power to fine and imprison people
for not doing something which may be within
the jurisdiction of the provinces.
I say this is a most tangled skeîn that we
are weaving, and as the originators of this
bill and as the eider statesmen of Canada as
83168-5

well, it behoves ns to be very careful indeed
la wbat we are doing. I suggest to the hon-

ourable leader of the honse that his measure

had better not be passed today. There is no
hnrry. J1 tbink it wouhd be well if it stood on
the order paper during the recess, in order
to givo some of us a chance to consider its
constitutional and other implications.
lion. Mr. MURDOCK: Wouid the bonourable senator say what the provinces have to
do witb this bill? It deals witb the United
Nations. Canada is a nation, but not one
of the fine provinces is. Wonld you tell ns
where tbe provinces are fonnd to be classed
as nations?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: 0f conrse, I did not

classify any province as a nation. The honourable gentleman does not seemn to have followed
me clearly, or I have failedl to make my
position clear. My statement is that Canada,
as a nation, represented by its governmentor, as is euphoniously stated bore, by the
Governor in Council-may enter into an agreement or a treaty or sometbing of that
character, and that is apparently wbat bas
been done. But in order to implement the
treaty you must go to parliament; or, if you
wish to implement At within the jurisdiction
of the provinces you must go to the provincial
parliaments, the legislatures. In such circum.stances, if the provincial legislatures refuse
to carry ont the treaty it is just too bad for
those who entered into it. They should have
found out about the matter in advance.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I ask the
honourable senator a question? Has some
precedent not been set and is some light not
thrown on this question by the fact that war
was declared by Canada, at a special session
of pamliament, in September 1939? To follow
the logical implications of his own argument,
it would have been impossible for war to
have been declared in 1939 except* with the
approval of ail provincial legislatures. He is
arguing something with respect to this charter.
We have approved of this charter. The
Parliament of Canada bas already approved
of the United Nations charter in every particular, and ail we are asldng here is that
an act be passed to enable the government
to take action if, as and when the occasion
arises, subi oct to the approval of parliament

later, because the order in council will be
placed upon the table of parliament within
fifteen days after it is approved.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I think the distinction is that we are now at peace, and when the
derlaration of war was made by -the Parliament
of Canada we were at war, and the subjeet.

REVISED EDITION

SENATE

matter of that declaration was not within the
jurisdiction of the provinces but rather within
the jurisdiction of this parliament, because of
the introduction to the British North America
Act with the overruling powers given to the
dominion in section 91. So the cases are not
analogous. If we were in a state of war, then
matters pertaining to war would, be within our
jurisdiction. But at the present moment we
are in a state of peace, and-the phrase "peace,
order and good government of Canada" does
not apply as it does in times of emergency.
We have to face the fact that this legislation
may be within the purview of the legislative
authority of the provinces, and not of the
dominion. I am only concerned to point out
the necessity for care and consideration before
we pass this bill, so that we may know where
we are going before we arrive there.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Surely my honourable friend would not argue that Alberta and
Saskatchewan were members of the United
Nations?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No, I would not
argue that.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Then what have
they got to do with it?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Because they control
property and civil rights within their respective
territories. And when the Security Councillisten now-

. . . decides upon a measure to be employed to
giv e effect to any of its'decisions and calls upon
Canada to apply such measure, the Governor iii
Council may make such orders and regulations
as appear to him to be necessary or expedient
for enabling such mieasure to be effectively
applied.
That is to say, if the United Nations asks
the Dominion of Canada to apply a measure
which affects the property and, civil rights of
citizens within this dominion, we shall be
attempting to give the Governor General in
Council of the dominion the power to legislate within the jurisdiction of the provinces
in times of peace. I may not have made
myself very clear in this. It is difficult. But
remember the principle which I have stated
with regard to treaties. The executive, the
Crown, the cabinet, makes all the treaties it
likes and signs them, but it cannot carry them
out without the consent of parliament. If
parliament does not consent, then the Crown
can get out of the situation as best it can.
Here you are giving power to our executive
to take measures which may invade the
jurisdiction of the provinces, and which it may
not be in a position to carry out. In other
words, you are passing a bill which is inviting
another contest between the jurisdictions.

Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
I must say at once that I cannot read into
this measure the serious implications that
appear to be in the mind of the honourable
member from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
loebuck). I may be quite wrong, but the
matter secms to me to be a relatively simple
one. After the organization of the United
Nations, which took place at San Francisco,
as I recall, a year ago last May, both houses
of this parliament considered the charter that
came out of the San Francisco meeting. That
charter was debated in the other house and
in this house, and as I recall, was unanimously
passed in both. I submit that when the ratification was before this bouse the honourable
member from Toronto-Trinity should have
raised this objection, because section 25 of the
United Nations charter-which, let me repeat,
was ratified unanimously in both houses-states
that the members of the United Nations,
and we are one of them, agree to accept
and carry out the decisions of the Security
Council in accordance with the charter. Now,
we are comimitted to that. We are conmitted by our ratification of the United
Nations Charter. What does that mean?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is, by the
Parliament of Canada.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: All this bill does, as
I read it, is to authorize the government of
the day at Ottawa to carry out the decisions
reached by the Security Council; and the
limitation is found in Article 41 of the United
Nations Charter, which is printed bere as a
schedule to this bill. It says:
The Security Council may decide wxhat
measures-Now, note this.
-not involving the use of arned force are to
be employed to give effect to its decisions,
so forth.
Let me illustrate. There might be a dispute
before the Security Council. A member is
seeking to violate its obligations under the
charter. The Security Council decides to
invoke sanctions against such member. For
instance, it may ask the other members of the
United Nations to withdraw their diplomatie
representatives as a censure on the offending
nation; or it may say, "You must net export
arms or munitions or anything else to such an
offending nation", or "Yeu muast cut off communication entirely." That, as I understand
it, is the purport of the powers that we seek
to give the government here in Ot'awawhatever government it may be. Surely that
does net trench in any way upon the powers
of the provinces.

-and

FEBRUARY 12, 1947
Hon. Mr.. LEGER: Suppose, for example,
that the order was te stop telephonic communication: would that flot he interference?
It says, "and other means of communication".
Suppose the order was to disrupt or stop
telephonie communication.
Hôn. Mr. CRERAR: My honourable friend
is a lawyer and I ar n ot, and consequently
hie may at the moment have the advantage
of me.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I ar n ot trying to take
advantage of the honourable senator. I am
just presenting an argument.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I think that if my
honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity and
my honourable friend who bas just raised the
point will inquire into the matter, they will
find that there are precedents for this kind of
control of international communications-not interprovincial but international communications--by the central government at Ottawa.
Be that as it may, certainly we must give the
federal government power to carry out the
comrnitments that we have already made in
giving our adherence to the United Nations
Charter. That is aIl that this seeks to do;
with the limitation, as I have already pointed
out, that the federal government is barred
from sending forces outside of the country
to meet a request of the United Nations.
It seems to me that in essence the matter
is really v~ery simple. If we are going to
carry out our. commitments to the United
Nations, vwhich we find clearly set out in
Article 25, and which let me repeat we agreed
to-and our ratification is already placed with
the proper authority-it is only common sense
and necessary that the federal government
have the power to act. It is all vcry well to
s-ay that we should cail parliament. Suppose
the Security Council sends a telegram to the
goverfiment here: "We are asking all signatories to the United Nations Charter to withdraw their diplomatie representatives immediately fromn the offending power". Are we
to wait?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is within the
jurisdiction of the dominion.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Are we to wait until
parliament bas assemhled to get authority to
do that? I do not believe that is a reasonable view to take. I think this act confers
upon the federal government nothing but the
necessary .power to act w.hen it is called upon
to act in accordance with the commitments
we have already made to the United Nations.

69

FEBRUARY 13, 1947
The first session of the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Employment was held in London fromn
October 15 to November 26, 1946.
That is the conference to which my honourable
friend refers, and the report before us is the
report of that conference.
It is flot specificaily Canada's report; it is a
report of a committee of wh'ich Canada was a
member. I shalh flot attempt to go inte it in
ail its phases. It is a sumnmary of the discussion and of the tentative agreement to the
proposed chartei. The report is now being
submitted te the respective governments and
parliaments. Honourable senators will realize
that in the light of their views, there will be a
further discussion. It does flot necessarily
mean that the agreement adopted will be preciseiy in its present form, nor does it mean, of
course, that any country is bound te it until
iA has been ratified hy the parliamient of that
country. The very point that my honourable
friend has brought up suggests to me that the
Senate should interest itself in this matter.
In the United States today representations are
being made fromn the point of view of that
country, and I think the Senate could render a
very useful service to this country at large if
our committee were to undertake to do the
samne thing.
I understand that reference was made to this
report in the other place -last Friday when,
1 believe, it was tabled there. I have taken
the epportunity of pointing eut to the Senate
the significance and importance of this report
in the belief that we could well address ourselves te it. Should copies become available
in the interim, I could have thcma mailed to
the honourable senators, se that they may
peruso the text in their homes.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: May I ask the honourahie leader. one more question.? If this matter
is referred to a Senate committce, will it be
possib1e tu have hefore the committee some
of the representatives of the Dominion Govcrnment who attended the conference?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I should say that
it would not only be possible 'but desirable
that those representatives shouhd appear
hefore a Senate committee, and- I am sure
they would welcome such an oipportunity. In
my slight experience of international conferences, I have often wished that I had the benefit of having. as my colleague the leader of the
opposition had, the point of view of honourable
senators.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Oaa my honourable
friend tell the Senate if there was any discussien of inter-Commonwealth relations?

,Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have no particular knowledge as te that, but I helieve there
was. I think that was announced in the newspapers. That is a very vital question. It is.
along the linesm of the suggestion made by my
heneurabie friend frem Kingston (Hon. Mr.
Davies), that officiais be breught before the
cemmittee which studies this matter.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Honourable senators,
is it in erder te move that the report be
referred te the standing cemmittee for
consideration?
Hon. Mr. RIOBERTSON: I said I hoped
that would be done, but that I did net wish
te do it in the absence of the chairman of
the cemmittee.

SENATE
lie sai(i: My honourable fi ieodi from
L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger) said yesterday
that lic would lijie to study the aet before
we proceed furtber witli this bill. I have flot
had an opportunity to consuit with bimi in
the meantime, 'but subjeC to any desire
that le mav have for furthcr consîderation of
the bill 1 would move the third raig
Hon. ANTOINE J. LEGEII: Honourable
senators, I bave the act before me anti, as I
appreiended, it provides no appeai from the
decision of the minister that feeding stuifs of
a certain kind or composition are not eligible
for rcgistration undter the art . Aftcr iooking
through the art I think that titis bill is aot
necessary at ail, bccause it seems to me that
ail the powers which the minister could possibly require arc already provided in, thie
statute. But if this view is not generaliy
accepte(l and the bill is ronsideredi necessarv.
then I say ive shotild defitio "public interest".
I wotild. not iinpiv anytbing agaiast the minister, but for some years I was a minister in
my province and I confess .that whien 1 was
politicaliy embarrassed by a question 1 would
reply that it was not in the public interest to
give the information rrqiiested.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: That is stili the
fashion.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: 1 think it is going very
far to give a minister absiolute power to say
that it is not in the puiblic interr4t that a
certain kind of fced should be rrgistered under
this act. If we think that the bill is necessaî'y at ail, we siîould at ieast dýefine "public
interest" as used in tlîis section, or we shouid
provide an appeai from tie mianister's decision.
Section 14 of the act gives the Governor in
Council power to make certain regulations.

I shouid flot object to this bill if it author'ized
the Governor in Council to decide what
feeding stuifs shouid be eligible for registration, but the bill gives absolute power to the
minister alone.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Does the act not
require that regulations mnade by the minister
shall be approved by the Governor in Council?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I do flot read it that
way. Section 14 of the act Baye:
The Gavernor in Council may froni time to

provisions of this act-

And there follows a Eist of things ta, which
such regulations may be applied. Then according to section 15:

that

in what I hiave said

there is sufficient ground for refer!ring this
bill ta a committee in order that we may
examine into, the working of the act. Some
of our honourable members who are farmiers
wiîll know whether this bill is desirable legislation or not.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In view of what
bas been said by my bonourable friend from
L'Acadie, I wouhd move that the bill be
referred ta the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I wonder if it would not
be better ta, refer the bill ta the Standing
Committee on Natural Resaurces. One reasan
for making this suggestion is that my honourable friend front Saskatchewan Nortb (Hon.
Mr. Hrmer) wishes ta bring beýfore that rommittee another matter which would came
under the saine bill, namehy, rock sait for
cattle.
lion. Mr. LEGER: How w'ouid il be to
refer it to the Lwo committees sitting together
and acting as a joint committer on tbis
matter?
Some lion. SENATORS: Oi no.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: There is a legal qucstion
invohved.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I think the point
whichi bas bren ruisi d as to the implications of
this section is a v'cîy important one, and
reference te the proper committer ta discuas
this miatter is a verdy important consideration.
For a long time tîtere bas heem constantly an
issue brtwcen the manufacturer of feeds and
the consumer of fecding stufifs in titis country.
As a very simple illustration, the allrged
quantity of srrrnings that gars into miii offal
lias bren a frequent source of contentian
between certain classes cf consumners; and the

manufacturer.

1 think tbat if tbe officiais of

the d'epartment, cannat satisfy tbe minds of
tbe committer in connection with tbis matter,
whatever committre considers titis bill should
be preparcd to rail in one or two representative agents of tbie different interests concernied.
While 1 arn incliord, off-band, to refer it ta
the Commnittce on Agriculture. I arn neot just
sure thiat that is the pi opr comitîittee tu
consider it. Possibiy it requires a broader
rPpresentation
than even tbe agricuiturai
iintE 1051.

FE13RUARY 13, 1947
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If I may speak again, I
would say that the reason I suggested the
Com.mittee on Agriculture was that I was
accepting the view of the honourable senat-or
from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger). He said
that the farmers will know whether the legisiation is desirable or not. I am of the saine
opinion. We can easily, cali before that
commitfee representatives of the Departmnent
of Justice who will explain the legal position
and cover that phase cf the subjeet. But
fundramentally this is a farmers' proposition;
the- real object is to protect the farmers who
are feeders, and personally I would prefer f0
sce the bill referred tu the Committee on
Natural Resources.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: I do not think if
is a mati er of great importance wbether this
bill is referred to one committee or another,
because if they approve it, they really will not
know what they are approving of. The bill
is to be "subject f0 regulations", and we do
not know what the regulations are. I would
say that before it is sent to any committee the
members who compose that committee should
know what the regulations s.re. I heard one of
the most eminent of Englisb judges declare
that it bas become the fashion to pass statutes,
and under them f0 impose regulations of which
the people in general know nothing. It is
this practice, wbich he; disparaged, that is
involved in the present bill. Suppose hýonourable senators unanimously approve of the bill,
what do tbey know about the regulations? I
believe that the regulations which if is proposed t0 frame in connection with the bill
sbould be attacbed tu if. because their effeet
may be týo alter altogether the operation cof
the statute.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
if seeme tu me that the bill sbould be sent
to a committee. Whether that committee be
the Committee ôn Agriculture or the Committee on Banking and Commerce does not
matter, perbaps, a great deal. But the honourable senator for L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger)
bas raised a point which I think la entitled
to some consideration, namnely, whaf is meant
by the words "public interesf".
Who is tu judge what constitufes public
interest in this matter? I venture to say that
on a set case you could get a dozen different
opinions from. members of this honourable
bouse as to whaf la signified by "'the public
interest." I do not know whet.ber the tfermi
could be more closely defiried or not; but at
any rate if the bill goes before a committee,
that comrniftee could ascerfain what la in the
mind of 'the officiais of the departmenf, or of
the Ministpr of Agriculture, in suggesting fhla

71

type of amendment to the Feeding Stuifs
Act. I look witb a good deal of coneern upon
the extension of rather broad, blanket powers,
even on a matter which perbaps la flot so
very important. The principle is unsound.
For this reason I should like ýto sec the bill
go to a commitfee to be furfber explored
and, possibly, improved. But I repeat that
if we begin f0 embed ini laws fhis ill defrned
principle of "publie interesf", we shall get
very badly off the ftrack.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I wonder whether we are
in order in discussing this at the moment.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Oh yes. I understood
that the leader moved that the bill be not
now read a third time, but that it be referred
tu the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
That was certainly in order.
Hon. Mr. COPP:- We will be in order as
soon as the motion for the third reading of
the bill has been discharged from the order
paper.
An Hon. SENATOR: That bas been done.
Hon. Mr. COPP: No; I beg your pardon.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: With leave of
the Senafe, the bonourable leader may withdraw the motion for third reading, and -then
move thaf the bill be referred ;to committee.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: With leave of the
Senýate. I withdraw that motion.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Leave is granted.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I now move that
this order be discharged from the order paper,
and that the bill be referred to the Standing
Committee on Natural Resources. My proposai that it be referred to the Committee
on Banking and Commerce was made upon
the assumption that it might facilitate business, because the other comm-ittee was sitting;
but that îs not a really important consideration. The habit of referring to the Banking
and Commerce Committee some matters
which, tbough quite within its province, might
be referred to some other committee bas perhaps caused me to overlook the very excellent
services of the Standing Committee on
Natural Resources and its chairman.
The motion was agreed f0, and the bill was
referred tu the Standing Committee on
Natural Resources.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. McKeen for an
address in reply thereto.
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators, it is oui duty at every session of this
parliament to consider the speech which His
Excellency the Governor General comes here
and delivers for our benefit. I am sure that
all of us agree with His Excellency in his
expressions of good wishes to this country.
We should reciprocate by wishing Their
Excelleneies the very best of everything while
they are in this country acting as the representatives of His Gracious Majesty King
George VI.
It is the privilege of those who are appointed
to this distinguished body to express not only
their own views but also those of the people
whom they represent, from the Atlantic to the
Pacifie. This is not only a privilege; ,it is a
pleasure. When I look at you, Mr. Speaker,
and see youî presiding over this assembly, my
nenory goes back a great many years. I
first met you in the city of Vancouver in the
ycar 1920, wlîen you were a member of the
Government of Brit-ish Columbia. Since then
you have filled many posts, having long been
a member of the Privy Council of Canada
and a distinguisied colleague of the present
Prime Minister, first as Minister of Public
Works, later as Minister of Iealth, and now
as Speaker of the Sonate. To you I extend
my heartiest good wishes, as does everybody,
I am sure, who bas ever known you.
Some hon. MEMBERS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: We listened with a great
deal of attention to the speeches made by two
of our newest members. Those of us who
have been hiere for some years, and who also
bad the- privilege of being elected to the other
place, have beard many Speeches from the
Throne as well as many speeches in debate,
and I am sure that while listening to these
t wo young men the other day we could not
easily forget that we are growing old. This is
an age of young men, and we are very proud
inded to have such capable men appointed to
this chamber. I an sure that in wishing then
long life and iany years of service in this
chamber, I an expressing the views of everybody who lad the pleasure of hearing them
speak.

We also listened with intense interest to the
speeches made by our two leaders. Those
speechcs were in a serious vein and referred
to very important matters related to the international situation as it exists today. Although
I enjoyed those speeches, I could not help
agreeing yesterday with my honourable friend
from Saskatchewan North (Hon. Mr. Horner)
that it would be a nice thing perhaps for the
lion and thei lamb to lie down together. I
know that the honourable leader opposite did
a good job at the United Nations conferences.
How liovely it muust be to go to Paris, or Lake
Success, or San Francisco. I hope that down in
his heart-or at least in his prayers-the
honourable gentleman bas net forgotten that
a lot of "us Grits" were left sitting at home
biting our fingernails. But there is no question
about it that after hearing the international
situation explained the other day, we all felt
that the world was in a very serious condition.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: It does not matter what
our political views may be, we are all concerned about seeing that the world gets out
of the present chatic condition in which it
finds itself. and we appreciate the good work
that our delegates did at the conference.
It is to be rcgretted fliat thoughi the lion
and the himb ean lie down together, neither
we ni our representatives can make agreements witi "The Bear that waiks like a Man".
Sw ho sit on the sidclines and watch the
different conferences take place are wondering
just how much longer we should sit back and
quietly alloiw any one particilar power to tell
those who are not in favotr of its policies wha'
it is going to do.
WVe have been sending millions upon millions
of dollars worth of our goods to countries
which support tiîis "great bear" of Russia-to
Poland, for instance. This is both amusing
and expensive. I do not mind assisting sonebody for xwhom I have respect, but it seoins
to me that if Russia lias so much influence
over Poland and sone etlier European
countries that she can control them in peace
cenfereneos at London, Paris. Lake Success
or San Fra:nciso, the Ieast she should do is
pay tlheir bills and fced the ir people.

Surne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
lon. Mr. DUFF: Howevcr, honouraible
enatous, there are sorne briglît spots. Canada
and the United States fou mian years have
led the way in shoaving other countries what
tiwo nations lying sice by side can do. I am
suire thîat vcir body iiist
have been gratified
to read tite di patch which appeared in the
newspa per yesterday. The a:nnounceent in

FEBRUARY 13, N~47
Ottawa and Washington of general approva]
of the continued defence collaboration hetween
Canada and the United States, was received
with the greatest deligbt. The speeches in
connection with greater peace plans between
the two countries were a great contribution
towards the peace of the world.
Canada and the Unitcd States have been
neighbours for the lest one hundred years,
and there has been neither a fort nor a
gunboat along -our border. They have a
cosmopolitan population, made up of peoples
fro.m Europe, Asia and every part of the
'world; yet tbey can live side by side and work
out their problems, whatever they may be, and
stili remain loyal to the principles of peace.
It was a splendid thing to, read, as we. did this
morning, about the decision that bas hean
arrived at in the last two or thrae days between
the governments of Canada and the United
States, whereby thay have pledged themseîves
anew to walk in the paths of peace and set
the lead for every other country in this world.
When we talk about peace between Canada
and the UJnited States, there is but one thing
that I regret, and that is that there is not
enough attention paid to fiscal matters between
the two countrias. If thare is to ha real peace
between any two countries, their trade relations must ha such that both countries will
hanefit and there will ha no had feeling
between them. I hope that it will ha in the
future plans -of world peaca that there will he
no such thing involved as the forty-nin-th or
any other parallel of latitude in reference to
Canada and the United States, and th-at there
will gro-w up hetween the two nations a feeling
that we should do, everytbing possible to
increase the trada betwean thase countries and,
if possible, remove tariffs and other restrictions
altogether.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Suraly my
honourable friand doas not mean free tradel
Hon. Mr. DUFE: As my honou-rable friand
bas asked me that question I will say that I
arn a great believer in tha Churcbill-Roosevelt
doctrine. I remember how proud- I was when
the warships lay off my native land, and
Roosevelt and Churchill got together and
diseussad tha different phases of the war and
decided. on the "Four Freedoms",, one of
whicb, if I remember rightly, was freedorn of
trada. Honourable senators, I believe in free
trade. If I arn the only man i. this country
who doas so, I still beliava in free trade. I
cannot understand why thare should ha any
tariffs betwaen nations. I fac] tbat eacb
nation sbould stand on its own feet and sali
its goods in the most favourabla market, and
huy where it can buy chaapast.

Hon. Mr. DUIFFUS: "No truck nor trade
with the Yankees!"
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I halieve in trade witb
aIl countries.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Tbay did not decide
that at the conference.
Hon. Mr. DUFE: They did not decide it;
they recommanded it.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: That is quite
different from frac trada.
Hon. Mr. DUEF: My honourabla friand
from Peterborough (Hon. Mr. Duffus) bas a
namne that is similar to mine, and I hava been
encheavouring to compromise with him for
several years as to whetber I -hould put the
"ius" in my namne or hae sbould drop it from
bis. My honourable friand, from Winnipeg
(Mr. Haig) certainly should ha a frea-trader.
I say to bim that as far as I arn coneerned I
have always heen in favour of free trade, for
I helieve it is on.ly with such a policy that
a coun'try will avar prosper.
I should like for a moment to discuss somae
of our local problams. In the Speech from
the Tbrone thare was referance to the tax
agreements negotiations tbat bave been carried on wit. certain of the provinces. I arn
flot quite sure, honourable sanators, whetber
tbis is the proper tima to discuss this mattar;
but if wa wait until the governrnent bas introduced legislation and it bas reacbed us, we will
flnd ourselvas in a very ambarrassing position.
I should liRa, therefore, to give rny views now
on what is known as fadaral-provincial relations. If I arn correct, when we were fighting
the Axis powers the faderai authoritias were
considerably worried as to whare they ware
going to get sufficient revenue to carry on that
great flght. I think that during the war years
avaryhody in Canada was inclined to giva the
governaient full power to raise aIl the taxes
possible, and, although it is pretty claarly laid
down in the Britisb North Arnerica Act that
the faderai and provincial authorities would
each have certain taxing powers, in 1941, 1
think it was, the faderai governrnent entered
into a five-year agreement with the provinces,
wharaby it could colleat succession du-ties,
incorne taxes, etc. As I say, everybody at
that time was anxious -to win the war, and
al.though thera was a double succession duty,
as well as othar burdens, we faIt that this was
ail righ.t. But once the war was over, the
question carne up as to whether these agreements should lapse, and -the provinces return
to the posi.tion in which they ware before the
1941 agreement.

REVISED EDITION

SENATE

I suhbinit that, we who Lai e bee summoneil
to this chamber by His Excelleccy the Goercor in Corincil, and, the memhers of acether
place whe Lave heen elected by the people ef
this cun.try front the Atlantic te the Pacific,
are represocntatix es of fedoral epicien. It is
tLe diiity of members cf beth houscs ef pa:rlicnient te sec ILat the fediral autheritv ccd the
fndieraI taxpayers are prolcte ei. Similarilyv it
is the duty of mcmbters of the legisiatures te
look after tlicir respectiv e prov incial interests.
The fedoral authority felt that it should have
a cocference witli the provincial authorities.
In my opinion that w*as a mistake. 1 think
that if it is necessary for the provincial authorities te raise more money te carry on their
ecocomy, they should do se by one means or
another. However, the fact is, that the federal
autlierity decided te try te miake, an agreemnent
witli the provincial authorities. I say with the
"provincial iiutliorities," net with the "provinces," hecause we alil are residents of one or
other cf the provinces. Non adays wvo are
British subjeccP', Canadian citizens, ceie sof
the previnces--and 1 do neot know wliat we are.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Or wlict ne arc nil
lien. Mr. DUFF: Or what ne are net. Bnt
at any rate ivo cli are residents of the provinces, and for thiat reason I amn making a distinction bet.wocn hlie ypîeî meces and the pirovincial authorities.
A meeting between the federal autlîoritv aed
the provincial autherities ivas lîeld, and cfter
figures Lad been presenied te show hon' mchl
moca tLe prov incial autliorities colletcd
frcm succession deties, corporation taxes, p roivincial inronie taxes and se on. the fecral
authority boIt. that the p ovictal authictic s
would ho maiking a good hargain if ic return
for giving up tîte right te lcvy) aIl those taxes
they roceiî cd, a payrnent on the hasis of $10
per hcad of thîcir population. The prov-incial
aut1hcritics, ion cicr, did îlot tliîik that figin
n'as LigLh encegli, ccd tie conferccnce brelo ut).
Afterîvards the dominion autLority carried
on negotiations with some of the provincial
authorities sepcrately, and lîad meetings w'ith
thema separately, and as a result an agreement
n'as arrived at îîith the prov'incial authiorities
of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and New Brunswvick îvlîerchy the federal autlîority would pay
them at the rate of $15 pet head instead of $10.
[loneurable seîaators, if I am looking- at this
thing properly, I cannet sec why there should
be any horsc-trading bctwccn the fa.deral
authority cnd prov'incial cutliorities. If the
dominion geverrcmcnt oivad semething te the
proinLcial govertiments, or ivanted te trade
wiîtli hin in certain taxation fields, c fair

agreement should be made. But I cannot
understand why in these negotiations the ante
should be raised by the federal authority from
$10 to $15 per head in one jump. And that
XOs nlot al. because we find that the federal
authority agreed to pay Saskatchewan flot
only $15 per head of population, but also to
cane a debt of some $44,000,000 and interest
of $16,000,000. In other words, the dominion
agrecd te make Saskatchewan an outrighit
prescrit of S60,000,000.
During tho depression Nova Scotia and the
other Maritime provinces had to raise money
for certain purposes, te take care of unemployment relief and s0 on. Well, we raised
the money ourselves. We did flot corne to the
federal governiment and ask for a gift or a
lban. Why should the federal government now
agÉce te give Saskatchewan $60,000,000, and
give nothing to Nova Scotia, New Brunswick
and Prince Edward Island?
In my opinion these agreements are nothing
te be prend of. 1 noticed that our good friend
the Premier of New Brunswick, who was in
Ottawa and agrood te accept a payment of
$15 per head of the provinco's population,
promnptl 'v boasied on 1iis return te Fredericton
that lie lad made a good bargain with the
federal authority because the provincial gevcrriment would roceive S2,500,000 a year more
than it c0111( have cellected unader the taxes
which it gave up. Let ueý net forget, honourchic senatel-s, that tlieýo agreements arc hotwecn. inccîhers of the ,anie fainily, as iL îvcre.
If I made a hargain withi oneo f my lenourahle
fricnds opposite and ho got the better of me,
tlîat would bo ail righit; but the kind of
bargain that the Premier of New Brun6wick
boasted about is altogethor different.
Fer the benefit cf mv Lonourable friends
frem New Brunswick lot me make it ecear
that 1 have not the slighitcst thing against
tltnt provice. If thece Liad becc soute difficulties betwcon New Brunswick and Maine,
let uis say, and tho Premier of New Brunswick
Liad gene te Washington and made an agreemont under wbich the provincial governiment
would rocoive from United States authorities
a paymont representing an annual profit of
82,500,000 for the province, I would say that
le liad something te boast about. That îvould
ho coi" acd euitside meney. But in this country the federci authority and the provincial
authorities represent one family. We aIl pay
taxes te our respective provincial governments
ancd teflhe fedoral govercmont, and the rosi(lents of -New Brunswick will have te pay back
te the dominion part of the money that they
ceccive from the dominien. That seems te me
te he a i idiculous state of affairs.

FEBRIJARY 13, 1047
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Will the honourable
gentleman say what lie would have done if lie
had been Premier of New Brunswick?
Hon. Mr. DUTFE: I wss neyer premier of
a province, and I do not know that my honourable friend ever was. What I arn trying to say
is--and I arn sorry if I cannot make it clear that the dominion and provincial authorities
represent the one group of people, one family,
as it were. The people who pay taxes to one
or more of the provincial governments pay
taxes also to the dominion government. What
is the sense in taking money out of one of
our pockets, and putting it in another? We
are robbing Peter to pay Paul.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Would the honourable
gentleman permit me to interrupt him? The
premiers of New Brunswick, Manitoba and
Saskatchewan were ready to recommend to
their governments that the dominion's offer
of $15 be accepted.
Then along came a
premier froîn the Pacifie Coast who had five
aces ini his pack.
H[on. Mr. DUFF: I arn coming to that.
Don't spoil rny speech; 1 had trouble enough
getting it ready.
As my honourable friend says, after the
premiers of New Brunswick, Saskatchewan and
Manitoba had agreed to the bargain offered
hy the dominion government, the Premier of
British Columbia carne along, and bie was a
better horse trader than the others. He was
able to go back nnd tell bis people that the
government of British Columbia would get
from the dominion goverument a payment on
the basis of $20 or $21 a head.
Hon. Mr. McKEEN:
British Columbia
gave the dominion more, though.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: 0f course, British Columbia always gives more than any other province.
Hon. Mr. MeKEEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: It is perhaps quite true
that, as my honourp3le friend says, the government of British Columbia gave up a little
more to the federal authority than other provincial goverrnents did, but I do not sce why
one province should be treated differently
from another. My view is that every province
should be treated alike. Anyway, as soon
as it became known that the federal. authority
had agreed to make a payrnent to the British
Columbia authority at $20 or $21 a head,
the premiers of Saskatchewan, Manitoba and
New Brunswick went up in the air and repudiated their agreements. That is the kind
of horse-trading which is being done in this
very important, sp1kere of dominion-provincial
relations. The first bargain was at $10 per

head. That was supposed to be fair, but
for some reason a second bargain was made
at $15 per head. The latest figure agreed upon
bas been $20 or $21. But goodness only knows
huw mudli Mr. Duplessis will get if lie cornes
here to negotiate with the dominion in a
couple of months. He will probably strike
a bargain at $25 a head, and then new agreements will have to be rnade with ail the other
provinces.
Somebody said that the dominion government made this gift of $60,000,000 to thc
Saskatchewan government because the province was poor. I am sure that no0 honourable
gentleman representing Saskatchewan in this
bouse will admit that. I certainily arn not
going to admît that about Nova Scotia, and
I know that my honourable friende from
King's and Queen.'s (Hon. Mr. Sinclair and
Hon. Mr. McDonald) will not admit it about
New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: What does Nova
Scotia want?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I will tell you. Nova
Scotia would like the very tbing that rny
honourable friend objecta to, namely, free
trade. What we wan.t in Nova Scotia is an
expansion of our foreigui trade. We do not
like having aIl our business centralized in
Toronto and Montreal.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: That is a good
come-back.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: How wou Id you
solve the problem?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: What problem?
Hon.
Mr. ASELTINE: The
problem
between 'the provinces and the dominion.
Hon. Mr. DUPE: As I stated wben beginning. under our

cdstitution the

provincial

authorities have certain rights and the federal

autbority bas certain rights. I say that as the
war is now over the dominion and the provinces should once more assume their respective rights. W'hile the war was on it was
perbaps proper for the dominion to say to
the provincial governments, "In, order to carry
on during this national emergency we need
your help." But that situation no longer exists.
Let me put this to my honourable friend.
If bis income last year was $50,000 an, this
year it is $100,000, is hie likely to spend more
this year than lnst year? Is hie more likely to
be extravagant this year? 0f course lie is.
And that holds true of provincial government
expenditures.
If out of moncys from the
federal treasury the provincial governments
are paid a sum ia excess of -their former

SENATE
revenues, tbey ara likely ta hecorne wasteful
and extravagant. 1 say tliat withi the utrnast
respeCct for the governatnents of our provinces.
It is only natural that the more rnoney vou
get t.he more you will spend.
Let mie now refer te sente figures for the
ast five ycars, ta show yen that the provinces
are net se "bard uip".
That the provinces are net, atter ail, se
litard up is indicatcd by thte follewing coinparison of total revenues in 1937 and 1944:
(Thmaisands of dollars)
1937
1944
2,168
1,583

Saskatchewan............
19,146 29.111
Alberta .................
30,573 40,963
British Columibia .........
A province suchi as British Columbia, wbese
revenue Itas jumped. in seven years from
$30,000,000 te $40,000,000, sbeuld not require
any hand-outs from the federal taxpayer who
teday is expecting a reduction and net an
increa.e of taxation. If we are te pay from
tbe federal treasury te the varieus provinces
$150,000,000 more than we shail receive by
taking over certain provincial sources et taxatien, bow are we to reduce tederal taxation?
How arc we over te got back on our feet as
far as the federal econemy is concerned? Se
I say tîtat in my) opinion the wltole system
is a mistake; and while I htave net vory
rnct respect politically for the governments
of Quebec or Ontario, 1 feel tbat tbey are
justified in refusing te enter the new scee,
if tbey can ebtain enoughi revenue otberwise
tô carry on upon their own account. Se far
as the other provinces are concerned, if tbey
are net raising sufficient revenue by their
prosent metltods of taxation, it is tbeir duty
te find some otimer alternative than te resort
te the hard-pressed taxpayers of the tederal
Government-a government wbicb today is
carrying from fifteen te seventeen billions et
dollars et publie debt. I remember that after
public debt was a
1he last war, wlten thte
little over twe billion, ahl et us got grayheaded over it. Now it is between fifteen and
seventeon billion, yet we are asked or are
geing te be asked te, pay eut an additional
125 million dollars te tbe provinces oe r and
above wltat we sîtaîl recoive tbrough taking
over succession duties and other taxes.
I say therefore, hon-ourable senators, that il
is aur duty. as federal representa tives of the
people of this country, te oppose tbis leg.islatien when if cornes before us; and titis, net
because we belong te a certain prov ince, for

in addition to belongin, to a particular prov'ince we bulong to the whole country. It is our
duty, as representatit e- ef the fedýeral aut.herities of this country and, the federal taxpayers,
to sec that no money is givcn out unless the
expenditure is absohtitely n,occssary and fully

1 feci that titis is a ver' serions.matter and
one to whichi we shauld give every consideration. Sa far as 1 arn eoncerned although 1
amrn eady to do anything possible to give the
provinces sueli additional revenue as they need,
and are entitied to-it is my conviction that
if wc gix e any of these provinces a great, deal
more mioney than they receive riow, and substantially more itan they raise from their
ordinary revenues, aiýl that money will bo
spent, and rncuh of it, perhaps, in, ways which
would net be in accord with good business
principles. This is net to say that the provitnal authorities are net honest, or that they
are net sincere, but if any province gets quite
easily say, fit e, ten or fifteen million dollars
from the federall treasury, it will feel at liberty to go ahead and spend that money in any
way it secs fit. 0f course, it may be said',
"Ohi woll. tfiey htave greater responsibilities now
and they need. more money te carry on the
business ef the province." It. seems ta me that
tite fed,ral taxpayer is doing very well se far
as bis obligations te the provinces are concerned. One litas enly te look at the contributions ta old age pensions, te unempleyment
insurance, and, also by way of baby boniusein wltich many people, theugh perbaps net
Itonourable senators. are greatly inte.restcd. It
would be mitch botter eeenomy if the federal

PRIVATE

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN meved the second
reading of Bill D, an Act respecting the
Torante, Harnilton and Buffalo Railway
Company.
Ho saimi: The hioneurable senater fromn
Lincoln (Hon. Mr. Bench) askcd me te give a
briet explanation et this bill on the second
reading.

FEBRUARY 13, 1047
This is a very simple bill, and merely purports to ratify a trust deed issued by the
Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company in favour of the Royal Trust Company as
trustee, securing an issue of $2,000,000 of'notes
of the railway company, and the issue of the
notes under that deed. Apparently there was
some question as to whether under its present
leg'siative powers the raiiway campany had
the right to, issue this particular form of
security, which, I may say, replaces a very
much larger issue of bonds originally issued,
and which have been paid off from time to
time during thc past few years.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: When I was a
railway worker I understood that the New
York Central owned 52 per cent of that railroad and the Canadian Pacifie Railway owned
48 per cent. Could thc honourable scnator
tell us whcther conditions have changed, and
in what respect? Is the company itself getting
the $2,000,000?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I think my honourable friend is right. I arn speaking without
much knowicdge of the matter, but I understand that the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo
Railway Company is owned to the extent of
approximatcly 50 per cent by the New York
Central Railway, and 50 per cent by the
Canadian Pacifie Railway; but it is a corporate
entity of itseif and does its own borrowing.
I might add that I undcrstand tbis is not ncw
rnonçy, but just to refund a vcry much larger
amount of bonds.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The rate is 21 per cent,
and I think the aid rate was 4 per cent.
Hion. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes. It is a very
goad deal.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES.: I have read the bill,
and I note that the trustee is under no obligation whatcver. I understand that this is a
public off ering. If this bill passes througb
parliament, as no doubt it will, it is a guarantee ta the people of this country that it is a
good investment. Arn I correct?
Han. Mr. HAIG: No.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Before I vote for the
1bill I sbauld like a much clearer explanation
of it than we bave had Sa far.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I arn sorry if I was
nat sufflcientily clear for rny *honourable
friend, and I hope I shal 'be able to answer
any questions that he puts.
There is no question here of a guarantee
at alI. This is nat a guarantee by the
Dominion Governme2t or anybody else of the
bonds of this campany; it is merely an
authorization ta the company ta issue these
particular notes.

77

In answer ta the honourable senator's question with reference ta a public issue, I understand that in this case no public issue of these
notes is involved. If my honourable friend will
look, he will sce that the total amount involved is $2,000,000, which matures at the rate
of 8200,000 in ecd of the next ten years.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I read that.
Hon. Me. HUGESSEN: As he knows, publie
institutions such as banks and insurance companies are only tao anxious ta rnvest in shortterm obligations of this kind. I understand
there is no question of any public offering
of this issue at ail.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Would rny honourable friend pardon me again? If the New
York Central owns 52 per cent of thc railroad
and the Canadian Pacifie Railway owns 48 per
cent, where is the backing for this loan- of
$2,000,000 by the Toronto, Harnilton and
Buffalo Raiiway?
Hon. Mr. HJGESSEN: I think the answer
ta my honourable fricnd is simply, as I said
before, that this railway is awned part4y by
thc New York Central and partly by the
Canadian Pacific; but it has a carparate entity,
and it owns its own railroad, its own stations
and -its awn rolling stock. That is thc security
for this loan.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Honourable senators, I
quite agrce that this bs not a guarantce, but
supposing these insurance campanies and other
organizations do not take up this 82,000,000,
and that there are private nestors who want
to invest some rnoney, what position would
they take? Wouid they nlot na.turaily assume,
if the Parliarnent of Canada passes this bil,
that parliament had iooked into ail the particulars of the assets and liahilities of the
company, and aIl that sort of thing, and would
thcy not say ta themselvcs, "This is a gôod
investment, because if it were not, the
Parliament of Canada wouid not bave given
the company the right ta borrow the maney?"
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: The ownership by the
New York Central and the other raiiways maLy
be under a termn lease, on a proportion of
traffie, or something of that kind wbich gives
the original company sonne revenue. That is,
the ownership by these two raiiways rnay nat
involvc control of the total incarne of this
railway. Hence there might be sornething as
betwecn the two.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: What I would like ta
know-I do not thin-k there is much ta it-is,
whether the original company by its charter
had nuthority ta issue notes in the first place?
Also, bad it authority ta borrow ta the extent
of $2,000,000? If these two provisionis were

SENATE
in the original act, alil very well. But if the
authority w as not contained in the original
act, and the company has actually issued the
notes and then comes to us to ratify what it
bas done without authority, that is another
matter. If there was the authority, and if it
extended to an issue in the amount of
$2,000,000, and all that is desired is ratification
of some technical iatters; to that I can see
no objection.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators will bear in mind that I am only the
Charlie McCarthy here. Bergen is sitting right
beside me.
Hon. Mr.
Bergen.

DAVIES:

Let

us hear

fron

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I think I eau
satisfy the three honourable senators who have
spoken. In reply to the honourable senator
from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies), I may say
that I am instructed that the whole of this
issue has been purchased by the Bank of
Montreal, so thero is no question of any
public offering. In the second place, in reply
to the honourable senator from Saint John
(Hon. Mr. Foster); there is no lease; the
Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway owns
its own property. It owns its railway and its
rolling stock. The ownership by the New
York Ccntral and the Canadian Pacifie is
merely a stock ownership: each of these companies owns half the shares. In answer to my
honourable friend from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr.
Leger), I might explain that in 1915 the
Toronto, Hamilton aod Buffalo Railway Company obtained the power to issue bonds or

debentures to a total of $10,000,000.

That

indebtedness was gradually reduced until, a
short time ago, it was a little over $2,000,000.
Then the company wished to refund the
balance by the issuance of these notes, and it
was merely a question of law as to whether
the original authorization gave the power to
issue what were called "notes", instead of
bonds or debentures. I-t is merely to clear
up this matter that the bill is presented.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mi. BENCH moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
He said: Honourable senators, I should like
to say a word of apology for having been
absent from this chamber when Bill D was
being discussed. I was unavoidably delayed.

I wish to thank ny lionourable friend from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) for moving
the second reading on my behalf and explaining the bill on such short notice. I should
also like to thank honourable senators for the
kind con-ideration they have shown in the
questions asked of the honourable senator for
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen).

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS

IN REPLY ADOPTED

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
February 13, the consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's. speech at the
opening of the session, and the motion of
Hon. Mr. McKeen for an address in reply
thereto.
Hon. J. FREDERICK JOHNSTON: Honourable senators, in rising to make a few
observations on the motion before the house,
I desire, first of ail, to offer my congratulations
to the mover (Hon. Mr. McKeen) and the
seconder (Hon. Mr. Bouffard) of the address
in reply. This is, I think, the thirty-first
session of parliament; at which 1 have been
privileged to listen to the speeches made by
the mover and seconder of the address, and I
can assure the bonourable gentlemen who
performed the duty on this occasion that their
speeches cornpared very favourably with those
that I have hieard in the past.
Dealing with the material things of this
country, I find that the income from natural
products in Canada for the year 1945 totalled
811,000,478,000. The net income from farm
products, included in that amount, was
$1,400,000,000, and in this sumn wheat was represcnted by $336,85.1,000.
More than onequarter of the total income from faim
products
industry.

was contributed by the wheat
In view of that record, one need

flot offer apologies or excuses for introducing
in this chamber the subject of wheat, its
growth and marketing. Wîth permission of
honourable senators I shahl deal with the
matter for a few minutes.
Honourable senators know that an agreement between the United Kingdom and Canada bas recently been entered into. It bas
aroused considerable controversy on the part
of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange. Exception
bas been taken to the ternis of that contract
on the ground that the price is too low. The
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
dealt witb this matter a few days ago.

The Family Herald and Weecly Star, of
Montreal, published on November 20, 1946, an
article headed "Paging Mr. Gardiner."
I
shall not weary honourable senators by reading the wbole article, but will quote only a
couple of paragrapbs from the end of the
editorial:
We have differed from Mr. Gardiner on occasion, but in our opinion he knows more about
the wheat business as a whole-its growing and
marketing, its polities and its economics, its
position at home and abroad, than any man in
Canada. We believe that if bis plans, and the
broad aims of the Federation of Agriculture are
to resist criticism and objection, they should get

81

together with the Department of Trade and

Commerce and the Wartime Prices and Trade
Board, and re-examine the whole wbeat situation.
And, just as important as this re-examination,
will be a plain, clear statement of the case by
Mr. Gardiner himself, meeting objections, gîving
reasons for the price differentials and showing

that the present plan, or some adaptation of it,
is the best that can ha devised for Canada.

A copy of the agreement between this
country and the United Kingdom appeared
as an appendix to the Senate Hansard of July
25, 1946.
As to the prices to be paid for the wbeat,

we find on page 3 of the agreement these
provisions:
2. (a) The price per bushel to be paid by
the United Kingdom Government to the Canadian Goverroment, on the basis Number One
Manitoba Northern, in store Fort William/Port
Arthur, Vancouver or Churchjill, shahl be as
follows:
W1 In respect of wbeat bought and sold in
the crop year 1946-47, $1.55.
(ii) In respect of wheat bought and sold in
the crop year .1947-48, el.55.
(iii) Jo respect of wheat bougbt and sold in
the crop year 1948-49, not lais than $1.25.

(iv) 'I respect of wheat bought and sold in

the crop yaar 1949-50, not less than $1.

Hon. Mr. HORNER; Excuse me, please.
That is at Fort William, not at the farm?
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: I said it was at
Fort William and Port Arthur.
I point out that before this agreement was
made the Government of Canada set 81.35 a
bushel as an initial payment to the farmer
on his whcat for the crop years 1945 up to
July 31, 1950.
The agreement further reads:
The actual prices to be paid for wheat to be
bought and sold wiýthin the crop year 1948-49
shall be negotiatad and settIed between the
Unitad Kingdoma Government and the Canadian
Govarnmant ot later than the 3lst Decamber,
1947-

That is, on the 3lst of December this year
the price is to be negotiated and set for the

crop of 1948-49.
-and the price for the crop yaar 1949-50 shaîl
ha negotiated and sattled not later than the 31st
Decembar, 1948.
In determining the pricas-

This is very important.
-for these two crop yaars, 1948-49 and 1l949-50,
the United Kingdom Government will have
regard to any diffarence batween the prices paid
under this agreement in the .1946-47 and 1947-48
crop years and the world prices for wheat in
1946-47 and 1947-48 crop years.
That simply means, honourable senators,
that on or bafore December 31 this year the
price of wheat in the open market will be
taken into consiieration in fixing the price
for the crop year 1948-49.

SENATE
In explaining the provisions of the agreement. tie Rigt Ilonourable Mr. Gardiner
stated, at a meeting in Montreail:
There are three special provisions of tie
contract which deserve special mention. The
first is that which provides that Britain can
dispose of wheat to others. That is necessary
so that quantities disposed of for a price to
prevent hardship cannot be considered a breach
of faith or contract. Britain requires 200,000,000
bushels for her own use. It stands to reason
she is not goiisg to sell any portion of the 160,-

000,000

bushels she gets froi

us and go into

the world mairiket to buy more.
The second is that if multilateral arrangements are made to which the two governments
are parties, tise terms of that arrangement
suipersede this commercial contract. As a matter of fact plans are being discussed at Washington at tic moment. Canada is ready to offer
similar contracts to other countries who want
our wheat, and discussions have been held witb
at least five other countries.
The third is the important one from tie
point of view of those who are impressed by
the argument of the Grain Exchange. In their
advertisements they ask this definite question,
"What guarantee have you that because you
accept the lower price now you will get a

higier price later?" My answer is this provision in the contract:
"In determining tise price for these two crop
years 1948-49 and 1949-50, the United Kingdom
Goverument will have regard to any difference
between the prices paid under this agreement
in the 1946-47 and 1947-48 crop years and the
world prices for wheat in tie 1946-47 and 194748 crop years."

Hon. Mr. EULER: May I ask my Ionourable friend a question? I think he said that
in December of this year there shall be
negotiated an agreementHon. Mr. JOHNSTON: December 31 this
year.
Hon. Mr. EULER: -in which the world
price shall be taken into consideration.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: In setting the price
for the crop year 194849.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Very well. It is quite
conceivable that the negotiators might not
arrive at an agreement. What happens if they
do not agree?
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: We shall have to
leave that to them. I believe that so far,
they have always been able to reach an
amicable agreement.
Mr. Gardiner continued:
The Grain Exchange says in their advertising. "There is no guarantee at ýall, and don't let
anybody tell you anything to the contrary. It
isn't true.'
All I caî say in reply is that I personally
diseussed tise matter with the British officials
and their minister. They are agreed that we
are entitled to have possible,losses in the first
two years made up in tie last two. They have

so stated in the contract. I have at least as
higi a regard and respect for tie word of the
Britisi Governmsent as I have for that of tise
Grain Exciange, and I know the western farmers have a much higher regard for the British
Governiment, whatever party heads it.
The Family Herald and Weekly Star, in an
editorial on December 25, 1946, after Mr.
Gardýiner had been to Montreal and made a
speech, states as follows:
The Famsily Herald felt that. owing to the
attacks made on the Government's wheat policy
by various organizations and individuals interested in the grain trade, a re-examination of
this matter of Canadian wheat exports and
It felt also that the
prices siould be made.

Honourable Mr. Gardiner could give that
answer better than anybody else in Canada.
Speaking in Mositseal recently, before a big
meeting of the Agricultural Institute of Canada, and quoting froin the Family Herald editorial, and froin tise leaflets and advertisements
suggesting that Canadian grain growers are
being unfairly dealt with, Mr. Gardiner gave a
full examination of the w-iole subject, which is
printed verbatim elsewhere in this issue. His
audience was a mixed one of technical agriculturists, prominent farmers, feed manufacturers,
grain trade men, and others interested in the
processing and distribution of farm products.
The Famoily Herald hopes everyone will read the

Minister's admirable explanation of the subject.
It has tie advantage of being thorough, complete
and authoritative. It hardly matters whether
tic reader agrees with all of it or not; he should
study it, and, if permanently interested in the
subject, keep it as a reference. Apart from the
clear sumnary of the whole matter of Canada's
wheat contract, we particularly commend to
interested farmers Mr. Gardiner's frank treatment of statements made in the attacks on the
regarding comparative
government's policy
prices for Canadian, Australian, Argentine and
other wheat."
A little further on it says:
The Fanily Herald has always supported the
Federation of Agriculture in its broad approval
of the present Government wheat policy, and a
clear understanding of the reality of the Canadian farmer's position, as compared with the

Australian or Argentine farmer's, shows that
not only is Western Canada's chief industry
being guaranteed some measure of stability, but
that, even at this point of peak world open
market prices, the Canadian wheat grower is

getting a square deal.
The Minister of Trade and Commerce, in a
statement given to the press in Ottawa on
December 6 last, had this to say:
It bas been contended that Canadian producers should eitier receive the full export price
now or at least a higher minimum price than
the $1.35 which bas been guaranteed to July 31,
1950. Fundamental te our own wheat poicy is
the expressed desire of producer organizations
not to take advantage of high export prices
temporarily, only to be confronted with much
lower prices when wheat is again in surplus. As
an initial step in providing price stability, the
Canadian Government concluded with the
United Kingdon Government a four-year contract. While the contract did not provide a

MARCH 5, 1947
complete guarantee of prices and market within
this period, the Canadian Government at some
risk to the treasury establisbed the initial -advance of $1.35, effective from August 1, 1945,
and continuing to July 31, 1950. No other
government has assured its producers s0 high a
minimum advance for so long a period.
Despite wbat happened in Western Canada
'n a by-election, 1 think that, if the farmers
of Western Canada were fully advised as to
the terms of this agreement, there would have
been a different story.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Would the honourable gentleman permit me to ask him a question? Does he know that on Monday of this
week the price of wheat for export to countries
other than Great Britain went up to $2.72?
Hon. Mi. JOHNSTON: Yes. I do.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: How is the farmer
going to get back the difference between
$1.55 and $2.72, that is $1.17 a bushel,' on the
wheat exported to, Great Britain? Is the
farmer not going to lose that money?
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: Does my honourable friend wish to ask a question or to make
an argument?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I arn simply asking
how the farmer is going to get that money.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: I say to my honourable friend that one of the worst tbings that
can happen to the western wheat producers
is the establishment of very high prices at
certain times. We had that experience when
the party to, which my honourable friend
belongs was in office. We had high prices for
wheat one year, but the following year that
price was cut in two. After the last war
farmers went abead and boughit land at
inflated prices of $50 to, 875 an acre. My
honourable friend knows what happened to
that land: it reverted to the original owners.
At times fiuctuating high prices are not good
for western agriculture. As I have stated, on
December 31 this year the government wilI
negotiate witb the British government for the
supply of wheat next year on the basis of the
world prices. That is a term of the contract.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: May I ask a question? How can the government negotiate
with Great Britain if there already is a contract with that country?
Hon. Mr. EULER: The contract says that
shaîl be done.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: I arn sorry, but I
did not follow my friend's question.
The big wheat producing countries have
been trying for years to get an international
wheat agreement that would stabilize the

83

price both to the farmer and the consumer. A
draft of such an agreement was made only
a few weeks ago at Washington, by the
International Wheat Council, for consîderation at the International Wheat Conference
to be held at London, this month, and a
copy was tabled in the House of Commons
by Mr. MacKinnon, the Minister of Trade
and Commerce. At the meeting of tbýe
International Wheat Council representatives
of Canada, Australia, Argentina. and the
United States -at around a table. They recommended that 81.25 and 81.55 a bushel for No.
1 Manitoba Northern be set as the basic minimum and maximum export prices in an
agreement for the next four or five years. That
is pretty well in line witb the prices under
the agreement we have with the United Kingdom. As those prices were proposed by
representatives of the wbeat producing
countries who had before tbem. tbe relevant
facts in the hîstory of wheat for the past few
decades, it would appear that the price fixed
in the agreement with tbe United Kingdom
is a fair one.
Another recommendation of the Council was
that Canada be given 40 per cent, or 200,000,000
bushels, of the basic 500,000.000 bushels world
export market; Argentina, 25 per cent, or
125.000,000 bushels; Australia. 19 per cent, or
95.000,000 bushels, and the United States 16
per cent, or 80,000,000 bushels.
In bis speech of February 5 the honourable
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) criticized
the government's agriciiltural policy. I am
reading from page 21 of the Senate Housard:
To my mind its whole policy indicates a f orgetf ulness of the fact that agriculture, and especially farm agriculture, is the basic industry of
our couîntry. I do not believe the goverument
has ever given that industry the rights that it

ouglît to have.

Honourable senators, I amn going to point
out a few tbings that this government bas
done. The agreement about which I have
been speaking is one thing; there have been
others. A statute known as the Prairie Farm,
Assistance Act bas brought great relief and
assistance to the wbeat producers of Western
Canada.
Yu.ring tbe war period the government introduced the Prairie Farmn Income
Act and the Wheat Acreage Reduction Act.

Tbe total amount of money paid, to the
western wbeat producers under these three
statutes amounted to 8168,720,697. I tbink
that answers my friend's statement that this
government bas been forgetting or neglecting
western agriculture. As to production, I tbink
a record of the results is the best proof of

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: You are getting an

Hon. Mr. JOENSTON: I shall be glad ta
have my honourable friend's campany.
The getting together of parties reminds me,
honourable senators, of what happened in this
country back in the year 1911. 1 amn aId
enough ta remember that.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Are you?
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: Yes, and sa is my
friend.
I think the repudiation of the reciprocity
agreement in 1911 was a bad deal for everybody, and set this country back many years.
I suggest ta honourable senators that if we
had done aur part in putting that contract
through, Western Canada would have had
double the population that it has today. But
the agreement was rejected. I recaîl the election campaigns of 1911 and following years,
and the eloquent speeches made by some
honourable members. I could mention one
gentlemnan now in this chamber who made very
effective speeches in support of the agreement.
1 suggest, honourable senators, that there is
a get-together between the party of aur
friends opposite and the Social Credit party.
We know that certain men high in the organization of the Conservative party visited the
city of Edmonton a few weeks ago-to be
exact, the week of January 20-and the Tory
party was buried, put out of existence, in
that province. What does that mean?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE : Wîill my honourable friend explain the statement we so frequentiy -sce in the press, that Mr. Coldweli
has been approached-not officially, but
unofficialiy approached-to succeed Mr. Mackenzie King?
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: Probably Mr. Coldweli is doing something ta raise the value of
his stock. But I can assure my honourabie
friend that there is na get-together between
the Liberal party and the C.C.F.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
though there were.

Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: I now assert that
the Conservatives elected tbe present C.C.F.
Gox erninent of Saskatchewan in the year
1944. 1 repeat, in the hearing of my two
friends across the way from the province of
Saskatchewan, that Tory votes put the C.C.F.
in power in Saskatchewan. Why do I say
that ?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Goodness knows.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: We thought anything
would be better than what we had. 1 can tell
the senator that.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: I arn glad to get
that admission-for it is an admission-from
my honourable friend. One who lives for
years in a small district gets to know people
pretty we]l. When you have been in .politics
for some time you can tell how people are
voting. In the election of 1944 I along with
other men, who knew the vaters just as well
as I did, checked the list of my own home
poli. We could not find more than about
forty C.C.F. votes, and we conceded the party
some doubtful ones. When, the polis closed
and the votes were counted there were
seventy-three C.C.F. votes. We thought that
the poil officiais had made a mistake, as in
our opinion there could not be so many
C .C.F. votes in that poil. The next day we
heard of this and that Conservative having
voted for the C.C.F. candidate. But the proof
came in the Dominion elections one year after,
when instead of seventy-three C.C.F. votes in
that poil there were only forty-three. This
showed that in the 194. election thirty Conservatives had voted C.C.F. A.pparently they
were willing ta do anything to put a Liberai
government out of office.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: They may have
been Liberals.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: They were not
Liberals.
.Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The Liberals in

necessary during tlie war and played an important part in keeping things stable throughout
the Dominion and in helping to achieve
victory. The Minister of Trade and Commerce, Who knows something about the subject.
stated, as reported in the Ottawa Journal of
February 18, that "without export controls
Canada would soon be denuded of essential
goods." H1e was speaking on the second reading of a bill authorizing continuation of
certain controls. The Government, lie said,
planned Vo remove the export controls from
goods as quickly as possible. However, the
bill would give the cabinet power to deal with
export and import controls during the next
year. He added that export controls were
nee-ded Vo help tlie Dominion 611l its United
Kingdom contracts and to direct goods Vo
needy area.s under international agreement.
Import controls were as necessary as controls
on' exports.
Here are the views of a labour mani. A
few days after the speech of my honourable
friend, Mr. Pat Conroy, Secretary-Treasurer
of the Canadian Congress of Labour, made
a statement, which wns reported in the Ottawa
Journal of February 7. The report stated,
among other things:
lHe concluded by sayiog that liigher prices
mean f ewer buyers and, in turn, surplus of goods
and less employment. The government sliould
baIt Vhis course now.
My honourabie friend the leader on the
other sida takes exactly the opposite view.
LI bis statement lie asserted that the sooner
we did away with controls the quicker we
wvould get back Vo mass production.
LI an article headed "A Success for Mr.
King", the Halifax Chronicle lia Vhis Vo say:
Control relaxation je ýail a matter of timing
and of degree. The Prime Minister lias declar.ed
it the policy of lis government Vo keep Vo the

circumestances warrant. This plan hitherto lias
noV kept prices precisely where we shouid like
to see them, but it býas maintained better conditions in Canada, on the whle, than may lie
f ound in any other country.
The Halifax Chronicle, I arn informed, is
not a Liberal publication.

lie said:
I know it is customnary Vo denounce controls

Vo criticize the administration of Vue controts,
but at Vhis moment wlien we are emerging from

our tremendous war effort and going through
an almost unbelievably successf ni transition
!rom war to peace, there is flot a business maxn
in Canada who in hie heart of hearts does not
believe that one of the outstanding accomplishments of the government has been the controlling of prices in order that there miglit not
bie a boom and a coilapse such as followed the
lest war.
The more a man bas been engaged in business,
the more lie has to lie thankful for in that
respect. I know that; controls are unpopuiar,
ýthat the government lias been criticized and
ridiculed because of them, but I bel jeve honourable senators will agree that when we get a
proper perspective we realize that nothing contributed more to the success of our war effort
and to a souud basis for the future success of
our country ýthan those very controls. Business
af Ver business and indnstry after industry in
this country can tliank their stars that controis were majntained.
I agree with these words, as I think the
majority of the Canadian people do.
My bonourahle friend the leader opposite
did not think enougli was being donc to

about Vhis. Although I should like to deal
with this topic IIow, I have taken up so mucli

Fr=m the point of view of the selfish interests

I should like ta rcad. the entire statement,
but it svouid take too long. Further on Mr.
Bracen says:

purely seitish grounds. Tihe money sviii be spent

point of view...

The present Prime Minister af Canada was
told tîsat lie lîad been a gond leader in peace

not be a good wvartime leader. Everything

halding office today and, supported by the
confidence of the Canadian people, wvill do a
good job in returning Canada ta a peacetime

Hon. Mr. HORNER: The honourable senatar miglht bave mentionod Mr. Raiston and
Mr. Power, wba are flot in the government

On April 16, 1946, at page 964 of Ilansard,
Mr. Bracken. is quoted as follows:

That is xvbat Mr. Bracken tbinks, but the
leader opposite in tisis bouse tbinks almost
the opposite to that.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: I do not think you are
.Iustified in drawing- tîsat conclusion froma tbe
observations made by the leader an this sîde
of tIse bouse.

Hon. Mr. QUINN: I heard wbat you said
and I do nlot think your conclusion is justified.
Hon. MVr. JOIINSTON: I do nlot know
bow my honourable friend can draw any other
conclusion from the speech of bis leader than
that bie does not regard the boan favourably.
Honourable senators, I have already spoken

ane furtiser matter that I should like ta mention. At the beginning af the war there was

Han. Mr. JOHNSTON: Is my friend asking
a question?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: You omitted to mention tn'o former mombers of the government,
Mr. Raiston and Mr. Pow'er.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Honourable senators, I
did not cnme bore today prepared ta address
the hause. We bave listened ta a fine palitical speech by the bonourable member for
Central Saskatchsewan (Hon. Mr. Jobnston).
eo is an old parliamentarian, and I have a
great deal of regard for him. He and I are
old friends, but I cauld not failon' lim. in
anme of bis statements. One of tîsese was ta
the effect tbat in 1911 the peopleo f Canada
made a decision whiicb did inestimable barma
ta tîsis country.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, biear.
Han. Mr. QUINN: An bonaurable gentleman ta the left of me says "Rear, bear.' Weii
the isonourable member fram. Contrai Saskatchewan bias others in the bouse and cbamber wbo agreo witb that opinion.
Wbile my honaurable friend n'as speaking
I wondered if hoe thouglit that Canada's action
in 1911 liad anytbing n'batever ta do witb the
legislation of Congress in tise twenties wben
it imposed the Fordney-McCumber tariff, and
in 1930 n'hen it put through the HnwieySmoot tariff, w'bereby this country n'as abat
out of United States miarkets. Honourable
members n'ilI rocail that we svore prevented
frcmn exporting ta that country a poand or a

MARCH 5, 1947
dollar's worth of any of our products. Those
are some of the things that entered my mind
when the honourable gentleman was talking
about ail the good which according to him,
was accomplished in this country by the Liberal party. I do flot blame hima for saying
what he did, for lie is a good supporter and
follcwer of that party.
But let us be fair. I ask onIy that we be
fair; I ar nfot a partisan. 1 wish to be
friendly, and 1 arn able to see 'the other feliow's point of view and deal with a question
fairly, and argue with hima if he desires to
argue a point. Let us go back to the year
1930, when we did not have a trade treaty
with any country in the world, when we were
not exporting a dollar's worth of the products
of Canada, when the government changed and
the Conservative party came into power.
What did they have wben they came into
power? They came into power with one of
the worst legacies that has ever been kn'own
in the political history of this country. There
was a depleted treasury, and Canada did not
have a trade treaty with any country in the
world. The then Prime Minister, now Viscount Bennett, had an almost insurmountable
task before him. We know the difficulties
that were encountered in attempting to
arrange the Empire trade agreements. Mr.
Bennett was howled down in Great Britaîn,
and bis proposais were referred to by one of
the British ministers as "humbug." However
lie persisted in bis attempts for an Imperiai
Conference, until lie was successful in having
it held here in Ottawa in the year 1932.
Up to that time our trade had completely
vanished. As lie said, we had to tighten our
beits and reduce our incomes. He even eut
by 10 par cent the incomes of members of
parliament and civil servants, for which action
lie was condemned afterwards. But lie had
no alternative. Nothing was coming into the
coff ers. so sometbing had to be done. He was
suecessful in having the Empire trade agreements ratified in Ottawa in 1932, and from
then on the trade in Canada increased until.
Mr. Bennett went out of power, in 1935, when
it was in a pretty good condition. I say these
tbings merely to keep the record straiglit and
to be fair to the party of which I have always
been proud to be a follower.
The honourable gentleman from Centrai
Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Johnston) placed
upon the shoulders of the Conservative party
the responsibility for the number of political
parties we have in this country at the present
time. Under the administration of the Liberals there has been developed- the C.C.F.
party, the Bloc Populaire, the Liberal Progressives, and a party just recently formed,

the Union des Electeurs. The Conservative
party bas had nothing to do with the creation
of these parties.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: I know my honourable friand wishes to be fair, and I can tell
him that lie will not flnd in my remarks a
statemant that bis party bas increased the
number of political parties in Canada.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: But I think the honourable gentleman placed on us responsibility
for the existence of the C.C.F. party.
Hon. Mr'. JOHNSTON:
I charged the
Conservatives with the responsibiiity of
clecting the . C.C.F. government in my
province, and I stand by that statement.
NIon. Mr. QUINN: My honourable friend
was, I think, a member of the House of
Commons in 1926, as was also the honourable
member from Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard)
and sorne others. 1 was a member at that
time and 1 recall we had a most interesting
session. The Liberal party, of which the
honourable senator (Hon. Mr. Jolinston) was
a inembar, carried on for six months witb
101 members. I ask him if ha can recail
by whose good offices bis party was kept
in power for six months. It was the C.C.F.,
Labour, the United Farmers and ail the
cosmopolitan groups that were in the bouse
at that time who kept the Liberal party in
power. I do not think lie is fair in placing
the responsibility for the încreased number of
partips in this country upon tbe shoulders of
the~ Conservative party. It would be botter
for Canada if we bad no third party but
carried on under the old systemn witb only
the Liberal and Conservative parties as we
did froma Confederation down to the twentîes.
Under that systemn if the people of this
country were not satisfied with the government
of one party thoy couid always turn it out
and put in the other. Both parties were
comprised of responsible citizens-men. of
bigli calibre, higli standing, patriotic, loyal
and devoted to their country. Whula they
diffcred, the Liberals fromn the Conservatives,
ail wpre loyal and true-blooded Canadians.
It is a pity tbat we are deveioping in this
colintry so many smaller. groups wbo are
hecoming only a menace to the political life
of Canada.
That is ail I wish to say. I mereIy wanted
to keep the matter straiglit and correct a few
impressions that the honourable gentleman
tried. to convey.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
The Address was adopted.

This arnendment would delete the followin
paragraph:
(a) "Expert" means send out of Canada or
out of one province te another province.
This definition of "expert" wvould broaden tbe

but eut cf one province into another. Some
bonourable members of tbc committee thought
that a trade barrier between previnces- was

POLITICAL PARTIES IN CANADA
ALLEGED INACCURACY

Hon. J. FREDERICK JOHNSTON: Honourable senators, I rise on a question of privilege te correct something that was said
yesterday by my honourable friend from
Bedford-Halifax (Hon. Mr. Quinn). The
honourable gentleman used these words:
The honourable gentlemen from Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Johnston) placed upon the
shoulders of the Conservative party the responsibility for the number of political parties we
have in this country at the present time.
The remarks I made yesterday do not bear
out that assertion.
My friend went on to say:
Under the administration of the Liberals
there has been developed the C.C.F.Hon. Mr. HAIG: Mr. Speaker, I rise on a
point of order. The honourable gentleman has
no right to correct the senator from BedfordHalifax (Hon. Mr. Quinn), who is quite capable of correcting bis own remarks, if necessary.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: A point of order,
Mr. Speaker. The honourable gentleman from
Bedford-Halifax made the statement that
the C.C.F. party came into being under
Liberal rule.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Order, order!
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Under the rules the
honourable gentleman could have raised that
point while the debate was in progress, but
he cannot do so now.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
gentleman has a right to raise a point of
order, but not to debate it.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: My honourable
friend continuedSome Hon. SENATORS: Order, order!
Hon. Mr. HAIG: You cannot do that.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: My honourable
friend's statement is not in accordance with
the facts, and I have a right to correct it.
The other statement is thisHon. Mr. HAIG: I must rise again to a
point of order. The honourable gentleman
cannot answer another member's speech in
this way.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: I suggest, on a
point of order, that any member bas the
right to correct a mis-statement of this kind.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, no.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Hansard has not
yet been distributed, and what was said yesterday is not before us.

91

Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: Oh, yes.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: We must wait.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: Hansard has been
distributed, Mr. Speaker. I have a copy in
my hand. The other statement I wished to
correct was thisHon. Mr. HAIG: Mr. speaker, I rise to a
point of order. Clearly, if the honourable
gentleman has the right te do this, I have
the right to take his speech and go over it
word for word and answer it myself. If he
desires me to do that, I will do it.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: And I have the right
to make another speech.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Surely. The honourable
senator bas no right te make an alleged correction in another member's remarks. The time
te have challenged the remarks was while the
debate was going on. It is too late now.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Believe me, I will tell
the honourable gentleman something.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: I am sure my
honourable friend from Bedford-Halifax (Hon.
Mr. Quinn) will agree, because this is a statementSome Hon. SENATORS: Order.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
senator is raising a question of privilege. I
have net seen yesterday's issue of Hansard te
which he refers; before I came in I was told
that it was net yet available. He is calling
attention te certain statements which he says
are erroneous. I think that if the statements
are not in accordance with the facts he is
within his rights.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Mr. Speaker, I beg te
appeal your ruling. I will ask for a division
of the house on that issue. I beg te move,
seconded by the honourable senator from West
Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. 'Aseltine),
that your ruling be not concurred in.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The senator has
raised a point of order and a question of
privilege. He indicates that certain statements
made by an honourable member opposite are
net according te the facts. It is that te which
he is calling attention.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He cannot do that.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: He has that
privilege.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I have made a motion. I
appeal your ruling, Mr. Speaker, and I ask
for a division on it; because if it is permissible
te do what the honourable gentleman is

SENATE
attempting to do, there would be no end to
debate in this house. This is not a case of an
honourable member being accused of misdemeanor or something like that. I read the
statement of the honourable member from
Bedford-Halifax (Hon. Mr. Quinn), and all
that is involved just now is a difference of
opinion as to the effect of it. I may think the
statcment of an bonourable senator opposite
is incorrect, but I cannot raise a point of
order on that.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Will the honourable
senator quote the rule on the point he has
raised?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The point is clear. Vote
to sustain the Speaker's ruling if you believe
it is riglit.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I am not disputing
the honourable senator's point of view, but I
should like to know the basis of it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The rule is that a member
may rie in bis place and correct a statement
that he him-elf made, or answer a charge
dealing with his personal integrity or honesty.
He may quote or criticize something that
another member bas said, but he cannot correct it.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, I
suggest that all that it is necessary to say
in regard (o tbis matter has been said, and it
seens bardly worth while to divide the bouse
on so simple an issue.
The honourable
gentleman from Central Saskatchewan (Hon.
Mr. Jonston), has, I believe, completed the
remark
bthat he wished to make.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But the Speaker has
made a ruling which I (1o not want to have
stand, bccause it would make for unending
debate in this house. I believe the Speaker
is wrong, and that is why I have protested
again-t the ruling. Even after the ruling the
honourable member from Central Saskatchewan went on talking as thougli be had the
right to (o so. That is why I appealed. Had
be sat down I would not have said a word.
Hon. Mr. COPP: He is sitting down now.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I have not made
a definite ruling, but I have indicated that
the senator has the right on a question of
privilege to call attention to what took place
in the debate. But the matter is not debatable
and the discussion should not be continued. I
believe an
member ha the right to call
attention, on a question of privilege, to statements made in a debate.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I will withdraw my
motion.
The motion was withdrawn.

MILITIA PENSION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. B. COPP moved the second reading of Bill 5, an Act to amend the Militia
Pension Act.
He said: I have asked the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) to
explain this bill.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators, this is a bill of minor importance, designed
to take care of two small errors which crept
into the Militia Pension Act. It will extend
the provisions of the act to protect the rights
of a snall number of persons in two particular
cases. There are only two sections in the bill.
The first section applies to fifteen naval ratings
who, during the war, accepted or were given
the rank of acting warrant officer and as a
result lost certain pension rights to which they
wcre entitled as enlisted men. They have
continued as acting warrant officers, but will
revert to the rank of men, and this amendment is designed to preserxe for them the pension rights to which that rank entitles them.
The second section of the bill deals with
pension rigbts of menbers of the permanent
forces who served previously in the nonpermanent active militia or non-permanent air
force or any of the auxiliary services of the
navy. Under the statute as it now stands any
men who are appointed to the permanent
forces after the 1st of April, 1946, are credited
for penion purposes with one-quarter of the
length of time they served in a non-permanent
force. The object of the amendment is to
extend that privilege to members of the
permanent force who were appointed before
the 1st of April, 1946. I am informed that
the amnodment would apply to only a very
small nomber of persons.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Honourable senators,
thoe of us who sit in the far ends of this
house have difficulty in hearing what is spoken
byx any one from the middle of the chamber.
I do not know one word that was said by the
lonourable member who has just taken his
scat. I understand that he was explaining a
hil. but I am unaware what that bill is. I am
sure it is not desired that a number of us
should sit here as "dummies". We should
like to hear what is said, and I would ask, as a
favour, that whben an honourable member is
speaking he endeavour to make himself heard
all over the house.
The motion was agreed to and the bill was
iead the second time.

MARCH 6,1947
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Unless my honourable friend from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Dupuis)
wishes to wait until he has had an opportunity to read my remarks, with the leave of
the house I would move that the bill be read
the third time now.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: I have no objection.
I am simply asking, as a favour, that an lioncurable member who speaks from the centre
of the chamber raise his voice so that lie can
be heard by everyone present. When my
honourable friend from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) was speaking I did not even know
what bill was under consideration.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: We can hear the honourable gentleman from Rigaud (Hon. Mr.
Dupuis) -pretty well.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
FERTILIZERS BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. A. B. COPP moved the second reading of Bill 9, an Act to amend the Fertilizers
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable gentleman from King's (Hon.
Mr. McDonald) to explain this bill.
Hon. JOHN A. McDONALD (King's):
Honourable senators, this bill contains six
amendments to the Fertilizers Act. The first
five have to do with the percentages of the
different ingredients entering into the production of fertilizers, the object being to bring
the act into line with present day practice.
I do not believe that anything in these first
five amendments should evoke discussion here
on the motion for second reading. I hope that
if the motion is passed the bill will be sent
to the Standing Committee on Natural
Resources, where these sections could be
studied in detail in the presence of representatives of the fertilizers division of the
Department of Agriculture.
Section 6, however, is in a different class.
It seeks to continue the wartime control regulating quality and composition of fertilizers
offered for sale. During the war years the
regulating was done in co-operation with fertilizer boards established by the provinces,
and it is feared that unless this practice is
continued the quality of fertilizers sold to
farmers may seriously deteriorate. The chief
reason for continuing this control is that the
principal ingredients for fertilizers, such as
potash, are in short supply. As has been said
here by others, no one likes controls. Certainly farmers, who are individualists, do not
like them. I believe that we should get rid

93

of controls as soon as it is in our best interest
to do so, but so long as there is a shortage of
fertilizer ingredients such as potash I feel it
is important that the controls on them should
be continued.
During the war the fertilizer council boards
across Canada gathered much information that
was of great help to the federal Department
of Agriculture and to the minister in carrying
on control work. It is only fair to those
fertilizer boards to say that they did a magnificent job. When there were critically short
supplies of nitrates, phosphates and potash
these boards helped farmers very materially by
arranging as fair a distribution of these
ingredients as cou'ld be made.
Unfortunately up to the present time potash
lias not beep manufactured in Canada. All
that we use lias to be imported, and from
what we know at present it appears safe to say
that this year our supply will be ten thousand
tons short of our requirements. To illustrate
the need for control I will take the case of
an orchard farmer, who may use a fertilizer
composed of nine parts of nitrates, five parts
of phosphates and seven parts of potashin other words, what is known as a 9-5-7 mixture. Some orchardists might wish to increase
the proportion of potash in the mixture, but if
they were allowed to do so it might mean that
potato producers would be unable to obtain
sufficient of this chemical to meet their needs.
I hope honourable senators will agree that
the control should be maintained while the
shortages continue. I know it is in the mind
of the government of the day to get rid of all
controls as early as possible, and I personally
would trust the Minister of Agriculture to dispense with the control on fertilizer ingredients
as soon as lie thinks it is in the general interest
to do so. However, if honourable senators
agree to a second reading today and the bill
goes to committee, it may be decided there
that in the general interest of al- concerned
a time lirmit should be placed on this control.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: I am not sure
that it is necessary to specify a time limit.
Honourable
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE:
senators, by and large I am quite in favour
of the bill with the exception of section 7
which has just been mentioned by the honourable gentleman from King's (Hon. Mr. McDonald).
An Hon. SENATOR: Section 6.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I should like ta
deal with that section a little later. I understand that for some considerable time we
have had a wartime fertilizer advisory

SENATE
committee. This committee was set up to
advise the administra.tor during the war period
and to guide him by making certain suggestions and recommendations. I believe I am
correct in stating that it was at the request
of the committee jthat companies manufacturing fertilizer offered fourteen detailed suggestions for the revision of the Fertilizers
Act. The proposed changes, intended to bring
the act into conformity with current practices
and, in some cases, clarify its wording, were
subsequently recommended by the committee
to the administrator. To the farmer and the
industry the most important of these recommendations was that the plant food content
of combined fertilizers be increased frorn the
minimum of 14 per cent as now required by
the act to 22 to 24 per cent. Bill No. 9, as
passed in another place has taken these
recommendations into consideration and increased the content to approximately 20 per
cent. In my opinion, honourable senators,
that is a very definite improvement.
The bill in its present form incorporates
most of the suggested revisions and, if passed,
would improve the act from the viewpoint
of the government, the farmer and the fertilizers industry. However, section 7 of Bill
9An Hon. SENATOR: Section 6.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Section 7 of this
bill, which provides for a new paragraph (i)
of section 10 of the actHon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Section 6 of the bill.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: No. Section 7 reads:
Paragraph (i) of section ten of the said act is
repealed and the following substituted therefor:Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: On my copy of the
bill, page 3. that is section 6.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Mine says section 7.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: It was section 7 in
the bill as read the first time in another place.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I am sorry; I was
looking at the first reading form of the bill
that came from the other house. Honourable
members will understand that I wished to refer
to section 6 of the bill as now before us. That
provides for new paragraph (i) of section 10.
That is the section to which I object. I am
informed that when that was drafted, the
manufacturers of fertilizer were net consulted.
The section appears to be an attempt to
perpetuate by legislation certain powers vested
in the Minister of Agriculture during the
national emergency by regulations issued
under the War Measures Act. Paragraph (i)
would give him power to make regulations

prescribing the physical and chemical properties of fertilizers to be used in any zone or
province in the Dominion of Canada and
prohibiting the sale or offering for sale, in
such zone or province, of fertilizers whose
properties do not conform with his prescription. The effect of this new paragraph could
be to prevent a farmer in any part of Canada
from buying a particular type of fertilizer
which, in his opinion, was most suitable in the
particular area in which he was farming.
Likewise, manufacturers would be prohibited
from producing or supplying the fertilizer that
the farmer wanted, even though they might
regard a fertilizer of that type suitable for his
particular purpose.
As intimated by the honourable gentleman
frorn King's (Hon. Mr. McDonald) in the
past manufacturers who have recommended
types of fertilizers as suitable for sale in certain areas have constantly received sympathetie hearings, not only from the department in Ottawa but also from the provincial
fertilizer boards. However if some political
or other situation interrupted these good
relations, the fertilizer companies would have
little or no control over the sale of other
fertilizers in the areas affected.
I am informed that the ceompanies doing
business in Canada at the present time possess
the most advanced scientific and technical
knowledge available on fertilizers. The full
benefit of this knowledge should not be withhield indefinitely by regulations that were
originally intended to apply only as war
measures.
I understand there was objection in the
other house to the indefinite continuance for
a long. period of time of this provision in
paragraph (i), and the minister stated that be
would be glad to reconsider the paragraph
next year, if someone brought it up. However,
unless some honourable member of the house
kept the matter in mind it would not be
brought up. This does not seem to be a very
satisfactory procedure, and I suggest that paragraph (i) be enacted for one year only.
Wartime controls were not intended to
remain in effect beyond the transitional period,
and it would seem that the control provision
embodied in paragraph (i) should be made
subject to annual re-enactment. If, as suggested
by the honourable gentleman from King's,
the bill is referred to committee, I shall suggest there that this new paragraph be enacted
for one year only. Should the government
wish to have it re-enacted, the matter can be
further considered next session. In this way
we shall net be perpetuating the control

MARCH 6,1947
indefinitely and depending upon some honourable member in another place to bring up
this subject for discussion next year.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. McDONALD (King's) moved that
the bill be referred to the Standing Committee
on Natural Resources.
The motion was agreed to.
MILITIA BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. COPP moved the second reading
of Bill 14, an Act to amend the Militia Act.
He said: I have asked the honourable gentleman from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) ta
explain this bill.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators, this bill consists of some 34 sections. Its
general object is to bring up to date the
Militia Act of Canada, which, I understand,
was originally enacted in the year 1868 and
has not been often amended. Honourable
senators will appreciate that the Militia Act
today contains a number of provisions and
phrases which are quite inapplicable to present
conditions affecting military establishments.
Many of the changes proposed by this
lengthy bill are procedural, designed to bring
the language of the statute up to da'te. For
instance, "Canadian Army" is substituted for
"Canadian Militia"; "active force" for "permanent force"; "reserves" for "non-permanent
forces"; "unit" for "corps", and "command"
for "military district." I do not propose to
discuss these particular changes in detail, but
there are some more important provisions to
which I should like to direct the attention of
the house for a few moments.
Section 3 amends the provisions of the act
in relation to the enlistment of boys under the
age of 18 years. Under the act such boys can
be enlisted as buglers, trumpeters or drummers
only, but it may now be necessary to enlist
boys for training in other categories at an
earlier age than 18 years. In fact, I believe
the categories of bugler, trumpeter and drummer were sometimes misused in the past. I
recall that in the First Great War my own
unit had two boys under 18 years who were
enlisted in the capacity of trumpeter and
drummer, but they did no trumpeting or drumming and were in exactly the same position as
the rest of the ranks.
Section 5 of the bill reads as follows:
The organization of the Canadian Army shall
be as from time to time prescribed by the Governor in Council.

That provision, honourable senators will
understand, gives general control over the
nature of the Canadian Army to the Governor
in Council, and enables him to decide from
time to time what proportion of the forces
shall be infantry, machine gun, anti-aircraft
and so on.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: Is that a change from
the present act?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: It is a slight change.
The act now provides that:
The Reserve Militia shall be raised and maintained under regulations prescribed by the
Governor in Council.
The new provision is a broadening of the
principle.
Sectiori 6 of the bill states the term for
which men may be enlisted. They are to be
enlisted in the active forces, or what has been
called the permanent forces, for a period not
exceeding five years; and in the other forcesthat is the reserves, or what we formerly
called the Militia-for a period not exceeding
three years. The act at present provides no
particular limitation to the term of service
in any branch of the army.
Section 9 of the bill is interesting and
important because it puts what one might call
a ceiling limit on the total or peacetime active
Canadian Army. The strength is not to exceed
30,000 men.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: May I draw the honourable gentleman's attention to section 8,
in which the proposed new section 20 (2) (b)
.of the Act reads as follows:
(b) the minister may at any time disband or
redesignate any unit or revoke, amend or restrict .any establishment if he considers it advisable so to do.
That means, I presume, that the minister can
change an infantry regiment to an artillery
regiment?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I am not sure
that it goes quite as far as section 5, which
contains the general power of the Governor in
Council to prescribe the organization of the
Canadian Army. I doubt that under the new
section 20 (2) (b) the minister could say that
such and such an infantry unit shall hereafter
become part of the Army Service Corps.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: I have in mind a case
in which an infantry regiment was changed to
an ack-ack. I do not think that has helped
recruiting in the unit.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Was that done by
the minister or by the Governor in Council?
Hon. Mr. WHITE: I do not know. It was
done since the war.

96

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:

Of course, there

mnust be some authority to redesignate units.
Whether it be done by the minister or by the
Gov-ernor in Council is another question. My
view of the bill is that under section 5 a
redesignation of this kind would probably
have to be done by~the Governor in Council.
But what my honourable friend bas said leads
me to another remark. There obviously will
be a number of questions which honourable
members will want to ask about particular
sections of the bill, and I may state now that
I intend, if the bill is given second reading,
to suggest that it be referred to a standing
committee, probably the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce, where officials of
the department would be available to answer
questions.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: That, I think, is what
should be done, because I recall that when
the bill was before another place it aroused
considerable discussion.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: My bonourable
friend is perfectly right: in the other house
there was for two or three days considerable
discussion, in which military members of
that house took an active part. I trust that
my honourable friend, a military member of
this house, will give the benefit of his views
to whatever committee the bill is referred.
Section 16 amends a provision of the act
which limits the training of reserve forces
to not more than thirty days in each year.
Under the new section 47, as enacted by section 16 of the bill, any of the units of the
Canadian Army may be drilled or trained for
such periods as the Governor in Council may
prescribe. It is felt that in certain circumstances it may be necessary to train units for
a period of more than thirty days in a year.
That would seem to be but a natural resuit of
the extreme complexity wbich now surrounds
various arms of the military service. It is
by no means an easy thing to become adept
in anti-aircraft, tank work and so on, and
there may well be instances in which the
training of the non-permanent force should go
on for periods of more than thirty days in a
year.
Section 23 of the bill is not of great importance in itself, but it reinforces what I was
saying a few moments ago, that the bill is
designed to modernize the language of the
present Militia Act. In section 23 there is
provision that the Governor in Council may
under certain conditions commandeer transport of any kind. The old section said that
be could commandeer "any railway, tramway,
boat, barge, scow, or steamship or other vessel,
or any wagon, carriage or pack animal." Well

transport bas advanced a little, so these particular designations are taken out and it is
now proposed to vest in the Governor in
Council a general power to commandeer any
means of conveyance or transportation.
Sections 32 and 33 are of some importance.
Section 32 adds to section 139 of the act a new
subsection authorizing
the
Governor
in
Council to empower the minister to make
certain regulations. I understand that as the
act now stands a vast amount of detailed
administration has to be approved by the
Governor in Council, and this results in the
passing of a large number of orders in council
concerned with minutiae of organization and
which could quite properly come within the
functions of the minister himself.
Section 33 makes a rather interesting
change. Under the present section 140 of the
act all regulations made by the Governor in
Council or the minister are required to be
published in the Canada Gazette. It has been
found that in certain circumstances some
regulations are of a secret nature. This section
as amended by the bill would provide thatAIl regulations shall be published in the
Canada Gazette unless the Governor in Couecil
certifies that such publication might convey
secret or confidential information to a foreign
powerIn such circumstances, of course, regulations need not be published; and in the nature
of things they should net be published.
The bill is more or less of the nature of a
temporary measure. The Militia Act, as I
say, has not been very greatly changed since
1868; and, as the minister stated when discussing the bill in another place, a complete
revision of the act is now in process of being
drafted and, it is hoped, will be presented to
parliament within the next year or two.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL
DEFENCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. B. COPP moved the second reading
of Bill 19, an Act to amend the Department
of National Defence Act.
He said: I have asked the honourable
senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
to explain this bill.

M.AROH 6, 1947
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN.: Honourable senstors, this is a short bill of three sections
designed to amend the Department of National
Defence Act in three different respects.
The first section provides for the reorganization of the department consequent upon the
.îoining together of the former departments of
the Army, the Navy and the Air Force; and it
provides that there shail be one Deputy
Minister of National Defence and flot more
than three Associate Deputy Ministers. I amn
advised that at the present time there is a
Deputy Minister of Defence and two Associate Deputy Ministers, one charged with
matters of finance and supply, and the other
with matters relating to personnel and pay.
It is flot intended at the present time to
appoint a third Associate Deputy Minister,
but power is sought in the bull to make the
appointment ini case that should at any time
be found necessary or desirable.
The second section of the bill carnies into
peace time a very useful provision, one enacted
in war time by order in council to provide
that the pay, allowances, and gratuities of
members of the armed forces who die while
on duty or while under care of the Department of Veterans Affairs, shail or may be
collected and paid by the Governor in Coundil
to the heirs of those men. There is a simple
procedure whereby pay and allowances due to
the members of the armed forces at the time
of their death are paid to their heirs-at-law.
No clsim can be made against the gratuities,
of course, because the pay and allowances are
not susceptible to, seizure.
An Hon. SENATOR: The dcpartment does
not administer the whole estate.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: No, merely the
military part of the estate arising out of the
military pay and allowances. The flrst section
of the bill may hereafter be of considerable
importance. It provides for the establishment
of a defence research board, to be charged
with the duty of conducting or co-ordinating
ail research and development for defence and
of advising the minister. The board wiIl be
rel-atively small; the section states that its
members Eha1l not exceed twelve in number.
It is expected that fromn time Vo time it will
employ scientists for special research, and
encourage defence research by providing
sch.olarships and financial sids to universities
and other institutions.
I do not know that the three sections of the
bill are of such importance or complexity that
they need be referred to a standing committee o! this chamber, but if any honourable
senator wishes to make inquiries,. and the bill

is given second reading, I, shall be only Voo
glad to move that it be referred to a standing
committee.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I tbink that had better

(Sec Appendix at end of today's report.)
IMMIGRATION
MOTION

Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK moved:
That the Standing Committee on Immigration
and Labour be authorized and directed to examine into the Immigration Act (iR.S.C. Chapter
93 and amendments) its operation and administration and the circumstances and conditions
relating thereto including:(a) the desirability of admitting immigrants
to Canada,
(b) the type of immigrant which should he
preferred, including origin, training and other
characteristics.
(c) the availability of such immigrants for
admission,
(d) the facilities, resources and capacity of
Canada to absorb, employ and maintain such
immigrants, and
(e) the appropriate terms and conditions of
such admission;
And that the said committee report its findings to this house;
And that the said committee have power to
send for persons, papers and records.
He said: Honourable senators, one year has
gone by since I moved in this house, seconded
by the honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar), for a committee of inquiry
into the subject of immigration. My resolutien was couched in terms identical with the
one to which I now speak. Honourable senators carried that resolution, and as a consequence an extensive investigation was had into
Canada's need for immigrants, her ability to

absorb new-comers into her economic life, and
the availability of immigrants for admission.
As you will recollect, your committee
reported that both agricultural and industrial
resources were available in Canada and were
awaiting development. The committee expressed the opinion that immigration is desirable in substantial numbers and as soon as
possible. Immigrants in considerable numbers
were declared to be available, and it was
recommended that Canada proceed to select
the more desirable and that they be guided
and assisted until established in this country.
Particular approval was expressed of the
admission to Canada of persons abroad having
relations or friends already in Canada who
were willing and able to receive and care for
them.
The concluding paragraph of the committee's report was as follows:
In conclusion, your committee expresses its
opinion that what is required for Canada is a
well-considered and sustained policy of immigration, selective in character and pursued by Canadian authorities with initiative and enterprise.
We should seek out the individual migrants
whom we want who will contribute to our industrial and agricultural economy and who will
assist in maintaining our high standards of
living by increasing proportionately our productive power, and in addition whose mentality and
education will fit them for taking part in Canada's political, economic and social life. What
we require is a steady flow in reasonable numbers of good settlers both urban and rural,
rather than any excited or spasmodic rush, with
regard, of course, to the varying economie conditions and needs of the country from time to
time. Successful immigration can be secured
only by careful and intelligent planning, and
sustained over a number of years. Continuity
of policy is essential to great and lasting success.
The committee said: "The immigration
problem is urgent. Action should be immediate, as otherwise opportunities will have passed
or been seized by others."
The committee's recommendations accordingly were as follows:
1. Announceinent immediately by the Government of Canada of a policy of selective
immigration into Canada of both agricultural
and industrial workers.
2. That such immigration be limited in
numbers to what from time to time appears
to be the absorptive capacity of the country,
and by practical considerations of transport
and establishment, and be subject to the shipping priority of service men and their dependents and other Canadian citizens.
3. That in anticipation of shipping becoming
available for immigration purposes:
(a) Canada's immigration policy be published
in appropriate foreign countries with explanations as to the unavoidable delay.
(b) That forthwith Canadian immigration
and inspection officers be dispatched to Europe,
and offices be opened with a view to meeting
prospective immigrants and to the selection of
those most desirable.

MARCH 11, 1947
(c) That surveys be undertaken immediately
inEurope to determine the localities where
immigrants may be found, and the conditions
and anticipated problems be met.
(d) That a survey be undertaken in Canada
inorder to determine the agricultural and
industrial resources available for use by prosPective immigrants, and the conditions and
anticipated problems to be met.
(e) That the immigration ministry at once
make studies and lay plans for an immigration
movement, and promptly take steps to impIement sucli a policy.
4. That everything possible be done to
shipping available subject to the above make
mentioned repatriation, and that thereupon priority
be given to the relatives, in ail degrees, and
to the friends of Canadjani citizens who assume
responsibility for the care and establishment
of the new-comer, and who are well able and
willing to give guarantees.
5. Thiat the Immigration Act and regulations
be revised to provide for the finding and seiection of immigrants, the admission of those most
desirable, and for the supervision and assistance
of-the new-comers until estahljshed in Canada.
The committee's report was received and
adopted witbout dissent, and it is satisfactory
to note that it was accorded a most favourable
and.sympatbetic reception throughout Canada,
and particularly in the press. One cosmopolitan journal remarked editorially:
The Senate can take pride in this week's
report of its Immigration Committee.
This particular comment I happened ito
clip,
but such comment was fairly general throughout Canada.
Urging action, one paper quoted the report,
as follows:
A settled immigration policy and a sustajned
effort is necessary if any real success is to be
achieved in attracting immigrants of the type
imdicated. Worthwhile men of skill and enterprise do not liglitly pull up stakes in the land
of their birth in order to emigrate into ncw
and unknown conditions, but experience proves
that there are sncb men abroad and that they
are willing to come to this country. The presently disturbed condition of the world presents
an opportunity to Canada in this regard which
wilI be largely lost if too long delayed.
Our agents shonld be in Europe now searcliing ont and interesting those whom we want,
and preparing for the time when shipping will
become available Time is an element in snch
migrations, for men of the type indicated must
know what they are doing . . . Canada should
neot stand inactively by, accepting passively
those who apply.
Organizations and individuals in great numbers, and representative in cliaracter, have
with practical unanimity endorsed the Committee's finding.
I quote from resolutions passed at the
recent meeting in Ottawa of the National

Liberal Federation Advisory Council:
83168-7j

1. Resoived that the Federation expresses its
appreciation of the statement of the
Representative to the meeting of the Canadian
Assemibly
of the United Nations at New York, that
Canada wonld do its full share in providing
a home for disp]aced per sons, now homeless in
western Europe. We therefore ask that aIl]
further active steps necessary to implement
this poliey be taken at once.
3
2. B e is Resolved that the National Liberal
Federation urges the adoption of an enlarged
immigration polîcy on a selective basis.
I might mention at randomi a resolution
passed by the Canadian Coundil of Churches
urging, "a generous immigration policy,"' and
that on January 23 last tbe Toronto Brancb
of the United Nations Socie*ty in Canada
passed a resolution asking "that Canada accept
a fair number of displaced persons as immigrants, without regard to financial resources."
JProbably the most outspoken individual
on this question of immigration lias been the
Dominion's Minister of Agriculture,
the
Honourable James Gardiner.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Riglit Honourable.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK:
is it?

Riglit lionourable,

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Yes.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I beg his pardon.
I always honour a man of Mr. Gardiner's
stamp and type for hie generous, bold and
outspoken comments, and I honour him particnlarly for what lie said on this occasion.
He is quoted in dispatclies from Vancouver
as saying:
We need as soon as possible in this country
fromi ten to twelve million people, most of
them settled west of the Great Lakes. We
need industries, not centralized, but scattered
al over the West from. Vancouver to Fort
William. Thei twelve million onght to be
secured first by retaining as many as possible
of our native born in Canada, and secondly by
drawing upon the skilled populations of Europe
fromn Britaîn eastward.
I suppose if twclve million people are to
settle from Fort William west that would
mean a good many more than twelve million
in Canada as a whole.
Urged forward by an overwhelming public
opinion in favour -of immigration, the government bas not b cen altogether inactive. It
bas twîce widened the classes of those admissible and, including tbe Polish soldiers and
tbe war brides and their children, lias -admitted
during the calendar year of 1946, twice as
many persons as reached our shores during the
previons six war years. That sonnds spectacular, but of course during those years we
received very few immigrants.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Conld my liononrable
friend give the figures for the different years?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I shall corne to that.
Unfortunately, bonourable senators, departmental action has been taken with such
deadly deliberation that the resulting impression conveyed to our people has been one of
holding back rather than of pushing forward
with any enthusiasm for the enterprise.
Perhaps one reason why that impression has
gained ground has been the deadly silence of
the minister responsible for the Immigration
Branch. I took the liberty of saying to him
not very long since that the clam is never as
popular as the lark. Se far, except for a few
formal statements from the department, no
words of inspiration or of forward-looking
desire to build Canada have emanated from
our Immigration Branch.
Having said that by way of criticisn. which
I think I have a right to express, it would be
fair for me to give some account of what
has been done during this last year, following
the activities of the Senate committee and
other bodies. To lay the foundation for a
statement I must ask you to recolleet that
since March 18, 1931, the landing in Canada
of immigrants of all classes and occupations
has been prohibited, with certain narrowly
restricted exceptions. I will summarize the
excepted classes. Honourable senators will
understand that I am net quoting the exact
language of the order in council, but I am
giving the facts. The exceptions have been:
1. British subjects and United States citizens
with sufficient means of maintenance until employment is secured.
2. The wife or unmarried child under 18
years of a legal Canadian resident in a position
to care for his dependents.
3. An agriculturist having sufficient means to
farm in Canada.
That means somebody who brings means
with him, and who is an agriculturist whose
main activity is farming, as distinct from a
farrn labourer.
4. The fiancee of any adult male.
I have heard a good many speeches on
women's rights. With some of them I have
agreed but with most of them I have not. I
do not know why the women's organizations
of Canada have apparently sat silent while
we have in effect an order in council permitting the male adult to bring in his fiancee
while a female adult has net the same
privilege. However fthat has been the rule
now since 1931 or longer.
5. A person honourably discharged from the
Canadian Armed Forces.

While the Senate Comrnittee was holding
its sittings last session these classes were
widened by adding the following:
6. The father or mother, the unmarried son
or daughter, 18 years of age or overThose below 18 were admissible before.
The unarried brother or sister, the orphan
nephew or niece under 16 years of age, or any
person legally admitted to and resident in
Canada who is in a position to receive and care
for such relatives. The term "orphan" used in
this clause means a child bereaved of both
parents.
The announcement of this concession was
received with great joy by those having relatives abroad, but unfortunately it has since
been a terrible disappointment to many of
them because of the large proportion of
relatives excluded from its benefits. The son
or daughter, the brother or sister, of someone
in Canada must be unmarried in order to gain
entrance to this country, as though a person's marriage were a reason why he or she
should not be admitted. The nephew or
niece must be under 18 years of age-it was
at first 16 years of age, but more recently
the limit was raised to 18-and bereaved of
both parents. And all these persons must have
relatives here who are both able and willing to
receive and care for them, which means that
they must be able and willing to supply them
with housing accommodation and maintain
them in Canada for an indefinite period until
established, and in most cases pay the costs
of transportation. No authoritative figures have
been given as to the number who may be
expected to get under that series of wires, but
I have heard the total estimate at 1,500 in
all, and I have been impressed in actual experience by the numbers left out.
I have in my files scores of cases in which
the nephew has one parent remaining, or is
over 18 years, or the brother, sister, son or

and in which the department has answered the
application of the Canadian relatives with a

hardship mean nothing. The fact that a whole

succor, is not even considered. No exceptions

experience I can state that it is a waste of
time to ask for the introduction of anybody
into this country who, in the light of the
immigration definitions as applied, has a hole
in his armour.

1%AIICH 11, 1947
The committee of last session deait with
the question of relatives and friends, pointing
out that the presence of relatives or friends
here who assume responsibility and guarantee
assistance is s0 great an advantage to the
immigrant as to justify his priority over ail
other classes. The fact that there are friends
and relatives already here ensures an easy
assimilation into the Canadian economy and
way of life. Such people present no problems
of absorption; their successful establishment is
almost a certainty, and they are the least likely
of ail immigrants to pass on to other countrios,
as thousands of others have done in past
years.
1 am in constant touch with people whom
we cal] "New Canadians"ý-that is men and
women who at some time came to Canada
f rom Europe, usually leaving relatives and
friends bohind them. Many of these good
people are in griovous distress hecause of their
inability to succor the few survivors of a once
extensive family connection, now ail wiped out
by the Hitler brutality.
The heart-pull is tremendous and stirs my
deepest sympathy. 1 have no difiiculty in
putting myself in their place and realizing the
attitude which I would adopt if I had relatives
in devastated Europe who desired to corne to
Canada and whiom I desired to rescue. It
would be inte4-esting to know how many applications from such people have been turned
down because the son or daughter, brother or
sister is married, or because of some picayune
definition of relationship rigidly applied.
What an opportunity Canada is missing to
win the undying gratitude of these good Canadian citizens and the loyal co-oporation of the
new-comers. No one ever bast anything by
expressing humanity in words and action, and
this applies to nations as well as to individuals.
The Good Samaritans have been lovod in ail
ages. Those opposed to immigration are disarmed by the human appoal of a government
expressing a paternal interest in Canadians
who are in a sad predicament. We should
open wide our doors to these relatives and
friends whio can be broughit in under guarantces from our own citizens.
On January 30, 1947, a further widoning of
the regulations occurred which, so far as it
goos, has my warmest approval. The following classes were added:
1. The widowed daughter or sister (with or
without umnarried children under 18 years of
age) of a legal resident of Canada who is in a
position to receive and care for such relatives.
}Ionourahle.aonators will note that suoh an
immigrant would not be acceptable if she had
a husb'ind; she must be a widow.
I arn

reminded of Mr. Weller-perhaps it is facetious to say so-when hoe told Sam to beware
of widows. In this case, however, we profer
widows and refuse to accept married women.
Further classes were as follows:
2. An agriculturist entering Canada to faim
wlien destined to a father, father-in-law, soli,
son-in-law, brother, brother-in-law, uncle or
nephewengaged.in. agriculture as his principal
occupation who is in a position to receive such
immigrant and establish him on a farm.
3. A f arm labourer entering Canada to engage
in assured farmn employment.
4. A person experienced in mining. lumbering
or logging entering Canada to engage in assured
employment in any one of such industries.
5. Orphaned nephews and nieces may now be
under 18, instead of .16, as formerly.
I say I approve this easing of the blockade
as far as it goes, but one cannôt but note the
hedging about with qualifications. Few whose
principal occupation is farming are in a position to "establish" a relative on a farm and
have relatives in Europe who may ho described
as agriculturists-that is who operate their
own farms as farmers as distinguished from
farm labourera; and are prepared to close
their estahlishments in Europe to ho re-established in Canada by the grace of farmer
relatives alrcady here. Such mon are more
likely to ho counted in tens than in hundreds
or thousands.
There should ho more farm labourera and
experienced minera and lumber-jacks who cau
be asaured employment-though I question
the need of insisting on -prier experience-and
I point out that history would lead us to
expect more difficulty when employers are
allowed to import cheap labour than when
Canadia-is whose hoarts are touched aie permitted to bring in bass fortunate relatives and
frienda for whose well-being they assume a
continuing reaponsihility.
Many instances
could ho given of difficulties cauaod hy
employers bringing in cheap labour-tako the
Japanese on the Pacifie coast-hut I think
these difficulties wilI ho few when Canadian
citizens have hrought in their frienda and
relatives and have estahlishcd them in this
country.
But why, honourable gentlemen, ahl this
liedging about of the free air of Canada?
Why this holding hack, as though we were
misera and every visa was a pearl of great
price? I grant you that it is a fine thing
to ho a citizen of this great and blessed
country, but are thore not two aides to the
iedger, responsibilities as well as privileges?
Doos flot the immigrant assume bis share of
the indebtedness, both private and public,
which Canadians must carry and ultimatkly

SENATE
pay off? Does the immigrant nlot underwrite
the succe-.s of our raiiroads and ail of our
other debt-laden enterprises,
public and
private? Does lie flot ns a, citizen, along with
the rest of us, underwrite the success of our
country, and of ail those institutions which
todav bear debts and whiich in the ordinary
course of business will encounter the risks
of operation?
Does flot the immigrant
arriving in this country undertake that hie
will dlaim no share of the great naturai
heritage of Canada, except that which hie
purchases from someone alreadv bere,' some
civner already in charge, who lias forestalled
him? He must pay hiis way; nnd the price
which hoe will ho expected to pay rnay ho
one reason wby so many have left us after
having reachied our favoured shores.
So there are two sides te the iedger. There
are obligations and respoasibilities as well
as privileges. In saying that 1 am a loyal
citizen of this country, I amrn ft
boasting;
1 arn only stating what ali of us would state.
I believe that Canada is the finest land in
which to live that cari be found in this world.
But 1 amn also a realii4, and I know that I arn
('alied upon to pay to the federal goverament
in taxes approximate]y one-haif of ail I earn.
Cigarettes, automobiles, gasoline and other
manufactured goods are ail considerably
dearer in Canada than they are acress the
United States border; wages arc about 35
per cent lower, and taxes 50 per cent higher.
We have obligations as weli as blessings to
share with those who corne and join us in
Canada.
We should becorne realists, nnd
recognize that what we are preposing to
share are our burdens as well as our benefits.
L is time we quit kidding ourselves that a visa
te Canada is a ticket to Heaven. It is nothing
of the kind. We are offering an oppertunity
foi labour and advancernent, it is true, an
opportunity to join the great fraternity of the
Canadian people,-a magnificent tlîing; but

Let mie now say just a word about the
problem
of administration.
Immigration
offices have beon established in Paris, France,
in Bru-t:iels. Belgium. and in the Hague,
Hoiland; provision alse bias been made
for the examinatien ef prospective immigrants
atCanadian missions in Athens. Cec.m

indications are that our staffs are engaged in

lias as yet arrived in Canada as a resuit of
their activities. If anyene lias reached Canada.
bis is a very rare case. indeed. despite the fact
that the war is two years in retrespect. How'ver. I nim heping that the work: new geing
forward in these offices will in the future bear
f ruit.
It is aNes proposed that tearns of immigration officiaIs shall proceed into Italy and into
the occupied zones of Gerrnany, there te conduoet examinatiens: but w-hon they wiil go and

building, and both classes have been clamouring in the past few months for entrance to
Canada. There is undoubtedly a shortage of
housing accommodation in Canada, but it is
sometimes hard to explain why we find such
great difficulty in providing roofs to' cover
our heads, when our forefathers were able to
do it with so few tools and under conditions
much more difficult than those under which
we live. As I say, gentlemen, there is «
undoubtedly a shortage of housing accommodation in Canada; but this is no argument
against the hundreds and thousands of immigrants who would come to the homes of relatives in Canada, where they would be received
and sheltered.
While Canada has been kidding along with
excuses for delays, other jurisdictions have
been active in skimming the cream off the
immigrant pool. The most important action
that has taken place is very recent. I have an
item from the daily press, a special from overseas, dated March 4, 1947, which states that
the British Ministry of Labour has just agreed
with the Trade Union Congress on the admission to the United Kingdom of 500,000
European refugees. The purpose of this
agreement is to solve the manpower shortage,
and it has been agreed that the immigrants
are to be selected on the basis of their skill.
The "Tight Little Island" is contemplating
taking in half a million immigrants while we
are talking about immigrants in half-dozens
coming into this great and spacious country of
ours.
Australia has set a target of 70,000 immigrants per year, with 50,000 orphans to be
admitted, so it was said, in the three years
following the war. New Zealand and South
Africa are both taking progressive steps in the
matter of immigration, and the United States
is admitting its entire statutory quota, something that has not been done across the line
for many years. I suggest to honourable
senators that it would be well for us in
Canada to at least keep in touch with what
is being accomplished in this respect abroad.
Here are the figures for 1946 that the
honourable gentleman from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. Haig) asked me for. They have been
issued within the last few daysHon. Mr. HAIG: That is why I asked.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: -and they are an
improvement, I admit, upon those of the
preceding year.
Immigration from overseas during the war
years has been practically at a standstill. The
grand total of immigrants received by Canada

103

via ocean ports for the six years from 1940
to 1945, both inclusive, was 34,963. During
the calendar year of 1946 we admitted:
English, Irish, Scotch and Welsh,

... 51,408.

It will be noted that the number admitted last
year from the British Isles alone considerably
exceeded the total of those admitted from
overseas during the previous six years.
5,633
Northern European Races .............
All others ............................
3,209
I call attention to the last figure.
The total number of overseas immigrants for
the year was 60,250. To this number must
be added 11,469 immigrants from the United
States, making a grand total of 71,719.
Included in these figures, of course, are the
Polish veterans from Italy-the figure for
them was set at 4,000, but I think the admissions fell short of that-and the war brides and
their children.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: How many war brides
and children were admitted? That is a figure
I should like to get.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I can give my
honourable friend the number of adult females
admitted, but some of them were not war
brides. Of the immigrants arriving via ocean
ports, 6,273 were male, 36,713 were adult
females-most of these were war brides-and
17,264 were children under 16 years of age.
Most of these children were the families of
war brides, but I cannot give exact figures as
to this; I do not suppose any exist.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Did you classify the
Poles among "Northern European races" or
"ail others"?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: They would be in
"al others". They certainly would not be
included in "Northern European races": in
that class would be people from the Baltic
countries and Scandinavia.
Honourable senators, I wish to call your
attention to the number admitted in the "all
others" class, because that is a fairly accurate
measure of Canada's magnificent contribution
towards the succouring of people from conditions in war-torn Europe. With that
generosity for which Canada has been noted
in the past we opened our doors in 1946 to
only 3,209 persons from devastated parts of
the continent, although undoubtedly thousands
of people here have been crying out to have
relatives admitted to this country and removed
from the terrible conditions under which they
are living. I do not think that is anything
for us to be proud of.

SENATE

Wbether the record1 of the Immigration
Branch during the past 3,ear has been satisfactory or nlot is, of course. a matter of
opinion. Those wbo have feit uipon their
bcart strings the tug of famiiy connections in
dire distress, and whom they have been unabie
to succour as montb after month bas gone by,
wiil be less complacent than some others I
miglit mention. Equanimity depends Iargely
on whose bull is gored. I myseif have flot
found much ground for rejoicing. I am giad
of the forward steps that we have taken, but
they are flot such as te arouse any great
enthusiasm.
Tbey have rcminded me toc,
strongly of the molasses barrel in coid
weatber. In saying that, I am flot by any
means referring to the immigration officiais
with whomn 1 have had a good deal to do in
recent mntbs, and wbom I have found most
efficient, industrious, sympatbetic, courteous
and belpful. Canada bas reason to be proud
of tbe departmentai officiais wbo, bave represented bier during this last year and previously,
but I cannot say that she bas much reason to,
be proud of the policy which those officiais
bave been forced to put-sue.
What the Senate should do about immigration is, of course, the question of the moment.
Certain it is that immigration is one of the
big problems confronting this country, and
tbat upon its successful solution depends in
great measure the future of our nation. I
beiieve we are ail agreed upon this, and so it
seems to me obvious that we in the Senate
sbould at least keep in touch witb what is
going on, and if possible influence the course
of events as we may tbink wise. That is
expected of us. That is why I have moved
this resolution again, in the hope that the
work done by the Senate committee last session wili be, not repeated, but continued in
the current session. If you pass this resolution, bonourable senators, as 1 expect you
will, I would suggest that we follow a somewhat different policy from tbe one followed
last year. Then we invited those wbo seemed
to bave special knowledgo of this sublect to
appear before us; but if a committee is set
up this year I would suggest that it throw its
deors wide open and extend an invitation to
ail who bave views to, express or knowledge
to impart.
By providiog an authoritative
forum for the expression of public opinion on
immigration the Senate may perform for
Canada a service of great and lasting benefit.
In moving this resolution I am honoured
to have associated with me, as seconder, the
honourable senator fromt Rockcliffe (Hon.
Mrs. Wilson).

Hon. M\,rs. WILSON: I should like to, second
the motion of the bonourable gentleman from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), and
also to adjourn the debate.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, may I be permitted to, speak now? The
honourable lady may then adjourn the debate.
I do not intend to, speak at any great lengtb,
and as I have not consulted with a single
meinher on this side of the bouse 1 will speak
only for myself.
Honourable gentlemen, when your bair is
the colour of mine and you have lived in
Western Canada as long as I bave, you can
tell the Senate what Canada was prior to,
1900 and wbat it bas been since.
I sbould like first to congratulate the honourable scoator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) and the chairman of the Committee
on Immigration and Labour (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) on their work of last year. By
their splendid efforts tbey rendered a real
service not only to this bouse but to aIl of
Canada. I ivas a member of the committee,
but took no part in it; so I am taking no
credit for its success. May I congratulate the
member for Toronto-Trinity on the able way
in which be bas presented bis case to this
bouse and to this country tonight.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I digress fni- a
moment Io relate an incident whicb shows the
difficulties resulting fromt our present immigration regulations?
About thirty-five yýars
utgo tbree Uk'rainian brothers came to, Manitoba. Todav one of tbem is a manufacturer
of coachies in the city of Win.nipeg, and bas one
of the' laigest busine,.ses wvest, of the Great

MARCH 11, 1947
Those who lived iu Western Canada prior
to 1900 will recall that the late Honourablo
Sir Clifford Sifton, when Minister of the
Interior, engaged in a wide open immigration
policy. There was no screen.ing, no selection.
I regret, as everyone does, that sorne Polish
soldiers suffering from. T.B. have recently been
allowed into Canada. At the present time
there are from seventy to one hundred of them
confined to the T.B. hospital at Brand-on, and
I fear they will be -there for the rest of their
lives. I cannot blarne the authorities for that
situation; the machinery for screening thoso
people was flot properly set up. I arn assuming, howevor, that when we let immigrants
corne inte this oountry in this day and generation ail necossary precautions will be taken.
The immigrants we would like to see allowed
into this cc'untTy are people from Great
Britain, Northern Europe and Central Europe.
The mon and women who were permitted to
corne to this country between 1900 and 1904
are today, with very few exceptions, as successful citizens as are to be found west of the
Great Lakes. Recently, in looking ovor a list
of niombers of the Manitoba legislaturo, I was
inteTested to note that eut of 58 members oe
was himself an immigrant and 5 were the sons
of immigrants. Three of the 5 were graduates
of the University of Manitoba, another was a
graduato of the Normal School, and one was
a mechanic. They do net bclong to rny
party, but the mal ority of tbom favour the
party ini the government-scme of them are
rnombers of the C.C.F.
1 have been among these citizeus cf Canada
and know that in the farming communities
of this country thoir word is as good as their
bond. They have made a success of thoir
lives. True, they got on poor land at the
start and have had bard times. My honourabie
friend from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) will
tell you that for a fow years thoy lived in
dugouts to get along. I attended the University cf Manitoba and arn governor cf oneocf
the affiliated colleges, and I know that sons
and daughtors of those immigrants are among
our best students today. In the universities
cf Saskatchewan and Manitoba the sarne
situation prevails. It should be rernemberod
that the parents cf those young people were
net selectod immigrants. Do net misunderstand me; I arn net criticizing the governeut
of that day; but we now know much botter
what should he done.
Let us look at tbings candidly, because
education carnies with it some diffieulties. Toc
few of our people are willing to take the tougli

105

jobs. How many of thern are willing teday
to go out on the farrn and submit to the

rugged lifo there? How many will go te the
bush and te the mine te werk? In my own
home town of Alexander, Manitoba, the
sectionmen were at first ail Englishmen.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:
railway?

That is on the

Hon. Mn. HAIG: Yes. By 1900 the boss
was an Englishman and the section hands
were Ukrain-iaus.
Today the boss is a
Ukrainian, and lie can get probably only one
man te help him. The railways have te send
a gang through in order te get the work done.
In the oarly days the immigrants teck the
peorest kind of poor land-tbey had ne money
te enablo them te do otherwise-and they
eked eut a living. Today thnougbout the
censtituoncios cf Dauphin, Marquette, Neepawa, Selkirk, Springfield and Provoncher, one
will find successful men and wornen. May I
lie permitted te mnake a personal reference?
Sorne cf my best clients and fniends are sons
cf those mon and wemen who forty-five years
ago came te this country as immigrants.
loet me tell you a stcry that you will scarcely
believe. I knew six mon, oach about fortyfivo yeans of age. who in 1902 bouglit 240 acres
cf land. Today in that district the third goneration are ail successful farmers.
Without immigration 1 do net see how wo
are te pay for the upkeop cf this country.
Five years ago our national dobt was about
3 billion; today it is around 16 billion. We
have two railway systerns in this country
clarneuning for an increase in rates. It is of
ne interest te me whetber they get it or notI have ne stock in either cf thom; but with a
population ef onlv 12 millions we cannot carry
on our municipal, provincial or Dominion
govorrnent, and support the railway, shipping
and elovator services in this country.
If I wene a young man or woman starting
eut in life today, und was net sure that
Canada would permit immigrants te coe
bore, I would go te the United States. If
vou bave brains, ability and energy, go where
the people are and you will have a far botter
chance. In the University cf Manitoba today
we have nearly 7,000 students. Our province
cf 800,000 people cannet possibly absorb that
many graduates.
That is tbe situation aIl over Canada. It

of Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbiaany one you like to name. We as citizens do
flot realizo that we have to adopt an immigration policy which will give the people of
the world who are healthy and willing to work
a chance to corne hero. I know that certain
people iii the ranks of labour believe that it
ivili prejudice thoir position. I agree with the
honourable member for Toronto-Trinity on
this matter. My experience as far back as
1902 to 1905 has been that these immigrants,
instoad of taking jobs from others, give more
jobs to others. The secondary industries and
occupations connected witb tbern are busier
today by reason of these people being here.
I believe that this is a matter upon wbicb
the Senate can give leadership in Canada.
Every part of Canada is represented here. We
have among us those of every racial origin in
Canada. We are interested first and forernost
in our country; and it seems to me that even
from a purely selfish standpoint-and that is
the only one I have discussed so far-we ought
to welcome the opportunity of bringing people
here.
But think for a moment of another consideration referred to by the honourable
member from Toronto-Trinity. If you had
a relative, especially a brother or nephew or
niece some place in Europe, and you were
happy and prosperous in this country, the
very stirrings in. your being would make you
want to bring those people out here. I amn
reminded of a man who is running a boarding
house on MeDormot avenue in the city of
Winnipeg. The other day he came to me
and said, "Mr. Haig, I have made a success
in this country." I said, "You certainly have."
He went on, "I have a niece about sovonteen
years old"ý-be showcd me her photograpb"and, she is the last one of my relatives over
there whom they did not murdor, and I cannot
get her out here becauso I arn not a farmer.
I run a rooming-house in the city, and I
rould easily support ber if I could get ber
hero." It is suchi peoplo that I believe we

have been born in Germany. He is a good
citizen, and was thoroughly loyal during both
the flrst World War and the recont one.
These are consideration.s whîch appeal to me.
I believe we should forget our individual
likes and dislikes. XVo should dismisa the
idea that these new-comnrs would jeopardize
the jobs of those working bore, because the
exact opposite will ho the case. At the sarne
time I candidly state tliat I do not helieve
ilhat wc should bring Japanese to this country.
I may bc' criticized for saying so, but I do
not think imv person should bo brouglit to

tlîis countrv wlîo cannot be absorbe(l into
our p)opulation. It is my theory of life that
unless we absorb immnigrants they will be a
threat to this country. If you attended the
United Nations assembly last fail in New
York you will remember the terrifie fight
which India made against South Africa on
the question of contract labour. Somewbere
about a hundrod years ago the South African
government of the day brougbt Indians into
the country lancr contract to work. Tbey
stayed there and multiplied, and what to do
witb them bas now become a world problem.
They cannot ho absorbed by the people of
South Africa: that is wbat bas causod the
trouble.
I did not intend to speak so long-, but I
bolieve that the Sonate is presented with an
in this matter. I am not
opportunity
criticizing the government one iota; probably
if I bad been a meinher of the government
I would have done exactly as they bave been
doing. I know thore is a feeling that among

CANADA

GRAIN BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. COPP moved the second reading
of Bill 4, an Act to amond the Canada Grain
Act.
ilonourable senators, I have
Ho said:
asked the honourablo senator from Qucen's
(Hon. Mr. Sinclair) to explain this bill.
Hon. J. E. SIN1ýCLAIR: Honourable sonators, this bill is to put into statutory form
some amendments tha.t were made during the
war, under the War Measures Act, to the Canada Grain Act. The principle rnvolvcd is not
new: the proviÀsons have been in force for a
few years and are wcîl known to the Board of

MARCH 11, 1947
Grain Commissioners, who have the administration of this act. It is flot necessary for me
to go into the details. I will just mention the
amendments which are proposed in the bill.
Section 1 uf the bill refers to the case of
a person who bas ordered a car and has
delivered a car lot of grain to an elevator
and then seils the grain to another person.
The new owner bas the rigbt to load the grain
on the car ordered by the original owner. This
amendment is deemed to be a benefit to the
producer, the grower of the grain, and it has
feen in force since 1944.
Section 2 of the bill refers to insurance in
the terminal and eastern elevators, and
requires a terminal elevator in the western
division and every licensed elevator in the
eastern division to at all times keep aIl grain
in the elevator fully insured by companies
approved by the board against loss by fire
"and inherent explosion". These last words
were added under the War Measures Act, and
bave been in force since 1941. They do not
apply to licensed public country elevators.
This bill was first considered before the
Standing Committee
on
Agriculture
in
another place, when representatives of the
Board of Grain Commissioners were present
and explained the particulars of the bill. They
informed the committee at that time that
they had no record of any inherent explosion
in any licensed public country elevator; s0
subsection 2 of section 2 only requires the
licensed public eleva;tors to keep the grain at
all times in sucb elevators insured against fire,
but does not include insurance against "inherent explosion", as the terminal elevators are
required to do in the western division and also
in tbe eastern division.
Section 3 of the bill bas be:en in force since

1943, and refers to the weigb-over in aIl terminal elevators. Tbis weigh-over is required
by statute, and the Board of *Grain Commissioners is required to conduct such weigh-over
in every terminal elevator once a crop year.
Section 3 makes an, amendment in regard to
weigb-over in terminal elevators. The present
act requires that in each erop year tbe Board
of Grain Commissioners shail weigh-over the
grain contained in every terminal elevator,
and that the period of time elapsing between

consecutive weigh-overs shahl net be less than
9 and not more tban 15 montbs. The amendment simply provides that the period of time

LeÂapsing between conseeutive weigb-overs shail
not be less than 9 and not more than 22
months.
Section 4 bas to do with the weigb-over of
grain in eastern elevators. The act as it now
stands provides that the period of time
83168-8.1

elapsing between conseicutive weigh-overs in
eastern. elevators shaîl not be less than 9 and
not more than 15 months. The amendment
changes this te not Iess than 9 and not more
than 22 months.
Sections 5 and 6 refer te Scbedules 1 and 2
of the act, giving the definitions of several
grades of rape-seed, sunflower seed, soy-beans
and peas produced in both the eastern and
western divisions. These two sections, whicb
have been enforced by erder-in-ceuncil since
1942, have proved satisfactory to the Board of
Grain Commissioners and, I think, to the. producers. It was felt by those who appeared

before the committee in another place that
from now on it was wîse te continue these

erders-in-council in statute ferm.
I feel tlîat that is aIl I need say in regard
to the principle of the bill 'or its details.
Tbe bill was discussed before a committee ini
the other place. Whetber or net it will be
sent to a cemmittee here is for members of
the Senate te decide. Whatever is their wish,
I should he glad te move in accordance with it.
If further information is desired, we could
send the bill te a standing cemmittee; or if
members are sufflciently apprised of the
details of the bill, after second reading we
could ]et it stand for third reading.
Hion. W. M. ASELTINE: Honourable sen-

ators, one can take very little exception te the
provisions of this bill. I amn in perfect agreement with section 1. There was a time when
a great deal of difficulty was encountered, in'
getting cars for the purpose of sh-ipping grain
eut of country points, but afýter considerable
effort and niegotiation the car order book was
established and from that time on you could
generally get a car, altbougb sometimes you
badl t-o give the station agent a five dollar bill
te miake certain that yen were geing te get
your car in its rigbt order. Ilowever, that
lias nothing te do w'ith tbis section as it stands.
This subsection bas te do witb the sale of
grain by a person entitled te a car, and authorizes the person wh.o purchascs the grain the
right te ship it out in that car. We bave no
objection te that.
The chief objection te the whole bill is subsection 2 of paragrapb 2. The honourable senator fiom Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair), wb'e
bas just moved the second reading of the bill,
states that hie bias had ne information disclosing any inherent explosions in country
elevators. I know of many elevators that
have gone up in flames from ne apparent
reason whatever.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I did net say it was
my information. I said that it was information given to a committee in another place
by the Board of Grain Commissioners.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Well, that is the
same thing, is it net? No one seems te knowx
why or how these tires originated. I have
always been of the opinion-perhaps the honourable senator from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr.
Paterson) could give us some information on
the subject-that they were caused by internal combustion. Whether internal combustion
is the same as inherent explosion or net I do
not know. If it is, I should think that subsection 2 as wefl as subsection 1 should be
amended to include the words "inherent
cxpliosion." For that reason I should like to
have this bill referred to the Standing Committee on Agriculture.
Mr. NORMAN McL. PATERSON: Honourable senators, may I reply to the honourable
senator from West Central Saskatchewan
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) in regard to the country
elevator business? I have had some thirty odd
years experience in the country elevator business and in the terminal elevator in Fort
William. During those years we frequently
put out fires by using dust. The presence of
corn dust was the cause of all fires that
ocurred that I know of. One of my early
experiences in Fort William was in the year
1908 when a man was sent by the United
States Government to inform us of the danger
of dust explosions. He brought with him a
small metal elevator with a portable roof, an
alcohol lamp and a pair of bellows which would
ordinarily be used for blowing up a grate fire.
He put out the lights and gave us a lecture
as te what would happen. He borrowed frem
the Empire Elevator enough dust for his purpose, and blew it into the alcohol lamp. Anr
explosion was supposed to occur and blow off
the lid of the elevator which was a foot
square. He tried it three times unsuccessfully;
lie thought we had put up some sort of a job;
and finally we iad to get some corn starch
fron a store so that he could carry out his
demonstration.
The dust in our western elevators does net
explode, but when you place it alongside corn
dust it does explode. The explosion at Port
Arthur wliieli killed 32 men is still unexplained.
It iught have been from an acetylene tank
exploding, but as far as I know there was no
corn dust in that clrator. It might be possible that the barley was particularly clean
thre cmelnof the barley were
and dry. and thl
iinanrble

For a number of years we had a wooden
elevator in Fort William, and sometimes we
had wheat in one side and oats in the other.
The wheat would sink the elevator lower on
one side and would cause the shaft to bind,
and the sparks would fly in all directions.
This would result in a fire. It was always
our practice to extinguish the fire by pouring
dust on it. That was a regular occurrence in
1912 and 1914. Then we got rid of the wooden
elevator and put up a concrete one. As far as
I know the explosion at Port Colborne was
from corn dust, and so were the explosion at
Montreal and the explosion that blew up the
Northwestern Elevator in Chicago. As far as I
know we liad no explosions west of Fort
William from wheat or barley dust.
This clause regarding explosion insurance
just adds a further tax on the grain industry
and the only objection to the bill offered by
the West was that it should be applicable to
Eastern Canada, where corn is handled in the
same elevator as wheat.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Would the fact that
we are growing so much more barley now than
ever before have any bearing on this question
that I have raised?
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: An explosion may
have occurred from barley dust, but no one
has ever proved it. The grain trade felt that
until barley dust or wheat dust was proved
dangerous this requirement was more or less
a hardship.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Can the honourable
senator tell us how much the cost of insurance
would be increased if this section were passed?
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: I cannot say, but
that information could be obtained in
committee.
The motion ivas agreed to. and the bill was
read the second time, and passed.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
Honourable Mr. COPP moved that the bill
be referred te the Standing Committee on
Natural Resources.
The motion was agreed to.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. S. S. McKEEN moved the second
reading of Bill G, an Act respecting British
Columbia Telephone Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to obtain an increase in the
authorized capital of the Britih ('olumbia

MARCH 11, 1947
Telephone Company from 811,000,000 to
825,000,000. 0f the $11,000,000 capital now
authorized, 810,000.000 has been issued. 0f the
81,000,000 additional capital authorized by the
amending act of 1940-41 no part has been
issued. The increase to 825,000,000' is necessary for capital expenditures which. wiIl be
required on the company's properties to
provide facilities adequate for the needs of the
province of British Columbia, and for' the
purpose of carrying out the company's postwar programme of expansion and modernization.
The bill would delete subsection (3) of
section 6 of the act. The purpose of the
deletion is to eliminate the restrictions imposed
by the subsection upon the $1,000,000 of

capital authorized by the amending set of'
1940-41. but of which no part bas been issued
by the company, so that the existing capital
and any autborized increase of capital shall
be of a uniform type.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED

Hon. Mr. McKEEN moved that the bill
be referred to the Standing Cemmittee on

very bad indeed. Several honourable members
have complained to me about it. Surely in
the Department of Public Works there should
be engineers capable of discovering the cause
of this condition and overcoming it. I felt
a strong draft when we were sitting here last
evening, but I did not mention it as I was
suffering from a cold at the time and thought
I might have been a little sensitive to any
change in temperature. In our rooms the temperature is kept at a reasonably comfortable
level, but in this chamber it is much lower.
That in itself would not be so bad if it were
not for the draft. I would suggest that the
acting leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Copp) take this matter up with the Department of Public Works and see if the condition
cannot be remedied.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: There are three
vents at each of the windows above my honourable friends, and I think it will be found
that they are kept open all the time. To
prevent a draft it would be necessary to have
a man get up on a ladder and close those
vents.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: A draft comes in through
the grill back of us.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I shall see that the matter
complained of by the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) is brought to the attention of the Department of Public Works.

THE SENATE CHAMBER
ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, I
want to repeat my complaint about the draft
that is felt on this side of the chamber. It is

Hon. W. D. EULER moved second reading
of Bill B, an act to amend the Dairy Industry
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
is an exact duplicate and has the same purpose as the one which I introduced at the
last session of parliament. Its object is to
repeal that portion of the Dairy Industry
Act which provides for the prohibition of
the manufacture, importation and sale of
oleomargarine. I introduce the bill again,
with all due respect to my honourable colleagues, because I believe that the Senate
erred last session in refusing to end the prohibition of margarine, and thereby deprived
the great mass of Canadian consumers of
the right of choice as to the purchase of butter
or oleomargarine. Further, the prohibition
denies to the public the opportunity of
purchasing an excellent substitute for the
butter which is in short supply and so necessary to the health of the Canadian people.
I have received a great many resolutions
passed by public bodies, and communications
of alI kinds from people throughout Canada.
A great many editorials and comments have

MARCH 12, 1947
appeared in the press from coast to coast.
As far as I arn concerned ail this material was
absolutely uninspired and voluntary and,
except for that from the representatives of
the Canadian Federation of Agriculture and
the Dairy Council, is in every instalce*favourable to oleomargarine.
Before proceeding further with my remarks
I should perhaps state that the bill is my
own. It is flot inspired by the government.
I do flot know what action the government
may take with regard to the bill; it certainly
is flot promoted by anybody financially
interested in the production of oleomargarine.
1 have had no communication from and have
flot been approached by anyone who might
be interested in the manufacture or sale of
the product. 1 do flot expeet to convince
Mr. Hannam, President of the Federation of
Agriculture, who last year and again this
year in more or less veiled terms imputed
that there were sinister motives behind the
introduction of the bill. Apparently he is
incapable of believing that even a humble
senator might be just as zealous in tiying
to promote the interests of the Canadian
consuming public as is Mr. Hannam in trying
to promote the class interests of the organization whieh he professes to represent.
May I review briefly the history of margarine? It wes first produced in France, a
fact which I did not myseif know until the
other day. The produet was plaeed on the
prohibited list in Canada more than thirty
years ago. During the latter part of the First
Grea-t War this prohibition was suspended, and
in 1922 we had a very animated debate in the
Hlouse of Commons as to whether or flot the
suspension should be continued for an
additional year. In that year those of us wbo
supported.the use of margarine won the fight.
It came up the following year, 1923, and, if
I remember.aright, the mover of the resolution
was Mr. Carroll, who I believe is now a
Supreme Court Justice of the province of
Nova Scotia and was the chairman of the
commission which investigated the coal situation in that province. There was no party
feeling or party division, particularly, in connection with his motion. As a matter of fact,
as I think I mentioned. last year, the then
Minister of Finance, Mr. Fielding, was
strongly in favour of, as he called it, freedom
of choice. The Prime Minister, Mr. Mackenzie
King, was just about as strongly opposed. It
was rather interesting to watch the debate
between those two gentlemen. I myself had
something to say on both occasions in supIn 1923 we were
port of oleomargarine.
defeated; and from that time on, for the last

twenty-four years. oleomargarine has been
banned in Canada, the only country in the
world where this is done.
Yet, as I remarked last year, it is no longer
contended by anyone that margarine, as it is
manufactured now, and indeed has heen manufactured for twenty-five years or more, is not
absolutely wholesome and palatable; and, wîth
the addition of a vitamin-vitamin A-just as
nourishing as butter itself. The use of it is
legal in the United States, Great Britain,
France. and those great hutter-producing
countries, Holland and Denmark, and everywhere else, so, far as I know. I leave it to'the
iudgrnent of honourable gentlemen, if it were
the case thaf margarine had been a legal cornmodity in this cAlntry for the last twenty-five
years, whether anyhody would dare to try to,
prohibit its use and manufacture and sale at
this time.
Last year in advocating the reintroduction
of margarine-its manufacture, its sale, and,
if you like, its importation-my ehief argument was that the sale of no legitimate article
of commerce, and certainly of no legitimate
and wholesome food, should be prohibited in
a free and democratic country. Freedom to
purchase any such commodity should be a
fundamental right of the Canadian people. It
is strange that a country which boasts of its
democratie principles--although we sometirnes
disregard them, and necessarily s0 in time of
war--should be the only country in the civilized world which prevents its people from
consummng a butter substitute which la as
wholesome and healthful as butter itacif. This
is especially strange when butter is in short
supply here, as it is at present. I do flot
believe that this prohibition can be reconciled with the principles of that much-abused
word, democracy, or of fair play. The existing
legisîntion is, in my opinion, class legislation
of the worst kind.
1 might pursue that point a littie further.
We are flot consistent when we ban oleomargarine. We might just as well ban a great
many other things. For instance, there is a
commodity known as Crisco, which takes the
place of lard, but we do not banish Crisco for
that reason. Nor do we ban the importation
of oranges or grapefruit. On the contrary, I
believe we even reduce the duty or make some
other concession to, the importers. Yet, these
fruits muýt compete with apples and tonatoes,
whieh we produce. We do flot dehar sal
stockings, although silk compotes with wool.
One of the produets of my own city, Kitchener, la leatherette, but we do not prohibit
its sale to avoid competition with leather,
which is produced by tannera, who also are lu
My City.

112

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DAVID: Nor the sale of Postum,
w~hich competes with coffee.
Hon. Mr. EULER: No. I read the other
day that in Kitchener some people are breeding a little animal called a chinchilla, the fur
of which is one of the highest priced in the
world. 1 believe a lady's chinchilla fur coat
costs as rnucb as thirty or forty thousand
dollars. Now, I arn very much afraid that
if a success is made of that industry my honourable friends from Prince Edward Island,
the province in which foxes are bred, will
probably move to have chinchilla breeding
barred.
Mr. Hannam contends that we should flot
permit the sale of oleomargarine,* as it interferes with the sale of buttet. But there are
in this country at least eleven million consumers who cannot obtain a sufficient supply
of hutter and who are obliged to do withi an
allotrnent, of six ounces a week. There has
been a shortage of butter in Canada for some
years, and Mr. Brncken, the leader of the
Conservative party in the bouse of Gommons,
states that this year there is geing to be a
shortage of sixty million pounds. This is not
te he wondered at, for in the last two years
we have exported to the United States 118,000
milk cows. Last year the production of mýilk
was four per cent less than in the preceding
year. There is a large production of cheese
and ice crearn, and the people are urged to
drink rnilk-to their advantage, I think. However, surely apart from the principle of freedom of choice, on which 1 base rny main argument, it is the essence of selfishness for the
dairyman to say, in eff ect, "If you do not
buy my butter you may not buy a substitute,"
or "I forbid you te buy margarine, even
though I have net the butter to seIl you or
have not as much as you want or need," or
"You cannot buy margarine, even if you
cannot afford to buy butter at twice the price
of margarine." Despite the fact of increased
wages fzom time te time, the ordinary working man with a family bas a smaller purchasing
power today than he bas had for some time.
S'orne of the opponients of this bill have
atternpted to answer the criticisrn that the
present law is class legislation of the worst
kind. So far as I know, eleomargarine is the
only article of food fit for buman consumption
whose manufacture and sale are prolhibited in
Canada. Mr. Hannam says it is impracticable
te permit the manufacture of oleomargarine,
because the necessary fats and oils cannet be
obtained here. Well, if be is right, why is he
werrying about this bill?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Is it truc that the ecessary fats and oils cannot be obtained liere?

Hon. Mr. EULER: I do neot think chat is
truc.
At thie moniunt there mav be sornie
shortage of cils. but in these days various oils
rcbeing used for the first time. In the
United States-I refcr to that ceuntry because
we are able to sce wliat is going on therecoco-mit oil used to be, an ingredient of
olemargarine. but after the war broke eut
nianufacturers could net ebtain a supply and
they subsitutcd cotton-seed oul, without any
deterioratien in the quality of the product.
There is ne argument as te the palatability or
neuri'.hing qualities ef oleornargarine as i t is
made teday.
According te docurnentary
exîidence whicb 1 could bring here. it lias the
sarne neurishing qualities as butter itself., Se
whule butter cannet be ýobtained in desired
quantities, wvhy should we deprive the Canadian people of the rigbt-fer it is their rigtte get a substitute that will serve thcir purposes just as well?
Net enly is butter scarce at preserit, but
when it is obtainable the price is higbcr than
seine people can afford te pay. if. as is
rurnoui cd. thïe go%-ernrnent dliscontinues the
>usiibiy ef 812 cents a pound te preducers, the
prico wvill prebably go up at least 10 cents a
pound. te 55 or 60 cents, a figure that the
erhin.îr marn witli a large farnily cannot afford
ta puy.
Then. henourable sýenators, why
should he or' anv other Canadian be deprived
of the riglut-I rcpeat that it is a rigbt. and net
a privilege-of being able te huv a good
substitute at haîf the price of butter?
Hon. Mr. COPP: Can oleemiargarine bc
liougbt ut liaîf the price cf butter?
Hon. _Mr. EULER: I arn glad my lionourable friend asked that, because it reminds
me te say something that otherwise I might
havec forgotten. A few weeks ago I visited
Buffalo. chiefly for the purpose cf finding eut
about the oleomargarine being used over
there. I went te four large food steres, ail of
whicb liad oleoinargarine for sale. There was
ne rationung or limitation of any kind on the
(tuantity that one could buy. I hold in my
hand a pouend package whicli I brought back.
In the past eone of the objections raised against
this bill lias been the alleged case with which
a custoincr ceuld ho deceived into huying a
peuind of olemargarine when he wanted
butter. Wcll, ns honourable members can sec
frorn this package, ne one could possihly mnistake it for butter. This product, called Parkay,
is made by the Kraft Company, and is describcd as xegetable olcornargarine. It is the
bighest, qualîty oleornargarine obtainable over
there. and I paid 42 cents foi' the pound. At
that time butter wvas selling there at from 78
te 80 cents. and the price lias been as higb

MARCH 12, 1947
as a dollar. I brought this back with me as a
sample. I have had it in my possession for
two months, and perhaps during that time
have been rendering myself liable to the
direst penalties for breaking one of the
prohibitions in the Dairy Industry Act.
Honourable members may be interested to
know that oleomargarine has better qualities
than butter itself.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Is it possible to
tell the difference between oleomargarine and
butter by taste?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I will reply to my honourable friend's question by relating a little
incident. When I went to Buffalo I was
accompanied by a friend, who also brought
back a pound of oleomargarine. Afterwards
he told me that for a Sunday dinner he had
as guests his son, who is a doctor, and his
son's wife. Butter and oleomargarine were
served on separate plates, and both his son
and daughter-in-law thought the oleomargarine
was butter.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: A case of mistaken identity.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Most honourable members who have visited the United States know
what a high quality of oleomargarine is
obtainable there.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Is it not a fact
that when oleomargarine was imported or
manufactured here many restaurants and
hotels, although able to obtain butter, used
to save money by putting oleomargarine on
the table, because their guests could not distinguish it from butter?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I do not know whether
that was done. May I ask my honourable
friend if he has ever heard of bottles labelled
"plum preserves," but containing a large proportion of carrots or some other vegetable?
If the ban on oleomargarine were lifted, the
manufacture and importation could be surrounded with all the precautions possible. We
have a pure food law, and the importers and
manufacturers of oleomargarine would be
obliged to comply strictly with regulations
under the statute.
I may say to honourable senators that
although I never write out my speeches I
usually make rather copious notes; and on
this occasion, as once before, I have come
here with the wrong notes. So I hope that if
my remarks are more or less disjointed honourable members will appreciate the reason.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Will the honourable
gentleman tell us if the notes he brought are
in favour of butter or of margarine?

Hon. Mr. EULER: They are in favour of
both.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: We thought the honourable gentleman had brought his butter notes.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Anyway, I do not need
notes for my main contention which is this:
there is no just reason why the people of this
country should be prevented from buying a
suitable substitute for butter, which they cannot obtain in sufficient quantity. And I say,
as I did last year, that even if a sufficient
supply of butter were obtainable, in a free
country no man and no government ought to
be able to say to the people, "You cannot buy
a certain wholesome article of food, though
you like it and have the money to pay for it."
I lay that down as a fundamental principle.
After all, honourable senators, we are continually boasting of our freedom and our
liberties, and we are supposed to have fought
a great war in defence of those rights. All my
other points are merely in support of this
chief argument, that there should be absolute
freedom for every citizen to purchase any
wholesome food or legitimate article of
commerce.
But Canadians have been prevented from
buying oleomargarine now for more than
twenty-four years. It is so long since the
product bas been on sale that our people
have forgotten what it is. Only those who
have visited other countries know how good
modern oleomargarine is. At one time, say
thirty years ago, there may have been a
reason, or an excuse-I think it was really
an excuse even then-for prohibiting the
manufacture or sale of oleomargarine. In
those days it was not made with the good
ingredients that are used today.
Surely our pure food inspectors would see
to it that no manufacturer or importer put
an unwholesome margarine product on the
market. Then why in the name of ordinary
fairness and common sense should Canadian
citizens be prevented from buying a nourishing food, if they want it? And especially
in these days when butter is so scarce we
should not be prevented from buying a
suitable substitute.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: What is the daily
consumption of butter in this country?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I am sorry, I cannot
answer that question.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: What is the approximate consumption?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I do not know precisely.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Is it not about a
couple of million pounds per day?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. EULER: I should think that
approximately correct.

On a train geing to, Toronto reeently I met
one of my farmer friends, a former constituent
of mine. It was affer I had intrnduced this
bill in tbe Sonate, and we woro discussing the
oleomargarine question. My friend was against
the bill. I referrod te the shortage of butter
and said thaf the individual shnuld ho at

I say te bonourable gentlemen bore fodav

purely selfish roasen that if might interfere

net admitting, because the producor of butter

Hon. Mr. QUINN: Lots of it.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: And what report

Hon. Mr. EULER: Perhaps my honourable
friend was nef prosont when I spoke on the
bill last year. I said thon that one of my
colloagues on this side nf the house, an officer
in the laf e war, said on bis return from oversoas thaf the soldiers had been much dissatisfied wifh the qualify of the butter that
they were receiving, but oleomargarine was
subsfituted for butter and immediately ahl

MARCH 12, 1947
1 wish to emphasize that aIl the press
editorials that have corne to my notice have
been favourable to margarine. Some of them
have contained far -more vehement statements than any 1 have made today.
In this morning's mail I received a letter
which gives somne indication as to the attitude of the workîng people in this matter.
It is written by Mr. Robert Summers, Recording Secretary of the Trades and Labour
Council of the city of Sault Ste. Marie,
Ontario, and reads as follows:
Dear Sir:
We, the above organization, have read with
interest the bill you have placed before the
house in relation to legalizing the sale of oleomargarine in Canada. We as an organization
feel that this is a matter that is of utmost importance to the worker of Canada. We would
also at this time place ourselves on record that
we as workers are in the fullest sympathy with
this bill and accord it our fullest support.
In last Saturday's paper from Kingston,
Ontario, the home town of an honourable
gentleman who sits almost opposite me (Hon.
Mr. Davies), there was a dispatch headed,
"Sale of Margarine Sought by Legion." It
was dated at Kringston, March 6, and stated:
Kingston branch of the Canadian Legion last
night decided to ask the federal government to
permit sale in Canada of margarine, a butter
substitute. Members said margarine would help
overcome the butter shortage.
Here is a dispatch fromn North Sydne y,
which may interest my honourable friends
from Cape Breton.
It is headed "North
Sydney is for margarine. Cape Breton farmers nlot making enough butter for use."
1North Sydney, N.S., January 18--The Town
Council of North Sydney, N.S., is urging ahl
cities and towns in the province to loin in a
campaign to lif t margarine restrictions.
The Mayor of North Sydney, A. Charles
Thompson, says about 75 per cent of the farmers
in Cape Breton, N.S., are without sufficient
butter for their tables. And he says he
believes
a large percentage of people are in f avour of
having the ban lifted on the importation of margarine into Canada.
The mayor said letters had been sent to -ail
large centres in the province, and although he
did not give specifie figures on the answers hie
received, hie said they would indicate that people
are in f avour of lifting the importation ban.
That refers only to the ban on importation
of margarine, but we have also a ban on the
manufacture.
Hlon. Mr. HORNER: Those farmers mnust
be just part-time farmers.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Probably se. And
maybe some farmers in Holland and Denmark eat the oleornargarine they produce and
seil their butter to Britain.

I have here an editorial from the Mon.treal
Daily Star. I do not know whether that paper
bas any party polities, and it does not make
any difference. The editorial states:
If. as the Minister of Agriculture seems to
think, it is going to be necessary to import
butter to maintain even the somewhat scanty
ration now available, it is bigh time to put an
end to the prohibition of the manufacture of
margarine in Canada. It is no longer a question
of protecting our butter industry. If the butter
producer were able to supply the country's needs
there might be some reason to help him hold his
market, but hie has not doue so for a long time,
and there is small prospect that hie will, at least
so long as the heavy demand for milk for various
purposes continues. The use of margarine eau
surely do little to hurt tbe butter industry
when the latter cannot meet the demand. No
one is likely to use margarine when butter is
available at a price whjch the small-income purchaser can afford. Until it is, it is flot only
uuf air but dowurîght stupîdThese are the newspaper's words not mmne.
-to deuy this large part of the consumer-public
an excellent food-stuff at a moderate price.
Duriug the war the argument was used that
the oils and fats necessary for the production
of margarine were of great importance to wartime industry. That was presumably true in
other countries, but did not prevent the makiug
of margarine there.
He is presumably thinking of the United
States.
In eny case this war prîority no longer exists.
If the production of margarine cannot be started
without too long delay, it should be possible to
import it until we can get production under way
in this country. It is true that the law now
preveuts the manufacture of this food product in
Canada. That need be no insuperable obstacle
at the coming session. Parliament has wisely
corrected mistakes before this, and should do so
in this instance. To maintain opposition to the
production of this healthy and medium-priced
food-stuff, particularly under preseut circumstances, would be a dog-iu-the-manger attitude
which would be inexcusable.
The fariner or the dairyman of Canada is,
1 think, just as reasonable a person as any
oither citizen. I doubt very much whether fie
would say to the man with a large family
in this country, "You must buy rny butter
and you canuot have a substitute," or "You
cannot have margarine, even Vhough I a.m
unable to supply you with enough butter to
provide for the nceds of yourself and your
family," or "You have got to buy my butter,
though the price be twice as rnuch as you can
afford to pay or twice an high as the price for
which margarine could be eold?"
Perhaps I arn prejudiced, honourable senators, but it secms to me that there is no real
argument against margarine. Canada is the
only country in the world which prohîbits the
manufacture, importation and sale of this

Honourable senators,
sokntoo long, but perhaps 1 may be ailowed
tu quote an item from Saturday Night,' which
is not a party paper but a highly reputabie
weekiy journal. Under the heading "too littie
-butter," that paper states:
The suppiy of butter in Canada is being permanentiy reduced by two factors, a sharp inecrease in the consomption of milk as miik, and a
hieavy expert of mnilch cuws to the United
ýStates. Canadians, however, are stili debarred
by iaw from the priviiege of obtaining that
excellent substitute for butter known as oleomargarine. It seems a littie hard that Cana,dians with no margarine shouid go short of
butter while their f ar-mers are seliing their cows
-at high prices to Americans, must of whoma are
permitted to consume and do consume ail the
margarine tbey want; and the present might be
a good time for a generai push to get rid of a
prohibition which has neyer had any other basis
than general sympathy with the Canadian daîry
f armer-who at the moment seems to need less
53 mpathy than the Canadian butter consumer
and to be likeiy to do su for quite a long whiie.
1 wonder if I might just give une more
quotation. I have so, many here that I feel
an embarrassment of riches. This quotation.
fromn an article in the Halifax Herald, is
cntitled "A dog in the manger attitude."
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I am against that.

EULER: That

language, perhaps, than 1 myself would use.
I do not know whether the paper bas any
party bias or not. However, that dues not
make any difference. After mentionýing the
fact that Canada is obliged tu import 12
million pounds of New Zealand butter, the
article says:
It means (1) that the Canadian dairy industry is not supplying Canadian needs and (2)
that,' in order ta keep the Canadian butter
ration at "a f ull six ounces" per person per
week. we are actually ta "enjoy" butter diverted
fro>ni the United Kingdom.

That probably explains why we get a littile
more butter in the par'liamentary restaurant
than we did at the samne time a year ago.
Hen. Mr. QUINN: Very littie more.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Well, more than the
siiver w1egot last session.
The article continues:
Much as they desire butter, sa long in short
suppiy, the pýeople of Canada will not reiish the
idea of taking it out of the mouths of the
British people. And what makes Canadians
particularly angry is the stubborn refusai of
politicians--and lobbyists for dairying interests
-to consider any modification of the rigid 100
per cent ban tipon butter substitutes in this
Dominion.
We are not supplying our own needs in butter (tbie Canadian demand f ar exceeds the
supply)-butter is being diverted fromn Britain
ta Caunada-and stili, Ottawa refuses to raise,
even teipurariiy, the prohibition ciamped down
and sale of marupocn importation, manufacture substitutes for
garine and other nutritins
butter.
Then reference is made to the bill introduced here last year.
Hon. Mr. DUF'F: A vcry sensible article.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It goes on.
That bill did net even pass the Senate and,
-of course, neyer reached the Blouse of Comnmons. It encountered the implacable hostility
of Canadi-an dairying interests-and the goverumnent itself displayed littie or no coneern in
the matter.
But the people of Canada are interested'rom sea to sea-and vill expeot reintroduction
'f the Lift-the-Margarîne-Ban Bill at the forthcoming session which opens January 30.
1 may say, honourable senators, that that is
flot my reason for introducing the bill again
at this se.-iun. If I remember correctly, I
promised iast session, when the bill was
defeated, that 1 would introduce it again
this year. However, 1 make no promise for
next session, because I hope honourable senators will sec how reasonable is this proposed
amendment to the act, pass it, and let it go
over to the Bouse of Commons.
Finaliy. may I read one or two letters wbich
I think are of interest. I wish to repeat that
every letter and communication I have
received ham been entirely unsoiicited. The
one I should like ta read first came to me
shortly after the bill was dcfeatcd last ycar.

of flot agreeing with bis conclusions. I believe
bis bill should flot be given second reading in
this bouse.
By the bill the honourable gentleman seeks
to arnend a very old act. He wishes to amend
one of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927.
The honourable gentleman said tbat the act
bad heen on the statute books of Canada for
about tbirty years, and hie included some
references to Liberalism and democratic institutions. May 1 point out to bim that this
l.aw bas faced democratie institutions for
thirty years. It bas stood tbe test of time.
During tbrce decades, while various parties
have corne and gone in tbis country, successive
administrations bave subscribed to this law.
It is therefore of national importance, and
represcnts the national viewpoint of the people
of Canada. My friend talked about trade;
hie told us about Liberalism and frccdom.
May I remind bim tbat trade, even from a
Liberal standpoint, is only good when it contributes to the benefit of the majority of tbe
people; and frecdom functions bcst wben it
sustains tbe bcalthful and abundant life of
the people of the country.
My friend brougbt this bill forward last
session. Honourahie members of the Senate
registered their views at that time, and tbe
situation bas not cbanged much since.
We know that the control, the, movement of
fats and cils is in the bands of the United
Nations, and undcr the supervision of the
Combined Food Board, situated in New York.
In Canada the movement is supervised by the
Oils and Fats Administrator, an officiai of the
Wartime Prices and Trade Board. The administrator is working in the interests of Canada
to see tbat wc get our fair share of these
commodities, in keeping witb other nations
who are trying to meet a world crisis at this
time. I consulted witb him and hie furnisbed
me considerable information.
lnder tbc headiug of "Supplies of Fats and
Qils for Margarine Manufacture" bie has tbis
to say:
1 wish to confirma that the Supplies of fats
and cils which will be available for consumuption
in Canada during 1947 will, we hope, be equivalent to that imported in 1946. However, our
import allocation is insufficient to meet the
present demanda of the shortening and food
industries, and therefore we could not make any
qu'antity available for margarine manufacture
without denying the baking and allied trades of
their most essential requirements.
Hon. Mr. EULER: May I ask my honourable frieod, a question? If that is the case,
wbich I do not admit, wbat harmn can resuit?

appears.

119

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: If my honourable
friend- will be patient, I will answer bis question before 1 get. through.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I ask the bonourable gentleman if hie would he opposed- to,
importation of the finished product from the
United States?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I will answer that. I
tbink my bonourable friend will agree that
for wbat we buy from the United States we
pay in cash, and what we are sending in the
way of goods and produets to Britain and
other countries we are sendîng on credit. One
of the serious problems before tbis country
in tbe near future may be to find enough
United States dollars ýto fulfil our obligations
to that country, in view of the fact that we
are sending overseas on credit hundreds of
millions of dollars worth of goods. Tbat is
only one of the reasons wby I would be
opposed Io importation of oleomargarine from
the United States to invade the Canadian
market at the present time.
Hon. Mr. McLEAN: What about Newfound.land? There is plenty of margarine in
that country.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: The administrator
says furtber:
In our opinioni, il will he some time, probably
two or three years, before the supply of fats
and oils available for international trade will
equal the pre-war level, and we must therefore
expect continued shortage of fats and oils in
Canada for the next two years at least.
Soap Industry
The soap industry is the largest. single conSumer of fats and cils in Canada, using approximately 150 million pounds per annum. We eîpeet continued shortage in the soap field during
1947.
Textile Industry
The textileindustry iii Canada uses some 31
million pounds of f ats and oils per annum; in
addition to consuming large quantities of special fats and textile soaps whirh likewise contain large quantities of fats and cils.
The types of oils used in the textile industry
are sulphonated castor oil, lard cil, oleic acid
and tallow. Spinners and weavers of cotton,
wool, fiax, silk and rayon fabrics employ large
quantities of cil as lubricants for the moving
parts of the looma. The use of fûts in the
textile industry is of immeasurable importance
in the manufacture of wool cloths. Here the
fýatty oil are required as a lubricant or softener for the wool fabrice -themselves beeause,
in consequence of the removal of the natural
f atty material by scouring, the fibres or "tops"
are rendered comparatively brittle. Treatment
with a suitable oil is required in order to reduce the liability of the fibre 10 snap during
the spirning and weaving processes.

arguments.
Hon. Mi. EULER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY:

not?

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I do not quite understand the unrest of senators who seem to be

in favour of this bill.

Wbiie tbe honourabie

gentleman from Waterloo

(Hon. Mr. Euler)

was speaking, na one at ail interrupted him. If
our friends wiil give me an opportunity to
discuss this matter I shail try, at the conclusion of my address, to answer any
questions.

The honourabie senator from Waterloo
referred ta the prices of butter and oleomargarine in the United States, and it is suggested
that there would be agreat economia advantage
in aur opening the doors to the production of
oleomargarine at the present time. I have
before me a communication from the Oiis
and Fats Administrator, under date of March
10, 1947, in wbich hie states:
At the time of writing, I am advieed that;
the wholesale butter price in the Eastern United
States is approximately 80 cents per pound and
the oleomargarine price 49 cents per pound.

Theoe prices are subjeet ta Borne variation,
depending on zone and market fluctuations.

I think the wbolesaie price of butter in
Canada is 40 cents--it varies in different
manufacturing zones-and the retail price
varies, fromn 43 ta 45 cents.
Now, wbat
economic benefit wouid those poor people
spoken of by my bonourabie friend framn
Toronto-Trinity (Han. Mr. Roebuck) derive
from tbe manufacture of oieomargarine,' when

they can get a better produet in butter?
Hon. Mr. EULER: If tbey cauld buy butter
nobody wouid abject. We are nat asking that
people be compelied ta buy margarine. Let
tbemn buy butter, if they can.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: The ration of butter in
Canada is about 6 ounces a week. or aimost
an ounce of butter a day. My hanourable
friend. in finding a remedy for wbat lie says is
a shortage of butter in tbis cauntry, proposes
tbat at this time we introduce oleomargarine.
As we ail know, butter is the most, digestible
of fats. It dissolves at the temperature af the
st-omacb and it is a most desirable food.

121

Han. Mr. BURCHILL: Wouid not any
other fat which is dissoived at the same
temperature be just as digestible?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Maybe, but I think the
natural product is best. We ail know the aid
saying, "Butter will flot meit in bis mouth".
But butter meits at the temperature of the
body and it is most digestible.
Hon. Mr. EUJLER: That is conclusive.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: There bas becn considerable reférence to the production of milk.
1 have had compiled a report on miik production in the whole of Canada during the years
1944-45-46. The report reads as foilows:

Honourable senators wiil note thât while
the production of cheese and butter bas
remaincd fairiy stable, the consumption of
miik bas increased each year. May I inform
my banourable friends that each quart of
milk cantains at least three per cent butter
fat and about an ounce and a baîf of butter,
so the chiid who drinks a quart of milk gets
that much butter in emulsion, the finest form
in which it can be taken. To the consumption of butter we might ýtherefore add the
consumption of milk.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: But the child cannot put miik on bis bread.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: No, but hie gets it just
the ane.
Hon. Mr. EULER: He, cannot eat it and
drink it at the saine time.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hie can soak bis bread

Hon. Mr. HALG: We miay have to do that.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: For years we have
been developing a bacon hog weighing about

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: When I was a lad
with ten. of a family around the table. and
my mother wanted fat, she would go to the

But with our entliusiasm to export bacon
over.seas we have materially affected the fat
situation in this country. Everybody from the
Maritimes knows that y ou should cook fish
with pork. Fish witb a few pork scraps and
potatoes males one of the best meals. Now

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hoar, hear.

The farmer in Canada bas no monopoly.
becatise more than half of the fats are
imported. He bas at the most only one-hiaîf
of the fats that are used.
Before the recent. war the importation of
vegetable ýoils into this country wvas getting us
into a rathýer serious situation. The sale of
lard. and tallow was unprofitable both for the
farmer and the dealer. I recaîl a splendid.
speech made by a member in tbe other bouse
on the question of ojîs wbich were brought in
from the tropics in tank steamýers to oompete
w'ith the products of our farms. He said he
would not put the Canadian farmer up against
the man w*ho need flot wear clothes, and who
could climb coco-nut, trees, tbrow the nuts
dowîi and send their oil into this country.
Thcre are several prescriptions available for
manufacturing oleomargarine.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUOK: You are flot going
to, ban the importation of coco-nuts, are you?
Hon. Mr. KLNLEY: Just hold on a minute,
please.
On the scîbjecýt of oleomargarine 1 should
like teo give a little history, which will perhaps
be better received than some of my honourOleomargarine wbicb
able friend's remarks.
wvas first known as "margarine", was -the culmination of experiments condiîcted by a
French cliemnist wbose object was to make a
substitutc for butter. The terme "margarine"
applied to -the finished produet, was derived
f.rom the Greek word margacites, meaning
pearl. The French product was a fatty subbecause of -its
ýfance, named "maigarin'
pearly lustre. It was later shown to be a
eutectic mixture of two common fats, stearin
and palmitin. It is recordcd that Napoleon
III awarded tbc originator a prize for bis succes in proýducing a substitute for butter. The
French cliemist pro.duced bais product by digestiVe ceactions with gasbric an.d mammary tis-sue

there arc a number of formulae for olcomargarine.

MARCH 12, 1947
My honourable friend said that oleomargarine would keep better than butter. You
can sait butter to keep pretty welI too.
Hon. Mr. EULER: May I ask when that
formula was iss~ued? I amn informed that
practically ail the manufacturers in the United
.States use vegetable oils almost entirely.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: That is true. An
editorial in the Globe and Mail the other day
indicated that in the United States about 94-5
pcr cent of the constituents of oleomargarine
were now vegetable oils. I presumne that that
.statement cornes frorn some authority, but
thiere are various formulae for oleomnargarine.
Five or six were presented to me, and I chose
th-is one because it was fairly reliable.
The honourable gentleman talked about
vitamins. It bas been found that there are
certain substances of unknown composition
normally present in certain food stuifs in
minute quantities, whose absence from diet
leads to a well defined morbid state; and in
addition to the carbohydrates, proteins, fats
and saits, certain accessory factors called
vitamnins are needed to satisfy the requireanents for energy and material for new growth.
These occur in natural foods and for convenience were termed fat soluble "A" and water
soluble "B" vitamins. Butter contains fat
soluble vitamins "A", "D", and "E" Oleomargarine is deficient in these vitamins, but
it is claimed that it bas been reinforced by
the addition of vitamins, a practice required
in some countries, and in others prompted by
competition. The question rises as to whether
the artificial vitamins are as good as those
that occur in natural foods.
Hon. Mr. EULER: One can secure aIl sorts
of documentary evidence.
Hion. Mr. KINLEY: There are many
explanations; I have several of them here.
The point is that oleomagraine is reinforced
and has not got the natural vitamnins.
Hon. Mr. EULER: May 1 show this to my
honourable frîend? It says the oleomargarine
contains 15,000 units.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Yes, of Vitamin "A",
which bas heen put into it for the purpose of

reinforcing the oleomargarine so that it will
contain some of the elements you get when
you cat butter.

Hon. Mr. EULER: It is not intended as a
You can still eat your
butter if you want to.

food, contains ail the vitamins, being deficient

substitute for butter.

A great amount of the oils which used to
corne to this country is not now available
because of the failure of the whale fisheries
and of the disrupted production in Malaya,
the East Indies, China and the Philippines.
The amount of oils available is, therefore, very
restricted. It seems to me that in view of
conditions of this kind, to try to, change the
situation now for the purpose of putting on
the market an article which bas been pro-

hibited in this country for years and years, is
like trying to secure something to which, in
our capacity of sharer of the supplies which
are available, we are not entitled.
Hon. Mr. EULER: On that principle you
would retain the prohibition for ever.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I wilI take up this
matter of prohibition. A great deal bas
been said in opposition to what is described
as a prohibitive act; but let us remember
that every day governments are prohibiting
something or other. I have here a book
published by Columbia University, entitled
Studies in History, Economica and Public
Law. It states that this question of the
manufacture and sale of oleomargarine has
been before legisiatures in the United States
for the past fifty years.
Hon. Mr. EULER:
Margarine is not
prohibited in any state of the Union.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY:
I would ask my
honourable friend to wait until I have
reviewed the history of the Iegislation. The
author states:
The st-ate and federal oleomnargarine laws are
an evolutionary produet. The firet state laws
passed between 1877 and 1884 wera inoperative
because the necessary machinery to enforce thern
was lacking. In 1884 the state of New York
created the office of Dairy Cornmisei4>ner, whose
special duty it was to ferret out violations of
the law and to prosecute offenders. This waa a
very important innovation iu the dairy and
food legislation of the United States. It had the
effect of enforcing not only the provisions of the
law pertaining to oleomargarine, but also those
pertaining to milk and other dairy and food
produets. Other states followed in the estab'lishment of the office of dairy and food comnmissioner.
The general principle upon which ahl of the
early state Iaws were haeed was restrictive;
that is, it restrictedl the manufacture and sale
of oleomnargarine to -a product which contained
no colouring inatter and required that it lie

marked or branded so as to inform, the purchsiser of its real character.
Then carne the period of prohibitory laws.
These prohibited the manufacture and sale of
oleomargarine in any formi whatsoever. This
principle was resorted to hecause the states
were unable to cope with the oleomargarine
frauds. The New York le,,islature, for instance,
in ý1884, authorizcd the §enate Committee on

Publie Health to make a thorougli investigation

mercantile importance of the littie places
in Canada, and I think in these days of
ugly bigness we can very well, without any
apology, support the smaller industry.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hlear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Now let me say a
word about prohibition. The big industries
of this country have enjoyed prohibitions, and
no one knows that better than rny honourable
friend who was at one turne the Minister of
Trade and Commerce (Hon. Mr. Euler). I
cannot import a second-hand automobile from
the United States. Why? Because that wou.ld
hurt our automobile ind.ustry. There is a prohibition that you cannot buy a second-hand
automobile in the Ujnited States and bring it
into Canada.
Hon. Mr. EULER: How about in Canada
itself ?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I will deal with that.
Hon. Mr. EULER: You will neyer get
there.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Go on. You are doing
ail right.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Then there is aspirin.
You cannot imuport -aspirin, foi can you import
vaseline.
Hon. Mr. EULER: You can manufacture it,
though.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: The manufacturer of
vaseline has a patent right and it is an offence
to bring the product into this country. Thé
moanufacturer here can charge accordingly.
That is what you cali1 big business.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The manufacture of
nothing except, oleomnargarine is prohibited in
Cana-da,
Hon. Mr. KINLEY - Surely my honourable
friend must be fair about this. You cannot
purchase a second-hand automobile ixi the
United States, because that would affect the
automobile industry in this country. Is that
not class legislation? You mnust buy what is
made in Canada. You cannot import vaseline; you must buy. what is made in Canada
hecause the makers dlaim they have a patent
right.
Is it big business that does not want class
legislation in this country? fig business does
not want us to support the fermer.
Hon. Mr. MURDOOK: Would the honourable senator say why Canada should be the
only country in the world that prohibits the
sale and manufacture of oleomargarine?

125

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: In this I arn only
concerned with Canada. Let the rest of the
world go by. I shall argue my point on the
conditions as they exist in this country.
Perhaps we are the best country in the
world.
Hon. Mr. EULER: An isolationist.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I arn not through with
this -talk of prohibition. The honourable senator from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duif) has
heard of embargoes. He knows that they
have been used in othcr countries. We also
know th-at by order in council other countries
are prohibiting importation. Great Britain
herseif prohibited the importation of Canadian apples. New Zealand, the country we
hear so rnuch about, got into such a bad
financial condition that she had to stop the
importation of rnany things.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Does the honourable
gentleman like these things he has been
reciting?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I arn stating facts.
Whether I like them or flot it does flot matter
much. I arn cornparing facts, not judgmng
them.
We hear a great deal about the United
Nations and free trade. There is a lot of
preaching which is not practised in the world
today, and those who talk of free trade hardly
know the situation as it exists. I believe in
freer trade, reciprocal trade and trade with
those who trade with us. It has been stated
that twelve million pounds of New Zealand
butter have heen brought into this country.
But I called up the Departrnent of Agriculture
this morning and was informed that they had
brought in only two million pounds, about
one day's supply.
Hon. Mr. EULER: More is to corne in.
Hou. Mr. XINLEY: When we deal with
New Zealand, we deal with a country that will
pay her bills.
It seems to me that Canada should do everything it cari to help the farmers and to see that
they are sustained and kept on the farms.
because the hardest thing in this world ia to
keep a mani on 'the farm. The farmer is the
backbone of our civilization, and while we
are dealing out protection to alrnost everybody else we must remember that he is
entitled to his just share.
My honourable friend said that 150,000 cows
were sold to the United States last year.
Hon. Mr. EULER. In the interest of
accuracy I point out that I said 118,000.

126

SENATE

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Well, that is trade
with the United States, and we need American
dollars. I do not know how many cows there
are in Canada but I suppose most of them
had a calf last year, and I imagine the cow
population would not be seriously reduced by
118.000 cows being shipped to the United
States for a high price. The United States
puts a quota on importations of Canadian
cattle. The difference between quotas and
prohibitions is only relative. I do not think
that Liberalism says that we cannot look after
the economie rigbts of our people. We must
do the things that will promote freedoms,
with economic advantage to the masses themselves. Uncontrolled freedom and economic
affairs cannot be left to an outmoded laissezfaire.
I say to you, honourable senators, that I
believe the present legislation is fair. I am
in favour of freerer trade and reciprocity and
I am in favour of doing what we can for other
people. but I am for Canada first and the
farmer, the backbone of the people of Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. JOHN P. HOWDEN: Honourable
senators, I am a medical man, a milk shipper
and, I hope. a free Canadian citizen.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: You are all rigbt.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: When this bill was
before the house a year ago I felt under a
moral obligation to support it, and, in spite
of everything, I feel precisely the same way
today. Honourable senators will be indulgent
with me, because I have neither notes nor
statistics, but I shall try to give the position
as I see it.
The demand today is for milk, and more
milk. The demand is net as great for butter
as it is for liquid milk. But liquid milk can
only be sold from certified stables withgranolithie floors, proper ventilation, sufficient sunlight, fresh water, drainage and all that sort of
thing. The number of barns in our part of
Canada conforming te these specifications is
limited. The milk that comes from certified
barns is sent to creameries, pasteurized and
homogenized, bott-ed and sold; but the milk
from the hundreds of little barns in which are
housed half a dozen cows-and honourable
members would shudder te look at serne of
tiese structures-is separated, the cream is
sold and the skim milk is fed to the calves and
pigs. The amount of cream that comes from
these smallcr barris all over the country is net
sufficient te make enough butter to feed the
people of Manitoba and thereabouts.

Only this morning I received a letter from
my home to the effect that the family bad
been without butter for nearly a week. They
have an abundance of coupons, but butter
is net to be had. That condition also prevailed during the time I was home. We would
put out butter coupons for the creamery man
morning after morning, and he would leave
no butter. The situation is a little better now
than it was a year ago, but a fair supply of
butter is not to be had in the country. The
price is very much better for fluid milk than it
is for cream, because of the by-product that bas
to be thrown out. To the farmer half a loaf is
better than no loaf, and hie gets what he can.
It does not pay to keep cows from which te
ship cream. Whyv are 118,000 cows sold out of
Canada to the United States each year?
Because it does net pay the farmer in Canada
to milk those cows. If it paid them to produce
milk they would keep the cows and sell the
milk.
The statement that there is net sufficient
butter produced in Canada te feed the people
has been substantiated. Then if we cannot get
butter to eat, why are we denied a substitute?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: Why has the government the right to tell me that I cannot buy
oleomargarine, if I am unable to get butter?
That is one thing I should like to know.
The original basis of oleornargarine was
oleo oil, beef fats and neutral lard, at the
same melting point as butter, with stearin
and palmitin taken out, and at odd times this
was mixed with a certain amount of the oil
from the peanut, coco-nut or cotton seed.
That was the beginning of oleomargarine. I
do net doubt that vegetable oils are used te
a much larger extent now. But if we cannet get vegetable oils we can still go back
to the animal fats and lard, which will taste
the same as modern oleomargarine. We are
net going to be stumped in this country
today if we can be supplied with a product
that is just as wholesome and palatable as
butter and that can be sold at half the price.
So long as we cannot get butter, neither this
nor any other government bas the right to
deny our people the privilege of obtaining a
substitute.
Hon. A. N. MeLEAN: Just to keep the
record straigbt I should like to refer to some
points raised by the honourable senator from
Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley). He
stated that we would only go further in debt
to the United States if we bought oils and
fats there te manufacture oleomargarine.

MARCH 12, 1947
The trade balance between Canada and
Newfoundland is very much one-sided in
favour of Canada. Newfoundlanders buy our
flour, wheat, hardware, lumber and many
other commodities but find great difficulty in
selling us any of the ir gaads. They have a
very fine oleomargarine factory, which 1
understand makes the product from whale
ail, seal oil and milk and enj oys a very gaad
name. During a recent visit to the island I
found that I could not distinguish their margarine from butter.
The honourable gentleman from Queen'sLunenburg stated that there was a great
shortage of fats and ails throughout most of
the world. It is truc that we bled this country almast white by shipping fats and ails
ta Europe. But it seems strange that Narway
has a sufficient supply of edible ails ta offer
them ta this country. During the Germian
occupation of Norway a pracess was perfected wherehy fish ail cauld be refined inta
fats for human consumptian. The Germans
got rid of the unwanted impurities, and
refined -the praduet dawn ta its pure form.
This process would be very valuable ta
Canada, especially as sa much fish ail is
produced an the Pacifie coast. The fat from
the fish can be refined inta shartening ar ail.
The oul bas been examined in this country
and, I understand, found ta be af fine quality.
If Europe is shart af ail the question might
well be asked: Why are they offering it ta this
country? Why do the.y flot hand their process
over to us, sa that we may apply it ta the
west coast or any other part of Canada? If
that were done we could supply aur own fats
and ails and have some ta ship ta Eurape.
We were tald hy the White Paper that any
processes developed during German occupation would be handed over to the United
Nations free fram any nianopoly, cartel or
toil-gate rights. Here is a case where we should
have the henefit of a process developed by
the Germans. I have discussed the question of
this formula or monopoly with different
departments.
Hlon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourable
gentleman a question at this point? Is it nat
truc that Norway halds the rights ta this
process?
Hon. Mr. MeLEAN: Yes, Norway does.
When the Germans evacuated that country
they were said to have taken a copy of the
formula with them.
Han. Mr. HAIG: But they did not do it.

Hon. Mr. McIEAN: A search made in the
United States and British zones has revealed
nathing. Whether the formula went into the
Russian zone we do not know.
Han. R. B. HORNER: Hanaurable senators,
I should like ta say a few words ta my hanaurable friend from Winnipeg. H1e is situated in
a certain area knawn as the whale milk area,
and farmers who live outside that area are
flot allowed ta ship milk in.
Hon. Mr. HOW.DEN: That is nat the way
it is with us.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: If I wished ta ga into
the production of milk I could nat secure a
sales quota unless I purchased fram somebady
who already had a cantract.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: That is truc.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I am glad my figures
on the sale af cattie ta the United States are
confirmed; 118,000 was more than I had'
estimated. A large amount is being paid out
to subsidize the milk producer, but in xny
apinion there is no cheaper faod for children
than milk. If the farmer had been assured
of 55 or 60 cents, which is a reasonable price,
in view cf the cost af labour and feed, we
would not be in 'the position that we are in
today.
As ta cabtle goîng across the line, I have
camplained af the position in Western Canada. Beef is selling in Chicago at 28, 29 and
30 cents live, weight; hogs, at 30 cents live
weight. There is no exact weight; they may
be 200 or 300 pounds, and are flot kept
down as in aur West. Our price is 17 or 18
cents for choice dressed bacon hags, as compared with 30 cents across the line. We in
the West have been deprived of the market
we once had in the United States for aur surplus range cattie. I laaked aver several herds
in Eastern Canada that were going ta the
United States. They would not be milking
after two months; they were picked because
they waul only milk for a short time, and
would be turned into heef.
The shartage of help on the farmns has been
a great difficulty. There are plenty of directions in which western praducers are restricted. Machinery in Western Canada casts
so much marethan in the East. For instance,
we have ta pay $460 for a binder; and a
binder is a necessity if you are going ta keep
cattle. In view of the high price of these
imýplements of production, I hold that a higher
price for butter is justified. Give us 60 cents
a pound and, I maintain butter will be produced 'in this country.

IMMIGRATION
MOTION AGREED

TO

The Senate resumed fromn Tuesday, March
11, the ad-journed debate on the motion of
the Hon. Mr. Roebuck that the Standing Commrttee on Immigration and Labour be authorrzed and direc'tcd to examine into the Immigration Act (R.S.C. Cirapter 93 and amendments) its operation and administration and
the eircumstances and conditions relating
tii etto.

MARCH 13, 1947
Ion. CAIRINE R., WILSON; Honourable
H
senatorsSoine Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. WILSON: It is regrettable that
the senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
is flot presenit to secondI this motion, and in
the circurnstances I amn grateful, to the senator
frorn Toron.to-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
for asking me -to do so. Immigration is a subject about whicli I have heen mucli concerned
for more, than the past eight years; and I
might mention that ever since the Munichi
Agreement I have been Chairnian of the
Canadian National Committee on Refugees.
The Senate Committee on Immigration
served a very useful purpose last session, and
undoubtedly as a resuit the members of this
house and the public are better informed than
before about the extrerne restrictions of our
present system of immigration. If the committee is authorized to function this session we
shahl follow its programme with more understanding and even more interest than we did
last year.
I expect that most of us listened to President Trumnan when lie spoke over the radio
last niglit. I was struck by lis specifie mention of the importance of strengthening the
causes of democracy in Europe. Canada bas,
I fear, been very negligent, for at the present
time, about two years after the close of the
war, those people who showed their opposition
to Nazismn, Fascisrn and Communism are stihi
languishing in displaced persons camps in
Europe, or wandering from country to country,
asking merely for an opportunity to rebuild
their shattered lives. People of the type *now
in D.P. camps are flot likely to be available
for -immigration later on. I think many Canadians fail to -understand the quality of the
people who are ea.ting out their hearts and
deteriorating morally and physically after two
years o! waiting. We gave them high hopes
for the future, a.nd now they wonder what to
make of our promises.
I should like particularly to stress the fact
that the problern of immigration-whjch has
to do with a long-range policy-7is distinct
from thiat of refugeea and displaced persons.
This is a humanitarian problem. Undôubtedly
we would build up a stronger opposition to
those very " isms" against which we took up
arms, if for the people who have siuffered
for years we showed sympathy by more than
words.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: H ear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. WILSON: The senator frorn
Toronto-Trinity alluded to the excuse that
lack o! shipping has made it impossible to
83168-9

bring. in rnany immigrants.

129

That exçuse is
no longer valid. Now we talk of lack o!
housesý to accommodate a large number o!
new-comers; -but we fail to realize that these
people with their own hands would be ready
to assist in building bouses.
A cabinet minister recently referred to the
fact that we have too few doctors and nurses
iin Cengda, lbut hie oniitted to state that arnong
prospective immigrants in the D.P. camps
are sonie of the most highly qualified
physicigns and surgeons in Europe. Our
hospitals are suffering sadly from the shortage
of prope.rly trained nurses and ward aids,
while in the camps to whIiph I refer mgny
women well qualified for this partirular field
eagerly await permission to corne here.
The United Kingdorn recently brought. ini
2,000 young Baltic wornen, who agreed to
corne without their families to look after cases
in the sanatoria. They have proved such
an asset that 5,000 more have been asked for.
But, like the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity, I wonder wby we have been giving
a preference to single men and wornen. This
seems to me contrary to our hitherto pronounced policy. When I irnplored the Immigration Brandi to allow certain people into
Canada, the usual reply was that only familles
were wanted. At that time it was occasionally
possible to get in a man or woman, or perhaps
two- if they were the last members o! their
i.amilies. But now we are asking men and
women to corne without their farniies. I
feel very strongly that the men who would
corne to work in Canada at this tirne, and
leave in Europe tbeir relatives for whorn
they have undertaken responsibilities, are
not quite the type that we want here.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. WILSON: It sounds a littie
too muchl ike irnporting indentured labour,
and we have some reason to fear that. On
the other hand, a man or a woman who
cornes with lis or hier farnily -is likely to
estabhsh a permanent home and becorne a
good Canadian citizen.
The honourable senator front TorontoTrinity said thgt hie wondered why women
had not protested against the discrirninatory
practioe of perrnitting the wives and fiancées
of Canadian men to corne here, wheireas no
sucl privilege is extended to the fiancés of
our women. I know that in the papers there
have been many protests by and on behalf
of service wornen whose promised husbands
have to date been refused entry into this
country.
There was some reference also to the silence
of the minister in charge o! imm-igration. I
arn afraid I do not agree witli what was

The Right Hon. W. L. Mackenzie King, P.C.,
M.P., LL.D., D.C.L.
Prime Minister,
Ottawa, Ontario.
My dear Prime Minister:
Ata meeting of the ]Refuee Committee on
Jannary 20, refereuce was made to a front-page
report in the Globe and Mail of January 14, of
a speech hy the Honourable J. A. Gl en, in Winnipeg. on January 13. The minister was quoted
as saying:"We have aiready doue more than any country so far in assuming responsibility of taking
.efugees from Europe."
The mrembers of the committee fonnd it difficuit ta understand what tue Honourable Mr.
recognized and wýere pleased
Gien meant. We aIl
with the active part, played by the Canadian
at the meetings of the Special Comndelegation
mittee on Refugees, in London, and of those of
the Economie and Social Council at Lake
Snccess. We hiope that, in pursuance of a policy
implied thiere. Canada will accept a generous
share of the displaced persans. We cannot,
how-ever, hionestly dlaimn that Canada bas, as yet,
done more than other countries.
During the war Canada received 3,500 refugees, as stated by the Hononrable Paul Martin
at meetings of the Economical and Social Council. We also commend the admission of 4,00
Poles, but understand that the number of displaced persons is not diminished thereby, since
the Polish army is not classified as displaced
persons by the United Nations.
We should, I think, realize that by admitting into Canada soldiers snffering from tuberculosis wbo have been tbe responsibility of
tbe United Kingdom, we are rehieving the
British people of some of the heavy responsibilities that they have been bearing.
The Immigration Department does not issue
statistics concerning the refugees per se, but the
number can be approximately estimated by
conniting the admission to Canada between 1933
and 1945, of ýail nationalities subjeet to Nazi
During these twelve years the
persecution.
total admissions of sncb nationalities numbered
17,869. Compared with this we understand that
the United States accepted something over 200,000 and the United Kingdoma offered baven to
more than 150,000. Sweden and Switzerland
also took large niumbers during the war. Those
admitted to Switzerlaud numbered 280,000 and,
altbough many vwere there only temporarily,
100,000 stayed there over two years.
We are very glad that the Department of
Immigration is arranging to send immigration
officiais into assembly centres in Germany. This,

hiowever, is part of the usual procedure for inspectional purposes and the number of displaced
persons whio have relatives in Canada as yet
only conditionally approved, is, we believe, 980.
Since this letter was written there bas been
a slight relaxation.
This is surely flot doing more than the United
States, whose consular offices were opened in
Frankfort f ollowing President Trunan's Directive issued in December, 1945, and whose admissions of displaced persons between May and
Octoher, 1946, numbered 4,787.
My oniy purpose in writing to you on this
matter is to express the hope that the Minister's
statement xviii be followed by generous action.
Canada is in a position, and lias both resources
and facilities, to do more proportionately than
other countries. We trust that the Government
will announce immediately a definite poliey to
bring refugees and displaced persons to Canada
just as soon as practical arrangements can be

The Rt. Hon. W. L. Mackenzie King,
Prime Minister of Canada,
Ottawa, Ontario.
Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
On May 10 last, the National Council of the
Y.W.C.A. addressed to you a letter urging
your government to take the lead among nations
in offering to admit to Canada a substantial
number of Europe's displaced persons. In the
noxtls since tiien, there- bas beeu an increasing puhlic a-wareness of the need for an overail eouisideration of Canada's immigration
policy, with which we hope your goverument
is proeeeding. However, we regard the problem
of displaced persons as an aeute and immediate
problem. the settiement of which need not,
and inideed cannot, wait for the revision of
Canada's immigration laws, but whicb should
be deait with hy special provisions.
Your goverument has r-ecently taken two

offer to certain classes of relatives to this
country, and to your recent announcement
that immigration inspectors will be sent to
varions centres in Europe to expedite the
movement of these persons. We are also proud
of the part which the Canadian delegations
have played in the varions international
gatberings at xvhicb the prohlema of refugees
has been diseussed.
These are certainly steps in the right direction but we wisb to submit in aIl respect, Mr.
Prime Minister, that they do flot go f ar
enough. Thousands of persons are still Iangnishing in camps in Europe, some of wbom
have already endured years of horror in German concentration camps. They are rapidly
losing all hope, aIl will to survive. If they
could know that there was prospect for a
future in Canada, or somewhere on eartb ontside a camp, even tbough because of transportation difficulties and other problemns it

ation as we suggested in our earlier letter,
may we suggest that yen give earnest consideration to the following alternatives:
1. Widen the categories of relatives admissible, or even go so f ar as to admit persona
sponsored by groups and organizations.
2. Select groupe of cpeople for whom there
*s real need in Canada, sucli as skilled worka
men in the building trades, household workers,
etc., and offer them an opportunîty to emigrate.
In support of such moves, we advance the
following arguments, over and above the most
compelling one of common humanity:
1. Shortage of skilled labour being one of -the
factors contributing to the housing shortage,
such newcomers would relieve rather than aggravate the present situation.
2. Eventually these displaced persons must
be resettled somewhere and presumably the resettlement will be an international responsibility
for whieh Canada will have a share. If this
resettlement on an international basis is postponed for some time, the most desirable persona
will have been selected by other nations and
those who are lef t will have been so Ion g ili
camps that it will be difficuit for themn to adjust
to normal if e. It seems, therefore, that it
would be to Canada's advantage to take some
initiative in selecting future immigrants from
this group promptly.
3. Canada has contributed through UUl'RRA
and the Intergovernmental Committee to the support of these displaced persona in camps, and
presumably muet continue to do so as part of lier
international responsibility. Would it not be
better for Canada if a large percentage of lier
contribution could be used toward the resettiement of displaced persons in Canada, which
would be a step toward the real solution of the
problemn, rather than simply toward their maintenance in their present circumstances, which is
generally admitted to be no solution at aIl?
4. As we indicated in our previous letter, we
would favour the admission to Canada of displaced persona of various racial and religious
backgrounds, with no special preference for aný
one group. However, as the total number of
refugees is reduced, the particular pressure on
Palestine will be lessened and anything which
could lie doue to alleviate the friction at that
point would certainly be a major contribution
toward the peace of the world.
The peace of the world is, we know, Mr. Prime
Minister, your fondest desire as it is ours. To
us the pliglit of Europe's displaced persons constitutes a menace for the future as well as a
reproach to the present and we urge that your
government take swif t and positive action which
will be an example to other nations as well as
an actual contribution to the solution of the
problem.
Most sincerely,
Mrs. Walter C. Rean,
President.
P.S. We are sending copies of this letter to
the various members of your cabinet who are
most concerned.
On February 7 last year a deputation representative of Canada presented to the Prime
Minister and the minister in charge of immigration a bTief which in part states:
The regulations in regard to admission of
relatives of Canadians are still, in our opinion,
too restrictive. One of the main reasoens for this

83168-91

131

attitude is that we fear that the strict application breaking will, among other things, necessitate
the of themn up of f amilies if taken advantage
of to any great extent.
For this reason we respectfully petition that
orders in council P.C. 2071 and 371'/47 be modified to include:
"'AIl immediate relatives of any persona
legally admitted to and resident in Canada who
are in a position to receive and care for snob
relatives."
(By "immediate relative" we moen to include!
up to and including first cousins and their chuldren.')
Our constituent members are monthly sendingr
thousands of dollars for the meagre support of
their relatives in Europe which miglit well be
spent in establishing these relatives in Canada.
This money is not only a severe drain on the
individual families supporting thëir relatives,
but the sum total, which is considerable, miglit
better lie used for the establishiment of these
p~eople here as Canadian citizens, and for the
development of Canada's natural resources,
through the efforts of these relatives.
The pliglit of at least 800,000 refugees, diaplaced persons and orphans is se desperate that
quick action is necessary if any considerable
numbers are to obtain a haven of refuge in
Canada. So we respectfulîy plead for immediate
action on our request,
We are, however, convinced that our present
petition for the immediate admission of "aIl
imnmediate relatives" of persona legally admitted
to and resident in Canada, requires merely a
change in the order in council, and is in the
national interest of Canada, and should not
create any undue opposition, since the reasons
for granting this request are justifiable in the
best intereats of Canada and on humanitarian
grounds.
We would urge that adequate and ample inspection f acilities be provided at readily accessible points in Europe.
We also respectfully ask that clauses 2, 3, and
4 of P.C. 371/47 receive a generous interpretatien.
Respectfully submitted.

She described how discouraging it was to have

te be a plumber." Months later, perhaps, he
would have to be told, "There is ne epening
for plumbers, se you had better qualify as an

Hon. G1RAY TURC EON: Bonourable senators, 1 was very glad te notice that in ber

are the vital necessity of bringing about a
large increase in our population by means of
immigration, and the problem et refugees and
displacod persons. Though they are te sorne
degree elosely connected, I teed that the honourable senator was right in treating tbrmi
separately, and. I propose te do the saine in
rny few remarks this afternioon.
Frankly, henourable senators, I suppose
there is ne une in ail Canada more deeply
anxious than I arn that Canada's population
should be very materially inereascd. I arn
thoroughly cenvinccd that Canada, in ber own
interest, must imrnediately open ber doors

reason why I, wbe was only recently summoned te this aug-ust chambor, arn very glad
that the Sonate is eonsidering the appointment ot a committce te facilitate, as was donc

on this great question.
With y our j)ctrisien. honourable senaters,
may 1 sqy a h iv words about the whole prob1cmn ot retugees and displaced persons? The
rnany tlîousands et Canadian families who

M.ARtA13, 1947
have close -relatives confined iu the refugee
camps, of Europe deserve our deepest sympathy. I wish to' express te them, through
the medium of this chamber, a word of hope
and encouragement, and, to tell them: soinething of the story" of the refugee problema
today.
A great honour was conferred upson me
when 1 was made Canadian delegate to various
international conférences on refugees.
I
represented Canada at' the -two-months'rmeeting in London of the special comrnittee for
refuger.s of tweuty nations;. 1 was Canada's
delegate at the Economic and Social Council
when it deait with irnmigratioue in New York.
A special commhittee of ten nations was set up
in*London to deal with the finaheces of the
propoeed international refugee organiaion
and I again represented, Canada. From these
faets those who listen to and read rny remarks
will know -that I at least speak with saine
practical knowledge of what haa-,taken place.
To our people who have close relâtives in
the camps overseas I sayý that had,it net been
for Canada, the United Kingdoini aud sotie
others of the western powers. the reftigee pYobýlem would -have been solved long ago, but not
in the mauner iu whieh, we are 4ttemptTug te
deal with it today. At the begînning of these
conferences the countries of origin stated
defiuitely that there would . be, no refugee
problem if the refugees were sent home. It
was only ou the insistence of the .western
powersthat, thesecommittees were set up and
finally mýet with at least seine .degree of
success in protecting refugees through international auspices.
Speaking for Canada in London at the
special committee for refugees, 1 stated that
under no circuinstances would this country
participate in a policy for the compulsory
repatriation of houa fide refugees aud d-isplaced persons. It was only following this
d'efinite assertion that the other countrjes
agreed not to demandcompulsory repatriation.
Canada is, therefore, in, duty bound to do
everything in hier power to help in the
re-establishmeut of thiese refugeies.
I am
thinkiug not nierely in ternis of what is coinmon.ly oalled the "benefit of asylum", for we
are obligated to take these people among
us and to assimîlate theru, to whýatever degree
is possible, into our ecouomic and social life.

Trhe Rtoman Catholie bishops of thé prolvince :of Qoebec recently made the following
stàteflieut:
1The bishopsi of the province of Quebec, in
union with the sentiments of His Holiness Pope
Pius XII, rejoice tbat the Canadian government
supports the cause of displaced aud homelesa
peoples iu. several European countries by permitting them to corne aud establish themselvea

However) they would like to caîl to mix1d th4tý
even in the exercise of this work of charity and
in the -establishmnent of au immigration poliey,
one should nlot lose sight of the higher necessity
of safeguarding social peace in our coenstitutio*r
ally Christian country, and of building its future
prosperity above aM upon a healthy f amUiy
policy.
There bas been a great deal of discussion,
and properly so, of many regulations thàt
have been issued by the Government of
Canada. I wôuld point out that -any action
taken up to this time *with resrJect to refugees
and displaced persons has been very largely
favourable te family life and family connections; and there is not the slightest cause
for fear that the bringing into this countrjr
of large numbers of refugees and displaced
persons. will. in any way disrupt either ôour
family 11f e or our cultural if e.
There was some mention today-and 1
approve of it very strongly--of the humamitarian aide of this problein of refugees and
displaced persons. 1 must say that any
réference to "humanitarianism" at the varieus
refugee conferences angered delegates fronià
the countries of origin. They dlaim that their

a134

SENATE

humanitarianism is just as deep as that of
the people of the western countries. As one
who bas experienced the atmosphere of these
conferences, I want to say that I do nlot
agree with the general assumption that the
eastern countries, the so-called countries of
origin, want refugees returned home solely
that they may wreak vengeance upan thema.
1 also had the honour of representing
Canada at a twenty-nation conference dealing
with the reconstruction of devastated areas.
That whole question is closely connected
with the problem of refugees and displaced
persons. Take Potand, if you wiIl, as an
instance. While in Warsaw we were taken
to the ruins of the ghetto. There, as ail
,honourable members know, were committed
the most atrocious crimes upon human beings
since the dawn of history. We wcre told,
as we walked through the ruins, that we were
trampling upon what was largely human
ashes. 1 do not have to recait to you the
history of Poland, a nation that during 150
years bas suiffered from the aggression and
domination of large neiglibouring states.
During the recent war she loat 6,000,000 people.
It is very liard to replace 6,000,000 people.
A very large percentage of refugees are Potes,
and 1 am thoroughly convinced that Poland
wants them repatriated because she needs
them in her efforts at reconstruction. Poland
is trying to buitd up secondary industry. A
large part of lier former territary, inctuding
ber oit wetls, was taken from her at the end
of the war and given ta Russia. There has
been a migration of possibly another million
people from the eastern part of Poland,
which lias been given to Russia, towards the
western part of Poland, where lier coal mines
and iron and steel works are located. That
of itself is a considerable migration; and
Poland wants lier people in the refugee camps
back, chiefly sa that she may avait herself of
their labour and of whatever skill remains
witli them in spite of the atrocities of the war.
This brings me to the question of immigration into Canada, apart altogether from -that
other question of wliat Canada, in view of the
stand she took in the working out of the
refugee probtem, should do with the refugees.
Tlie honourable senatar from Rockcliffe (Hon.
Mrs. Witson) mentioned irrigation. Irrigation
has been financed, partty with Canadian
money, in lands that are foreign to us. Yet
when soîne of us advocate irrigation in parts
of our own country where it is essentiat, we
meet with objections to the expenditure of
much muney for this purpose. I woutd point
-out that Canada entered into the United
Nations Conference on Food and Agriculture

at Hot Springs, Virginia, in 1943, where it was
resolved, with our concurrence, that certain
great works should be carried out. The conference proposed the adoption of poticies of
settiement and the development of a programme applicable to the economic, sociat,
agricultural and geographical needs of the
nations. Among the means of development of
production recommended we find irrigation,
flood prevention, water storage reservoirs, and
proper drainage facilities.
I allude to this principatly because a good
deal of our current opposition to immigration
is based upon a fear, in addition to others that
I have mentioned, that we may be going into
another economie recession. My own opinion
is that we ýire not, and that if we permit aurselves to do so we miglit just as welt give up,
as individuals and Canadian citizens, any
effort to con.tinue in aur way of life. One of
the factors which coutd throw us into a socalled depression is a serious degree of inflation. But if we do what at the Hot Springs
oonference we soundly undertook to do-make
a proper expenditure of money atong the lines
I liave mentioned-this will of itself bring
about sucli an expansion of industry and of
production tha:t inflation wilI be avoided.
Part of the opposition to resettlement of
refugees in Canada and other western countries cames fram the Soviet Union. What I
said about the reasans why countries of arîgin
desire the ret.urn of their nationals applies as
mucli to the Soviet Union as ta Poland. Russian refugees, particularly those fram the
Baltic states and the Ukraine, are anti-Communistic and determinedly apposed -ta the
policy of the Russi-an government, and that
government fears that if Vhey scttled in Canada
or ýthýe United States or any other American
country they would cre-ate there a bitterness
against Russia.
I have sai at conference tables, and I repeat
here that Canada from one acean ta the other
ia so definitely apposed ta Conununism that
the inclusion in aur population of a few of
these refugees would nat noticeably increase
opposition ta the Communistic system of
gavernment. I am unalterably opposed ta
Communism, but the settiement in Canada of
refugees from the Baltic States, the Ukraine,
and Byelorussia would nat be intended as an
unfriendly gesture toward Russia, and would
not lessen in the slightest degree aur friendly
relations with ber. The Russian ecanomic and
political system would not suit Canadians at
att, but we want aur friendly relations with the
Soviet Union ta continue.

MARCH 13, 1947
We wish to bring these refugees to Canada
partlyr because in Europe they constitute an
international problema which Canada is trying
to help to solve; but our main reason is that
we badly need more population, and they
would make good citizens. Whether or not
other provinces are desirous of increasing their
population I cannot eay, but certainly sny own
province of British Columbia is. British
Columbia, like the Maritime Provinces, proteste against the concentration of industries in
Ontario and Quehec. We are demanding that
this concentration be broken up and that
industries, be distributed acrose the country.
I have asked thîs question in British Columbia
and I ask it here today: How caon our province
with its present population compete in industrial efforts with Ontario?
When I first came to, Ottawa, as a miemaber of another place, 1 talked with many
indufftrialists, particuliarly those connected
with the textile industry, to sec if they
could establish factories in northern and
central British Columbia. I found that they
would have been willing to do so if we
had had more population. They said: "We
cari supply the domestic market fromn our
present plant, so why should we make a
capital expenditure to build another plant?"
We can only get more industries in Western
Canada and the Maritime Provinces by
increasing our markets for industrial production, and that cannot be accomplished except
through immigration and the natural increase
in population.
I am certain, honourable senators, that if a
committee is appointed and works as last
year's committee did, it will arouse public
opinion in Canada to such a point that the
official policy of Canada on immigration will
be materially changed. If this is done we
shaîl be started on the way towards what I
think is the greatest role that this august
chamber could play, namely, that of making
certain that Canada shall not again go into
a serious economic recession. For the danger
15 that if such a recession should occur, Canada as we know it might be destroyed. On
that thought, honourable senators, I close;
and I thank y-ou for your courtesy.
The motion was agreed to.
PRIVATE BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN moved the second
reading of Bill H, an Act to incorporate
Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway
Company.

135

He said: Honourable senators, altho.ugh thie
is a private bill I think it ie of more than
usual interest, particularly to the members of
this chamber whose Committee on Natural
Reseurces cnnducted last ses~sion an investigation into the mining industries of the country
and presented a most valuable report. For
that reason I propose to give a somewhat
longer explanation of this measure than is
commonly given upon the second reading of
private bille.
This bill is presented by what are normally
called the Hollinger intereste; that is, those
intereste associated with the Hollinger Consolidated Gold Mines Limited, which, as is
well known, is one of the largest producers of
gold in Canada. Their mine is situated at
Timmins, Ontario. The name "Timmins"
itself inevitably hrings. to mimd the story of
great mining developments in this country
in the past, and bionourable senators will
observe with some interest that the naines
of two members of the Timmins family are
included among -the applicants for the.
incorporation of this company.
These incorporators, seek the power to construct and operate a railway, the location of
which will be found by reference to section
7 of the bill. That section reads:
The company m-ay lay out, construct and
operate a railway starting at a point on the
St. Lawrence River, somewhere between the
Riviere Marguerite and Riviere Moisie in the
province of Quebec; thence in a northerfy direction f ol.lowing the valley of the Riviere Moisie
or the vaileys of the Riviere Moisie and
Wacouno River to the southerri boundary of
Labrador; thence in a northerly direction to a
point on the northern boundary of Labrador in
the vicinity of Ruth Lake provided that authority be obtained from Nýe;rfoundland for the
construotion ani operation of this section of the
railway; thence northwesterly to a suitable port
on Ungava Bay.
The incorporators ssek also very wide ancillary powers. They request the power to own
and operate vessels, wharves and docks; to
generate and distribute electric power; to
operate a service of traction motors or cars;
to construct and maintain oul pipe Uines; and
to own and operate commercial aircraft of ail
types.
This railway, as wiil be seen fromn the
section that I read, is to be situated partly in
the province of Quebec and partly in Labrador,
the latter being a part of the colony of Newfound-land. I am informed its length will be
approximately 350 miles, which is slightly
longer than the distance between the cities of
Montreal and Toronto. The total cost is estim-ated to be in the neighbourhood of 50 million
dollars. F*rom my remarks honourable senators

SENATE
will appreciato that this bill has a wide ambit,
and is of much greater national interest than
the u-sual private bill which cornes before this
chamber. 1 propo-e to classify wvhat I have
to say under thrcc heading-: first, region
affected; second, the interest of the promoters
in thiat region; and third, what the promoters
hope to accomplish with the belp of this bill.
The region affected is in the extreme northeasterly part of the province of Quebec, commonly known now as New Quebec, and is
bounded on the south by the Lower St.
Lawrence river and the Guif of St. Lawrence,
and on the north by Ungava Bay and
Hudson Strait. To the east is the western
boundary of the Newfoundland section of
Labrador. This vast area of 300,000 square
miles is unsurveyed and littie known; it is
bleek, forbidding and practicaily uninhabited.
Up to the present time no conditions have
existed which would permit of human habitation there. Some bonourable members may
be acquainted with the district. 1 had a slight
glirnpsc of it a littie over a year ago when
returning by air from the Preparatory Commission of the United Nations in London.
Our airpiane followed the northern route and
flew without stopping over that great Labrador
airport at Goose Bay; for the next two or
three hundred miles it passed over the territory
which is the subject of this bill. So far as 1
could observe from the air on tbat sunny
winter afternoon, it is a barren and desolate
land of mountains, lakes, rock and muskeg,
aimost compieteiy devoid of any top soul
suitable for agriculture. It lacks that covering
of forest which beautifles so much of our
northern country.
My second heading is the interest of the
promoters in this region. The promoters are
in the mining business in a big way, and
aiways on the watch, as they should be,
for new areas of developrnent. In 1942 they
obtained from the goveroment of the Province of Quebee the right to explore and
prospect for, though flot to mine, minerai
in an area of 3.900 square miles. They concuirrently obtainod similar rights from the
goverument of Newfoundland in an ares of
20,000 square miles in ttie contiguous territory
of Labrador. During the past three years.they
hav e spent apprcxirnately $310,000 in exploration w oik. I mention this Iact to show that
they aie serious in thcir undertaking. It is a
rather large ainount to spend in view of the
fact that the country is far froma ordinary
communications, and subiject to such severe
weather conditions that it can ho explored

diiring a period of only three rnonths in the
vecar from the middle of June to the middle
of September.
In 1946 the prornoters obtained from the
Quebec legisiature a special act under which
the duration of their right to prospect for
mineraIs w-as extended. They were granted
the right, to select, after exploration, an area
of 300 square miles and to mine for minerais
in that area for a period of twenty years,
renewable
for three further twenty-year
periods. The act provides that thcy must
commence their mining operations before
January 1, 1958, and makes them subjeet to
payrnent of certain annual rentals and other
conditions whicli are flot germane to the bill
now before the bouse. Under that act they
spent in 1916 a further $225,000 on exploration.
Thus, their total expenditure on exploration in
this territory sinco 1942 bas been $565,000. I
should add that tbey obtained from the Newfoundland government a similar rigbt to
select and then to mine a thousand square
miles of territory in the contigunus area of
Labrador for a period of ninety years.
Now may I deal with the third phase of my
remarks, as to what the promoters expeet to
accomplish and why tho bill is introduced at
this time? Honourable senators will understand that tbis project does not involve
precious metals--gold or silvter. One dues nul
spend $50,000,000 to build 350 miles of railway for the sake of a gold mine. Precîous
metals can ho brought out by airplane in the
summer and by dog teamn in the winter. No.
What is involved here is iron ore.
The
exploratory work done so far gives important
indications of iron ore. I arn informed that
with the continuation of work there is hope
of estahiishing an iron ore deposit of a salisfactory grade and of such quantities as to
warrant production.
The primary reason for the introduction of
this bill Ns that a railway is neessary to transport iron ore frorn the mine to the seaboard;
docks are required for loading purposes, and
ships are needed to carry the ore to its ultimate destination in the markets of the world.
In addition to the estirnated cost of $50,000.000
for the construction of the railroad, it is said
that a furlher $10,000,000 will be necessary for
equipmcnt such as speciai ore cars, docks,
loading facilities and ships. One must bear
in mind that iron ore is a coînmodity of great
bulk and lowv price. To justify these enormous
expendituros, I arn advised, thero must ho a
know n quantity of at least 300.000,000 tons
of commercial ore, with a daily production and
rail moveorent of 40,000 tons-the equivalent
of ton 60-car trains per day.

contains one or two spécial features to which
1 think the attention of honourabie members
sbould be cfrawa. May I refer~ again ta section
7, dealing with 'the location of the railway?
Honourable members will 'see that it ssks for
p erm 'ission to build a railway starting at a
point on the St. Lawrence river, somýewhere
bétween the Riviere Marguerite and the Riviere
Moisie. 'That wording is a littie more vague
than one finds in the usuai bill to authorize
the construction of a raiiway. The reason is
that it has flot yet been possible -to determine
the Most economical location for the port
fromn which the railway should start, and
further surveys will have to be made of the
ice flow, tide and other conditions.

which ailows the promoters five years in which
to co mmence the construction oi the raijway
and tan years within which to complete it. The
periods generally specified in acta of this kind
are two years for the commencement of ýconstruction, and five years for compietion; but
1 think that in the rather unusuai ciTeumstances of this case honourable members will

should be somewhat extended.

INSPECTION AND SALE BILL
CONCURRENCE

IN AMENDMENTS

The Sonate proceeded to the consideration
of the arnondrents made by tho Standing
Cornrittee on Banking and Commerce to
Bill 8, an Act to amend the Inspection and
Sale Act, 1938.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: In the absence of the
chairman of tho comrnittee (Hon. Mr.
Beaurogard), I would move, for hirn, that the
amondmonts ho now concurred in.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourablo sonators, I arn probably the hast porson in the
bouse to question the moaning of legat
language, but I find in this bill something
which, to me, is attogethor peculiar. Listenl
to this:
12A: In this part, unless the context otherwise roquires,
(a) "export" moans send out of Canada or
out of one province to another province.
In other words, we have nine provinces in
this Dominion of ours, and we are now going
to talk about exporting potatoca from Prince
Edward Island to Ontario or Quebec, or
exporting apples froma British

Columbia to

Ontario or Quebec. It seenis to me that it is
attogether wrong for us in this Sonate to
undertake to define the word "export" as a
matter of transport or shipping from one
province of this great Dominion to another.
If we can deat with the amendments in the
absence of the chairman of the committeo, I
presumne I can present a motion in the absence
of its seconder, who asked me te present it.
I therefore move, seconded hy the honourable
senator from Sorel (Hon. Mr. David), that
this question of amendments to Bill 8 ho net

now deait with but that the bill be referred
back to the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce with instructions to amend
section 12A (a) by substituting for the word
"ýexport" in relation to trade between provinces, the words "transport, ship or transfer"
and thus preserve the well-.known meaning of
the word "export". I arn sure we are ail agreed
that the word "export" means shipment fromn
one country to another country, flot from one
province to another province. I had expected
this question would be deait with when the bill
was before the committee, at whose meeting
sorry to say I was not present, and I thinc
it should be referred back so that we may not
lose our definite understanding of what the
word "export" means. It does not mean the
shipping of potatoes from Prince Edward
Island to Ontario or Quebec, or of appiles from
British Columbia to eastern >provinces.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, 1
wouild suggest to the honourable member for
Quee-n's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) that bie ]et the
matter stand until the chaîrman of the comnmittee is here. 1 do not wish to raise the
question but the honourable senator for
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) cannot second
a motion for a senator who is not here. One
can move on behaif of an absent senator, but
a seconder mnust be present. I arn simply
stating the rule. I suggest it would be better
to ]et the whole niatter stand until Tuesday,
when the chairman of the committee will be
here.
1 arn told that the processors who were
represented before the committee want
"export" defined as in the bill for the protection of the industry itself. I arn one of those
persons very anxious to sce the flax industry
established in Canada and, rather than risk
a vote, I urge that we had better wait untîl
Tuesday, wben the chairman of the cornrittee
will bc here and the bill can be fully explained.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Do you agree that
"9export" mneans shipment between the provinces? If that definition can be applied in
this bill, it can also be applied in a peach
bill or to a potato bill.
Hon. Mr. HIAIG: But I amrn ot desirous of
hurting an industry hy arguing over words.
Froni representations made by men in the
industry 1 realize that it is nccessary for the
protection and development of the industry to

DEPARTMENT 0F NATIONAL DEFENCE
BILL

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Honourable senators, we might as well understand this matter.
1 was.asked by the acting leader (Hon. Mr.
Copp) to take charge of the bill. When it
came hefore the committee I was present, and
I may say to my honourable friend from
Parkdele <Hon. Mr. Murdock) that the industry was represented hy the president of the
National Flax Council. The question before
us is merely one of words. For the purposes
of the Inspection and Sale Act "export"
means what the bill says. For any other
purpose the word retains its ordinary meaxiing. I do flot see any reason to delay this
bill; it bas been twice before the committee,
which adopted it as it is now. 1 submit to
the bouse that the amendments should be
concurred in at this time.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: May I suggest that
there is nothing to prevent my honourable
friend from Parkdale from moving an
amendment, if hie wishes on the motion for
third reading.

Tbe Senate proceeded to the consideratioe
of the amendment made by the Standing Com.
mittee on Banking and Commerce to Bill 10intituled an act to amend the Department oi'
National Defence Act.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: It bas been
moved by Honourable Senator Sinclair, on
behalf of the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, tha.t the
amendments made to Bill 8, an Act to amend
the Inspection and Sale Act, be now concurred
in.
In amendment thexYeto, it bas been moved
by Honourable Senator Murdock, seconded by
Honourable Senator David, that the amendments made by the committee be not now
concurred in, but that the bill be referred back
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce to amend section 12A (a) so as to
define what is described as export between the
provinces as "transport, shipment, or transfer,"
and thus proteet for us the well-known meaning of the word "export."
Is it your pleasure, honourahie senators, to
concur in this amendment?
The amendment was negatived.

DIVORCE BILLS
On the Orders of the,, Day:
Hon. JOHN 1. HAIG: Honourable .senators,
before the Orders of the, Day are called I
wish to make a suggestion to the house. The
Divorce Committee is confronted with a
tremendous volume of work-more than 400
cases. I *ould ask that when divorce bis
appear on the Order Paper they be cleaned
up as. we go. along. The members of the comrnittee feel that when the. evidence has been
heard and reported upon they have no further
relsponsibility.
1Hon. Mr. -MORAUD: What do you mean
by having them '"leaned up"?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: For instance, items 4 and
5 on the Order Paper tonight have to do with
divorce, and it would take only a f ew minutes
to ;deal with them. before we take up the
other items. Unless we follow some such
plan there will be no0 possibility of getting ail
the divorce bills to the other place before the
session ends, and in that event the members
of the Divorce Committee will feel like giving
up the ghost and letting somebody else take
the responsibility for ail these cases.*
1 amn not asking that honourable senators
who are opposed to divorce vote for the
bis. You«may vote against them if you wish.
Nor arn I asking for any special consideration.
1 arn simply pointing out that if we are going
to do the job at aIl we mnust have assistance
in getting the bills through the house.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCH- Will the honourable

lion. Mr. HAIG: I would point eut to the
honourable member from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) that ahead of these divorce items
en the Order Paper are three or four important matters which will probably take the

whole night to debate. hI the Manitoba
bouse we used to have a procedure whereby
on one or two days a week certain matters
would be given precedence and pushed
througËh right *away. I wonder whether we
could not adopt such a procedure for dealing
witb divorce orders.
Hon. Mr.. COPP: If there 'is no objection,
we can proceed first with order No. 4, for the.

DAIRY INDUSTRY BILL
MOTION

FOR

SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
March 12, the ad.journed debate on the motion
of Hon. Mr. Euler for the second reading of
Bill B. an Act to amend the Dairy Industry
Act.
Hon. CYRILLE VAILLANCOURT (Translation): Honourable senators: I do flot intend
to expound at Iength the food value of
oleomargine as compared to that of butter.
I onhy wish to state my views concerning
the main argument which seems to supersede
all others in this debate: That the freedom
of the people should not be restricted.
By prohibiting the manufacture or importation of oleomargarine, why do we deny to any
citizen of Canada the right to eat oleomnargarine if he feels hike eating some?
Everybody wiIl admit that no human law,
that is no law created by man, is absolutely
perfect. The object of every law is to accommodate the greatest possible number of people,
and to give justice to the greatest majority
of the population. It is inevitable that the
rights of some people will be encroached upon.
But what can be done about it? Nobody can
deny that during the war, the immense
mai ority of our population benefited from the
controls imposed upon our economy. Some
<itizens, however, suffered injury; but this was
unavoidable.
Let us examine the very principle of freedom. We will admît that my own freedom
ends where that of my neighbour begins. By
abusing my freedom, I can kill my neighbour; but my neighbour is entitled to live.

MARCH 18, 1947
Therefore, if 1 misapply this principle of
freedoni, I may injure the essential part of the
population of a country, that portion which
feeds the whole nation, and ini short allows
it to live; I 'would thus abuse my freedom,
and I bel-ieve these are the present circumstances.
The period we are presently going through
can be termed abnormal; and we would like
to redress certain defects by enacting extraordinary measures and adopting certain means
wbich, in my opinion, seemn very dangerous
and could bring about evils which will be
more sericus than those we presently wish to
redress. Towards the end of the last war, we
authorized the importation and manufacture
of margarine because we were then going
through the same abnormal times as today.
What were the resuits? When conditions again
became normal farmers sold their butter
for ridiculously low prices, and that was one
of the rensons why our farmers and our youth
abandoned farming and are still abandoning
it. After realizing that margarine was detrimental to agriculture, we prohibited the sale
of margarine.
It is useless to attempt keeping farmers and
farmers' sons on their farms if their revenues
cannot afford themn as comfortable a mode of
living as is enjoyed by cîty people. By authorizing the importation and manufacture of
margarine, if 1 protect four, five or ten manufacturera at the expense of hundreds of
thousands and even millions of my compatriots, then I am entitled to say that this
principle of freedom which we invoke is not
freedom, but dictatorship, subservience, in a
word, the very opposite of freedom.
A few days ago, I enquired from large
Montreal and Quebec dainies about a possible
shortage of milk. Everywhere, I was told:
"There is a superabundance of milk, and we
do flot know what to do with it." Tben why
are there not greater quantities of butter on
the market? We must acknowledge facts and
admit that the prioes paid producers for raw
milk and for butter are not at ahl adequate.
The price of milk sold for consumption as
sucb is niuch higher than the price of milk
used for butter-making.
We arc told that the price of butter will
be much higher than that of oleomarganine.
It is quite easy to lower the price of butter.
If we wish to bring back freedom, if we wish
everyone to obtain freely everything he
:wants, then let us lower tariffs on agricultural
implements, on automobiles, etc. We all know
that in the United States farmn implements are
far cheaper than in this country; and the
sanie applies to autos and many other manufactured products.

I heard another argument: Ia the importation of oranges prohibited? I do not think
many people grow oranges in Canada. Then
this situation cannot hurt anybody. And 1
was .also told that the oils and fats used in
oleomargarine are also used in the manufacture of soap. Then you would rather use
these oils to make soap instead of food for
the poorer part of our population? Let us
proceed slowly. We know that often priority
is granted to hygiene over food; if we wish
to prevent epidemics and even infection, we
must firat of all use soap. Froni a certain
angle, it is just as important, as far as bygiene
is concerned, to have soap as to have supplies of oleomargarine. It is useless to dwell
longer on this point.
Here is another way of rcasoning: Canada
is the only country in the world wherc importation and manufacture of oleomargarine
is prohibited. Why is this? Because we went
through -this experience, and we saw for ourselves the harm which it effected in our
national agriculture, which is one of the most
vital industries of our country. Furthermore,
comparisons are always lopsided, and it is
futile to make tbein.
We were told that Denmark authorizes the
importation and manufacture of oleomargarine. This is truc, but only in limited
quantities. There is no free market in that
country, and oleomargarine
cannot be
packaged and offercd as if it were butter.
According to my information, oleomargarine
cannot be colourcd in Denmark, and 'thus
people are not deceived when they eat it,
they are not led to believe that it is aimply
rotten butter.
In our country, the dairy industry is closely
relatcd to cattle raising. and, to be profitable,
cattle raising, especially hog raising, is done
with grain and skimmed milk. If, as it happcned in the past-and we have gone througb
this experiment-tbe farmer is placed in a
difficult position, then he will not produce
milk, and furtherînore he will not raise cattle;
if he doca not raise cattle, meat will be
scarce, and Western farmers wîil have greater
difficulties in selling their grain, because in
a few yeara, when pre-war labour conditions
prevail in Europe, that continent will be in
a position to raise its own crops. Then will
we pay farmers to refrain from. producing?
This is an absurdity.
Those who invoke the argument of fretdom also tell us: "Why impose restrictions
upon the sale of oleomnargarine if we wish to
eat some?"
To that I could answer: "Why not authonize
the free importation of Argentine wheat?"
It is leas expenaive than ours, apparently
and even if I cannot admit that it is as good

144

SENATE

as ours, some people might say that they
prefer it and would rather eat it than our
wheat.
Would that be beneficial to our
Western farmers?
We are also told that the manufacture of
Crisco is permitted. But we all know that
Crisco does not compete with butter. People
who buy Crisco know very well that they
will not eat it with their bread.
It was also pointed out that we import butter from New Zealand. I believe that my
honourable colleague from Queen's Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) gave a clear and
successful reply to that point.
(Text):
Honourable senators, according to availabte
statistics, fats are very scarce throughout the
whole world, and in order to produce oleomargarine we should have to import cottonseed oil, soya bean oil, coco-nut oil, etc.
When the whole world is complaining about
the scarcity of fats, why should we deprive
the unfortunate inhabitants of Europe of the
few supplies they possess?
In the Montreal Gazette of March 14 I read:
The serious shortage of soap and sliortening
resulting directly from a world scarcity of fats
and oils was laid to six main causes by F. H.
Lehberg, administrator of oils and fats of the
Wartime Prices and Trade Board, in an address
before the weekly luncheon of the Montreal
Kiwanis Club at the Windsor Hotel yesterday.
Canada is now in a very vulnerable position,
he said, since every branch of industry uses fats
and oils directly or indirectly. He blamed shortages on: i-Complete chaos in the southeast
Pacifie; 2-China and Manchuria which were
large exporters before the war are now completely out of tha picture due to internal strife;
3-A decrease in production and increase in consumption in Australia, due to drought and
other reasons; 4-A decrease of 35 per cent in
whale oil production, due to the loss of whalers
and experienced operators during the war;
5-Higher consomption and lower exports by
South American countries; and, lastly, the decrease in output in Africa due to the tact that
natives want consumer goods instead of currency.
Fats and ails are the shortest commodities in
the world today, he declared. Since Canada
must import 50 per cent of all her needs, he
added, the quota allowed this country is far
below the demand.
Mr. Lehberg said that it will take at least
another three years before 1935-1939 levels are
reached, and that methods should be studied in
Canada to raise production. He further suggested that soybean and flaxseed production
should be improved, and pointed out that the
latter, from which linseed oil is obtained, could
be used for export in order to receive higher
quantities of other oils.
Stressing the higher prices on oil and fats, he
said that soybean oil, which could be freely obtained before the war at six cents a pound, was
now 33 cents a pound and hard to get. The increase in the price of palm oil was even more
drastie.

He deplored the tack of a Canadian whaling
fleet, which was unfortunate for a country
bounded by- three oceans, and stated that seal
and whale oil was highly desirable and would
bring high remuneration.
Honourable senators, would it be wise and
consistent to enact an invalid law? Would
it be wise and human to pass this bill, in
spite of the scarcity of fats and vegetable
oils, and thus take them away from those
who are starving, while we virtually have
everything we wish? This would be anything
but a charitable and Christian action.
Finally, we are told that if the bill is
passed and there are short supplies of fats,
farmers need not fear anything on this
account, that they will not be affected in
any way. But this point must be considered:
if we agree to the principle of the bill, competition between butter and margarine, between farmer and manufacturer, will be more
acute and more disastrous as soon as fats
become more plentiful. A few years ago
certain monopolies were investigated
in
France, and it was discovered that 80 per cent
of all the vegetable oils produced in the
world were controlled by two powerful companies which sold their products throughout
the whole world. It is unnecessary ta elaborate on this.
If the principle of freedom is to be invoked
for the manufacture, importation and sale of
oleomargarine, it should be applied honestly
to everything and everybody, and not only
to some things and. a few privileged people.
For instance, our freedom is restricted by
traffic lights for the general advantage. They
hold us back at the very moment when we
may wish to move on. We did without them
formerly, so why should we not abolish them?
You will answer that would be impossible
and indeed, because without them many
people would get run over.
This illustrates the principle I stated at the
beginning: my freedom ends where that of
my neighbour begins. If, by abusing my
freedom, I injure my neighbour, then I am
not entitled to have it. If, by abusing the
principle of freedom which bas been referred
to so often in this debate, I injure hundreds
of thousands of my compatriots, then I ought
not to have it; and I have not the right to
concede this freedom to a few individuals
who would use it against the welfare of the
general population.
The honourable senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) read a letter from the
President of the National Dairymen Association, whose head office is in New York. The

Montreal, Feb. 10, 1947.
Senator C. Vaillancourt,

We note with alarm proposed bill being presented by Senator Euler whichi would legalize
importation and manufacture of oleomargarinie
in Canada. Canadian dairymen now suffering
fromn low prices and restrictions imposed by
W.P.T.B. > and have protested .to governmeut
asking these prices be raised in order that production be encouraged. Should this bill become
law it would further discourage production of
butter. .Under. normal conditions Canadian
dairymen can p)roduce more butter tban can be
consumred in Canada. We therefore protest very
strongly against passage of snch bill.
John K. Dickson,
President, Montreal Milk Producers Association.

Hon. Mr; VAILLANCOURT: No. The
people of the province of Quebec prefer good
butter ta bigb-priced imported substitutes.

Ste. Anne de Bellevue, Que., Feb. 11, 1947.
Senator Cyrille Vaillancourt,
Parliament Buildings, Ottawa.
The Quebec Council of Farm, Forums on bebalf of the butter producers of Quebec wish to
go on record as supporting the Canadian Federation of Agiuture in its objection to the introduction of oleoU'.margarine on the Canadian market we believe that -if the sale of margarine is
legalized it will refleet severe hardship on our
butter producers who during the war years a .ccepted a comparatively low and unsatisfactory
price for their produet in order that Canada
might fulfil hier commitments for other dairy
produets.
R. Alex. Sim, Seeretary-Treasurer.
The following is a letter fromn the Sherbrooke Group of the United Milk Producers
of the Province of Quebec.
R.M.D. No. 1,
Sherbrooke, Que., February 12, 1947.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt, Senator,
Parliament Buildings,
Ottawa, Ont.
Dear Sir:
We, the Sherbrooke Milk Producers, strongly
protest against the project introducing margarine on Canadian market.
Yonrs very truly,
(Sgd.) W. H. A. Smith,
Secretary-Treasurer.

Hoù. Mr, EULER: Everybody prefers to
cat good butter, if hie cari get it.
SHon. Mr. VAILLANCOURT: People can
get it, but it is very scarce n-ow, but it wil
be plentiful next sumnmer.
The oleomargarine question is a miatter of
peysonal opinion, and we could argue at length
over it.
In conclusion let me empbasize that I am
not discussing the fobd value of oleomargarine.
Nor am I saying tbat 1 sliall always be against
the principie of the, bill we are examining
today; but, in the present circumstancesi1 do
not believe àt is expedient ta pass snbh *a
bi., In a few years,.hence, when conditions
have become normal once more, if we decide
that oleomargarine can be placed on thé
market wýithout any. detriment to the dairy
industry and witbont working any disadvantage
to the majority of the citizens of Canada, I
shah 1 be 'rcady to support a bil! like this.
Meanwbile. I hold fast to this principhe of
frecdom, that we must first of all endeavour
to bring about the prosperity of those who are
mainly responsible for the prosperity of our
country. In a country hike ours, if the farmer
is flot prosperous, our wb.ole economy will soon
be injuriously affected. Let us protect the
farmer, and thus promote the prosperity of
our country.
We sbouhd not abuse an argument based on
freedomn. I am in favour of freedom whicb
allows the. maj ority to lead a better life and
liroteets their rights; but I am against tbe
kind of freedom wbich prevents many of our
compatriots from prospering and attaining a
higher standard of living, because that form of
liberty is but travesty and camouflage.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, this bill w.as introdnced in the
Senate on February 6, and bas been hanging
fire more or less ever since.. I think we should
now put on the record saime of the objections
that, I presume, were tehegrapbed ta ah!
senators.
On Febrnary 9 the following telegram, came
to me:
Senator Jas. Mnrdoek,
Ottawa, Ontario.
We vigorousy protest proposa! to hegalize oheoiargri
e anada, as a bhow at the f armers
of Ontario. During the war we accepted with
good grace diversion of milk fromn butter to

.46

SENATE

other commodities as in the dominion's interest.
We have accepted with good grace importation
of New Zealand butter to make up the current
artificial shortage. Imposition of oleomargarine
would be a serious blow to 71,000 cream. producers of the province of Ontario and a poor
reward for sacrifices stili being exacted by the
federal goveriment. We solicit your support for
agriculture, and would urgently request you to
vote against the proposed oleomargarine bill.
A. S. Thurston. Secretary-Manager, Ontario
Creamery Association.
Two days later, on February 11, I received
this tclegram:
Hon. Jas. Murdock, Senate of Canada,
Parliament Bldgs., Ottawa.
Ontario creama producers for butter purposes
protest vigorously importation and manufacture
of oleomargarine. Producers suspicious potential manufacturers and marketers raising this
issue for private gain. Creamn production at
less than cost as part of war effort resulted in
decrease in production. Importation vegetable
oils whieh are in short supply may prove definite
threat to dairy industry. Producers object to
importation without protection w-len other industries are protected by tariff such protection
adding to cost of f armers needs. Ontario's 75,000
creani producers look to you for fair and just
treatment.
V. S. Milburn, Secretary, Ontario Federation
of Agriculture.
I rcplied by letter to these telegrarns, and
in ecd of my replies I said, "Pcrhaps you
rnight advise me why Canada should lie the
only country in tlie world to prohibit the
manufacture and sale of oleomargarine.*" I
did flot get a rcply from either of these gentlemen whose telcgrarns I have read. 1 arn stili
waiting for one.
Many honcst, well-rneaning and enthusiastie
senators and others argue that tlie existing law
is intended to pilotect and conserve the riglits
of the farmers. No member of this liouse lias
greater respect for the farmers, or a greater
desire to do justice to them, than I have. I
spent some of the youngcr years of my life on
a farm, and I know somethin-g about wliat
farmers have to do. But it is nonsense even
to suggest that this prohibition of oleomargarine is for the benefit of the farmers. If
we believe it is, we ought to undertake to
pr-ove it.
Do not forget that this particular matter is
alrnost a perennial in Canada. The first tirne
it was raised on Parliarnent Hill was on June 1,'
1886. We have sornetirnes talked about "rushing" things througli the Senate and doing business hurriedly. Wby, we are merely "pikers"
in comparison with those who, in 1886, first
deait with this particular matter. Here is the
record of wliat was donc:
'Mr. McLelan introduccd Bill (-No. 149) to
prohibit the manufacture and sale of substitutes
for butter.
Bill read the first time.

Mr. McLelan moved the second reading of the
bill.
I do not know what is in the
Mr. Blake:
bill, but I hope it does not prohibit the importation of ail substitutes for butter. The title is
rather wide. There are a good rnany very wholesome substitutes for butter.
I wonder if it would cover
Mr. Mitchell:
molasses, because in rny part of the country the
people use a good deal of it as a substitute for
butter.
Title clianged by adding after "sale of" the
word "certain."
Motion agreed to, bill read the second time,
considered in committee, reported. read the third
time, and passed.
On rnany and various occasions since June
1, 1886, this question bas been before parliament.
I said a few moments ago that the existing
legisiation is not for the benefit of the farmers.
To suggest that it is scems to, me just a fourflush, a bluff, a piece of nonsense. Truc, under
it thcy may get a littie more, a morsel of
what they are entitled to, in the shape of
compensation for what they provide in the
way of rnilk. For the last few months wc
have been hearing quite a bit about the cost
of butter and the scarcity of butter. At a
public place in this city of Ottawa a few wecks
ago I attcnded a party of distinguished people,
brouglit together by my wif e, and we did not
have any butter, for wc could not get it.
Let us sec what is happening. On Deccmber 5 I wrote to one of our capable and
distinguished Ottawa newspapcrs, as follows:
MAN AND HORSE WORTHY OF THEIR HIRE

So rauch lias been said and written recently
rcspecting the price of milk that a slight
illustration miglit be in order.
This morning I bappened to look out of my
window at 7.43 ýa.m. and noticed an Ottawa
dairy horse and rig delivering milk the first
door west; at 7.45 a.m. an Ottawa dairy horse,
and rig delivering milk at our door; at 8.04
a.m . an Ottaw-a dairy horse and rîg delivering
milk at our next door neiglibour east, and 1
noticed also a couple of hours later an automobile labclled an Ottawa d.airy delivering milk
a few doors east.
As a matter of fact I give the narnes of
those dairies-they are ail different-but I arn
not putting them on the record.
Perhaps this illustrates the increascd cost of
milk whicli, hy the way, appears to be still
about seven to fifteen cents per quart lcss here
than in the United States.
Needless te add, this letter was net published in the paper te which I sent it. Why?
It is not the farmers who are responsible
for this increased cost. If any honourable
senators need the explanation, ternorrew I
will load you into an automobile and show
you where that increase cost cornes frorn,
riglit here, in the city of Ottawa; and I
assume the sarne conditions operate in other

MARCH 18, 1947
parts of Canada. Hundreds of thousands of
dollars are expended on the provision of plant
for the delivery of milk by dairies. Yet we
are told that the object of the ban on oleomargarine is to help some farmers out in the
West to get a better price for their milk.
It is nonsense.
I said a moment ago that I was sympathetic
te the farmers. May I be permitted to put
on the record the views of one man who
states that hie is a farmer? In the correspondence column on the editorial page of the
Toronto Daily Star of February 17 last we
flnd this item:
OLEOMARGAINE BILL
To the Editor of The Star.
Sir: Both as a farmer and consumer, I protest
the attack of H. H. Hannam, president of the
Canadian Federation of Agriculture, againzt
Senator Euler's bill calling for the removal of
Canada's ban on the manufacture *and saie of
oleomargarîne. I and thousand of other longauffering, butter-rationed consumers cau tell Mr.
Hannam and the senaters wliat interees stand
te profit f rom margarine manufacture in
Canada. Here is a partial list:
1. The dairy farmers themselves, because
23J per cent of oleomargarine ingredients is
fresh milk. The margarine industry thus would
open a new and profitable domestic market to
dairy fermera--a market over and above their
present one which is so beset by high distribution costa.
2. The soybean and sunflower farmers of both
the West and East, whose crops would, provide
most of the vegetable oil content of margarine.
3. Canada's 70,000 diabetes sufferera, who
must have up to two ounces a day of butter,
the backbone of an insulin p>atienýt'g diet in
order to live. Under the shortages maiutined
by Mr. Hannam's butter monopohists, there isn't
enough butter to fill the extra ration allowed for
diabetics.
4. Labour would profit frorn margarine by
having an entirely new industry in whicli te
work and build a future.
5. Business at large, f rom finance through to
machinery and carton-makers, ail of whom would
have a new industry te serve.
6. The generai publie (including the dairy
farmers), who would profit au taxpayers
because (a) the new margarine industry. would
pay inceme, property and sale taxes which are
nov non-existent from this source, (b) because
the new industry could export margarine to
nations needing it, thus adding to our foreig
trade, which benefits every person In Oana
te the tune of $3 out of every $10 lie earns.
.Canada does not now and neyer lias produced
enough butter to supply hier full needs. Therefore, the cry of margarine peril 'to the buttermakers is a fake.
R. Magee
Milliken, Ont.
That is signed by a farmer.
I suggest that before an>' honourable senator votes against this bill lie sliould ask
himself: Wliy in this Dominion of Canada,
whicli we think is tlie best country in. the

147

world and which we feel lias corne through
the war with credit and h.onour, should we
continue this farce of denying our people the
night te have oleomargarine? And why should
Canada be the only country in the venld in
that position?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Honourable senators,
I move the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: May I
ask the honourable senator if hie would kindly
postpone his motion until after I have fimished
a few remarks that I should like to, mae?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I arn quite agreeabie
te that. I vithdraw my motion.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, in differing frorn the argument which has
se ably heen presented by rny colleague, the
senator frorn Keninebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt), I do so wit-h considerable diffidence in
vicv of the eminent position which hie ocupies in his province as the representative of
organized agriculture.
May I say te hirn that I arn ready at any
time te give credit te the farmers of Quebec
for having done more perhaps, and in a very
striking way, to improve the standards of
dairying, both in the quality of their fierds
and their facilities for inspecting producta,
than the farmers in any other part of this
country. I might also say te hirn that I amn
the last person vho would do anything te
in-jure the status of that industry. However,
in approaching this subject I do se with the
conviction that the oniy fair measuring rod
te apply te the proposai contained in this
bill, which presents te us an economic problern,
is consumer demand. Everybody is a consumer of food! clothing and shelter. The
farmer himself is an eutstacuing consumer in
our communiity, and I have noticed that over
the years hie bas been ver>' deflnitely accus-.
torned te stress his right as a consumer to buy
rnachinery and other supplies in markets
wherc lie can secure the lowest possible price.
I have always agreed witli and supported him
in that position. For sorne tirne, hovever, I
have aise observed that the dair>' industry,
through.some of its organisations, lias adopted
a rather arrogant and unreasonable attitude
towards the mass of consurners in Canada.
For example, I think its opposition te the
riglt of ever>' individual te have access
through purchase te wholeseme articles of
food, is net only unsound economcially but
saveurs rather of the dog-in-tle-manger
attitude.
My honourable friend from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock) lias just quoted a couple of
messages which lie received and which I think

148

SENATE

most of us received. I had intended referring
to one of them. I wish to take very strong
exception to the suggestion in the telegram
sent to me by Mr. Milburn, Secretary of the
Ontario Federation of Agriculture, that the
potential manufacturers and marketers of oleomargarine are raising this issue for private
gain. The implication is that those of us who
do net happen to agree with the point of
view of opponents of the bill, are being actuated by some consideration of interest in
potential manufacturers and distributors of
oleomargarine.
Honourable senators, it bas become a too'
frequent pastime, if I may say so, on the part
of bureaucratie officiels of the Federation of
Agriculture, to impute ulterior motives to
those in parliament and elsewhere who do not
happen to agree with the things they are
opposing. I submit that every time such
suggestions are made they should be resented,
if for no other purpose than to draw attention
to the need of seme measure of respect for
public institutions which represent the people
of this country as a whole.
olin. Mr. MacLENNAN: There is nothing
wrong with private gain.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: There is nothing
wrong with it, but there is something wrong
with the implication that the motive of the
supporters of this bill is consideration for those
who are making private gain.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: That is the
motive which the sender of the telegram has.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Exactly. I think it
is the weakest recourse to take, but of late I
have observed, as I think all of us have-in
relation not only to this bill, but to some other
matters which will become before this Senate
-a tcndency to impute to us ulterior motives
rather than the motive of trying to do our
best to serve the public of Canada. I for
one, honourable senators, intend to resent
that sort of thing every time I see it and
every time I meet it.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I also wish to devote
part of my main remarks to the economic
aspects of this question. The telegrams that
we have received from the spokesmen of the
dairy industry complain of a potential decline
in the industry because of the discipline, if
yeu like, that was placed upon it during the
war; and it is contended that any importation
of margarine would prove a definite threat to
the industry as a whole.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Will the honourable
gentleman permit me a question? I believe
those telegrams were sent only to the senators
from Ontario.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: We specialize in
pressure.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: You need it; we do not.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: That situation does
not change the point of my remarks.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not say that it does.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The repeated conplaints about the decline of the dairy industry, and the reasons given, do not correspond
with the published facts. I have before me a
statement on the production of milk and dairy
products for the period 1920 to 1946, which
I am going to take the liberty of placing on
Ilansard.
(Sec appendix at end of today's report.)
This statement shows an increase of 70 per
cent in our total milk production, out of which
all dairy products take form. The messages
and representations criticizing the purport of
this bill have been made on the basis of cream
production, almost as if the production of
cream could be distinguished from the entire
milk producing industry.
In 1920 roughly 11 billion pounds of milk
were produced; in 1945, a peak year, the total
reached 17,627,000,000 pounds; and in 1946,
almost 17 billion pounds.
In every item of dairy products from whole
milk, with the exception of dairy butterwhich is made on the farm-and condensed
milk, there bas been an increase. In evaporated whole milk, whole-milk powder, casein,
ice cream and creamery butter there has been
a tremendous increase. I would commend to
honourable senators a perusal of the figures
contained in this statement.
The fact is well known that during the past
year millions of pounds of New Zealand butter
have been diverted from Great Britain to this
country, because of the inability of the dairy
industry, even with increased production, to
supply the demand for butter in Canada.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: Has the honourable
senator the figures with respect to importations into this country?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I have no figures
on the importation of butter. My information
is that the main item last year was approximately 13 to 14 million pounds of New Zealand
butter destined for Great Britain, which
through arrangement was diverted here and
is now either in storage or being consumed.
Some of it, I understand, has not landed yet.

MARCH. 18, 19471*
. Every year shiçe 1941 thirs rountxy has contributed ýmila4ions of dollar iii the ,forma of
subsde t support the dairy, industry.
Hon. MW.HAIG: No.
Hon. Mr.,'LAMBERT: I shall refer to, only
t)4ree outstanding yearer-1943, 1944 snd 1945.
The subsidies for butter fat, millk and cheese
totalled more than. $112,000,000 for that period.
thîs amount came out of the consumners in
the forai 'of taxation to subsidize the dairy
industry.
lion. - Mr. HAIG: Does -the honourable
geikieman pmean to say that that money went
iiito the pocikets of th e milk produWers? Was
not that amount paid by the government to,
reduce. the priçe of milk to the consumer? I
may be wrong, but that is'my understanding,
ànd 1 shouId like to be clear on it.
Hoi,.. Mr..LAMBERT: I arnquotingsome
figures published -by the Dominion Departmnent of 4griculture.
Will the' honlourable
lion., Mr. HAÀIG:

1 am flot questionng the amount, but I arn
inquirinig about the purpose for which the
money Fas paid.
non_ Mr. MURDOCK: The producerg got
the largest part cf it.
1Hon.ý Mr. HAIG: No; the consumers got
it. Thé minute the subsidies 'were taken off,
ffiilk jumped two or three ýcentsa pound.
Eo.Mr. MURDOCK: It was, not ýthe
farmer producers that benefied, but the
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I wish to refer to
the amount of subsidiespaid by the Dominion
government to the industry on the busis of
fluid mnilk, butter fat, concentrated milk,
eheddar cheese, cheese bonus on quality and
cheese factory improvement. In addition to
honourable
the subsidies mentioned-my
friend will. underst4nd. and appreciate thîs-on freight assistance on feed grains sent from
the prairie provinces -to' the eastern provinces,
a great percentage of which wçnt to support
çWry herds, there was a subsidy of more than
$44,000,000 in the three years mentioned.
That was an allowance for the benefit of the
feeders, of dairy and beef cattle.
May I ask another
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
question? Did the government of this country
not put a ceiling price on milk sold to, consumera? The producers said they could not
supply milk unless a subsidy was given to
hold down the price. That subsidy bas been
taken off and in consequence the price lias
gone Up.

,, RQn. Mr. LAMBER1~T: I.agree with what

I1 favour this bill with 'the conviction that
the importation- of oleomýargarine would .not
injure the dairy business in any way, but
would rathey tend to help it. -It would provide
a cheaper substitute for. butter especially in
the closely populated indus'rial centres, and
enable the average family to obtain a larger
portion of fluid milk. and ice creami for the
children.
Just as trade begets trade between nations,
so it does between different classes of people
in the samne community. Recause I believe
firmly in that principle, which is the principle
upon wbich this bill is based, I heartily
endorse every line of the bill.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Would the honourable
senator answer a question? I did not like to
interrupt him when lie was speaking. He took
exception, andl I think rightly so, to the fact
that ulterior motives were attributed to those
who are supporting this leeisation. Would lie

150

SENATE

not think it is just as bad for the honourable
senator who introduced this bill (Hon. Mr.
Euler) to say, in effect, that the motives of
those who opposed it were purely seIflsh
interests or political considerations?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I have an easy reply
to that. The honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) wilI, I believe, have the
privilege of winding up this debate, and I
teave the question for him to answer.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Does the honourable senator from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs.
Fallis) recognize the difference between political motives and improper monetary motives?
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: He said, political considerations, or purely selfish interests, which
would suggest thinking about one's own
pocket-book.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I should like to correct
My .honourable
friend from Peterborough
(Hon. Mrs. Faillas). I spoke, of course, of
political motives; and I think they are present
in the debate on this bill or will influence the
action that is taken when the vote cornes.
My other point was that there were ciais
inýterests being served, namely, the interesta
of those opposing the bill, flot the selfish
interests of any individual senator. I never
intended, of course, to impute that.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: On page 127 of
Hansard, of March 12, 1 read:
1 say to honourable gentlemenIt shouid be "honourable senators".
Hon. Mr. EUJLER- I stand corrected.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS:
-here today that there are oniy two reasons
why people should be againat oleurmargarine.
One is the purely selfish reasonHon. Mr. EULER: Yes; a elass interest.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: He said that one is a
purely selfish reason and the other is political
considerations. I stili ask, ia not that attributing ulterior motives to those who are opposed
to this bill?
Hon. Mr. EULER: In this country of capitahism, as long as you have it, everybody is
selfish, trying to make money; every ciass la
trying to do the best for itseif; and that
applies to the farmers and dairy people as wel
as to anybody else.
An Hon. SENATOR: You close the debate.
Hon. Mr. EUILER: Well, the honourable
senator from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Failis)
is asking a question.

Hon. A. W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senstors, I have just a word or so to say in connention with this matter. 1 made my position
clear when it was before the bouse hast session,
and I should like to do so again. For my own
satisfaction. becauste of the position which I
hold, 1 wish to let the people interested know
where I stand.
I do not propose to go into this question in
detail. for two or three reamons. One is that
it ia unnecessary. The arguments in detail pro
and con have been expressed with great force
and with considerable elaboration on botb
sides; it is unnecessary to repeat them. But
there are one or two phases that I want to
make clear.
We have just listened to an illuminating discusion as to whether there are financial and
political considerations invohved in this debate.
I do not know why we should camouflage this
sort of thing. 0f course there are. There are
private interests which are bringing pressure
to bear for their own selfish purposes. There
are those who, no doubt not in this chamber
but e sewhere, are catering to political
motives; and I submit there are other considerations which actuate people in this chamber
and elsewhere. One of these considerations
ia a mnatter of high principle. That is the one
thing in which 1 amn interested at this moment.
1 do not propose to follow the sinuous
arguments of the protectionist minds that we
have in this chamber; but when I hear them I
arn reminded that financial interests can flnd a
multiplicity of arguments. I have always
admired the protectionist mind along these
Uines. For instance, 1 cannot foliow the argument whichi is advanced about the lack of fats
in Europe, that it is too, bad that we should
take away some of their fats and feed them to
our people. The obvious reply-and there is
usually an obvious reply to financial arguments of that kind-is that if we are taking
their fats we might ship them somne of our
butter, and then we would be ail square with
the world. Or possibly we need net import
quite s0 much butter from New Zealand, and
sortie of it could go to the poor people of
Europe whom we might deprive of some oul.
Arguments of this sort go in a circie.
The one consideration which impe.s my
mind is the principle involved in this bill.
No doubt thosè who have argued in this
chambýer in favour of butter to the exclusion
of margarine are just as high minded as I
amn. They are, as a matter oi fact, very fine
gentlemen; they are ail honourabie men; and
1 would ho very glaci indeed to weleome any
of them te my houseliold, in the full assurance that once they were laide rny fr-ont door

MARCHI 18, 1947
they would observe the amenities o! Mie and

be perfect gentlemen inside my bouse. Yet
these very gentlemen, whomn I admire and
approve, propose to corne mnto my house and
ta.ke off my table one o! my valued dishes;
or, worse than that, say f0 me that I shail or
shall not serve a certain disb upon my private
table. To my mîmd that is a piece of
impudence, an invasion of my rigbts, and a
most ungentlernanly position to take. It is
my private right to buy oleomargarine and

serve it on my table if I please. These. gentlemen propose to interfere wifb rny rights ini
my own house,-rny comrnon-law rights, my
natural rights as a man to buy wbere I please,
to, serve what I like on rny own table, so
long as if is a healtbful, wbolesomne article of
food. That is wrong in principle, andi I arn
opposed to legislation whicb embodies that
principle.
Sornebody bas said that this measure is o!
old standing; and it is. The honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) bas
inforrned us that if was diseussed on tbe floor
of the bouse for the first firne in 1886. I
wùuld point out that those whose liberfies
have been curfailed in this unjustifiable way
have neyer once ceased their protesta. I
happen to hold in my hand a clippîng that is
about twenty-five years old. If says this:
A delegation of the National Council of
Women, headed by Mrs. Adam Shortt, waited
on Agriculture Minister Motherwell urging the
continuance of the distribution and sale of
margarine in Canada.
That was published in the Ottawa Journal,
in 1922. Neyer bave those wbose rights have
been curtailed consented f0 that curtailment:
always they have protested: and on their
part I protesf tonight against this invasion of
our natural rights f0 buy oleomargarine or
anything else o! a wbolesorne character which
we see fit to buy.
A number o! newspaper articles have been
quoted, but so far nobody seems to have
observed the article by J. V. McAree in the
Toronto Globe and Mail o! January 13, 1947.
Mr. McAree devoted an entire column to tbis
subject and referred as !ollows to an article
by Sam Shulsky, in an American magazine
called This Month.
He says that at present the dairy industry in
the United States is unable to provide more
than two-thirds the prewar level of consumer
butter, and less than haIt the optimum requirements, even with butter at the highest price
in history.
That applies to Canada as well as f0 the
United States.
Yet it is so strong politically that it is able to
keep in force laws and regulations which. hinder
or make impossible thc sale and distribution of
margarine, which can provide the same amount

151

of fat and vitamins at from one-half to, one-third
the cost of butter. He says the situation is exactly the same as if the manufacturer of Cadillac
cars were to say, "We cannot manufacture our
cars at a price low enough for every Arnerican.
In f act, we cannot turn out enough of thern for
those who can afford to buy them. Therefore,
we insiat that you levy a special tax of $500 on
every Chevrolet. and that every dealer in Chevrolets be compelled to pay a special f ee of
$50,000 a year, just to make it clear to the

publie that he is selling something which may

be a good automobile, but is not a Cadillac."
In some of the states of the Union they
have taxed oleomargarine, but in none of
them have they gone so far as actually to prohibit'ifs manufacture and importation, as we
have in Canada. Therefore the illustration is
one of taxation rather than of prohibition, and
we have the ridiculous parallel o! the manu-

facturers of motor cars asking the governent
to give them special privileges whicb put a
noose around the neck of the consumer by
compelling hirn to buy their car and no otber.
It is the old, old clash between free-trade
thought and the protectionist thought that
wishes to shackle and gag and tie up the consumer in order tbat he may be made fair
game for financial interests. 1 say that without any disrespect for the dairy industry. We
are a protectionist country, I arn sorry to say,
and anyone wbo can, gets bis proboscis into
the public, his snout in the trough and feeds
to bis heart's content. Therefore I do not
blame the dairy industry for trying to, get ini
with ail the rest. However, as one of the
consumners of this country who bas the right
to .protest I do so.
Today I was talking to a parliarnentary
representative of a mining constituency, who
told me that for five yeare the hard-rock
miners in bis constituency have been short of
butter. He said that if the people down in
the city of Toronto-I arn speaking of the poor
people whom I have always been proud and
happy to represent-were allowed to buy
oleomargarine, there would be, more butter
left for thie hard-rock miners of the north who
need it. 1 thought that that was a pretty
good argument so far as the utility question
is conccrned. Honourable senators, I rose f0
say that, because I stand for freedom, I propose to vote for this liberating measure and
againsf the restrictive act which. is now upon
the statute books.
Some hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR moved the adjournment o! the debafe.
The motion was agrecd to.
The Senate adj ourned until tomorrow at

SENATE

I arn quite wiliing to, facilitate the government's action. I realize their position, and
1 wouid be the iast man in the world to want
to take any advantage of it. But I repeatand I think I speak for every member of our
party-I arn opposed to controis in general.
The only reason I except rent control-and
I object even to, it-is that the very nature
of the control makes it impossible to remove
it. The minute you put on rent control you
stopped ail building for rentai purposes or
anytbing of that ebaracter, and conditions
have grown progressively worse over several
years. The backwash of the poiicy of rentai
controls is certain to be such that we cannot
t.ake tbem off ail at once. But 1 suggest, with
ail respect, that at sorne time-and I think
the tirne is now-the governrnent should
announce that rent controls, so far as they
affect soldiers or their dependents wbo'own
property, shall cease in say six rnonths frorn
xîow and, as they affect other people, a year
frorn now. I do not suggest a blanket eut-off;
but sornething is necessary in order to overtake existing requirements.
I may be unfair to the bouse in discussing
this matter at the moment, but I do flot want
the record to sbow tbat 1 have agreed without
protest to the continuation of the act until
May 15.
My protest is not against this
I
particular act, but against ail controis.

think they are a mistake, and I have thought
so ail along. You may point to the example
of the United States, and say that this is an
offsboot of that poiicy; but by and large we
have got to face the situation some day, and
the sooner we face it the better for this
country.
I consent to the passing of the resolution;
indeed I beartily approve it. It is better to
deal with this matter in this way than to
try to rush through a lot of measures in the

next ten days. It gives us an opportunity
for better consideration; and 1 tbink we bave
a duty to advise the other place of our
unbiased opinion regarding some of the controis. True, it is proposed that the act shall
be continued in force until the l5th of May,
and then for one year. I fear that wben the
year is up the government wiil again want
to continue controls, because people are in
favour of controis on the tbings they buy.

You wili find ail across Canada that men
aud women who selI their labour want controis maintained on everything except labour.

People want the coul rois kept on what tbey
boy, but not on wbat they seli. Honourable
senators, that makes for a lop-sided economy

whjch wili ultimately lead to more trouble
in this country. I may be saying it improperly, but I think we are drifting into a

position wbich makes it important for us to
realize that hast year our purchases from the
United States were more than $600,0,000
in excess of our sales to tbem, and that our
sales to other countries were made because
we lent themn the money to buy the goods.
Tbe time is coming wben that has got to

stop.
My honourable

katchewan

friend from Central Sas-

(Mon. Mr. Johnston) asked me

the other day if I was in favour of making

more boans to Great Britain. In auswer to
tbis it mighit be said that the leader of tbe
Progressive Conservative party in the Senate
is agaiust loans; but I want to say to him
that I amn not against making boans to Britain,

if that is the onhy way by which we can save
ber and if in our own judgment we are preDared

to do that.

However,

I

say quite

candidly tbat boasting about the goods we are
selliug abroad wben we are hending tbe money
to buy tbem is absolutehy a mistake.
We are comiug to the position wbere the
United States is goiug to bave to iend us

mouey; and, that is wbat I think wili be done,
provided we in turn hend it to European
countries. I do not tbink Mr. Truman bopes
to get through anotber boan from the United
States to Britain; but be does desire, as do
bis friends, tbat the United States lend money
to us and that we hend it to Britain. But
remember, we shahl be the ones lef t bolding
the bag. Muke no mistake about that.

Some Hou. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: True, I recognize wbat the
British people bave suffered througbout tbe
war; I arn keenby aware of it. However, I
also realize what we face in this country: a
tremendous debt by reason of our part in the
war. Yet, in the making of tbe peace treaties
witb Germany, the country that started tbe
hast two wars in one generation, we are not
allowed to bave a part. We are tohd, "No".
We are told that tbe hlnod that- flowed in
Russia is of greater volume tban the waters
that flow in Canadian rivers. By and large
we were in the war before Russia and we did
our share ail througb along with Russia. In
proportion to our population we contributed
as mucb to the allied war effort as any other
country in the worhd. These are matters that
disturb me as a Canadian. I arn willing to,
vote for the coutrols but I tbink that first we
shah bhave to consider wbere we stand in
those other matters.
It is ail riieht to talk about wbeat being
wortb three dollars today, but remember that
it is our money which makes it wortb tbat
price. We are hending money to, ahi tbe purchasing countries, and they are using up that

MARCH 19, 1947
money. When we corne to consideration of
these controlé I hope every member of the
house will be prepared to offer advice on what
ought ta be done ta meet the situation facing
Canada today.
I will support the resolution.
Ile motion was agreed ta.
INSPECTION AND SALE BILL
MOTION

FOR THIRD READING-REFERRED
BACK TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. COPP moved the third reading
of Bill 8, an Act to amend the Inspection and
Sale Act, 1938.
Hlon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, is there nothing ta the suggestion
I made the other day with regard ta this
bill? Section 12A (a) reads:
"ýexport" means send out of Canada or out of ane
province to another province.
The other day I moved:
That the said amendments be net now concurred in, but that the bill be again referred
back ta the Standing Committee an Banking
and Commerce ta amend clause 12A so as te
define what is described as expert between the
provinces as "transport", "shipment" or "transfer",, and thus protect for us the well-known
meaning of the word "export".

Perhaps ta some people it does not mean
much ta suggest, as this bill does, that fiax
products may be, "exported" from, ane
province ta another-from Saskatchewan for
instance, ta Quebec. My information is that
the product is sent ta Quebec for manufacturing purposes, and that inspection is required
before shipment is made.
For a number of years I have heard it
preicted that the three most easterly provinces of Canada would tie up with the United
States; that the fourth easterly province
would become an independent nation; that
Ontario would be a separate British colonyHon. Mr. DUEF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: -that the three
Prairie provinces would become a great
member state of the United States; and
finally, that British Columbia would adhere
ta the British Empire as a separate colony.
Personally, I do not believe the prediction,
though I have heard it many times. If this
house passes Bill 8 as it stands we shail be
giving an indication of readiness ta recognize
a material separation between the nine
provinces of Canada. This bill provides that
"export"ý-long recognized as relating ta trade
between countries--shall mean shiprnents and
transfers froma one province ta anather. It
ope-n
6that thîs meaning can be

155

avoided by the insertion of one short paragraph ta amend section 12A <a) so as ta
define what is described as expert between
the provinces as "transport", "shipment" or
"transfer", and thus protect for us the wellknown meaning of the word "export" as
applied between different countries of the
world. I suggested this the other day, but
nobody paid any attention ta iL, and possibly
honourable members think it is not worth
while ta pay any attention ta it today. Well,
that is elltirely up tu the Senate, but iL seems
ta me that we ought ta undertake ta maintain the ordinary rneaning of the word
"expert" and not make a farce of the word
by using it where we mean only transport,
shipment or transfer between one province
and another. My honourable friend fromn
Sorel (Hon. Mr. David), who wanted the
matter deait with the other day, and wus the
seconder of my motion on that occasion, in
not in the bouse at present, se I do not know
whether, he would be in favour of having
that motion moved again. However, if I arn
in order, I should like ta repeat my motion,
namely, that the bill be again referred back
ta the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce ta amend section 12A sa as ta
define what is described as expert between
the provinces as "transport," "shipment" or
"transfer", and thus protect for us the wellknown xneaning of the word "expert." I do
not know whether there is a seconder for that
motion.
Hon. T. D. BOUCHARD:- I wil second
the motion.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Mr. Speaker, I think
the motion should be: That the bill be not
now read the third time, but that iL be
referred back ta the Standing Cornrittee on
Banking and Commerce for further consideratien.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is right.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Iýt is moved by
the Honourable Senator Murdock, seconded
by the Honourable Senator Bauchard, that
the bill be not now read the third time, but
that iL be referred back te the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce for further
consideration.
Hon. Mr. BOUCHARD: Honourable senators, I wish to say just a few words. I think
that the word "expert" should nlot be used
in the bill ta mean shipment from one province ta another, because te use it in this way
would. irn'ply that aur provinces are sovereign
states. In my opinion we should dispense
with the word altogether in relation ta shipmente between provinces and replace it by

156

SENATE

another word, such as "transport" or "shipment" or "transfer". Honourable members
may have read lately, as I have, that there
are a group of citizens who would like to set
this country revert to the stage of a colony, or
adopt the American governrnental system,
under which each province would he a separate state. It has even been suggested that
the Lieutenant-Governor of the province of
Qucbcc and of each of the other provinces
should be called the Governor of the state of
Quebec, and so on. That-suggestion was made
flot ýby a Conservative, but by a Liberal, ad
it is evident that there are people trying Vo,
divide Canada into différent political sections.
As for myself, I stand for -our constitution
as it is. I like Confederation., believing that
it is the only systern by whîch this country
of ours can pave the road to unity. I arn
opposed to the sectionalizing of Canada, and
think it would be a mistake to give official
approval to a word that would stand for disunity of the provinces. As I say, the word
"export" in this bill would irnply that our
provinces are sovereign states, and I therefore
believe we should delete that word and replace
it by another.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: May I ask the hon3urable senator who moved concurrence in the
committee's amendmen-ts (Hon. Mr. Sinclair)
what reason was given in the committee for
the use of the word "cexport"?
Hon. J. E. SINCLAIR: Jionourable senators, the bill as it now stands for third reading
is in the formn in which it carne to us frorn
another place. When it was first considercd! in
our eommittec on Banking and Commerce
clause (a) of section 12A, which defines
"1export", was deleted. but the Senate referred
the bill back to the committee for further
consideration.. Wlien the bill was before the
committee the second time the honourable
senator from Sorel (Hon. Mr. David,) objected
to clause (a), claiming tbat the definition of
the woril "expert*' conveyed an impression that
was not intendedi. That is what I gathered
from the objection that lie stated in the cornmittec. After that objection was made a
motion was put by the Chairman of the
committec (Hon. Mr. Beauregard) for reinstatement of the chause, and that motion was
carried without further objection. The bill in
its present form was then reportcd back to
the Senate.
After the discussion that îve hiad here on the
committee's second report I took the precaution of consulting our Parliamentary Couinsel
and getting his views, which I then submitted
to the Department of Agriculture, the department responsible for the introduction of the

bill and for the genéral administration of the
Act. Just before I came into the House this
afternýoon I received frorn the Minister's office
a note saying:
Under the present wording we would not expeet any difficulties, silice we do nlot believe
there will bie any short liauls of fiax fibre across
the provincial boundaries. On the other hand,
we can agree to this wording without losing any
of the desired control.
The wording which it is intimated wou'ld be
acceptable is an arnendment suggested, by our
Parliamentary Couinsel in the évent that the
department desired to make a change after
the discussion that we had here hast week.
Having received this notification that the
department is satisfied with the bill as it is,
andý having consultedý the honourable the acting
leader of the bouse (Hon. Mr. Copp), I thought
it wie not to move any amendment.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: What wordingwas
suggested by the Parliarnentary Counsel?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Let us have that.
Hon. Mr SINCLAIR: It is this:
I don't thînk that the alteration of the définition of "expert" in the bill to amend the abovenoted act would imiprove the operation of the
prohibition clause. In its present state, the
definition covers one phase of mioving flax froin
one province to axiothier. To defeat the purpose
of the statute ail that is necessary is for a producer to carry his produet frein one province to
another. and lie is net then "seniding" it out of
the province, and is, thierefore, nlot committing
any offence.
Thiat is to say, if lie carried it out under his
arma he would not be committing an offence
undcr the acet; but I do not thîink there is
any danger of the act being evnded in that
way. as this is a product which you ship in
carloads. The nîenorzindium continues:
If I %veredrafting this set to cover the various
mieans by whiehi flax miay bie moved freim odie
province to siiotiier, iiroperly graded and
îîîarzed, I would delete the (lefinition contained
iii para;grapli (a) of section 12A entirely, and I
%%ould redraft the proposed section 12B to read
as follows:
-No persoil shall (a) export fromr
12 (b) :
Caîîada or (b) soeiid. sliip. take. bring. or carry,
cause to lie sent. shiippe(l. talken. brought or
(arrie1 to or inito any province froni or out of
aîiy otlier province. any Hon. -.,r. QUINN-,,: H1e does not tise the
word "pt"there
-o faîr as the provinces are
(onicernied.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: No.
-any fiax fibre, unless it is inspected, graded,
miarked or designated, andi labelled in accordance
ivith tlîe regulations madls under this part.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Fine.
better than I suggested.

That is far

167

MARCIH 19, 1947
Hon. Mr. QUINN: But that is flot in the
bill. That is only the recommendation of
couasel.
H on. Mr. SINCLAIR:' That is the recommenidation of the parliamentary counsel, and
that was.submitted to the Department, whoe
view I have already read. I have no particular
views to express personally. Any of themn will
suit me. Satisfaction having been expressed
with the bill as it was drawn by the Department of Justice and concurred in by the
Department of Agriculture, I feit that it would
be best to let it stand in that f on. I repeat
that I, have no partieular views about it: I a.m
putting the matter equarely hefore the Senate.
If on the motion for third. ieading it is desired
to use the amendment suggested by parliamentary counsel, there is no objection. But
1 ma.y say that I could not accept the
amendment offered by my honourable fniend
from Parkdnale (HSn. Mn. Mjirdock), because
it does not coven the matter properly.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: I would be in favour
of the amendnient moved by the honounable
senat-or fromn Par.kdale. I tblink we would
save time by sending the bill back to the
Banking and Commerce Committee and there
discussing it further.
Some Hon. SENATORSý: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: When the bill was
first before the Banking and Commerce Coinmittee, objection to the word "expont" was
naised by the byonourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Creran). Othens joined
with him in the obj ectitrn. Might I suggest te
the committee that. if the bill is referred
back, considenation of the matter be deferned
until the senator fromn Churchill is bere? He
expressed himself very strongiy, and it was
because of bis argument, 1 believe, that the
change was first made.
The Hon. the SPEAKER. That would be a
direction to the Banking and Commerce
Committee?
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Just a suggestion.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: That the bonourable senator fromn Churchil have an oppontunity to appear before the committee.
H on. Mn. SINCLAIR: May I point out to
the honourable senator fromn South Bruce
(Bon. Mr. Donnelly) that the second, time
the matter came before the comamittee the
opinion of the honounable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), expressed, at bis
request by another senator, was that clause
(a) was necessary.
The motion of Hon. Mn. Murdock was
agreed to.

DAIRY INDUSTRY BILL
MOTION FOR

SECOND READING-DEBATE
CO.NTINUED

The Senate recsuenýd from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Euler for the second neading of Bill B, an Act
to amend. the Dairy Induetry Act.
Hon. J. E. SINCLAIR: Honounable senîMors, wben I adjourned the debate yesterday
it was not with the intention of making aciy
extended nemarks on this bill. I have listened
to the very intenesting discussionx which bias
taken place so far, and I feel that it bas been
confined too much-to use a common expression-to our own back yard. Those who
expressed themselves were thinking more particularly of the tables of themselves and of
the people of Canada than of world conditions.
I tbink it wise just to cali attention of honourable senators te the present situation at
the World Trade Conference. I have in my
band tbe suggested charter, wbich was drawn
u, by the United States and is to be conàp
sidered at the conference which meets at
Geneva early in April. Our delegates, with
their assistants, left bene on February 28:
there were twenty-five in the party. Tbey are
attending a conference on trade mattens wbich
is proceeding at the present moment in London, and early in April they will be in attendance at the Geneva conference. The suggested charter whicb will be up for consideration at that conference, was neferred te bere.
earlier tbis session by ;the -leader of the
Senate, who unfortunately is absent at this
time. It was also referred to and in part quoted
in another place by the Rigbt Honourable
Secretary of State for External Affairs. I
tbink it is wonthy of notice at this time when
we are considering a bill te permit in Canada
tbe manufacture, sale and importation of
oleomnargarine. That is the purpose of the
Dairy Industry Bill: to permit the manufacture, importation, exportation and sale of
that product, whicb for many years bas baen
prohibited in ithis country. It was to point
out to honourable senators what our position
is that I moved the adjournrnent of the debate
and am now making these few remarks.
In order îto bring the matter as clearly as I
can before the Senate, I will quote froin the
suggested charter submitted. by the United
States,. but not concurred in by any of the
United Nations, even the one that drafted it.
Bon. Mr. EULER: When was that charter
submitted?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The submoission was
signed by W. L. Clayton, the American Under
Secretary of State for Economic Aifairs. I

158

SENATE

do flot see a date on the document. It is
marked "London, 1946", but I should think
that refers to the first conference.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Perhaps this will clear
up my question: Was it submitted by the
United States Government before there was
a change in Congressional representation to
a republican majority?
Hon, Mr. SINCLAIR.: I ar n ot in a
position to answer any questions regarding
United States politios.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It is not a question of
politics; it is a question of date.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: What I wanted
to cite is the paragraph with reference to
prohibitions and restrictions of trade. It is
to be found under the heading of "Quantitative Restrictions, Section C, Article 19."
GENEJIAL

ELIýMINATION 0F
RESTRICTIONS

QUANTITATIVE

Except as otherwise provided elsewhere

in

ibis chapter, no prohibition or restriction othor
than duties. taxes or other charges, wvhether
nmade effective through quotas, licences or other
ineasures, shall be imposed or maintained by
any inember country on the importation of any
product of any other member country, or on the
exportation, or sale for export, of any product
destined for any other member country.
There are sorne exceptions to that.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
Does that not

prove that we should not he the only country
in the world to prohibit the manufacture and
sale of oleomargarine?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
The honourable
gentleman from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) is getting a littie too anxious. If he
will contain himself and obey the rules of the
bouse for a few minutes, I shall state my
position. I suggest that it is not according

to the rules
Hon. Mr.
question.
Hon. Mr.
Hon. Mr.

to interrupt like that.
MURDOCK: I was asking a
SINCLAIR: It is not in ordor.
MURDOCK: Let us find out

if it is not in order.

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Honourable senators, the point I was going to raise was that
the exceptions referred to bore are made for
other purposes, and

may be continued for

six months or until the first of July, 1949.
That is the problem our delegates have to
face in April at the Geneva conferenco. As
I sec it, honourable senators, there is no
douht that our delegates will have to consent

to do away with our country's prohibition of
oleomargarine.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
I do not think
there is any doubt about it if at that conference they can corne to an agreement with
the other nations under this suggested charter.
What would be our position in taking a
stand at this time on a single article of
trade ?
We have sent our delegates to
Geneva to considor this matter, and if we
take action such as is suggested bore we shall
deprive our delegates of the best bargaining
position they have.

Soine Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: If we take no action
and leave the matter as it is todiay it will

corne up at that conferonce and I believe--this
is my opinion only; others can have their own
opinions--thýat the ban on margarine is one of
the prohibitions that will have to go by the

board. However, if that should happen there
would ho other ,benefits for 'the butter pro-

ducers -and dairy farmers. This is the situation: if wo dAonothing today we leave our
delegates in a good position, but if we go
ahead ansd begin to make changes with respect
to a single article, we take away from them
the best bargaining power they can get.

What was our position in trade in past
I have had saine experience as a
grower of potatoos, and I know that we have
years?

suffered

considerably 'because of quotas and

high duties imposed by the United States on
otm potatoes when we have had an exportable
surplus.

We have

had a large

exportable

surplus running from ciglit to nine thousand
carloads every year, and when the quota
imposed against that produet is filled the duty

is doubled. It so happons we fill the quota
every year, and tihere is alway6 a race, to get
in before it is filled, for as soon as th-at happenis
trade is redluced. almost to a state of stagnation. Saine potatoes may get in after that
tinte, but comparatively few. That is a matter
which will corne up for consideration at the
World Trade Conference.
Honourable sonators, I might now refer to
the situation in regard to the exportation of
beef cattle. During the war we prevented the
export of our cattle across the border. T-hat
prohdbition was understandable as a war
measure, but in the course of time it will
,disappear along with other war measures. We

know that in the past the experience of our
Western Canada 'beef breedËrs in trying to seli
-their products in the United States bas been
both disheartening ansi disappointing to them,
because the quotas and double d-uties have

forced them to accept a much smaller price
than they otherwiscý wnîîld have~ taken. This
will ho one of the problemns comîng before, the
World Trade Conference at Geneva. I submit

MARCH 19, 1947
-that the present ie flot an opportune time for
the Senate to in'terfère through this bill with
our existing position, which our de1egûete wil
be able to use in bargaining for equal advantage with other countries on a trade basis.
Today we are faced with -the old troublesome
bogey of economic nationalismn that has injured
our producers in the past.
Honourable senators, that is about ail I
desire to say in regard to this bill. It is a
matter of importance. I again submit that in
the present situation it would be unwise for
us to take the action proposed in this bill.
If the conference is succeseful, as we hope it
will be, the proposai will corne back to us in
the course of a few months or a year, backed
by an international agreement, and I think we
shahl accept it almost unanimously. To pass
this bill now would be to weaken the position
of our delegates and at the came time do ourselves no good.
Whcn I spoke on this bill last year, and
looking at it in a more direct way, I said that
the ingredients used in the manufacture of
olcomargarine were in short supply. Thcy are
in an equally short supply today. I am not
going to take the time of the Senate to quote
what international publications cay about
edible oils and fats. I said hast year that I
thought the oleomargarine question could be
discussed when normal conditions returned.
At that time indicationis were that it would
require three years for times to become normal. If that je right, we have two ycars to
go. By that time, if the international conference is flot successful, we shall stihi be in a
position to face this matter and deal with it
on its merits in Canada. Any action at present
that would weaken the bargaining position
of our delegates to the conference would be
vcry uawise.
This subject has been before the bouse for
the pact few weeks, and I cee no gain in prohonging the debate.
Some hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL: Honourable cenators, I am sure that those who listened tu the
debate for and agaînst a similar bill last session did not at thüt time anticipate that an
international conference would be requîred to
permit the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine in Canada. I gat-her that the honourable senstor from Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) believes that after the proposed international conference is held it will be necessary
for us to permit the importation of oleomargarine; and that whether or flot we shail be
forced to permit its manufacture within the
country will be a matter for later discussion.
But I cubmit that as oleomargarine is being

manufactured and sohd in every other country and is a wholesome f ood produet, it should
be admitted into Canada also, subjeet only
to any tariff restriction pl-aced upon it. We
should face the situation today and permit the
uc-e of this butter subetitute.
I havrt the greateet respect for those who
have voiced objection to, this bill. I know
thcy do so in the sincere belief that they are
protecting the farmer. No one feels that oleomargarine would be harmful to the health of
the people. Medical authorities throughout
the world have expressed opinions on butter
substitutes, and today it je recognized that
oheomargarine is a wholesome food produet.
If that were not so its sale would be proliibited by our pure food laws.
It would appear that in opposing the bill
corne people feel-without being able to point
to any sound arguments to support their
views--that the farmer would be seriouely
affected by it. Many yearc ago, when there
was a great surplus of butter on the market,
that may have been truc. But surely we
muet realize that today there is a tremendous
shortage -of butter, not only in this country,
but throughout the worhd. Everythîng has
heen donc to encourage the dairy farmer to
produce more butter. Great assistance has
been given in the form of subsîdies and other
encouragement.
In spite of ail this the
farmer-who we appreciate has donc everything possible to help the food situation during the war years--has been unable to produce sufficient butter to meet the demand.
I do not cee how the manufacture of a
butter substitute could possibly hurt the agricultural industry of this country. A large percentage of the ingredients used in such a substitute je produccd on the farmn or composed
of agrîcultural producte. There can be no
question about the demand for more butter
in Canada today. Surcly the farmers and the
industry gcnerally ehouhd put forth every
effort to meet that demand by the production
of more butter, and if they are unable to do
so they ought not to oppose the manufacture
of a substitute.
This bill would permit the setting up of a
new industry which wouhd use agricultural pro,ducts and thus be beneficiai to the farmer.
If I sineerely believed that such legiehation
wouhd be detrimental. to the £armer, and that

gond. reason for flot suppnrting, the bill and
bringing Canada in line with other countriee.
May I recapitulate the grounda upon which
I support the bill? First, oleomargarine is a
good, fond product, approved for human consumption by the best medical authorities in
the world. Second, as the produet is manufactured and sold in every other country, its
.manufacture and sale should be permitted in
Canada. Third, oleomargarine is a gond substitute for butter andi has general public acceptance wherever it hias been manufactured.
Fnurth. most of the ingredients used in its
manufacture are agricultural products. Then,
the short supply of butter throughout the
world, and particularly in Canada, makes it
necessary that we have a substitýute to supplément the ration.
I emphasize that the farmers and the dairy
industry have been given every support to
enable them to increase the production, of
butter, yet they have been unable to do sn.
The honourable senatnr fromn Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert), speaking in favour ofi the
bill last evening, referred to subsidies amojinting to $112,000,000 paiti tbrough the years 1943,
1944, 1945. Some questions were asked. as to
whether that amount did not benefit the consumer more than the producer and offset the
increase in the production nf butter. I think
the answer is that the Wartime Prices and
Trade Board bias controlled other prices which
would tend to increase, the farmer's cnst nf
prnducing dairy products. We find controlrigid control-in the iorm of ceiling prices on
clnthing, including overalls andi ail working
clothes; and on machinery ni ail kinds,, including butter churns, cream separatnrs, milking
machinery, dairy pails, can strainers, milk
stirrers, gasoline pumps, butter containers,
packages, and ail other such things used in the
dairy indiistry. So by the freezing of the
ceiling prices the prodiue in the dairy industry lias been protected in having these conmodities made available to him at pre-war
costs. And in addition, subsidies have been
paid to the extent oi $112,000,000 direct to the
dairy industry.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Antd the price of
butter wvas kept at the price it was before
the war.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: And, as the bionourable senator bas said, along with the freezîng of the prices ni otber articles, the price nf
butter was kcpt more or less stable: there
were ssligbit, but. nnt substantial, increases. So
we find,, considering tbe profit that the farmer
made in the pre-war perind, lus cnst of production bias not increased substantially.

Hon. Mr. MORAUD:
My honourable.
friend forgets the most, important element.
It iýs feed. It is ail very well to put a ceiling
on overais; but what, about feed?
lo n. Mr. CAMPBELL: I was going to deal
with feed. As part oi this subsidy, $44,000,000o
was paid in the formnio freight te, bring feed
fromn Western Canada to the East. That was
Iargeiy beneficial to the dairy industry, and
it benefited also the cattie industry generaliy.
An Hon. SENATOR:

Is tbat part of the

Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Tbat is part oi tbe
$112,000.000.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Will the bonourable
gentleman permit me to point out, by way of
correction, that it is in addition to the
$1 12,000,000.
Hlon. Mr. CAMPBELL: That is in addition
to the $112,000,000 oi subsidi-es that were paid.
Besides these subsidies the farmer is given
furtber protection in the forma oi a duty. On
butter there is a duty ni 14 cents per pound
general, and a preferential duty nf 5 cents. In
other words, butter brough't iromn New Zea]and and other territories subject to the
preferential tariffs pays a dut.y of five cents
per pounti; butter imported fromn other countries not entitled to the preferential duty is
subject to a duty oi 14 cents. There can be
no objection to a duty in that forma to protect tbe farmner against importations; but I
submit tbat the complete prohibition ni the
manufacture of an essential fond product,
wlben there is such a tremnendous demand for
the product, is unfair to the consuming public
oi this country. I suggest that it would be a
similar situation if we found that during a
certain season there wns a shortage ni the
potato crop and we were prohibited fromn
using rice or some other substitutýe for
potatoes.

Lot us look at the cirpumstanes nf the prohibition which was introduced many years ago,
during the last century, whe:n some butter
substitute was prohibited. Possibly at that
time it was not considered to be a gond fond
product, and possibly also at that time the
dairy industry needed some protection. But,
apart ýaltogether from the consumaption oi
butter in this country, we finti that the dairy
industry bas had a steady growth, and other
uses are gradually being found, for the products they manufacture, particularly milk.
There bias been a much greater consomption
oi fiuid miîk, and the use oi milk in the manufacture ni syntheties and other producte bias
greatly increased. I am sure bonourable sena-

MARCH 19, 1947
tors will agree that there is ikely to be a
further increase both in the consumption of
fluid milk, with proper distribution at fair
prices, and-as science develops-in the use of
milk for plastics and other synthetic materials.
That being so, our dairy industry is assured of
various outlets for their produet, and there
sheuld not be the slightest objection either by
the dairy industry or the farmers of this country to permitting the consuming public to
have a substitute for butter, as we find they
have in all other countries. And, with all
respect to the argument advanced by the
honourable senator from Queen's (Hon.. Mr.
Sinclair), I submit that our delegates to the
international conference will not gain very
much àf they have to base their arguments for
any concessions they may wish to get on the
fact that we are going to permit the importation of oleomargarine. I think we should face
the situation now, face it courageously, say
that the present legislation should 'have been
taken off the statute books some time ago,
and pass this .bill to permit the manufacture
of oleomargarine.
Hon. J. P. McINTYRE: Honourable senators, in rising to say a few words in connection
with tbis bill, I realize that it was before
this honourable body just a year ago and
was then voted down by a small majority.
The honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) has seen fit to reintroduce it this
year, and rightly so. He has the right to put
forward all the arguments and muster all the
strength lie possibly can in order to carry his
bill through this house. I appreciate the sincerity and the ability of the honourable senator in the case that he has made out in favour
of oleomargarine. But it muet be realized
that there are differing views in this chamber,
and anybody who takes a different view has
an equal right to muster all the strength and
put forward all the arguments he possibly can
in order to express the views of the people
whm he represents in the Parliament of
Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McINTYRE: It was, I believe,
in 19'18 that legislation was passed to prohibit
the importation and manufacture or sale of
oleomargarine in Canada. In 1922 parliament
legalized the sale of oleomargarine; and in
1923 it reversed that deaision, rescind-ing or
repealing 'the act of the previous year. So the
legislation was in force for one year. There
must have been something wrong with legislation 'that was left on the statute books for
only one year. I do not know the circumstances, but I have been told in the Department of Agriculture that there was so much

161

indignation throughout Canada that year that
the government of the day was forced to
repeal the act at the following session. That
may or may not be the case. The henourable
member from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
may be better informed than I am.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is not quite correct.
Hon. Mr. MeINTYRE: That is not quite
correct. lowever that may be, representing
as I do an agricultural province, I am here
to voice in this honourable chamber the views
of the people of that province. Last year I
received a resolution on the subject from the
Dairymen's Association of Prince Edward
Island; and this year, again, I have had a
letter from them confirming the opposition
they voiced a year ago to the manufacture
and use of oleomargarine. If honourable
members will bear with me for just a few
moments I shall read the resolution. I was
not here last year when the discussion took
place and I do not know whether or not this
resolution was read in this chamber at that
time. It puts forth the views of both the
dairy industry and those who are associated
with it in the province which I represent.
The resolution reads:
Whereas, the maintenance of soil fertility
should at all times be the main object of the

farmers,
And whereas, it lias long been recognized by
agricultural authorities that dairying is the one
branch of farming that tends the best to maintain this fertility and anything that might lie
donc to weaken the dairy industry would reflect
unfavourably upon agriculture in general by
lesseoing its purchasing power which in turn
might disturb the whole economy set-up,
And whereas, the present shortage of butter
is only temporary, caused in part by an unwillingness of labour -to engage in agricultural work,
a scarcity of dairy equipment, and partly by a
greater quantity of milk being diverted into the
fluid milk trade rather than into churning cream
caused by the low price paid for butter fat in
comparison to that paid for fluid milk,
And whereas, during the war years the dairy
farmers of Canada, under great difficulties .and
at a financial sacrifice, valiantly maintained the
production line, a feat only made possible by
overtime work and family labour,
And whereas, anything that might cause the
farmers of Canada to turn their attention from

dairying to other lines of agriculture such as
the production of poultry, hogs, beef, grain or
potatoes, lines that would be more attractive
to labour and allowance of shorter hours, but

would at the same time rob other people, especi-

ally the children, of a food which cannot be
replaced for its nutritional value by any other
commodity,
Therefore, be it resolved, that we, the Prince
Edward Island Dairymen's Association oppose
most strongly the passage of the bill now before
the Canadian Senate having for its object the
manufacture and sale within Canada of oleomargarine, a substance produced by the products of

cheap labour in other lands where a lower standard of living prevails than that which we
would like to see for our own Canadian people.
You may see from that resolution that its
sponsors are afraid that if this bill becomes
law the farmers of Prince Edward Island will
give their attention to the production of other
ines besides those of the dairy industry.
Prince Edward Island is a potato-growing
province and if the farmers turn their attention to growing potato.es in larger quantities
than they are now doing and thus forget the
production of cream and butter, I am afraid
that would prove disastrous. At the present
time we have in storage more than three
million bushels of seed potatoes and a million
and a half bushels of table stock potatoes.
Had it not been for the contract that we were
able to make with the British Government for
the sale of three million bushels, I do not
know what would have happened.
Transportation has been a problem in
Prince Edward Island for many years, and
anything that tends to hamper transportation
is detrimental to the population. At this time
a year ago we had a little over a million and
a half bushels of seed potatoes and 700,000
bushels of table potatoes. This year we have
200 million bushels more than last year-it
would take 5,980 cars to transport them-and
when I tell you that we have only one boat
operating across the straits you will have some
idea of our difficulties. We are hoping by
June ,15 to have a new boat in operation
which will help to solve the problem. The
railroad in Prince Edward Island is planning
to replace steam engines by electrie or diesel
engines so as not to have to transport coal
to supply the steam engines. If this bill is
passed in the Senate and in the other house,
which I very much doubt, oleomargarine
would be another nuisance to be transported
across the ferry.
To give you an idea of the agricultural
activities in the Maritime Provinces, I may say
that at the present time we have over nine
million bushels of potatoes in storage, that is,
5,092.000 bushels more than there were at this
time a year ago; and in the whoIe of Canada
there are a little less than 12 million bushels of
potatoes in storage, or 6,588,687 bushels more
That is. the Maritime
than last year.
Provinces have nine of the twelve million
bushels in the whole Dominion of Canada.
We do net want anything that would be
harmful to our agricultural activities.
Opposition to this bill is not confined to
Prince Edward Island and the other Maritime
Provinces. I received from the secretary of

the Ontario Creamery Association a telegram
protesting against the bill. No doubt other
honourable senators received the same telegram, and with permission of the house I
should like to place it on Hansard:
We vigorously protest proposal to legalize
oleomargarine in Canada, as a blow at the
farmers of Ontario. During the war we accepted with good grace diversion of milk from
butter to ether commodities as in the dominion's
interest. We have accepted with good grace importation of New Zealand butter to make up
the current artificial shortage. Imposition of
oleomargarine would be a serions blow to 711,000
cream producers of the province of Ontario,...
Averaging five persons to a family, that
would represent between three and four hundred thousand people in Ontario.
. . . . and a poor reward for sacrifices still being

exacted by the federal government. We solicit
your support for agriculture, and would urgently
request you to vote against the proposed oleomargarine bill.
A. S. Thurston, Secretary-Manager, Ontario
Creamery Association.
That alone, coming as it does from his own
province, should influence my honourable
friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) not to
proceed further with this bill. I think it would
be in the interest both of Ontario farmers and
the honourable senator from Waterloo if he
would consent to withdraw the bill.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I am thinking of the
consumers of this country as a whole.
Hon. Mr. MeINTYRE: The consumers?
Hon. Mr. EULER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MeINTYRE: My honourable
friend said in his speech, if I remember rightly,
something about 118,000 dairy cattle which
were sold in Canada and shipped to the
United States last year.
That is good business, and it has always
been going on.
Hon. Mr. EULER: We are not objecting
to it.
That does not
Hon. Mr MeINTYRE:

cows freshen every year and young cattle are

United States is a sideline from which the
farmer gets some extra money to carry on
his operations.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: May I be permitted
to ask a question?
Hon. Mr. MeINTYRE: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: Is it more profitable
for a farmer to sell dairy cattle than to make
butter?

MARCH 19, 1947
Hon. Mr. McINTYRE: I would say it is
good business for the farmer to seil his surplus of old cows ta the United States. If lie
can get a good price lie should take it; lie
bias young stock coming an. May I say in
answer ta my honourable friend from St.
Boniface (Hon. Mr. Hawden), who is a

Hon. Mr. EULER: Can you get $175 each
for aId cows?
Hon. Mr. McINTYRE: If the ather felIow is willing ta pay it, I think it is quite
proper ta take it.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hon. Mr. McINTYRE: A six-manths old

Hon. Mr. DUFF US:

Hon. Mr. QUINN: Why seli butter?
Hon. Mr. McINTYRE:
Yes, why seli
butter? But I do not blame any man for
Pccepting whatever amount the other fellow
is willing ta pay.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Neither do I, but I
doubt whether lie would pay as mucli for aId
cows as the honourable gentleman suggests.
Hon. Mr. McINTYRE:
The other day
my honourable friend -fromn Waterloo ý(Hon.
Mr. Euler) mentioned a firmn in Toronto
that was exporting ails and fats ta Newfoundland, where oleomargarine
is being
nianufactured.
I wish ta quote a recent
newspaper article headed "Fats to Newfoundland".
lIn urging the legaliza-tion of margarine in
Canada, Senator Euler last week told of a concern operating in Toronto which lie said collects
fats-vegetable, animal and fish types-and exports them to Newfoundland where they are
inade ino margarine.
Wlxy, asked Senator Euler, should flot these
fats be utilized inside Canada at a time of
"great butter bardship"?
If the senator really wants it, the answer
is easily supplied . JBecause of the world-wide
shortage of fats and ails, these commodities are
allocated to the varions countries by the International Food Emergency Council.
Canada's
iniport quota for this year is 78,000 metric tons.
Part of the deal is that Canada shaIl supply
Newfoundland with 4,700 metric tons of fats
and ois. In return Canada receives f rom Newfoundland 4.000 tons of whale and fish ails. This
arrangement is based on historical record and
83168-llj

is typical of the way in which the international
schieme bas been worked ont an a regional basis
wherever feasible.
The Toronto firm referred to by Senator
Euler is siniply exporting fats and ails ta Newfaundland in conformity with the overaîl agreement.
Hon. Mr. EULER:

It is a bad agreement.

Han. Mr. McINTYRE: Mr. S. H. Lehberg,
speaking before a meeting in Montreal
recently, said that lie anticipated the shortage
of fats and oils would continue for another
three years. A British authority predicted
that it would last ten years.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD:
That is right.
Hon. Mr. MeINTYRE: Why then should
we place on aur statuite books legislation that
w-ill act as a red light ta the farmers of this
country, and prevent them from going ahead
and performing dairy farming operations as
they have done in the past? I am speaking
an behaîf of the farmer who makes bis living
from a small herd of cattie. This country
has innumerable farmers who have only six
or seven head of cattle. That type of farmer
gets up at five o'clack in the morning, milks
his caws, separates the cream and takes it
la the milk stand, where it is picked up by
a truck and taken to the factory. That is
his only means of livelihood until bis crops
are harvested.
He gets bis cream cheque
once or twice a month, and that pays for
bis groceries and hclps ta maintain bis family
during the summer months. If we permitted
the manufacture of oleomargarine in Canada,
and it was placed in every grocery store from
the Atlantic ta the Pacific at a few cents
a pound cheaper than butter, would anyone
expect the hausewife flot to choose oleamargarine?
Butter would be lef t on aur
shelves, and the reaction would put the small
dairy farmer out of business. That is the
history of those things.
When the Japanese crab was imported from
Japan ta the United States and Canada the
people chose crab instead of lobster, because
crab was cheaper. Lobster was selling at a
very low price and the fishermen on the
east coast were so seriously and detrimentally
affected that the Canadian, governrnent bad ta
camne to, their assistance. The same situation
would apply ta the dairy industry, if the manufacture of oleomnargarine was permitted. Butter
would be side-tracked and oleamargarine would
take its place.
I shou.id like hanourable senators to see
oleomargarine under circumstances that I have
seen it. Look at a smail1 amount of oleomargarine that bas been exposed ta the sun

11e might have stated also, as I think I stated
last session, that at the timae that bill passed
oleemargarine had a very unsavoury reputation; and, according to the researchi I have
madle, it deserved at that time jts unsavoury
reputation. It was flot a wholesome article of
food, The bill whicb was brouglit dlown at
that time and subsequently enacted into law,
to prohibit the manufacture, sale and importation of oleomargarine, contained in its preamble a recital that oleomargarine and certain
butter substitutes were injurieus to public
healtb, and it was on that ground, I submait,
that the Parliament of Canada assumed
jurisdiction to enact the legisiation in the
first place. But it is very significant that in
the same ycar, 1886, when the statutes were
revised, tbe recital as to the alleged impurity
of the substance disappeared. I submait that
the recital in the original bill was the only
ground upon wbich the Parliament of Canada
hýad any authority to pass that legislation.
Nobody can argue today that oleomargarine
is not a wholesome article of food. 'Did flot
our own Parliament in 1919 lift the ban
against it?
And, contrary to wbat was
stated by the honourable senator from Mount
Stewart (Hon. Mr. McIntyre) that lifting of
the ban, if I may so term it, was continued in
force from 1919 dlown to 1923 or 1924.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: Has it lest it by an
enaetment that oleomargarine is net detrimental te health? I have net seen any sucli
enactment.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BENCH: I should be very surprized if the parliament of this country in
1919, 1921 and 1922 authorized for sale to the
people of this country a product that was
injurious to public health. I think that is the
answer to my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Oleomargarine was fed
to the soldiers in the first world war and in
the recent one.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I have been told that it
was fed to our troops during this war. As I
say, honourable senators, if it were possible
for us in some way or other to refer the
matter to a court for its opinion, I should
bu a very strong supporter of such a move
because, among other reasons, I should be
pretty sure of the answer. However, I realize
that that is impossible. Nevertheless, if we
pass the measure and send it to the House
of Commons, the government can make such
a reference; and if the answer of the court
is as I think it would be, then nobody need
be embarrassed about the prohibition or
attempt to remove it. If this present prohibition can be defended at al], I suggest it can
only be donc on the grounds that it is required
for the protection of the dairy inferests. I am
not endeavouring to say that the dairy inferests are not entitled to protection.
As I
understand the situation, I do not think they
are entitled to it, in view of the benefits that
would accrue to the consuming publie of this
country if the protection were removed. In
the dairy industry itself there is not complete agreement that protection is necessary.
For example, last year the honourable gentleman from Soutb Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donnelly)
was one of those wh.o supported the second
reading of this bill, and just a day or two
ago the honourable senator from St. Boniface
(Hon. Mr. Howden) spoke in favour of the
measure now before the house. Both those
gentlemen have either direct or indirect interssts in the cattle and dairy farming business.
It has always seemed to me that committee
work is one of the very useful functions of
this branch of the parliament of Canada. It
is mainly in senate committees that an opportunity is provided for interested sections of
the public to give expression to their views.
Through these committees we get the opportunity of obtaining professional, technical
advice on matters which otherwise are mere
conjecture on our part. I should like te see
this bill discussed by a representative committee of this bouse. I should like to have
that committee hear evidence as to whether
-or not fats and oils are available for the
manufacture and sale of oleomargarine in
Canada; and evidence from representatives

of the dairy industry in this country as to
whether or not the removal of this ban would
do the industry any harm. The committee
could also hear representations by people who
can speak for labour and for consumer
organizations. I am sure tha-t the sponsor of
this bill would be very happy to give Mr.
Hannam, President of fthe Federation of
Agriculture, an opportunity of appearing
before the committee and saying whatever
might then bu on his mind.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: How about getting
somebody to speak for the parliamentary
restaurant?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I should also be in
favour of that. If the bill was referred to
such a committee we could then come back
here with the cormittee's report, knowing
better at least than we do now what is the
actual state of affairs as to the shortage of
fats and oils, and as to other matters that are
in dispute in this debate.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Do you think that the
committee would change your opinion?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: The honourable acting
leader of this side has asked me a question
which I am very happy to answer. I say to
him that it might very well change my opinion.
I might have some doubts as to whether or not
it would change the opinion of the acting
leader.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I can assure my honourable friend that it would not.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: If the bill were given
second reading, on the understanding it will be
referred to a standing committee, honourable
senators would bu committed in no way at all.
When it came back to this house for a third
reading, any honourable senator would be
free to vote against it. I suggest that that
might be the best and most realistic way for
this house to deal with the matter.
May I make a few observations regarding
the speech of the honourable senator from
Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair)? I have very
great respect for everything he has to say,
which is only natral in the liglit of his long
and varied experience in the parliament of
Canada. I find it difficult to accept his suggestion that a removal of the ban on the
importation of oleomargarine would in any
way embarrass the representatives of Canada
at the World Trade Conference. In any
event, that is another feature which could be
considered by a committee of this house. If
the committee should conclude that the
removal of the ban would affect, or in any
w'ay embarrass, the position of our representatives at Geneva, then this louse might

MARCH 19, 1947
properly consider an amendiment to the bill
so as to provide only for permission to manufacture and seli within Canada. Under those
circumstances I arn quite sure the honourable
member from Queen's would agree that
Canadas representatives at Geneva would
nlot in any way be embarrassed in their
deliherations.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: May I say that if
1 used the word "ernbarrass" I djd nlot have
that precise meaning in mind. What I intended to say, and what I thought I did say, was
that the action provided by this bill wold
weaken the bargaining powers of our representatives in getting a quid pro quo arrangement wjth other nations for a balance of
trade.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I accept wbat the bonourabIe gentleman bas said,. I was using the
word "embarrass" in the sense in which ho now
expresses himself.
Hon. IVA CAMPBELL FALLIS: Honourable senators, at this late stage in the debate
1 do not intend to take more than a few
minutes of the time of the bouse. My only
reason for rising at this time is that before
coming into the chamber today I noticed in
a Toronto paper the headline, "Ontario Senators Favour Oleomargarine". Just to kcep
the record straiglit, I rise in my place to say
I arn one .qenator frein Ontario who is not
supporting tbe bill.
When the bill was before the bouse last
session I expressed my views at some length,
and I do not intend to repeat what I said at
that time. My opposition to the bill can be
summed up in two brief sentences. First,
I bave not been conv-inced- by any speech that
bas been mnade in this boeuse that the fats and
oiîs necessary to manufacture oleomargarine
on this continent can be made available to
Canada without depriving people in other
parts of the world who need themn worse than
we d.o.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Canada today is an
oasis of plenty in a world of scarcity. Every
day we bear pleas to belp the starving cbildren
of Europe and the people of China. Are we
with one hand to give them. money and food,
while wjth the other reach out to take from
them that food procluct of which they are in
such urgent need?
I bad, the privilege last night of having
dmnner with a young womnan who has just
returned frorn England. She said before
leaving that country the butter ration was two
ounces per person per week; the ration of
bacon was the saine; and eaech person was

167

allowed 20 cents worth of meat per week. We
live in the midst of plenty; there is nothing
necessary to our dai-ly wellbeing that we lack,
ualess it is a 'little bit more of butter. In a
world of scarcity we can scarcely consider
d.epriving people of a commodity they need s0
badly. This young woman said to me tbhat
the people of Britain are cold ail the time. If
they had more fats in their food they could
stand the cold better. We in Canada, with
everything upon our tables, must reach out
and seek to take frorn thern somne of that fat
which we can get in. no other way. World
supplies are pooled; there is a world shortage.
If we consume more than we are using today;
somebody aise wil1 bave less.
I corne to my second reason for opposing
the bill. Every person who bas spoken in
support of the bill bas said: "We are short
of butter in this country. Why should we
not bave a substitute?" On the surface that
sounds very reasonable.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: It was good sense last
year.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: If that condition had
always existed, in the past and was likely to
continue in the future, I would support the
bill. The honourable members who are supporting it are asking us to place upon the
statute books of Canada permanent «legislation based upon temporary conditions. I can
think back a good many years-too rnany-to
the days when one could scarcely give butter
away.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: No one knows what
is ahead of us in the next few years. An
economic recession with unemployment in
the cities would soon drive help back to the
farrns. The shortage of help on the farrn,
more than anything else, bas caused the shortage of butter. If that condition cornes there
wilI ha plenty of help and the picture will be
entirely changed. I refuse by rny vote to bind
myscîf to permanent legislation whea I do not
know what the conditions the dairy industry
may be in a few years hence.
For these two reasons I arn not supporting
the bill.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: May I ask my honourable friend a qùestion? I shahl try to ha quite
fair. The honourable lady spoke of a shortage
of butter and fats in England, and said that
the ration was only two ounces per week. Is
she not aware that 12,000,000 pounds of New
Zealand butter coming to Canada are being
taken froin Britain's stores?

MR. DONALD GORDON
TRIBUTES TO FORMER CHAIR-MAN 0F WARTIýME PRICES AND TRADE BOARD

On the Orders of the Day:

Hon. A. B. COPP: Honourable senators,
before we proceed with tbe regular business
of the bouse I wishi te say a few words in
tribute te Mr. Donald Cordon. We have all
noticed the announeement made by 'the Prime
Minister in another braneh cf Parliament,' as
well as in the publie press, that Mr. Donald
Giordon has resigned as Chairman cf the Wartime Prices and Trade Board.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Thank, Ccd for that.

Hon. Mr. COPP: As this matter bas been
mentioned in another place, 1 fe-el that it
would flot bc inappropriate to make reference
to it here. \Ve are ail familiar with the record
of Mr. Gordon in the high positions which hie
bas beld. H1e is Deputy Governor of the
Bank of Canada; and five or six years ago,
at the request of the. goveramcnt, hie assumed
the position of Chiairman of the Wartime
Prîces and Trade Board. Since then hie bas
carried on in that position-a position that
everyone must realize bias been a very difficuit
one because of the many orders and decisions
hie bas found it necessary to make. Ail of us
bave had to observe bis orders. Hie has been
severely criticized on some occasions, but lie
bias also reeeived many plaudits fromn the
people of Canada for the splendid way in
which hie bias conducted bis very trying and
responsible tasks. Now that bie bas relinquished bis duties as chairman of tbe board,
1 feel it is only fair and right that we should
recognize the work hie bias done and thank
hirn for a splendid job. We ail agrce that hie
did wlhat lie belic'ed to be an honest and
straightforward job, and in my opinion did it
ia a way that wva, highly creditable to biim-self and greatly to the advantage, of the
The thanks of the people of
Dominion.
Canada are duc to 1dm.
Sonie Ilon. SENA'ýTORS: Hear, hecar.
Hon. CYRILLE VAILLANCOURT (Translation): Honourable Senators, 1 was Mr.
Gordon's assistant for two and a half years
at tbe Wartime Prices and Trade Board, as
representative of the Frencb-speaking clement,
and it gives me great pleasure to add my
compliments to those of the bonourable leader
of this bouse. Mr. Gordon and 1 sometimes
disagreed because I beld certain views regarding the needs of my province wbicb were
not always those Mr. Gordon held in connection witb the needs of other provinces.
But lie was primarily responsible for the
protection of our whole economie organization.
In spite of our differcnces of opinion, 1 can
say that Mr. Gordon always deait with
our econornie problems w'ith bis characteristie
fair-mindedness and ivithout perjudice. Some
may not have been satisfied, wbile others
may even say "God hless yoii'* 1 arn happy
to say "God blcss us", because we were
fortunate in baving a man of bis intelligence
and eharacter at the head of that organization
whiich saved Canada in a period of extraordinary emergency.
Hua. JOHN T. HIAIG: Honourable senators, during the five and a half years of war
the people of Canada were ivholebeartedly
behind any controls or other policies whicb

MARCH 20, 1947
would be useful or helpful in winning the war.
1 arn one of those who hold that wben the
war was over controis should have been abolished, and 1 do flot hesitate to say nowy nearly
two years after the conclusion
of the war,'
that they should have been abandoned long
ago. However, asstiming a controller to be
necessary, I do flot know how one could do
better than choose a Scotsman for t.he job;
and I believe that Mr. Gordon, ini the exercise
of his jurisdictjon, bas donc as well as, or
better than, anybody else could have done.
I say again that I do flot believe in the policy
of controls, but also I do flot blame Mr.
Gordon for that policy; it is one for which
the Government must take full responsibility,
especially since the war ended. It is fortunate for Canada that in our public life we
can command the services of men with the
siiigleness of purpose .that Mr. Gordon lias
shown in serving the interests of our country.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, I cannot let this opportunity
pass without expressing, on: behaîf of a large
group of their friends in this community of
Ottawa, a word of appreciation to Donald
Gordon and bis wife. I arn sure that it will
be with feelings of sincere pleasure and pride
that tbey note the formai recognition of his
services as voiced yesterday by the Prime
Minister in another place, and today, in the
Senate, by the acting leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Capp), the leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig), and my honourable friend
from Kennebec (flon. Mr. Vaillancourt),
speaking in bis own language and 'that of the
majority in the province of Quebec.
For nearly six years now Donald Gordon
bas been Canada's officiaI point-duty man,
directing the dairly routine of every man,
womnan and child in this country. His job bas
flot been, an easy one; it lias been a very
trying job, which bas subjected the publie as
well as himsedf to many irritations. He has
been able to survive aIl tbese and to overcome
numerous obstacles large'ly because lie possesses a fundamental understanding of human
nature and a ricli sense of humour.
Wben I think of tbe role that Donald Gordon
bas had to play in tbis country during the
past six years, I arn reminded of those stalwart figures who are establisbed at the important crossroads in aIl our communities, doing
their duty day by day, directing traffic so that
confusion is reduced, to a minimum. We
gradually corne ta look upon these figures with
a friendly eye. At tinies, especially during
traffie jams, we are irritated by tbeir restrictions; but we realize that, after aIl, they are
oficers of the law and represent the interests
83168-12à

171

of tbe community. In nearly every instance
tbey manifest the courtesy born. of contact
with people in the mass.
In these days of waning and, disappearing
price ceilings, I rejoice to tbink-in companywith a good many other people in this cornmunity wbo know Donald Gordon well-tbat
there bas been, no cei'ling on the ricli store of
Scottish lore and songs in which he bas heen
accustorned to induilge himself during moments
of relaxation. Now. that lie is retiring as head
of the Wartirne Prices and Trade Board and is
resuming the duties of bis former post of
use.fulness. it is ta bie hoped that lie will have
time for these deliglits, for I know that in this
city there stilIl are many roofs able ta withstand the reverberations of bis lusty baritone
voice when lie chooses to raise it in praise
of the Scottish land and story.
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD BILL
MOTION

FOR SECOND

READING

Hon. A. B. COPP moved the second reading
of Bill 23, an Act ta amend the Canadian
Wheat Board Act, 1935.
He said: Honourable senators, my bonourable friend from Central Saskatchewan (Hon.
Mr. Jolinston) bas kindly consented to explain
this bllI.
Hon. J. FREDERICK JOHNSTON: Honourable senators, the purpose of this bill is ta
give to the Canadian Wheat Board by statute
certain of the powers which it bas exercised
previously by virtue of orders in council under
the National. Emergency Transitional Powers
Act.
Tbe chief purposes of the proposed amendments ta the Canadian Wheat Board Act,
1935, are as follows:
1. Ta authorize the regulation by the Canadian Wheat Board of the interprovincial and
export trade in wheat for thc purpose of fuIfilling the wheat cantract with the UJnited
Kingdoin.
2. To provide, in connection witb this contract, for a five-year pool period from August
1, 1945, until July 31, 1950, during which time
producers of wbeat are guaranteed a fixed
initial price of $1.35 per bushel. It will lie
noticed that thc pool period is five years,
whereas the contract entered into in July last
is for a period of four years.
3. To make necessary changes in the provisions fixing the price ta be paid ta producers
of whe.at by the board.
4. To permit the board with the special
approval of the Governor in Council to deal
in grains other than wheat.

The wheat of the western provinces is sold
mainly for export to world markets at prices
which have been chronically unstable. The
following table gives the yearly average cash
price per bushel for No. 1 Canadian Northern
wheat, basis in store Fort William. The source

It should be noted that these prices are for
top grade wheat and do not take into account
freight and other charges, so that the amount
per hiishel paid to the farmer is considerably
less than the figure given. At the height of the
depression, in fact, many farmers were getting
as little as nineteen cents a bushel in actual
cash for their crop. The violent changes in
the world wheat price are due to rapîd changes
in worlrl wheat cropa, the onset of world-wîde
depressions, the abnormal demand for wheat
dîiring and following the war, and policies of
self-suffleiency followed hy wheat-importing
counitries. It will be remembered that after
the first Great War the European countries,
which hiad been short of foodstuffs while the
wvar was on, tried to f ortify themselves against
a rccurronce of that condition, and they broke
up their pasture lands and produced wheat,
rye and other grains.
In 1935 the Canadian Wheat Board was set
up undcr the Bennett government in response
to the dernand by western wheat growcrs
for a gox ernment agency to establish a floor
price for wbeat. The board operated aide by
aide-tbis is worth noting. honourable senators
-the board operated aide by side with the
prix-ate grain trade on the futures market.
Each year the board set a price at whicli it was
willing to buy wheat. Thus, wlhen the Board
set a prîce above the market price. it bought
wheat at a loss, but whcen it s-et a price
below the market price. the private trade
bouglit ail the wheat and made what profit

there was to he made. Prior to 1940 the board
lost about 60 mill ion dollars over the successive crop years; after 1940, however, it began
to make substantial profits.
On September 27, 1943. the Grain Exchange
wvas closed and aIl marketing in wheat and stocks
of wheat wvas put under the wheat board. A
fixed initial 1)rice of $1.25 a bushel was established for top grade wheat, and more than
61 million dollars was paid out in participation
payments for the crops of 1940-41 to 1942-43.
On July 30, 1946, a new wheat price policy
was announeed, based on the contract with
the United Kingdom that was signed on
July 24. Participation paymcnts of about 12
cents per bushel were to be paid on the 1943
crop, about 16 cents per bushel on the 1944
crop, and 10 cents per bushel on the 1945.crop.
The guaranteed initial price of $1.35 per bushel
was to ho paid for wheat over the five-year
period 1945-1949 inclusive. At the cnd, of this
five-year period, any profits made by the
wheat board on the sale of this wheat would be
pooled and distributed to the producers in
the forma of participation pa-yments. In the
other bouse there was considerable discussion
on the pooling of these profits after a fiveyear period. and it was held by many that
participation pqyments should he naid at thic
end of each crop year. I am one who helieves
that the distribution of profits after a period
of five years is a good idea. 1 will go further
and say I feel that, if it was made possible
to do so under this agreement, any surpluses
,whichi accrue should lie hcld as an insurance
igainst repetition of whiat wc had in the
West from 1932 to 1935-36.
On February 17, 1917, the price of wheat for
domestie consumption was raised from $1.25
to $1.55 per bushel. Millers of flour were
stilI able to get, wheat for 77î cents per
bushel bv reason of a drawback paid by the
goveroflirnt.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HAYD EN: I apologize, for interrupting my friend, but I arn trying to find
out what the contract prevides for. Is there an
obligation that in each of the years 1948-49
and 1949-50 the United Kingdom gevern.ment
must take 140,000,000 bushels at a minimum
price of $1.25 for 1948-49 and at least $1 per
bushel for 1949-50?
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: I understand that
there is an obligation.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: It is a moral obligation?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, no. I will read the
provision when I speak on the subi ect.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: When we speak of
$2.90 as the price of wheat on the open market
today, it must be remembered that this is flot
the amount which the farmer receives. For
instance the Un.ited States imposes a duty of
42 cents a bushel on Canadian wheat, and
limits impoýrts by quota to 800,000 bushels a
year. It is apparent that we s'hall not haveaccess to a very large share of that market.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Does the price of $1.55
represent what the farmer gets?
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: No. it (1005 not. It
should be noted that Canada lias offered to
miake a like centract witb other wheat pur(basing countries, but none have accepted the
offer.
There ig a clause in the agreement stating
that the contract may be altered to conform
withi any subsequent international agreement.
It bias been said in anothûr place that the
farmers dislike the contract. But evcry major
farmers' organization hias expresseci approval
of it. Slowness of deli%-eries. it lias been said,
indicates the farmers' disapproval, but figures
show that within flic first hiaîf of the crop
year we shipped 72.00.00 of the 160,0000
bushels that Britain lias agreed, to take. The
hold-up in deliveries at points in Western
Canada is attributable to the railways being
blýocked withi snow wbichi dclaved the arrivai
of cars at the elevators for the loading of
wbea f.
The fivc-y-car pool period is necessary if tbe
guaranteed minimum price of $1.35 a bushiel is
to he paid without risk of a, heavy charge on
the fcderal treasury. Bctween now and 1950
farmers will continue to receive participation
paymcnts on the 1943 and 1944 crops, and a
ten-cent payment on the 1945 crop.
The
inatter of participation payments cannot be
taken care of over nighit. It would be physically impossible, even if desirable. to pay
participations each year.

If was sid in another place that the preamble of the bill pretends that its objeet is to
carry out the wheat agreement, but that
actually it provides for permanent socialization of grain marketing. A careful reading of
the preamble does not suhatiantiate this
charge. It is true that rinder Part II of the bill
the Wheat Board is given exclusive control
over the huying, delivery, transport and sale
of wheat, and that these powers do not expire
in 1950. But it must bc realized that the
gevernment bas undertaken rcsponsibility for
wheat maiketing as tbe result of persistent
demands by the farmers theinselves over a
period of many years. If the goveroiment is to
continue to control wheat marketing after
the United Kingdoni wheat agreement bhas
expired, if will have to nsk parliament te confirrn the necessary arrangements, such as the
length of the pool period. A clause in the
bill states this explicitl ' ; it is section 20(c),
to be found on page 10. If parliament decides
to end goverinent marketing of wheat, it can
do so at any time it wishes.
If is said that the board dlaims the status
of an agent of the Crown, putfing itself above
the ordinary law of the ]and, se that it can
only be sued with great difficulty. In the other
place there, was con.siderable discussion of this
point. The fact is that you can sue the Board
by applying for a fiat and proceeding in the
Exehequer Court. This procedure is neces.sary in order to prex ent lawsuits froin holding
up the payment of participation. to prevent
participation dlaims from being hiable to
garnisbee proceedings, and to prevent the
confusion of conflicting decisions and identical
suits.
Another charge is, that the board can
mnonopolize trade in coarse grains if if so
wishes. Now, as rnany honourable mnembers
know the bulk of the fecd grain produced in
Canada is for domestic consumption. The
powers eonferred on the Board f0 deal in
coarse grains are p)ermissive rather than comnpulsory, and are made necessary hy the policy
of fixing price floors and ceilings for oats and
barley. The board dees not intend to monopelize trade in coarse grains except for that
part of the crep sold fer expert. Participation is paid annually out of the equalizafion
funds set up for nats and barley. The privaf e
trade can deal in coarse grains for domestic
cen.sumption.
Then it is charged that parliament is unable
te find eut anything about the eperations of
the board. That is net berne eut by what bias
happened in the past. The board must submait
annual reports te parliament. Up until fwo
years ago a House of Commens standing cern-

MARCH 20, 1947
mittee scrutinized these annual reports and
reported, that they were extremely lucid and
informative. The, committee is being set up
again this year and will resumne its investigations of the board's activities.
Tben it has heen sta.ted in the other place
that the board can refuse to buy more than
fourteen bushels an acre from any producer.
The clause does flot set an upper limit, but is
a guarantee to the farmers that in case of
congestion at the. elevators they will be able
to deliver at least fourteen bushels per acre.
It is unlikely that it will prove necessary to
restrict deliveries of wheat, but if very large
crops 6hould make this necessary, the <armer
is protected. The minister offered to remove
this clause, but the other house decided that it
should remaain.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourable
member a question? Did- the minister offer to
remove this clause, or did hie say that he would
take an.y grain that was in elevators or forwarL positions? But there is nothing binding
a future government to take more than fourteen bushels an acre? Arn I right or arn I
wrong?
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: I think the honourable leader opposite is right in his first statement, that the minister offered to take the
clause, out. I read his statements ini Hansard;
he definitely off ered on more than one occasion
to remove that clause if so, desired. But, as
I remarked a moment ago, it was ailowed to
remain in., The Minister of Trade and
Commerce stated that there was no risk of a
l)lockade, at any rate for three years; that
ouJr storage facilities were upwards of 500,000,000 bushels, andL the elevators would be
eleaned out at the end of this crop year, or
at any rate the carryover would be very small.
So, with on.ly one year to mun, there is not any
like.hihood of a blockade, or of the board not
heing able to take ail the wheat produced.
This matter of marketing wheat is a very
live issue in Western Canada. Everyone who
(ornes from the West knows that very well.
It mnust be admitted that during the hast
number of years, -under a systema of marketing
by the wheat board, conditions have greatly
irnproved. The setting of a quota works to
the advantage of farmers living some distance
frorn the market. In these days of general
use of trucks, if there were no quota those
living close to town could fill ail the elevators
mn a few damys, and when a man living ten or
twenty miles from town came a-long with his
team and wagon-load of wheat, there would
be no space available.

175

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: With the incorne
tax as high. as it is, they do nlot rush it tO
nmarket any more.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: I Vhink they do.
My land is situate close to elevators; 1 can
move wheat in a hurry. 1 have always feit
that it was of real henefit to the man living
a considerable distance from town to be able
to secure lis share of the storage space in
years of big crops.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Does the honourabie
senator propose to send this bill to the Committee on Banking and Commerce?
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: If the house desires
that the bill go to a committee, I would
propose that it be sent to the Committee on
Natural Resources.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I should like to know
what the honourable senator proposes to do,
because it will somnewhat affect the iength
of my remarks. If it is intended to 'refer
the bill to a commaittee my observations will
be mucli briefer than otherwise they, would
be. If this is the final debate, I shouid like
to know it. Personally I prefer to have the
bill go to a committee.
Hon. Mr. COPP: There is no reason why
it should not.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: If my honourable
friend wishes, I arn prepared to move that
it be referred to a committee.
Some Hon. SENATORS: What committee?
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: The Committee
on Natural Resources.
Honourable senators,
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
I am going to assume, although I know it is
an insulting thing to say, that this house
knows very littie if anything about the wheat
marketing business. Those of us who'corne
from, the Western Provinces do know something about it. Ever since I was a small
boy an expression commonly in use in our
country was, "Well, it is just as good as the
wheat".
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is not peculiar
to the West.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: In other countries people
say, "It is as good as gold". In the West,
when we remark upon somneone being upright
and straight and honest, we say that lie or
she is "just as good as the wheat."
Hon. Mr. EULER: They say it here, too.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: From my earliest boyhood I have been accustomed to hearing of
wheat, the marketing and the handling of

176

SENATE

wheat. I shall fot discuss the history of the
early days; it is sufficient to go back to about
1919. That year the goverament of the day
made the first interference in the wheat
market by taking over the handling of
wheat: it proposed that a board should carry
orn the marketing of wheat. A new government came into office in 1922, and in the
following year it decided to shlow co-operative
or volunteer organizations, outside the regular
marketing agents, to handle the wheat. With
the wheat pools of Manitoba, Saskatchewan
and Alberta eo-operatively handling the trade,
things ran along quit e successful]y until 1929
and 1930, when a curious psychology swept
over Western Canada. It affected not only
the grain trade, but the pools as well.* Everybody said that the price of grain was too low,
that it would go higher, and the pools made
advances f0 enable the grain to be held.
The resuit of this was thiat by early 1930 a
tremeudous loss had been incurred by the
pools in Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan.
I believe that the loss sufiered by the Mansitoba pool was approximafely three million
dollars.
In Saskatchewan it amounted to
approximately twelve or thirteen millions,
whii-e in Alberta, it wvas between sevcn and
eight millions. This was as a resuit of having
te, seil the grain for the money advanced
against it. The governments of those fhree
provinces guarante-ed that loss.
I remember wüll that a certain gentleman
now well known in the Parliament of Canada,
who at. that time was leader of the government in the Manitoba legislafure brought in
a bill to guarantee the loss, whieh bas, of
course, largely been paid back since that time.
That was the situation with regard to. cooperative marketing of wheat by farmers up
until 1935. You could either selI your wheat
te, the grain trade direct or turn it over ýto the
pools, and they would handle it for you and
give you a certain advance against it. You
had your choice: if you wanf cd to co-operate
with your neighibours you did su.
In 1935 the then goverumnent broùght in a
bill, which 1 have before me, to form a comnl)ulsory wheat board for Canada.
I want
honourable senators to keep that fact in mind,
hecause the bill we are uow dealing with is a
compulsory wh'eat board bill.
Hon. Mr. EULER: What government was
that? There was a change of goverumnent in
1935.
Hou. Mr. HAIG: Not. in the carly part of
1935. In June of that ycar the goveroment

which wvas asscnted to on July 5. Wlîen it
w~as jufrodu(ced in the house-

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: You mean the other
bouse?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. At that time the
present Prime Minister, was leader of the
opposition. I am not going to read alI that hie
said, but the Communs Hansard for 1935, at
page 3451, shows that the first words spoken
by him were in the truc tradition-a demand
that the bill go to a committee. Mr. Ring
said:
May I say that 1 agree with the Prime Min.
ister (iMr. Bennett) that this question is far
too serious to be dealt with in any narrow par.
tisau mnanner. I believe it is as serious as any
problem whichi bas faeed this country at any
time, and too great care caunot be taken in
thie cousideration of what is to he doue. It is
for that reas-on I feel that if the goverument
could see its wsy to refer the bill to a select
or special committee. it is -wholly probable that
some of the points which may hie obscure at the
mnoment would be eleare(l up and possibly much
in the way of confusion and contruversy ended.
Again:
It bas, I thiuk, been customnary lu counection
with a mneasure of this importance to have it
referred either to une of the select standing
committees uf this bouse . . . or to a speciai
commi ttee.
And again:
1 therefore ani askinig the Prime !Miinister
. . . that the bill . . . be referred to a select
committee.
Iu answer fo tliat request the then Prime
Minister szaid thiat lie ivas agrecable to having
ihie matter dealt with hy a eommittee. Remember, houourahle senutors, thiat if was a coinpulsory wheat bill. The committee of nine,
of which Mr. Bennett himself was a member,
broughit back a voiunfary co-operative bill.
Housard of 1935, at page 3581, shows that the
Honourable J. L. Haîston said:
I (10 not believe that the people of the
Dominion of Canadta are favourable to a comnipulsory wheat board, to a board the constitution of which will mnean that every wheat
grower. every elevator man andl everybody
engaged in tlîe wheat business must deal with
the goverinent ageney and nohody else . . . I

There you have the issue clearly drawn between the two parties at that time in the house;
one was for compulsion;
-the Conservativethe other,
-the. Liberalwas for a continuance of the voluntary
system.
That is the history up to the year 1939.
Now we have the bringing in of a comnpulsory Wheat Board Bill, andI say, without
ft.ar of contradiction, that no Socialistic governlment in the world could use harder or
stronger language to make compulsion the
basic principle of a bill.
Last July the governmcnt of the day aaw
fit to make a wheat agreement with Britain.
Permit me to deal with that agreement for a
moment.
It provides that Great Britain
would take 160 million bushels of our wheat,
at a price of $1.55 f.o.b. Fort William for first
grade. I shall deal with the rest of the agreement later. My honourable friend the member for Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr.
Johnston) suggcsts we should be glad to deal
with Great Britain because that country is
one of our best customers. That may be true,
but let me cail attention to this. My deskmate (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) is one of the largest
grawers of wheat in this country and hie is
paying the full contribution on bis wheat,
whercas I am paying nothing, because I have
no wheat to seli. Is that fair? la that something for this house ta boast about? If we
in Canada want ta help the
British
well and good; but let us ail pay aurpeople'
share.
Why should the wheat grower seli his product
for $1.55, when only three days ago in Winnipeg the wheat board was selling wheat on
the world market at $3.10 a bushel?
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: May I ask the
honourable senator a question? How does
the farmer know whether the world price is
going to be $2.90 or below 81.55? I arn a
wheat grower myself and I understand the
farrner's position. H1e figures that hie has a
guaranteed price until 1950.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is only for two years.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: H1e figures that
hie can hase his operations on a certain minimumi guarantee, and that if anything more is
realized hie can get bis ahare.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is not correct.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I think it is.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The agreement makes
provision for only a two-year period, following which new negotiations wilh be made.

177

There neyer was any danger that the wheat
price would go down for two or three years,
because it is impôssible for Europe to produce
enough wheat for its own people, and they
will be compelhed to buy from us as well as
froni other nations.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The saine condition
exista after every war.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes; after every war,
from the Napoleonie war ta wars of thia day,
there bas been the saine atory.
We are boasting about giving the British
people grain at $1.55. My point is that the
farmer should not have to bear the burden
of that agreement.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: May I ask my
friend if it is not true that in bad times the
people of Canada atood behind the western
provinces by way of prairie fanm rehabilita'tion, war acreage extension and seed grain to
the extent of more ithan 400 million dollars?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: And it bias ahl been paid
back. Losses of 61 million dollars have ahl
been paid back.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Not back into the
treasury?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, it is ahl back in the
treasury. The banks have had ta make it Up.
They have held back a sura of 36 million dollars, which applies to 1945. This year probably 161 million dollars will be in the treasury.
Hon. A. L. BEAIJBIEN: Under the contract
you are bound ta give the fanmer whatever is
left in the pool.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The honourable gentleman froni Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) is talking about lasses. The lasses were nepaid out
of money saved during the yeans. The West
will have about 100 million buahels of wheat.
this year to keep for itself and. ta selI ta outsiders.
At the world price of 82.25 a bushel-it haa
climbed ta $3.10 within the hast few daysthe farmer is deprivedi of 70 cents a bushel,
which would amount ita around 100 million
dollars. When fneight and expenses have been
accounted for, it would amount ta nearly 200
million dollars. A very large profit is represented there. Why should we boast about
what we are doing for Britain, when the only
people who are doing anything are the wheat
gnowers? They are paying the piper.

office. wbo bave a total erop of about 3.000
busbels, protest against this deal and say they
have lost at least $3,000. They contend that
lhe arrangement is a very improper one.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: But minus tbe income
iax it would not arnount to much.
After expenses and
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
exernptions are deducted. the income tax
irnounts to very little.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL:
lionourable gentleman if be
parity of farm prices. and
agree that this agreernent is
l)arity?

May I ask tbe
is in favour of
if lie would not
one step towards

Hon. Mr. HAIG: The farm implement coinpanies bave been nllowed an increase of 12ý
per cent on their machinery. Wben I was a lad
'vo could buy n six-foot binder for $150 cash,
l)ut today you cannot buy one for less than
$450.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: Do you mean the saine
size binder?

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Some of them are sev-enfoot. You have to pay cash on the line now,

but in my day you were permitted to pay $50
down and give a note for the balance.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Wbat would be the
relation between the cost of the implement
and the price of wheat in those d'ays?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Wheat in those days was
worth 70 to 75 cents a bushel. My honourable
friend fromn Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr.
John.son) said the price bas been as low as
that in sorne rocent vcars. But there is no
comparison. The price of inachinery today to
the farmer i.; tbree tirnes wbat it was fifty
years ago; but the price of wheat in ordinary
tirnes-not in the war years-is flot more than
double wbiat it was tlien.
H-on. Mr'. SINCLAIR: If we could operate
on the basis of the war v'ears we would not
need this agreernent at aI.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: If the government is right
in applying the ternis of this agreement we are
going to be faced with a charge fromn the
western farmers that during 1946 an.d 1947
Vhey sold their wbeat at a loss of 2M0 million
dollars. In 1954 and 1955, if the wheat price
on the world market goes down to 75 cents,
they will stili demand $1.55, and will want

the difference madle up to tbem. In those
cireumstances I wou]d say they had a very
good case. But I know that menx frnm. the
Maritimes, Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia who will not be very keen to vote in

favour of sucha a contribution. It will be said,
"We have to take a low price on commod-ities,
why should.n't they?"
WTheat is the only commodity about which
such a deal as this bas beien made. True, we
have sold bacon under certain agreements,
but they -have not had the defeets of this contract. To the large wheat producing province
of Saskatchewan the difference in price to, be
received by the farmers under this agreement
is an important item.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Do I understand my
honourable, friend to say that at the end of
the pool period he wo-uld be in favour of an
extension for two or tbree years?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I amn in favour of a voluntary pool, and, have always taken that stand.
In 1930, when a member of the Manitoba
legisiature, I voted to guarantee a voluntary
pool, and I am stili in favour of it. I amn
against a compulsory pool. I believe that those
who have wheat to seli should be at liberty
to seli it either to the pool or to private
trade, as tbey wisb. Under this agreement
there is no freedomn of choice; in faet, if the
producer does not have bis little book witb

MARCHý 20, 1947
hima he is unable to selI any wheat.. If a policeman suspects tJbat thle fariner lias been docing
anything wrong, the farmer has his book taken
away and, hie is unable ta do a thing. It is
the compulsory nature of the bill that I
o.kject ta.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Haw is the grain
to be secured ta fulfil the obligations. under
this agreement?
Hon, Mr. HAIG: The governiment will 'have
ta go on the market and buy the grain.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Then the whole
burden of your argument is that the taxpayer,
and not the wheat grower, sbould hear the
burden?
Hon. Mr. HAIG.- Tliat is what I 'have been
saying. There is no reason why the wheat
grower should seli his grain ta Great Britain
at $1.35 when the world price is 82.25 ta $3
a bushel.
I amn sure that if I informed my honourable
friend fram Queen's that 'lie was o'bliged ta
seil bis Prince Ed-ward Isl'and .potataes ta tlie
British people f or 25 cents a 'bag, tliat hie
would have something ta say about it. Yet
that in effeet is wbat lie is asking the wheat
producers ta do.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Wheat is a coinmodity that can bie carried from year ta year,
but vegetables cannot.
Hon. Mr. HAIG.- You can carry only a
Iimited amount of wheat from year ta year.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Is tliere not ta lie a
bill dealing with farm products in general?
Han. Mr. LAMBERT: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Tliat will liave ta do
witli tlie Marketing Act and will relate only
ta certain commodities. Tliis is the really
important bill.
I cliallenge any member of this bouse ta
point ta any provision left out of this agreement that a socialist would put in. I know of
no possible condition tliat could be added ta
thie agreement wliicli would make a socialist
more pleased. If we do not believe the
farmers of western Canada have enaugh of the
spirit of free enterprise ta dispose of their
own commodities, then we sbould pass this
bill.
Tliere is nothing ta prevent the making of
any deals that we wish-we can agree ta selI
wheat ta tlie bakers of London, France or
Holland. Sucli an arrangement lias heen
carried out witli a minimum of expense, and
tlie government sliould now folaw the saine
plan. If it is said that we bave ta stick by
tliis cantract, that can he donc, but I am nat

179

uirging that we go that far. An agreement
bas been made for two years, an the understanding tliat it will be negotiated for a
furtlier twa years. But, knowing the Englishman as I -think I know him, I believe tliat
wben it cames ta those furtber two years bie
will drive a liard bargain. His condition will
compel him ta do. so. We now knaw that
lie drove a terribly hard hargain wben lie
bouglit wheat at $1.55 a hushel. XVe could
seil a liundred million bushels of wbeat in
the world market if we could get it in position, but it is flot in position; and the British
Gavernment are clamouring for wbeat. Sa we
are losing the profit on sales of 100,000,000
bushels at the high price at present existing.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: Will my honourable friend permit a question?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Certainly.
Han. Mr. JOHNSTON: Hie stated a moment
ago that the contract is for only two years.
We bave a contract for four years, as regards
bath price and quantity.
Han. Mr. HAIG: Perbaps tbe honourable
senator from Central Saskatchewan (Hon.
Mr. Jolinston) understands the contract better
than I can. I cannot read "four years" into
it. Let us see wliat it says. First, as I will
candidly admit, it covers the two-year period,
witli a price of $1.55 and a total of 160,000,000
bushels f.o.b. Fart William. But witb relation
ta the last two years one finds a very odd
clause, about whieli there lias been a gaod
deal of discussion. I quate from section 2,
paragrapli (b) :
The actual prices ta lie paid for wlieat t, lie
bouglit and sold within the crop year 1948-49That is tlie first of the twa last years.
-shal]

lie negotiated and settled between the

United Kingdom governiment and the Canadian
government not lýater than -the 31st December,
1947, and prices for wheat ta lie bouglit and
sold within the crap year 1949-50 shaîl lie negatiated and settled not later than the 3lst December, .1948. In determining the prices for
these two crop years, .1948-49 and 1949-50, the
United Kingdam. gavernment will bave regard ta
any difference between the prices paid under
this agreement in the 1946-47 and 1947-48 crop
years and the world prices for wheat in the
1946-47 and 1947-48 crop years.
That simply means, if I readi the Eng-lisli
language eorrectly, bliat when the first twa
years are aver, if we fail ta negatiate, the deal
is'off.

Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: Riglit.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If the British declare that
they will not negotiate, that is the end of the
d"s.
There is nothing here ta hind the
Britishi; the matter is absolutely wide open.

180

SENATE

My honourable friend says that they will keep
their word, their word of honour. Well, they
are going to make about $150,000,000 this year
on the deal, and that will more than pay what
will be required of themn in the lust year; s0
the flnai year's transaction will cost them
nothing. And if, as is probable, the price next
year is as bigh as it is now, the last two years
of the contract will flot cost the British people
one cent-we shall pay the whole shot-and
under this eontract they do flot have to carry
on the deal for another two years.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Surely my honourable friend's arithmetic there is rather strange.
What he means is that the people of Great
Britain wil1l pay $150,000,000 less than if they
had to pay the market price. But they stili
will have to pay whatever price wheat is sold
at in 1949-5,0.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: They do not bave to -agree
tu anytbing. Tbey can refuse to corne to an
agreement on those ternis; tbey cen offer us
$1.25, although the world price may be $2.50.
If we do flot agree to accept their offer, the
deal is off. They may offer a price which we
canflot accept.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: \Vill tbe honourable
leader opposite pernmit a question?
Hon. Mr. JOUNSTON: Honourable senators, IHon. Mr. HAIG: Surely I will permit questions. But I cannot answer two at once.
honourable
Mr. HAYDEN: The
Hon.
senator bas sugges-ted that in 1948-49 tbe worqld
price of wbeat m-ay be bigber than $1.25. There
will be no problemi under those circumstances.
There will be a mark'et for the wbeat: the
United Kingdom will take it.
Hou. Mr. HAIG: The $1.25 figure is not
final; it is a suggested figure.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: It is a minimum price.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, no.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Does my bonourable
friend say tbat the 11.25 and tbe quantities in
relation to 1948-49 are not minimum pricos and
quantities?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Assume tbey are, for the
sake of argument.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Then my question is.
how can there be any problem, if the world
price is greater thun $1.25 in 1948-49? In that
year the United Kingdom will exercise its
rigbt and take the veheat at least at the
minimum price. Is that not so?

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Ibat is what I do flot
want to see bappen. I believe that in the next
four years the price will be higher.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Is yýour contention,
thon, that the farmers of Canada sbouild be in
a position in 1948-49, and shoulil now be in a
position, to realize tlhe world price for wheat,
wbatev'er it may be?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Aiasolutely; and, that the
peuple of Canada, if wbeat is to be sold to
Great Britain at anything less than the world
price, sbould "carry the baby". That is my
argument.
Tbe bonourable
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:
senator would not suggest that, if the price
of wbeat in the world market sbould fall, the
government sbould bolster the price to the
Canadian farmers?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is a condition, we
may bave to face.
I am in favour of a free market for wbeat.
I know tbat some farmners are of the samne
opinion as the honourable senator fromn St.
Jean Baptiste (Hon. Mr. Beaubien): if tbey
can ho sure of receiving $1.25 a bushel for
w'beat riglbt tbrougb. the years. tbat is wbat
tbcy would like. But I am one of tbose whio
believe that tbe peuple of Canada would nover
consent to that. I do not believe it would
ho acceptable to our peuple in any single
province of Canada.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Supposing the
western wbeat growers are satisfied witb $1.25
for a certain period, and are willing to make
any sacrifice inv'olved, wby sbould the bonourable gentlemen or the rest of the peuple of
Canada grumble about it? Tbey will say: "We
forced Mr. Gardiner to bring in this iegislation. Return us to parliament, and we will
force bim to do more alung the samne line".
That bas been our experionce of their policy
in Manitoba for tbe past twenty-five years.
Hon Mr. HORNER: Tbey are not satisfied.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I contend that tbe
large majority are satisfied.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Thbe only test of public
opinion we bave bcd so far is in the constituency of Portage la Prairie, one of tbe best
agricultural districts of Manitoba. In tbat
election a Liberal majority of 1.900 wvas turned
into n Conservative majority of 700. The
parties favouring and opposing this agreement
were represented in tbe figbt, and tbe Minister
of Agriculture fougbt to the' bitter end in
support of this agreement, wbile the leader
of tbe Opposition entered the contest at six
different parts of that constituency, and in
every une of them, including the home of the

MARCH 20, 1947
Liberal leader. tbere was a majority against
the government candidate. That is evidance
to me, honourable senators, tbat once tbe
people understand tbe facts tbey will be
opposed to this agreement. Let me say this
to my honourable friend, tbat if tbe Minister
of Agriculture tbinks tbat by means of tbis
bill he will be able to carry the province of
Saskatchewan for the Liberal party, be is
wrong, absolutely wrong. I know what the
attitude of the C.C.F. will be.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I can tell my bonourable friend how 'the Portage la Prairie election was won. It was won by bis party going
around making promises of a great reduction
in income tax, and so on. I took part in the
campaign in the Portage la Prairie constit.uency, and the wheat contract was not in
issue.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I disagree witb thc bonourable senator. The fight was made by Mr.
Gardiner himself: He spoke in every part of
that constituency. Ha defended the agreement with Great Britain, and he was defeated
-and he would ha the first to admit that that
is why lie was defeated. The only answer to
this contention whicb I have heard is tbat
in some other districts the verdict may be
different. His desire is to make headway
among the farmers against -tbe propaganda of
the C.C.F. in the province of Saskatchewan,
but in my judgment, thougb it may not ha
wortb very mucb, be is deluded, and socialists
wvill, for -the most part, vote against him, as
they bave done before. Tbey voted against
him in the provincial contest, and tbey will
vote against bim in tbe dominion field. Every
time you make a concession to the Socialists
you help to seal your doom. The only course
is to fight their propaganda, and figbt it witb
ahI your ahility.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: That is not what
mny bonourable friends did in the province of
Saskatchewan. They supported tbe C.C.F.
Hon. Mr. HAIG- How does the bonourable
gentleman know? Nobody knows how ballots are cast. The Conservatives ran candidates in nearly every riding, and thougb tbey
got only a few votes, tbey did poîî a few.
What they got did not go to the C.C.F. The
C.C.F. cannot be byeaten hy the tactics suggested by my honourable friend. They cannot ha beaten by sucb tactics anywhere,
especially in tbe province of Saskatcbewan.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Tbis is a very interesting debate. I do not wisb to interrupt my
friand, but a vote was taken recently in tbe
other place and I believe that the representatives of the prairies vot'ed for tbe bill.

181

Hon. Mr. HAIG: How the other house
voted bas nothing to do with me or this
bousge. I know wha~t my responsihilities are.
Tbe sentiment of my own province is such
tbat I arn persuaded against this bill, and I
arn persuaded that in the next election the
Liberals there will vote against the government if this question is made an issue at that
time. If tbe members from Lisgar, Marquette,
Macdonald and Brandon were to re-sign and
seek re-election on the basîs of the agreement,
what a toasting tbey would get in that province! I do nlot say the same for Saskatchewan.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Every member ...
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The bonourable member
will bave to wait. I know that tbis is painful,
and that be does not like to take it, but I
have to band it out to bim. The Socialists
in Saskatchewan will vote for tbeir party,
no matter what bappens. We bave bad them
in our province for tbirty odd years now, and
tbey do not lose votes at ail. I cannot tell
you wliat will bappen in Saskatchewan, but
1 arn persuaded that if this bill goes tbrougb
Mr. Gardiner will bave a difficuit time to
get re-elected. I was in Saskatchewan a year
ago and I know tbe feeling of tbe people
tbere. Tbe Socialists tbink that tbey are
sitting on top of the world, and- if we sbould
carry out ail tbeir policies we would only
help their position. Honourable senators, I
have taken up more time than I bad intended.
An Hon. SENATOR: Our time is our own.
Hon. Mr. HAIG.- I tbink tbis bill ought to
be taken to committee. I do not 'know
wbether the governiment bas the power to
carry out the contract they made *with Great
Britaîn, but this fact can be ascertained by
inquiry made of our Parliamentary Counsel
and counsel for the Department of Justice.
I do not want my bonourable friend from
Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) to
criticize me for this statement, but as a
Canadian and a member of parliament I amn
willing to bave this bill sent to a committee.
If the government bas not got the power to
carry out the contract they made with Great
Brîtain, I arn willing to give them. tbat power.
If I bad had my own way that contract
would neyer bave been made, but now that
it bas been made 1 will stand bebind it. I
will not go furtber.
I bave one more word to say. It is from
a personal viewpoint, and not on bhbaif of
the Progressive Conservative party. I arn
in favour of the open marketing of wbeat.
We are under this agreement at the present
time. The wbeat board at Winnipeg is
putting the price at $2.90, and in se doing

182

SENATE

they are following the price set at Chicago.
Yet our own market in Winnipeg was the
best market in the worid. Mr. Justice Turgeon, one of the members of the great Turgeon
family, after a complete and exhaustive
examination of this problem came to the
conclusion that, by and large, the open
marketing of wheat on the exchange system
was beneficial to the producers of Canada.
I agree with hirn. 1 am n ot opposed to the
wheat pools. I quite welcome them, as would
anvbody who believ es in the system of cooperation.
I arn ail for them, but I think
the farmer should have bis individual choice.
1 understand that the honourable senator
froin Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Johnston) intends to move that the bill be referred
to committee. I suggest that this be done,
so that I may prescrnt my view that Part II
is not needed at ail.
I think the bill should be pinned to the
United Kingdorn agreernent only so far as
that agreement needs to be bolstered by
legislation. There should flot be a eontinuing
measure to cover sometbing which at the
present time we do flot intend to cox or.
Hon. A.
L. BEAUBIEN:
ilonourable
senators, it is not my intention to spcak at
any grcat lengtiî on this bijll or any of its
clauýýes, but miy hionourabie friend tue leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) bas advaned certain arguîments. that I do flot think are
entireiy corrcct. A few moments ago he made
a statement to the effect that if the memrbers
for certain constituencies were to resign and
go back to their electors, they would be
defeated on this very meaýsure.
In reply to that, honourable ýenators, I
would point out that ini the other bouse this
inea-sure was approvedi by a majority of 165
memberrs. Only seven meinbers voted against
it. If my bionourahie friend's contention is
correct, it woultl follow that those 165 mcmbers woiîld have no chance whatever of bcing
electeti in the future.
Another statemnent that my honourable
friend made was to tbe effect that in the
Portage la Prairie by-eiection the wheat
agreement with Great Britain was the cause
of the defeat of the Liberal candidate. I
took sonme part in that by-election.
Hon. Mr. HORNER:
that, if I were you.

I would not admit

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: My bonourable
friend from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)
prubably bias taken part in many clections,
but lias flot been able to be elected. su 1 do
not sec why he should grumble. As I was
saying. I took part-a very small part, if you

like-in the Portage la Prairie by-election,
and the wheat agreement, although discussed,
was flot an issue. A man by the name of
MacDoweii raised the issue, and I sbouid
say that it mîght have had some effeet in a
v'ery smali part of the riding, but that is all.
Let me tell bonourable
members what
defeated the candidate in Portage la Prairie.
The late Harry Leader, wbo was member for
the constitriency, had been a very strong Conservative ail bis life until the Progressive
Conservative movement in 1921. He had also
been a great supporter of the Right Honourable Arthur Meiglien, wbo wvas leader of the
Con.servatjve party in the House of Commons
and later in the Senate. During general electionsý-I know of wbat I speak-Conservatives
as weil as Liberals voted for Harry Leader.
However, in the by-election last fail this condition did flot exist. Liberals voted Liberal
and Conservatives went back to their own
party. In order to get some of the Liberal
votes my honourable friends opposite-I
have fno quarrel with them; they are ail
very fine people and if they can win an election. that is ail right-made fine promises ani
elaborated on the income tax question anti
how miueit tax the farmers wcre paying. Weli,
farniers aie humran beings and blîcv do not
like the income tax any mi-ore than anybody
else does tbey probabiy like it less, becaulse
the 'v have flot been brouglit up to the idea
of paying taxes. Many of them keep no
books, and they are more or less confusedl
;vhen they corne ho mnake out their income tax.
As I wvas sayiag, mny friends went among andi
made promises of reduction of income bax.
and that is what won the elechion.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Was there oniy one
party that madie proises? Did the Liberai
party make no pi-omises?
Hon. A. L. BEAIIBIEN: We neyer do.
Somle Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
lion. A. L. BEAUTBIEN-,: I can tell mv
lhonourahie friend that I Nvas a member in
another place for twtenty years, and in every
e!ecbion 1 increased my majority yet neyer
during that time did I miake a promise. I
think that is a record that my honourabie
friend cannot equal.
Honolirable senators, the question is flot
ivhethier the best way ho sell wheat is througb
the wheat board or the grain excbange or on
the open market.
The g-overoment bas
enterled into a contract to deliver so much
wýheat to England aht $1.5.5 per bushel for two
years and FI.25 for tbc third year, with a
minimum of Si for the last year.

MARCH 20, 1947
,During the First World War we received
very high prices for whcat, and also paid high
prices for other commodities. When the war
was over and the, market crashed, in what
position was the farmer? He owed more
money than before the war started. But what
is the situation today? As a grower of wheat
I amn familiar with the genera] situation, and
I would say that 95 per cent of the wheat
producers are satisfied with the prices fixed
for four years, plus the benefit of getting
what is left in the pool at the end of 1950.
By reason of the farmer receiving a fair price
for wheat-instead of $2.90, or whatever it is
today-the economy of western Canada is
better than it bas ever been before. Proof
of that statement cari be had by geing te, the
municipal counicils and finding out how much
taxes are in arrears, or by ascertaining from
the mortgage companies the state of interest,
payments. Very many western, farmers have
cleared off their mortgages and today have a
clear titie to their lands.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Does my honourable friend not thînk that the satisfactory condition to which hie refers is also due in a very
large measure te the marked inerease in production of livestock? The province of Alberta
has beceme in a few years one of the largest
producers of hogs.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I do net wish to
take away any credit from other agricultural
products. My friend knows better than any
honourable member that the wheat crop of
western Canada, rather than dairying, hog
raising and cattie producing, is reaily the paying crop and the one that enables the farmer
te pay off bis mortgage.
Hon. IVA C. FALLIS: Will the honourable
senator permit a question? I have lived on
the prairie and arn interested in the wheat
producer's problems. A few moments ago the
honourable senator made a statement which
had been previously made by the honourable
senater from Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr.
Johnston), te the effect that the werst thing
that happened to the farmers of western
Canada was that they received high prices
for their wheat during the last war.

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Dees the honourable lady mean during the First Great War?
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Will the henourable
War. During the recent war compensation
te industry. was augmented because of the
rise in living costs; increased prices were
allowed on mnanufactured, products' and even
the indemnities of members of Parliament
were beosted, ail because of increased costs.

183

My question is: WhY are. farmers the only
class for whom it is bad to seli their commodities at high prices?
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I arn glad that
my honourable friend bas asked that question.
One of rny ambitions is to interest the ladies,
and I arin pleased that I have been able to
interest the honourable lady member. If we
consider the price of farm produets belore the
most recent war it wi1l 'be readily appreciated
that there bas been an increase. Bomne honourable members of this house are supporting a
bill to permit the manufacture of oleomargarine that would be sold cheaper than butter.
I speak more particularly in respect to western
Canada, because I arn famniliar with it. I
emphasize that the economy of that part of
Canada is in a more healthy state than it bas
been in its entire history. If you go to the
savings banks you will find that deposits are
very high; the bankers are unable to lend
money and therefore will pay only one and a
haif per cent interest.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Ras ail this to do with
the contract we are now diseussing?
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: No, it bas not;
because the contract bas not been in effect a,
year yet. I arn attempting to establish the
fact that during the First World War we got
high prices for wheat-if I arn not. mistaken it.
was fixed at $2.25.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: I sold some at
82.40 a bushel.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: With that high
return for bis wheat the farmer extended bis
land holdings at high costs; hie mortgaged his
home place to acquire more land. But when
the war was over hie owed more than when
it started, and hundreds of farmers Iost not
only their newly acquired land 'but their home
place as well.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: A good illustration of
the evil effects of gambling.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: I suggest that the
high prices brought about a spree of spending.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: My honourable
friend from St. Boniface (Hon. Mr. Howden)
is absolutely correct.
I arn not arguing the point as to whether
we shouki have only one agency for the
marketing of whea't. My point is that we
have made a contract with the United Kingdom to provide so much wheat. The Farmer
will ha paid a minimum of $1.35 a bushel and
is guaranteed whatever is left in the pool at
the expiration of the contract. I believe that
my knowledge of wheat growers in western
Canada is as ýextensive as that of the honour-

able leader opposite, and my feeling is that
the western farmers are in favour of taking
$1.35 per bushel for their wheat today and
accepting whatever is left in the pool whcen
if is alI over.

The motion was agreed to.
CANADIAN COMMERCIAL
CORPORATION BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Mr. COPP moved the second reading
of Bill C2, an Act to amend the Canadian
Commercial Corporation Act.
lie said: ilonourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to enable the Canadian Comnmercial Corporation to continue to carry on
the purchase of requirements for the Department of National Defence. The advantages
of maintaining a single purcbasing agency
under separate ministerial control for defence
purchases were amply demonstrated during the
war, wlhen suchi purchasing was carried on
undcr the direction of the Minister of Reconstruction and Supply. On February 5 this year
Order in Council P.C. 314 transferrcd the
functions of defence purchasing to the Canadian Commercial Corporation on behiaîf of
tlie Miister of Trade and Commerce. This
hill would give statutory authority to this
transfer.
Hlon. Mr. LEGER: Whiat is the date of that
order in council?
Hon. Mr. COPP: Februarv 5 this year.
Hlon. Mr. LEGER: Thiat is why the bill is
retroactive?
Hoo. Mr. COPP: Yes. The Canadian Comnmercial Corporation, whichi succceded the
Canadian Export Board, was ýestablisbied by
statute to carry out purchasing functions in
conncction withi forcign tradc. The personnel
of the corporation were to a large extent
rccruited fromn the Department of Munitions
and Supply and its succeŽsor, the Department
of Reconstruction and Supply.
When thcs-e purchasing functions were transferred te the Minister of Trade and Commerce,
if was with thie object of utilizing the services
of the Canadian Commercial Corporation, an
established, agency well suited to carry on
the work. In order f0 maintain continuity, the
key personnel of the Department of Reconstruction and Supply wcre transferrcd to the
corporation on February 1, 1947. Therefore
the Department of National Defence hm~ at its
disposaI, under the Minister of Trade and

Commerce, a purchasing organiza.tion staffed
ia'rgely by personnel entirely familiar with its
requirements, and. whose high standards of
prirchasing efficiency were developed and
proven during the recent years of intense
aýctivity.
The purpose of this bill is to
empower this corporation to do the purchasing
for the Departmen.t of National Defence.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I have one or two
observ ations to make in connection with this
bill. It will be recalled that last year, when
the Commercial Credit Corporation Act came
before us, there was considerable discussion,
and in committee certain ameodinents were
added. I think it is important that I should
cali attention to the purposes for which the
Canadian Commercial Corporation was set up.
These purposes are stated in the act passed last
year. Section 4 provides:
4. (1) The Corporation is established for the
following purposes-.
(a) to assist in the development of trade
between Canada and other nations, and
(b) to assist persons in Canada
(i) to obtain .goods and commodities fromt
outside Canada; and
(il) to dispose of goods and commodities that
are available for export from Canada.
So that the function, the purpose and the scope
of the corporation as stated in the act of last
year Ivas to fa-cilitate international tradethat is, the purchase or manufacture of goods
in Caniada for expert; or to facilitate the
obtaining of goods outside of Canada for the
use of industry in Canada. That is the whole
scheme and, purpose of the act. Now we find
a preposed ameodment which would appear
te add an entirely different principle; and I
suggest that when the bill goes teo committee,
if it is sent there, some consideration should
he given to its contents, in view of the addition
of semnething which is so foreign te the purposes
specifically set eut ie the existing act. What
is now intended is the estaîblishing of a corporation as a purchasing agent for the Department of National Dcfence,--and, it will be
noticedat the instance of "the Minister,"
that is, the Minister of Trade and Commerce.
So that, while I arn net suggesting. that we
should, net pass this amending bill, I wouïd
point eut that if we do ise without full consideration of the pu-rposes of the original act,
we shaîl add an appendage which bas no relation te the purposes o~f the orig inal statute, and
conv ert that corporation into something which
i3 internai or domestic, and whose life is
limited., because hy a specifie section in the
original act the life of this bill is restricted
te 1949.
I repeat, that the purpose of this legislation
is te do a deomestie job of purchasing and of
manufacturing or etherwise producing muni-

MARCH 20, 1947
tions of war and supplies, or carry out other
projects for the Department of National
Defence. That, it seems to me, is a strange
and most unusual combination.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Wholly foreign to the
purposes of the act of last year.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Absolutely foreign to
the avowed and stated purposes of the
original act which set up the corporation. The
situation may have arisen through thoughtlessness. Possibly it was intended to use the
machinery of the corporation for a limited
time. though it seems to me folly to employ
an agency of this kind only until the year
1949, which, unless extended by Act of
Parliament, is the limit of its life. The reason
for setting the limitation was that it was felt
that the government should not be put permanently in the business of purchasing and
manufacturing agent as between manufacturer
and exporter.
I am calling attention to these points
because something is involved which seems to
me of more importance than a casual reading
of the bill would indicate, and which, when
the bill goes to committee, will require very
earnest consideration.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, I am
glad to have the bill referred to a committee
for consideration. Departmental officials can
come before us and explain it more fully than
I am able to do at the present time. I would
move that the bill be referred to the Standing Comittee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

-Hon. Mr. NORMAN McL. PATERSON
moved the second reading of Bill Zl, an Act
to incorporate Canadian Nurses' Association.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
similar to a great many that have come
before the Senate. I will make a brief
explanation before it is, as I hope, referred
to a committee. It is an application to
incorporate, as the Canadian Nurses' Association, Rae Chittick, of Calgary, in the province of Alberta, Fanny Munroe and Eileen
Flanagan, both of Montreal, in the province
of Quebec, Ethel Cryderman, of Toronto, in
the province of Ontario, Evelyn Mallory and
Reverend Sister Columkille, both of Van-

185

couver, in the province of British Columbia,
Lillian Pettigrew, of Winnipeg, in the province
of Manitoba, Reverend Sister Delia Clermont,
of St. Boniface, in the province of Manitoba,
Agnes Macleod, of Ottawa, in the province of
Ontario, and Reverend Sister St. Gertrude,
of Quebec, and so on.
The Canadian Nurses' Association is an
unincorporated association whose members are
registered nurses from across Canada. They
have existed as an unincorporated association
for about thirty-five years and at their biennial convention in Toronto last July they
adopted a new constitution and by-laws and
decided to'apply to the Parliament of Canada
for an act of incorporation after the new constitution and by-laws had been approved by
the provincial chartered Registered Nurses'
Associations. The necessary approval has
been given by the provincial associations.
The objects and purposes of the Association
are set out in the bill. They are analogous
to those of other national and professional
bodies such as the Canadian Medical Association, the Dominion Association of Chartered
Accountants, the Canadian Bar Association.
There is nothing in the proposed charter
which in any way interferes with or encroaches upon the provincial associations
which have been incorporated in the different
provinces, or with provincial legislation. It
is the earnest desire of these women to
promote the best interesta of the nurses
throughout Canada and to maintain and
improve the ethical and professional standards
of nursing education and service. The association also provides a vehicle for maintaining
national unity among the members. The past
record of the unincorporated association shows
that they have faithfully discharged their
duties.
The present membership of the unincorporated association, including members of the
religious nursing sisterhoods, exceeds 24,000.
There are 169 Schools of Nursing in Canada,
with a present enrolment of 12,151 students,
and eleven University Schools of Nursing
having a total number of 682 undergraduate
students.
The members of the Canadian Nurses'
Association had a splendid record of service
in the last war. Some 3,040 Registered
Nurses were on active service with the Royal
Canadian Army Medical Corps, 280 with
the Royal Canadian Navy, 450 with the
Royal Canadian Air Force, and 300 volunteered for service with the South Africa
Military Nursing Seryice, making a total of
5,070 on active service. Five hundred decorations were awarded to them.

SENATE
It is the earnest desire of the association
f0 serve the best interests of the nursing profession and to meet the needs of sick people
throughout Canada.
Hon. ANTOINE J. LEGER: Honourable
senators, the mover of this bill may be able
to answer a few questions that I wish to ask;
but if hie is flot ready to answer them at this
time and the bill is sent to a standing coinmittee, perhaps hie ivili have the answers at
that time.
I notice by section 6 thaf ail the associations
of the aine provinces mentioned are to forma
part of this association. By subsection 2 of
section Il it is proposed that ail the sections
of the association shall cease to exist upon
the enactmnent of this act. Section 15 says
that the sole and exclusive right f0 have and
use any embiem and se, for-th, shall be vested
in the association. And under section 16 the
corporation creafed by thîs act is vested with
al] the rights and assumes ail the obligations,
and se forth. When I turn back f0 section 1
I sece it refers to only the provinces of Alberta,
Quebec, Onfario, British Columbia and Manifoba; thiere is no mention of Saskatchewan and
the three Maritime Provines. What I want
to know is, have the or-a nizat ions of nurses
in the provinces flot mefltione(l un section 1
bren con-'ulted? Thaf is mnv first question.
My second question: if so, hav e tlîev agreed f0
this bill or this incorporation? If tlîcy have I
have nofhing more to say; if they have not, in
viewv of the provisions of this hill. I think we
should have their consent.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: 1 am unable to give
tise honourable senator from L'Acadie an
answer at this time, but 1 hope f0 have one
for him at the hcaring before the committee.
The motion was agreed te, and the bill was

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I think the rule is
that the Law Clerk makes such corrections
when necessary.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We agree.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Carried.
Hon W. E. FOSTER: Honourable senators,
I do not wish to delay adoption of the report,

but there arc a few remarks that I should like
to make.
When the committee previously reported
this bill the honourable member from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock), in bis usual
vigaraus and expressive way, ob.jected to tbe
definition of the word "expert", and as a
resuit the bill was referred back for further
consideration. I arn glad that the committee
has sean fit te clarify the definition of the
word "export" so as to bring it inta lina with
what Canadian

citizens

bave always under-

stood it to mean.
It is important that we should nlot put any
barriers in the way of interprovincial trade.
I hope that ail the provinces will recogniza
this principle so that the unity of the
provinces and good will between thema will at

ail times prevail. In the press a few days ago
it was stated that the government of the

187

province of Quabec was considering a measura
ta prevent the movement out of that province
of pulpwood eut on Crown lands. We in

New Brunswick are particularly interested in
the use of some wood which is eut in Quebec

and moved from that province into ours. I
arn informed that in the year 1945 the pulp
and paper milis of New Brunswick used
appraximateiy 500,000 corda of wood which
came into the province, most of it from. the
province of Quebec, and a small quantity from
the province of Nova Scotia and elsewhera.
On the other hand, New Brunswick exported

about the same quantity, and quite a considerable portion faund its way into the province of
Quebec. The remainder was exported to the

United States. Our mills lie near the Quebec
border, and aur exports of wood practically

balance the amount which we imnport. It ia
not always practicable for wood te be eut on
lots adjacent to the mills, and the deficiency is
made up by supplies framn the province of
Quebe.
We should pramote as far as possible the
interchange of commerce between the various
provinces; and I hope that. before the measure
to which I have referred is passed, the
Government of Quebec will further consider
the matter so that aur milîs wbich lie along
the border .will stili be able ta procure these
supplies of pulpwaad. I fear that if measures
like that are adopted, the gaud wvill which
should exist between the varjaus provinces of
Canada, and the reciprocal arrangements for
interprovincial mavements of purely Canadian
praducts may he retarded. I therefore hope,
in the intereats of us ahl, that the province of

Quebec will give this subject further consideration befare the measure is passed.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Ia it your
pleasure ta cancur in thc amendments ta this
bill?
Hon. -Mr. -SINCLAIR movad the adjournment af the debate.
The motion was agreed 'ta.
BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
On the Orders af the Day:
Hon. Mr. COPP: Hanourable members, a

well ta cstablish the time now, so that ail
members will have this information before the

when the Senate adj ourns today it stand

8 o'ciock in the evening.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members, 1
arn going to use the acting leader's rcmarks as
a justification for referring to sometbing cîse.
I notice that the other house bas decided to
adjourn for tbe Easter recess frorn the 2nd te
the l4th of April. As the ernerguncy powers
which are flot extendod will run eut on the
29th of March, 1 wonder if it would be possible
for tbe acting leader te givo us on Tuesday
next somfe indication of what recess wve sball
take fer Easter. This information would be
of particular benefit te members from tbe
four wcstern provinces and the maritime
provinces because, as we aIl know, there is a
good deal of difficulty in arranging fer transportation tbese days. Naturally those of us
wbo are engaged in business want te ferward
word tbat we shah ho bhome on sucb and such
a date. I arn net afraid of the legislation
before this lieuse, and I arn persuaded tbat it
can ho dealt witb by Friday, March 2S. There
is still te corne te us, bowever, a bill covering
the supplerncntary supplv tbat wvill ho needcd
for April and May. I bave no doubt that
botb bouses will, as usual, pass tbat withet
any objection, and I arn wendcring if tbe
acting leader can inake iequiry and notify us
on Tuesday wbcn tbe bill will be received.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I inav sav to rny beoneurable friend tbat 1 bave already bcid a conferonce with tbe Minister of Finance in relation
te ieterim supply, and lie assured me tbat hoe
would do his best te get the bill over te us
before the sitting davs of next week are
concluded. I sball be glad te give the house
any further information as soon as it cernes
te me.
The motion was agreed te.
CONTRACTS SUPPLEMENTAL
PAYMENTS BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. A. B. COPP moved the second reading
of Bill 17, an Act rospeciing supplernental
payments on rural and land mail contracts.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is known te aIl who bave followed
the debate on it in the other bouse. It is
te continue for a period of approximately
one year tbe autbority granted te the Postmaster General during and sinco the war te
make certain supplementary payrnents te
rural and land mail ceuriers. By an order
in council passed in Octeber, 1941, tbe
goveroment authorizeel the payment of a
general increase of 5 per cent te aIl mail
contractors te cornuensate thern for tbeir
bigbcr operating costs. Before long a good
many complaints were rcceived fromn different
parts of the country that tbe increase was
MAIL

insufficient, and in Marcb, 1913, anether
order in council was passed, authorizing tbe
payrnent of furtber bonuses te centracters
wbo applied for them and satisfied the Postmaster General tbat the increased arnounts
asked for wcre fair and resonable.
Between Marcb 1, 1943, and the end of
hast year, bonuses were given on 4,034 contracts, increasing tbe total cest of these
contracts by about 36 per cent. During tde
same period 4,164 contracts were awarded by
tender, at an increased cest of 36-6 per cent.
Tbe rernaining contracts were continued at
the original scale set eut in each contract.
This bill wil gîve the Postmaster General
statutery autbority te replace tbe autbority
that hoe bas lîad in the past few years under
order in council for paying these bonuses.
Honourable senaturs,
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
I arn net objecting te the bill, but after listening te some of tbe debate in another place and
reading the explanatory notes in tbe bill 1
The explanatory
arn sornewbat disturbeel.
notes say:
It is, ýtherefore, necessary te continue the payment of the supplernental arnounts te mail coutracters for the duratien of thieir cootracts.
That is ahl righit. But the notes go on te
say:
Thore are aise contractors who a1though c.arr -ing on tieder centract rates that are not equitable, are flot in receipt of a bonus, but would
have been granted a bonus if they Jiad presented
,their claims.
1 do net like tbat at ail. It seems te me
tbat if any bonus is autborizcd it should ho

te get a bonus bas te, apply for it.

COPP:

That

is one of

the

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Tbe Postmastor General
migbt refuse the contracter's application.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: "Ask and ye sball
receive."
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That would seern te ho
the pelicy, and I do net hiko it. 1 tbink we
sbould sendi the bill te a cornrittce. The
Deputy Postmaster Ceocrai. w-be is a very able
man. could appear befere the cernmittce and
fell us just w-bat tbe situation is.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I bave ne particular objctien te the bill being sent te cernrittee, but
1 wender wbether any good wo'uld 'ho accernplishîec 'by tbat. The bill was tborougbly
dehatpd in theotnhîer hoîse. and<the peint made
bv the behnourahle leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) w-as raiýed there. In answer te that the

MARCH 21, 194718
Postmaster Generai said that he could not very
wehl investigate the conditions uncler which
every mail contractor operates, but that as
soon as an application foT a bonus was received.
it wouhld be inquired into and, if found to be
justified, wold~ be granted. My ho-nourable
friend mnust reali7e that to grant a uniform.
increase wouici 'be hardly fair, because conditions in some rural sections are such as to
make the mail carriers' costs there much higher
than in other sections. For example, in some
parts of the country the carriers may have to
contend with snow drifts on side roads thàt
are not ploughed in, winter. Then, the number
of rural mail boxes varies in different districts.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I will flot press my suggestion for Teference to a committee.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I cannot see that any good
wouhd be done 'by going to committee. After
all, the bill would continue the authorization
for only about a year, so the matter could be
brought up again next session, if necessary.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators, if
I were not so timid 1 would caîl this proposed
legislation bad; 'but, as I amn tiýmidý, I will say
that it is no good. I agree with my honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Haig) that the authorization
under the bill is too indefinite. I have every
sympathy with people who have entered into
contracts and now find themsefves in difficuhty. My suggestion is that we shouhd pass
a bill permitting them to surrender their contracts, and that new tenders should be called
for. It seems to me that would be mnuch better
than to pass this bill authorizing the Postmaster Generel to pay bonuses in certain
circumstances, ivhich are not defined. A man
might tender low and get a contraet, and then
apply to the minister for an increase.
Hon. Mr. COPP: For one year.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: The bill continues the
Postmaster Generah's anthority for one year,
but there is nothing to indicate that an application wilh not be mnade next year to renew it.
The principhe is wrong, and we should, not give
effeet to it for a year or a mon-th or a day.
I would, be in favour of pa8sing an act ahlowing the contractor to surrender his contTact
after certain notification. But once a contract
bias been awarded this, parhiament shou.ld flot
authorize any increase in the payznent agreed
upon.
The Hon.. the SP~EAKER: Honourable

Senate, I would move that the bills be now
read a third time.
The motion was agreed to, and the bills
were read the third time, and passed, on
division.
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Copp for the second reading of Bill 23, an
act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act,
1935.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, in considering this bill I call
to mind a memorable visit to the city of
Ottawa almost exactly twenty-five years ago
this month in company with a delegation of
official representatives of the grain growers
from western Canada, for the purpose of
asking Mr. Mackenzie King's first administration to continue the life of the wheat board
set up at the close of the First World War.
There was stubborn resistance to the proposal
in official circles at that time. Later, enabling
legislation was passed here on condition that
similar legislation should pass in the western
provinces. But the bill introduced in the legislature of Manitoba was decisively turned down
because it was held that the farmers of that
province desired to look after their own affairs
in their own way. When I remember these
facts, and recall that out of all that negotiation there arose a movement which finally
resulted in the establishment of the present
wheat pool organization, I realize that water

not only flows swiftly over the dam, but
often, as in the remarkable Reversible Falls
near the native heath of my honourable
friend from Saint John (Hon. Mr. Foster),
seems to flow uphill as well.
So many aspects of this bill present themselves that one hesitates to embark on any
sort of exhaustive or comprehensive discussion of it at this time. The honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) made some references yesterday to the historical background
of the bill. There are also the social, political
and economic aspects of it. It might suffice
for me to say that behind the legal phraseology of this bill is a most fascinating story
that extends back to the early years of this
century, when the pioneer settlers of the
prairie provinces-then called the territorial
areas-laid foundations for what later became
known as the grain growers movement of
Western Canada. The honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), who unfortunately is prevented from being in his seat
at this time, could tell that story much better
than I can, because he happens to be one
of the few remaining figures who took part in
that pioneer work.
Since the inception of the movement there
have been a good many changes, both in the
character of the movement itself and the
nature of the commercial and co-operative
marketing institutions which arose from it.
Those changes have coincided, I believe,
fairly closely with fundamental changes that
have occurred as the result of periodical upsets
in world conditions. That statement could, be
pretty conclusively proved if one were to take
the trouble.
As I look back over a number of years in
a spirit of sympathetic regard for the developments of the organized farmers' movement on
the prairies, and view them, I trust, dispassionately and in fair perspective, a number of
features appeal to me. In the first place, the
inception and also the changes which have
taken place in the movement have given
evidence of a very genuine force of idealism
behind the actions taken. I have been
impressed also by the steady loyalty to their
leaders of the rank and file of these organizations. Another comment I am bound to make
is that the tendency to confuse forms and
machinery with fundamental causes in relation to the problems that had to be contended with has increased rather than diminished. For example, with regard to the
machinery of the marketing of grain there
has been a mistaken tendency, I believe, to
associate the turn of fortune or misfortune
with the current system of marketing with
which the organizations have had to deal.

MAROR 21, 1947
Let me illustrate that in this way. The old
Canadian Wheat Board was able to pay the
producer of grain at the conclusion of the last
war something like $2.63 per bushel for his
wheat. That figure, which was reached in the
first crop year aiter the wartime prices1919-20 -- seeme ta have left an indelible
impression upon the minds of the rank and
file, as well as of the officiais of the arganized
grain growers, that high prices were associated
with goverament handling of wheat. Conversely, when the price collapse of 1929 and
1930 oceurred, it was assocîated with the
operations af the marketing machinery at
Winnipeg, and nothing would serve but that
tihe government should step into the picture
and take charge of the whole situation.
I have always felt that on that occasion
those who were in charge of the western wheat
producers' associations, commonly known as
the wheat pools, should have insisted upon the
banks carrying them through that crisis,
rather than have permit.ted the banks ta shift
the responsihility to the government of this
country. There were good grounds for taking
thlat position, because the operations of the
pools were based largely upon the wiflingness
of the banks ta finance the advance of $1 .per
bus'hel on every buishel of wheat marketed
through the pools, without the traditional protection, which had always heen required by
the~ banks in the handling of the grain, af
using the legitimate machinery of hedging
tl)rough the selling of options against purcheses for future delivery. In their anxiety
ta handie the business of the organized
farmers' movement, the banks dispensed with
that proceeding long before 1929-30; and, conironted with the inexorable and inevitable
forces which came ta bear on the situation as
the result of world-wide conditions in 1929-30,
the pools were forced, or at ail events were
persuaded hy the banks, to seek relief through
government help.
When the wheat board ai 1935 was set up
under the present act. it was not, as the
honourable senator fromn Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Johnston) intimated yesterday, as a result ai demands from western
grain farmers; because despite the guaranteed
support by the government, and the handling
by the government's representative, the late
Mr. John I. McFarland-a very able manwlheat prices did flot advance, but rather
declined, during the years from 1930 ta 1935.
The Prime Minister of that day and the banics
ai the country became deeply concerned over
the financial liability which was being incurred
by reason of the steady accumulation ai grain
in Mr. McFarland's bands. He attempted ta
stabilize prices by buying more wheat, more

191

wheat and yet more wheat until, when the
wheat board af 1935 was officially brought
inta existence, it had ta assume responsibility
for something like 400,000,000 bushels ai
unsold wheat owned by the people ai this
country. Most ai this accumulation was
Iiquidated with fair success during the next
two years, largely as a consequence ai the
short crops produced in that period.
Çonsidering this background, we find over
against it today the rather striking paradox
ai whent pool organizations, whose foundatians and whole history are based an the principle of independent and individual initiative,
identified with the demand for complete state
control and direction ai the marketing ai
grain. One may well ask: Where this confusion ai ideas is leadîng ta? Is this trend an
action on the part ai the organized co-aperatives ai the West a permanent trend? 1s the
trend based on a constructive or ecative idea
in this country's affairs and its relations ta the
rest ai the world? Frankly, honourable senators, I do not think it is. My feeling is that
the direction ai things amongst the grain
growers ai the West today is based upon fear.
My honourable colleague (Hon. Mr. Johnston)
vesterday gave some indication ai what that
fear is, when he said that the western farmer
was influenced. hy the thought ai the depressed
thirties. WeIl, what we stili1 regard as the
farces ai enlightenment are arrayed at this
very moment in a demand ta set the world
stage for a return ta decent international relations based, for ane thing, uýpon a positive
desire for a larger measure ai ireedom. ai trade.
I suhmnit that it is a positive attitude towards
the future that we should be cultivating rather
than a negative attitude ai fear tawards the
past.
Up ta this moment I have dealt with the
fundamental factors ai this proposed legislation. I think 'that they represent the really
important considerations. The pros and cons
of the United Kingdamn wheat agreement,
which in the preamble ai this bill is made ta
seem the real hasis ai the mreasure, are actually
secondary in importance ta the basic issue
ai statism that is involved in this legislation.
The Wheat Baard Act ai 1935 set up a
permanent wheat board. That board was set
up as a corporation ta serve the int.erests ai
producers and was subjeet ta arraignment by
praducers in the courts ai the land. if dissatisfaction developed. Those who have been
intereted in -this subject will recaîl very
definitely that a man by -the name ai Oatway,
living in Manitoba in 1942, appealed ta the
courts by issuing suit against the Wheat
Board for an accaunting of wheat deliveries
ta it during the years 1939 ta 1942. The case

SENATE
was heard in the Province of Manitoba, where
the courts held that Oatway had no right to
sue the whcat board. on the ground that it
was an agent of the crown. The case was
eventually referred to the Supreme Court of
Canada, but before judgment could be brought
down an order in council was passed d'eclaring
that the wheat board definitely was an agent
of the crown. Therefore, the final judgment
on this matter bas not yet been brought down.
It is interesting to note that this court action
was co-incidental with a case that had been
tried before the Privy Council involving
exactly the same issue. That was a case
between the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Gooderham and Worts, and the
Privy Council declared that Gooderham and
Worts were quite competent to sue the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation at that time.
Whether or not that decision was in any
way responsible for the passing of the order
in couneil declaring the whecat board an agency
of the Crown, I do not know; but, at any
rate, it had the effcet of giving absolute
power to the wheat board in the narketing of
grain at that time. In reality, Bill 23 confirmss that order in council. It is my desire
to enphasize that feature of the legislation,
because wlien section 2 of the first part of
the bill is linked with part II of the bill, I
think it will be realized that the real issue at
stake in this legislation is not so much the
confirmation of the Unitd Kingdom wheat
agreement as the permanent establishment for
all time under a complete totalitarian technique of grain marketing nachinery for this
country.
Due to the fact that at least doubt exists
about the character of part II of this bill, I
think there is every reason for referring the
bill to the appropriate committee for analysis
and amendment. My support of this bill on
third reading depends entirely upon the outcome of amendments that might be suggested
in committee.
There are two further points that I shoud
like to mention before I conclude. The first
is the question of the future of the wheat
agreerhent. As bas been stated, an international wheat conference is at present being he'd
in London, England. That conference is to
del with the whole question of an international
wheat agreement. The Montreal Gazette of
March 19 announced on its front page the
opening of that conference
with these
headlines:

Wheat Parley Opens Anidst Soaring Prices.
Delegates from 40 countries expect "tough sledding" at London Conference.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT.

The press dispatch goes on to state how
current world prices compare with the fixed
prices that have been made the basis of the
United Kingdom wheat agreement between
Canad'a and Great Britain.
It is only fair to say that good grounds exist
for the assumption tiat representatives of the
organized wheat marketing interests in Western
Canada undertook te support such an ogreement-or, to put it another way, made the
demand for such an agreement and were willing to support it-on the condition that the
price of $1.55 as a maximum and $1.25 as a
minimum would be the basis of an international wheat agreement.
In his speech on the adýdress in reply to the
Speech from the Throne my honourable
friend from Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr.
Johnston) said that at the meeting of the
International Wheat Committee, in Washington, it was indicated that the Canadian prices
whichb had been set in connection with that
agreement might at least be a basis for agreement at the conference that is now taking
place in London. I think it is also a fair
assumption that those prices will not 'be
acceptable to countries which are net parties
to the agreement today. and which are receiving for their wheat from $1 to $1.50 per
bushel more than ouir producuers.
My other point is that neither the Argeintine
Republic nor Russia is represcnted at that
conference. If this conference should dissolve
without accomplishing anything, the Canadian
representatives. most of whom are officiallv
connected with the wheat pool organization of
western Canada, will return with some ground,
I think. for demanding a higher price for
wheat when the time arrives for renegotiation
at the end of the crop year 1917, unless
between now and then an overwhelmsing production of wheat in the world materializes to
bring the price somewhere near the level cf
the present United Kingdom Agreement prices.
Prevailing conditions at the end of 1947 will
have a great effect on the outcome, but with
present world conditions, and production of
this valuable cereal being limited largely to
this continent and South America, prices
should not be substantially lower than they
are today.
One of my criticisms of the
wheat agreement is that it speculates over too
long a period. Having made that criticism
of the agreement, I must net indulge in
speculation as to the probable course of wheat
prices.
At any rate, when the Canadian
representatives
at the conference cannot
establish S1.55 and $1.25 as the basis for the
wheat agreement, we may be released to a
considerable extent from any obligation to
support the United Kingdom agreement.

MARCH 21, 1947
A further point is that another international
conference now taking place at Geneva, is
trying to arrange world trade on the level of
a multilateral rather than a bilateral basis.
Ail honourable senators were impressed by
the pertinent remarks made yesterday by the
bonourable senator from Queen's (Hon. Mr.
Sinclair) upon another subi ect. The honourable gentleman said that we should not pass
any legislation that might prejudice the
deliberations of the delegates at the Geneva
conference. 1 submit that this bill proposing,
on the basis of an agreement with the United
Kingdom, te, establish an arrangement for five
years, is certainly calculated to prejudice the
diplomatic interests at stake at the Geneva
conference. If the principle applies in one case,
it should~ apply in another. I make that comparison with the knowledge that I arn trespassing somnewhat on the rules of the house.
In conclusion, I emphasize the hope that
the honourable acting leader of the bouse
(Hon. Mr. Copp), wbo is sponsoring
the
will have it referred to an appropriate bill,'
committee whose membership comprises senators
most representative of, and most competent to
deal with, the subi ect before us.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators,
I have been a wbeat grower for almost forty
years, in perbaps one of the difficuit parts
of western Canada. Almost haîf of the land
had to be cleared of bush, and sorne required
the removal of stone. My object in speaking
today is to reply to the rather strange argument put forth by the honourable member
who explained tbe bill <Hon. Mr. Jobnston),
Vo the eff ect that the farrners were ail so
wealthy that any more money would be very
bad for them. The bonourable gentleman
appeared to, suggest that a fund sbould be
set up for the farmers, as is done for Indians,
and doled out at times when tbey were in
need of assistance. He might have used as an
argument that passage in the Good Book Vo
the effect that it is bard for a ricb man Vo
enter into the kingdom of beaven. However,
1 neyer heard until yesterday that it was particularly bard for a farmer Vo enter there.
While money may not be very good for
some people, I maintain there are farmers
wbo can bandlè it as well as any other classes.
We hear no denunciation of the International
Nickel Company, the Aluminum Company of
Canada, or large firms in the meat packing or
paper industry. In spite of over-expansion on
tbe part of these industrial concerns we hear
not a word of criticism about them; and we
are told that their beads are great men,
capable of earning unlimited salaries.
83168-13

I maintain that because the farmer bas a
littie money for expansion be should not be
classified as a dangerous man. He is progressive, and if he can manage a large farrn he
sbould be allowed to do so. 0f course, there
are those wbose nature is better suited to
small farming operations. At any rate, the
argument that tbe farmer might bave too mucb
money is a very strange one.
May I throw a little light on the history
of the development of the country from
wbich I corne? There was no land under
cultivation when I went there; but today
railway lines such as Big River, Leoville
Line, and Meadow Lake bave opened up tbe
country. The Laird line and the Wakaw Railway have gone tbrough in my time. In eastern
Canada the young man wbo goes into farming operations usually moves into a stone
bouse and bas a stone barn, with lots of
improvernents, built by bis grandfatber. Tbose
who chose to go West wben I did were young
lads witbout any money. The development
of their farms started with the stringing of
the first bit of wire. IV is Vwenty-nine years
since the end of the first World War, and
surely farmers are entitled to make somne
progress in that time. I would like the
bonourable senator from Central Saskatchewan (-Hon. Mr. Johnston) to tell me bow
many of the farrners in the whole of bis
district live in really modern homes, how
many have painted their buildings in the
last few years, how many have the modern
plumbing to whicb people are entitled.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: Is my bonourable
friend asking a question?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: There are not so
rnany living in what in these days we term
modern homes. The point I was making in
rny speech, if my honourable friend will
recaîl, was that farmers are paying off their
rnortgages.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I admit tbat; and
why should they noV, durîng twenty-seven
years of bard work?
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON: Tbey have been
doing most of it in the last five years.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I do noV agree. I
ean tell the bonourable senator of people,
Eome of wbom bouglit land frorn me, who
bave continued year after year to wear down
their obligations.
A word as Vo grain prices. The honourable
ssenator from Central Saskatchewan stated
that ini 1932 and 1933 wheat was sold for
nineteen cents a buehel. Hearing -that statement, a good rnany people wbo do not under-

3DITZON

a

SENATE

stand the market in Western Canada would
form a wrong opinion. I believe it is truc ýthat
the price of wheat fell one day te nineteen
cents; but the fact is that progressive farmers,
men with suine knowledge of world conditions,
sold their wheat that very year for seventy
cents, or at least sixty cents. I recail that
in 1907 the elevators were refusing to take
grain because they had flot the money to buy
it; and I arn ashamed to say that I bought
200 bushels at ton cents a bushel, while the
producer paid eleven cents a bushel to have
0f course there was then a
ià threshed.
temporary financial crisis.
If, imitating the honourable senator fromn
Central Saskatchewan, I were to make a political reference, I might point out there was a
time when the party which he supporta held
that the whole of the West was no good, that
it would neyer pay for the axie grease which
wen.t on the wheels of the companies who
built the railroads out there. Admittedly we
farmn in a country where there are plenty of
hazards. But men whose knowledge can be
relied upon, who have made a thorough study
of the subjeet, say that there bas neyer been
a world surplus of wheat. Always the surplus
bas been absorbed in a few years. Other countries, like our own, do not always have a crop.
The honourable< senator from. Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) mentioned. that the late Mr.
McFarland but up a large surplus. What
became of it? In the summer of 1937 unfavourable reports were going around, and as
I travelled across the country I saw that
there would be no crop. At three o'clock in
the morning, in the neighbourhood of Calgary,
I was looking at fields of wheat six inches
high, and .burnt. I do not believe anybody
arrived at a close.r estimate than I did in
travelling west from. Winnipeg; and on the
strength of my conclusions I wrote to the
press, begging the government net to give
away our wheat, because ahl of it could be
suld at $1.50 a bushel. They were boasting of
having sold 100,000,000 bushels at seventy
cents. Shortly afterwards the price of wheat
rose to $1.55. The entire surplus built up by
McFarland could have been sold at a profitable price, every bushel of it.
I, like some other senators, have had a
good deal of experience in wheat growing and
marketing, and on this account honourable
senators may bear with me if I add a few
personal references. Before the pool came
into being we had in Saskatchewan a cooperative elevator company. A delegate from
each elevator district attended the annual
meeting to hear the reports and, as they told
us, to run the elevators. In the particular year
I have in mind I was chosen as a delegate

to attend the meeting, which, as 1 recail, was
held in the basement of the First Baptist
Church at Regina. The year before the
organization had given one of their officiais
a limited credt-I do nlot know how many
thousand dollars-to deal for the co-operative
elevator company on the Grain Exchange,
and he had made a few thousand dollars for
the company. At the meeting which I attended
it appeared that they had advanced him considerably more credit, but he had lost at least
$95000. Yet in the directors' report the delegates were assured that "your directors have
conducted the business of your company on a
sound business basis, in true conformity with
co-operative principles."
But 1 did not believe that the manner 'n
which the company was bcing conducted conformed at ail to co-operative principles. The
man who took ail bis grain to the company,
and the man who obtained haif a cent a
bushel more, or a grade better, from another
elevator, received a share of the profit on the
handling of my grain. So when the report was
presented 1 rose and moved that this line be
deleted. I said I ýthought that the company
had been conducted on a sound business basis,
but not in conformity with truc co-operative
principles. One of the delegates who knew
something about co-operatives and how they
should be run, supported the suggestion that
this phrase be deleted. That snme day 1
moved that that co-operative elevator company be sold to the pool, and after a very
strong fight the motion was carried. So our
co-operative elevator systemn was sold to the
pool, and 1 have neyer to ýthis day regrettcd
the transaction. It was of great benefit to the
farmers of Western Canada.
I arn not opposed to the bill, but my objection is that we are not getting an adequate
price for our grain. Consider the cost of
production. Second-hand tractors are selling
from $500 to 81,000 more than they cost when
new. I have personal knowledge of tractors
four years old which have been sold for $500
more than the price of a new machine. Every
repair part that the farmer needs, and almost
evcry other article he requires, bas increascd
in price. The fact is that the farmer bas not
enough monýey to improve bis buildings and
bis home; and in the light of the high wages
nnd higlh costs which prevail today I doubt
whether $2 a bushel will not 'be regarded as
a reasonable price for grain in the future.
Grain growing in the West is suhject to
serious hazards. ln alinost every month of
last year there was frost in the V.'est; and our
situation now is such that we must summerfallow every other year. You plough and

MARCH 21, 1947
cultivate and summer-fallow, and your land is
idie; you seed it ntxt year. In many cases the
resuit, is no more than ten bushels an acre
of very low-grade wheat, either No. 3 or No.
4. How can the farmer pay his taxes and
other outgoings on a yield of ten or aven
fifteen bushels? Meanwhile taxes arm increasing; they rose approximately $10 per quarter
section last year. Remember that the price
quoted for wheat is for No. 1 basis Fort
William, and if there is a large crop of lowgrade wheat the average price may be very
much lower. If there is flot too much lowgrade wheat it is more easily disposed of and
'the spread may flot be so great. What does it
represent, after ail, as a return for two years'
work on .the land?
Honourable senators, I have spokeu on
some matters of which I happen to have particular knowledge, and I thought my remarks
might be of interest to some honourable
members.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: May I ask the honourable senator whether, with a restricted
price of 81.35 for wheat, and an open market
price of 83.20 for rye, he anticipates a reduction of wheat acreage and an incease in rye?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: That has taken place
already.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: To what extent?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I should say that it is
pretty difflou'lt to estimate, but it is certainly
taking pl1ace.
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: Honourable
senators, the question of marketing wheat and
getting the hast price for it has always been
a very serious problein, not only for the
farmers of Western Canada and the government, but also for the people of Canada as a
whole.
I have listened with great interest to the
speeches that have already been -made, but
it is my intention to deal with a different
angle of the question. I am no more satisfied
with the prica that exists than is the honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon Mr.
Hornar). In the first place I should like to
say that the question before the Senate now
is not one .as to whether or not we should
have a wheat (board. We have had a whest
board ever since 1935, and we are told that we
lad one as early as at the end of the last war.
Both of these boards have done good job@.
However, I have come in contact with tlree
different views ainong farmers. You will find
one fariner is in favouT of the Canadian Whent
Board having complete control over the marketing and sale of wheat. Another does flot
83168-13J

195

like that kind of board at al, but prefers to
have the wheat board, working with the grain
exchange or the, open market. Yet another
wants to have ail restrictions remnoved, and to
be allowed to seli and dispose of his grain
on the open market as he sees fit.
I am reminded of a story that was told me
about -a fariner a short tima ago. It was just
before the Canadian Wheat Board took over
the absolute control of wheat. This particular
farmer, having scme trouble with bis bead,
ha went to a doctor. After an axamination
the doctor suggested that the fariner had
brain troubla, and that ha leave bis brain at
thc doctor's office to be checked over. The
fariner said that that w.as satisfactory Vo him,
so the doctor took the braîn and put it in a
case, and the fariner went off ab>out bis business. Several days went by and the fariner
did flot return. TIen one day the dioctor met
hum on the street, and be said to hlm: "John,
why didn't you coma back for your brain? I
have examined. it and I think I know now what
is wrong with you." The fariner replied:
Since I saw you last the wheat board bas taken
ovar tIe complete marketing of wheat, and
I dýecided that I don't need my brain any
more.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh oh.
Hon. M-r. ASELTINE: I find it impossible
Vo agree witb aIl the remarks made by the
member for Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr.
Joînston) or bis colleague beside hlm (Hon.
A. L. Beaubien), and I bave certain suggestions
to rnake in regard to Vhe amendinent of the
bill that is before us.
Ini view of the fact that I am going Vo have
considerable to say about the price that is
being paid for wheat, and also in view of the
fact that subsection (e) of section 1 of Vhe bill
defines grain as including wheat, oats, barley,
rye and flaxseed, I propose to place on the
record the average Winnipeg cash closing
prices of wheat, oats and barley, and the
Canadian Wheat Board's fixed prices where
applicable, based on wheat in store at Fort
William and Port Arthur from the crop years
1909-10 to 1945-46. 1 believe that with these
prices before them honourable senators will
have a much better chance of realizing
exactly wlat the situation is, and be able to
appreciate how the farinera are being cleated
out of a great deal of the money they are
entitled to for this wheat. If honourable
members are agreeable, I shaîl not read these
prices but I ask to have them placed on
Hansard.
(See appendiz at end of todays report),.

IIJ6

SENATE

My honourable friend from Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Johnston) stated yesterday-or if be did flot say it he indicated
it--that when the Wartime Prices and Trade
Board was set up wheat was at the very low
price of around 74 to 76 cents a bushel. That
wvas the prices which prevailed at that time.
A continued ceiling at that price wouid have
meant bankruptcy for the farmer, because the
price was considerably below the cost of production. The more fact that the Wartime
Prices and Trade Board estabished a ceiling
price at that time is one of the reasons we
have bad so much difficulty.
It was flot until 1943 and subsequent years
that the farmer received anytbing like a fair
price for bis wbeat. As was stated yesterday,
the price went up from 74 or 76 to 90 cents,
and, in 1944, to $1.23; in 1945 to 31.25; and
Honourable senators should
1946, to $1.35.
bear in' mind that these prices are ail f.o.b.
Fort William or Port Arthur or Vancouver,
B.C. The farmer does not get ail that money.
For example, in my district in Saskatchewan,
if I seil wheat I receive only the price f.o.b.
Fort William less 18 cents for freight and
bandling charges. That means, if wheat is
31.35 per bushel for No. 1 Northern f.o.b.
Fort William, 1 receive 31.17 or 31.18.
If I seil No. 2 Northern I gct 31.14 or 31.15,
and for No. 3 Nortbern I get three or four
cents less than that.
Throughout my argument when dealing with
prices I arn referring to prices f.o.b. Fort Williain, but they are flot tbe prices tbe farmer
gets. A farmer in the province of Manitoba,
where my honourable friend tbe leader on this
side (Hon. Mr. Haig) lives, would receive
more, because thc freïgbt, rate is seven or eigbt
cents a bushel less. Tbat is to say, he would
receive seven or eigbt cents more for bis
whleat than I would for mine.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: And mny bonourable friend from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) would receive more tban we in our
province.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Yes, we would get
more than you in Alberta. Well, we certainly
need it.
When I stated that the price of wheat had
gone up to 31.35 a bushel, I did flot mean
that the wboat board was not sel.ling it for
more than that. For some considerable time
the board has been selling wheat to Britain
and other countries for $1.55 a bushel, but the
farmer (1005 fot get $1.55, less 18 cents for
freigbt and elevator charges. Ho gets $1.35,
and 20 cents per bushel is kept by the wbeat
board, to be distributed, I presilme, at the

e.nd of tbe five-year period. After expenses
have been deducted the farmer will receive
whatever profit is shown on wbat we eall bis
wheat producers certificates.
My chief objection, honourable sen-ators, to
this whole matter bas been tbe manipulation
of prices. In my opinion it can neither be
ju.stified nor explained. People in this part of
the country can scarcely understand exactly
what bas been going on. It is difficuit enougb
for us, w-ho are dealing in wbeat almost dýaily,
to understand the set.-up.
The Canadian Whieat Board stili selîs wbeat
to the milýlers of Canada for 77k cents a busbel.
For a long time tbe board paid the farmer
for that wheat et $125 a bushel. For any
wbeat used domestically tbe farmer drew $125
a bushel and the governaient made up the
(lifference by way of a subsidy. That accounts
for tw-o prices. During a goodi deal of this
time the board w-as exporting wheat at 31.55.
That represents a third price. Wheat is still
being sold to the millers et 77k cents but the
price to, tbe farmer for such wbeat is 31.35
a busbel and the difference is being made up
by way of a dominion subsidy. There is stilI
another price that bas been prevailing for
some time-the world price. Just how the
poor farmer cen understand ail those prices,
I do not know.
We heard in this bouse recently thet the
w orld price has been running close to the 3
mark.
lion. Mr. SINCLAIR: At what point is tbat
price preveiling?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: That would be f.o.b.
Fort William, on exports to any country in
the w-orld except Great Britain.
This jockeying of prices bas been very
confusing. I do not know whetber the responsibility belongs to the w-heet board, the Department of Trade and Commerce, or the
Depertment of Agriculture, or whose it is. I
should tbink that the board would take its
instruction from governmental. departments.
I sbould like to deal as briefly as I can
witb tbe lasses the farrmers have suffered
during the past four years rby reason of not
being permitted to seîl their grain on the
open market. Tbe Ioss for tbe 1943-44 crop
was 136 million dollars; 1944-45 crop, 147
million dollars; 1945-46 crop, 126 million dollars; and for the 1946-47 crop-from August 1,
1946, to the date of tbe compilation of these
figures in February, 1947-126 million dollars.
Tbo loss will be greater as the marketing
continues, because the world price now is
higher than it bas been.
Hon. Mr. FOS'FER: The farmers must be
nearly banknipt by now.

MARCH 21, 1947
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The total loss for
the four years' crop is 535 million dollars.
Hon<ourable senators, it would flot take a great
deal of mathematical ability to compute how
nruch money the farmers will lose if that
continues during the lifetime of this wheat
agreement with Britain. And they will neyer
get it back. I emphasize that none of this
loss wlll be repaid to the farmers at the end
of five years.
.Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: How were those
amounts computed?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: -I took the figures
fromn the Searle Index.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The honourable
gentleman misunderstood my question.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: They were computed at Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: What comparison is
made?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: It is the amount the
fariner bas been receiving compared with the
price on the open market. I wish to be clearly
understood that the loss is only on the wheat
that bas been sold to Great Britain and other
nations at 81.55, and the loss to the fariner
on wheat for domestic consumption sold to
the millers of Canada at 77J cents during
that period.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Doce my fionourable
friend suggest that the farmers have heen
losing the difference between 77J cents ad
$1.25?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: No. I deait with
that question when my friend was out of the
chamber.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: A subsidy is given to
cover that amount.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I refer to the loss
sustained on the amount actually receivedwhether $1.25 or $13 a bushel-as compared with what would have been obtained
had the grain been sold on the open market.
Some reference was made' here yesterday to
the vote that was taken on this question in
another place. It wa.s stated that only some
seven votes were cast against the bill when
it was finally passed. I draw to the attention
of bonourable senators the fact that certain
amendments to the bill were proposed, and
when a vote was taken they were defeated by
a small majority. On the final vote only seven
or eight members voted against the bill. 0f
course, when the amendments were refused
the other house could do> nothing but paw the
bill, because Canada must bonour her agree-

197

ment with Great Britain. The agreement has
been made, and we are going to deliver the
wheat.
The chief objection by members in another
place and honourable senators on this side of
the house is that the agreement is improvident and unnecessarily penalizes the farmers
to the extent that I have mentioned. The
farmer is the person who loses through this
agreement; and if we are to help Great Britain,
as we all appear to want to do, the people of
the whole Dominion of Canada, flot. farmers
alone, should do the helping out. I suggest
that there should be legislation whereby the
farmers who have sold their wheat at this
sacrifice price in order to help Great Britain
should be reintursed.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: So far as the honourable senator knows, are -the farmers' organizations and the pools in favour of the agreement?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I am not able to
answer that question definitely. I understand
the terms of the agreement were worked out
,by some of the pool officials and the dëpartment at Ottawa, and that is how it came into
being. But it is not to say that the people of
,the West are in favour of this foolish agreement, merely because officiais of the wheat
pool-an organisation which bas flot purchased wheat for years-helped to make it.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Does the pool itself
sustain the action of its officers?
Hlon. Mr. ASELTINE : As I have said, the
pool bias not bought any wheat for some
years.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: But it is stiil in
existence.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The pool exists practically only as an elevator agency. As the
honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner) said, the wheat pool took over
the co-operative elevator systein. and organised the Saskatchewan wheat pool elevators,
the Manitoba pool elevators, and the Alberta
pool elevators. They are ail subsidiaries of
the western pools. They have been carrying
on in that way ever since they got into trouble
and had to be financed by their respective
provincial governmnents.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: May I asic a question? I know very littie about this agreement. As I understand it the proposition of
the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) is that if the farmer loses mo-ney
as a reeult of- this agreement the national
treasury should reimburse him.

198
Hoan. Mr. ASELTINE:
suggesting.

SENATE
That is what I arn

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The question I wisb
to ask is, if the farmer makcs money out of
this agreement, as a consequence of the price
going down in future years, would you suggest that the farmer contrihute to, the national
treasury accordingly?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: That loss of which I
have givea particulars bias already occurred.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: The pools are still in
business.
Hon. Mr. R-OEBIJCK: In future years the
farmer may gain by this agreement. Wauld
the bonourable senator propose that bis gains
be made over to the national treasury?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I do not see how
that is possible.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCX: Sa, as I understand
the honourablo gentleman, bie suggests that
the losses be assumed by the stato, and tbe
gains, or possible gains, rotained hy the
farmor.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Perbaps the honourable member fromn Toronto does not understand.
Hon. Mr. ROEBIJCK: No, I do not understand.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:
Perbaps I should
have said that at the end of this fivo-year
poriod, if the marketing operation is succossfui, a paymont will ha made to the farmer who
bas delivered wbeat on the wbeat producer
certificate whicb lie recoives each time bie
markets a bushel of wheat. But tbat will
cover profits only on sales to countries othor
than Great Britain, bocause the contract witb
Britain bas been so drawn that there can be
neithor gain nor losa from that.
Nothing has been said here about tbe views
of that great Liberal îlewspaper, the Winnipeg
Free Press. 1 ivas astonishced that the bonourable senator from St. Jean Baptiste (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) and tbe honourable sonator from
Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Jobnston)
havq flot mentionod tbis wonderful nowspaper.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON,: We would rather
talk about the Saskatoon Star-Phoenix.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The Winnipeg Free
Press and somne of the other newspapers mentioncd hy the sponsor cf this bill have adopted
a v'ery antagonistic attitude to this agreement
with Great Britain. They say it is improvident,
it is rohbing the fariner. and it should nover
have beea entered into.

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: But, ater ail, that
is only the oditor's opinion.
Ho bas no
more right ta bis opinion that I bave ta, mine,
or you bave to 3 ours.
Hon. Mr. HAIG : He is influential1 witb the
Liberal party, though.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The Free Press is a
very strong Liboral paper and expresses tbe
views and opinions of the Liheral party in
Western Canada.
In tact, it is the most
powerful newspaper publishod west of Fort
William.
Hon. Mr. COPP?: Does the honourable
senator agreo with its views on the question of
the agreement?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Naturally I agree
one bundred per cent with the Winnipeg Free
Press as ta thîs agreement with Great Britain,
hecauso every time I seli a bushel of wheat
tao Britain-that is, a hushel of wheat wbich
1 bave dolivered-I loso $1.30.
An Hon. SENATOR: Too bad!
Hon. Mr. COPP: I will make a contribution,
any time.

Hon. Mr. ASELTIýNE: I wish now to came
te a consideration of the act itseîf. I bave
some suggestions to mako. and some criticisms
to offer. I will try not to taike up any more
timo than is necessary.
Tbe bill fixes dýefinitely, positively and
unalterahly the mothods of bandling wboat
and prices up ta 1950, and these motbods
cannot possibly be changed in any mannor
whatsoever except b3y an act of parliamont.
Would it not ho botter to change section 29
by insorting, on line 10, atter "tbe first day
cf August":
nineteen bundrod and forty-eigbt, but which
period niay be continued until 1950 by order in
council.
That would mean that things as they are
would continue' until that time, and if the
gavernment saw fit, for sufficiont rossons it
could he continued until the expiration of the
five-year period. My reason for making this
suggestion is tbnt no one knows whiat is going
ta happen hetween now and 1950. As was
said hy the bonaurable senator tram Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert), five years is a long time
te, look ahead and try ta envisage what may
bappen. Tbe puice of wheat may ho up, or
it may ho down. The wbeat board may find
tbat conditions have become so complicated
that it cannot carry on, and prefer the adoption
of some ather method. But. with the provisions cf the bill as they are, it would ho

MARCH 21, 1947
absolutely impossible to make any change
by order in council or otherwise than by act
of parliament.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: Was there a definite
undertaking or bargain with Great Britain for
the inatter of four years?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I arn coming to
that.
By section 21, in Part III of the bill, the
farmer is guaranteed a price of $1.35 per
bushel until 1950, no matter what wheat
selis for. That, at any rate, is the meaning I
take from the section. I think that the government, in making that promise, probably
did not use very good judgment. Nevertheless,
with wheat selling now at around $3 per
bushel, it is quite likely that they can
continue to pay the pool Si1.35, and perhaps
much more. 1 suggest an amendrnent, to read
this way:
The price shall be at least $1.35 per bushel,
or such other higher price as the povernment
by order in eouncil may see fit from time to time
to establish.
That would enable the farmer, without
waiting the entire five-year period, to participate in an increase of the price of wheat,
such as we have at the present moment.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: In other words, the
honourable senator would make the pool
period one year inetead of five?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I am coming to that
also. I ar n ot satisfied. to wait the full five
years for my participation dividends, on the
1944-45 and 1945-46 crops, at any rate.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: This bull does not
affect the 1944-45 crop.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Yes it does. In the
other bouse an amendment wêg offered as to
tijat, but was turned down because the government did not sec fit to accept it.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The amendment
which the honourabte gentleman has in mmnd
referred to the 1945-46 crop.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: By order-in-council
it could be provided that the participation
payrnents be made yearly instead of only at
the end of five years.
What I was going to say before I wam interrupted was, that day by day farmers are
becoming more dissatisfied with the provision
of the bul, and many of them take violent
opposition to the wheat board retaining the
profit and not making any distribution on the
producers certificates untit 1950. In rny opinion
the bill shoutd be amended so as to give the
wheat board the right te make an annual participation payment if so desîred. Otherwise,

V

the board's hands are tied and nothing can be
done without parliament sitting and amending
the legisiation.
I next corne to the penalty sections which
in the flrst bill were very severe. Subsectionis
4 and 5 of section 34 of the bill as originally
drawn and submitted in another place were
stricken out. Nevertheless, a permit halder
can -stili have his permit book seized and
retained for a fifteen-day period, and if proscution is taken against him the permit book
can be withheld for longer than that. In the
case of a prosecution the permit book can be
retained until the trial is over, or un-til any
appeal resulting from the decision of the trial
judge has been. heard. That might be for a
period of weeks, rnonths, or in soine cas
even a year. This would prove to be a
severe penalty imposed on any farmer, because
hie would be unable Vo, seli wheat during that
period; yet hie may have been quite innocent
and not have had any intention whatever of
making a breach of the complicated provisions
of this bill.
I had intended Vo deal with the question of
the value of the dollar and what the farmer
can buy for it now, as compared with what
hie could buy with it in 1939; to suggest that
perhaps there might be inflation between now
and 1950 and that the money that the farmer
wîll get on his producers certificaties in 1950
might flot buy as much as hie can get for his
money at present, and so on; but I shahl not
go into that now.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Will1 the honourable
senator tell us the approximate difference
between the cost of producing a bushel of
wheat in 1939 and in 1945-46.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: There are a great
rnany factors which enter into that. For
instance, if I were to grow only ten bushels
to the acre, each bushel would cost me a
great deal to produce.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: I ask that because of
the difference between the prevailing price in.
those two years, as shown by the table which
is being placed on Hansard. I feel that it is
not really possible to compare the prices that
we receive for wheat uless sme idea is given
of what it cost to produce a bushel of wheat
in the years that are be.ing compared.
Somne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: I should like to know if
there is not some way by whieh we could get
a supplement showing production costs as well
as the prices received for wheat.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: It aIl depende on
the -method of farming used and the isize of
the economia unit being farmed. A farmer

200

SENATE

who cultivates two sections of land an~d uses
big machinery will produce much more cheaply
than a farmer on a quarter-section who uses
horses.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: There must be some
statistical average given somewbere.
Hon. Mr. LA.MBERT: May I ask the
honourable senator (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) if hie
would not agree with me when I say that
there have neyer been any authoritative figures
given on the cost of wheat, because of the
varying yields, due to natural conditions and
other varying factors.
-Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I think the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) is correct. I have seen lots of figures,
but I have always been able to find defects
and faults with tbem. I know of none that
have flot been subject te dispute.
I have deait with the various points that I
intended to discuss, and I would suggest- to
the honourable leader of the bouse that the
bill go to the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce, because that is a large committee and it bas to do with matters of
finance and trade and commerce.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Before my honourable
friend sits down, may I point out that the
bonourable senator from Queen's (Hon. Mr.
Sinclair) asked him a question wbich I do
not think was understood or properly answered.
My honourable fricnd fruîî Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Ascitine) %vas dealing, with the question
of the basic price for wheat being $1.35 a
bushel. He suggested that if in coming years
t'le price of wheat sold to countries other than
Britain continued to be higher than the price
under the agreement, the advance payment
should be higber than $135.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Or that at least a
payment could be ma'de to the farmer on his
producers certificate at the end of each crop
year.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: If we got $2.50 a bushel
thero would be a great deal of money in the
pool, and therefore the basic price could be
raiscd from $1.35 to 31.50 or $1.55. Then there
is also the final payment, which is another

matter.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Tbat would destroy
the five-year stabilization principle 'bebind the
whoie bill.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do net think so.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: May I ask the lion.
ourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) if hie had in mind limiting the period

of this act to the definite-price period in the
contrsct witli Great Britain? I have not read

the contract very carefuly,-but I understand
from wbat bas been said bere that it is for
a two-year period, and tbat then it is to be renegotiated.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: My idea was to limit
this to the definite-price period andi then have
the wbole thing gone into again and
re-negotiated.
Hon. Mr. MeLEAN: Honourale senators,
I arn desirous of speaking on tbis subjeet, but
amrnfot prep-ared to do se this afternoon. I
should like now te move the adjournment of
the debate until Tuesday next.
The motion was agreed to.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. J. J. BENCU moved the second reading of Bill E2, an act respecting Guaýranty
Trust Com.pany of Canada.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Will the honourable
gentleman please explain the 'bill?

Hon. Mr. BENCH: Honourable

senators,

I hope I may find agreement with the suggestion, wbich I respectfully make, that the
principle invo'lved in this bill is a simple one.
The Gilaranty Trust Company, as honourable senators may know, is one of the smaller
but rather progressive trust companies and
operates at prcsent out of the city of Windsor,
where its h4'ad office is located.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Does it attend to
the administration of estates of deceased persons, nnd that kind of business?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Yes, it bas to do with
business of a general nature applying to trust
companies.
The company was incorporated by an act
of this parliament in the year 1925, by w'hich
statute its capital was authorizcd at 3500,000
and its head office determined as being located
in the city of Windsor. The purpose of this
bill is to effeet two simple amendments to the
act of incorporation. T1he first is to authorize
an increase of capital from $500,000 to
$1,000,000; and the second, to remove the
head office from the city of Windsor -to the
city of Toronto.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: Why do that?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I arn not overly sympathetie with the practice of centralizing aIl
these financial institutions in Toronto, any
more than is my bonourable friend from
Le-thbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan).
But I
assume that the sharebolders and others interested in the company find it better, from an
administrative standpoint, to have the bead
office in Toronto.

MARCH 21, 1947
While I have no specific information on it,
1 understand the additional capital is required
for the purposes of the company. According
to newspaper reports of a day or two ago it is
proposed that the Guaranty Trust Company
should acquire the assets and undertakings
of -the Capital Trust Company, which I believe
also lias a very good record as one of the
smaller trust companies.
The motion was agreed to and the bill was
read the second tirne.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
-Hon. Mr. BENCH moved the third reading

of the bill.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, I
have no objection to the bill receiving third
reading this afternoon, but 1 wondered if
Parliamnentary Counsel bas been given an
opportunity to consider whether its phraseology is proper in every d-etail.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I arn unable to say that
he bas. In those circumstances 1 arn quite
agrecable that the bill should stand over for
third reading at the next sitting.

201

Hon. Mr. LEGER: In my opinion the bill
should be referred to either the Standing
Committee on Miscellaneous Private Buis or
the Standing Commit-tee on Banking and
Commerce. Then if anyone lias an objection
he can appear before the committee and state
it. As stated, newspaper reports have been
to the effeet that the Guaranty Trust Company is acquiring the Capital Trust Company.
The location of the head office should be settled by the shareholders and directors of both
companies. 1 know the city of Ottawa is
reluctant to lose the head office of the Capital
Trust Company.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I arn grateful for the
suggestion from the honourahie senator from
L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger), and 1 have no
objection to the bull being referred to committee. I would therefore withdraw my
motion for third reading and move that the
bill be referred to the Standing Committee on
Miscellaneous Private Bills.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned unti] Tuesday, March
25, at 8 p.m.

BUSINESS

OF THE SENATE

EASTER RECESS

Hon. A. B. COPP: Honourable senators,
at the sitting on Friday the honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) asked if I would
make a statement tonight as to when the
Senate might adjourn for the Easter recess.

MARCH 25, 1947
Honourable senators know that about this
time of year we may expect to receive from
the other place an interim supply bill, which
lias to be dealt with by this house. I have
been 'in touch with the Minister of Finance,
and while I have no definite promise to make
to my honourable friend 1 have a strong hope
that the supply bill will corne over to us on
Thursday afternoon, or at the latest on
Friday. If we complete that business on
Friday we may be able to adjourn the same
evening. I was also asked to indicate for
what period we might adjourn. Subject to
what may happen elsewhere, I intend to
ssk the Senate to adjourn until April 22. Al
this information is tentative.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I wish to thank the acting leader of the
house (Hon. Mr. Copp) for the information
he has given. I think I can assure him that
if the supplementary estimates corne to this
house on Friday there will be no difflculty in
getting tliem through that day, unless there
is some objection by honourable members
from Montreal and Toronto.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: No objection from
Manitoba?
CANADIAN
MOTION

FOR

WHEAT BOARD BILL
SECOND READING-DEBÂTE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Friday, March 21,
the adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Copp for the second reading of Bill 23,
an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board
Act, 1935.
Hon. A. N. McLEAN: Honourable senators,
there is a phase of this bill relating to conditions in the neighbouring island of Newfoundland with which I arn familiar and
which I would like to cati to the attention of
honuurabie senators. I feel sure it is flot
realized that the wide disparity between the
prices of wheat and flour quoted to the United
Kingdom under the wheat agreement, and
those quoted to other importing countries on
the basis of the mucli higher world prices, has
a direct unfortunate effect upon Canada's relation with Newfoundland, the West Indies, and
our other neîghbours.
Newfoundland has always been regarded in
the past virtually as an extension of our own
home market. Canadian flour was always
quoted to Newfound]and buyers on the basis
of Montreal prices plus the cost of water
transportation to St. John's, Newfoundland,
and a very satisfactory trade in flour has
existed for many years.
83168-14J

Since the United Kingdorn wheat agreement has been in force Canada lias divorced
Newfoundland from its home mnarket and now
classifies lier witli sucli distant mnarkets as
China, Belgium, the Netherlands, Brazil, Norway, Jamaica, the United States, Eire, the
Philippine Islands, Italy, Greece and other
countries, fifty-one in ail.
Up to February 28, 1947, sales since August
1, 1946, througli the wheat board were equivalent to 155,000 barrels of flour sold on world
price quotations of wlieat, known as class 2
wheat, representing figures quoted outside of
the United Kingdom wlieat agreement. Newfoundland is at the rnercy of top world prices.
Egypt, India, Malta, Iraq, Iran, Germany
and Ceylon have been supplied with wheat
on the basis of the United Kingdom wlieat
agreement, known as class 1 wheat, eitlier
direct by the wheat board or by the Government of the United Kingdom. Figures sliowing
exports of flour from Canada to Newfound]and before the wlieat board took fuît control
of wheat and flour exports in September, 1943,
are as fol!ows:

Hono>urable senators wilI note that while
sales for the whole of 1946 were 423,374 barrels,
sales for the seven rnonths from August 1,
1946 to February 28, 1947 were only 155,000
barrels. This was a period during which Newfoundland had been subjected to world prices,
and the figures show a big falling off in sales.
It looks as though she was securing lier supplies elsewhere.
The fact that a substantial portion of the
world's visible supply of wlieat lias been set
aside for special purposes bas liad a tendency
to drive up tlie price of the balance.
There seems to be a falling off of sales to
the West Indies also. I quote the following

My informant in Newfoundland says:
Flour importers here recently had a meeting
an(l decided to refrain f rom purchasing Canadian flour at present prices. because of the great
risk involved. Many Canadian mills, on the

204

SENATE

other hand, are refusing to sell private buyers
here and in other similar export markets, because of the extreme credit risk involved in
the event of a price decline.
It would now be possible for British mills
which get Canadian wheat to manufacture it
into flour and ship it back to Newfoundland at
prices substantially lower than Canadian mills
could sell the same kind of fleur direct to our
neighbouring island.
Canada's important diplomatic interest in
Newfoundland would certainly not seem to
be well served by this sort of thing.
Newfoundland is one of Canada's largest
customers. She ranks eighth on the list. But
we must remember a great many of our customers today are credit customers; otherwise
Newfoundland would be much nearer the top.
As a cash customer she ranks third. Several
countries whose export figures are larger are
credit customers; in other words, we pay for
our exports to them with our own taxpayers'
money. But Newfoundland asks for no credit
from us, and she spends about six dollars with
us for every dollar we spend with ber. She
spends with us around 40 million dollars per
annum, and what we buy from ber amounts to
around seven millions per annum. What
applies te Newfoundland applies te the West
Indies. Both these countries are our very
near neighbours. The West Indies buy far
more from Canada than this country buys
frem them. These• neighbours cannot help
but feel greatly annoyed over the position
they have ibeen placed in with regard to their
daily bread, and my own opinion is they may
appeal to England to turn over to them some
of the English allocation. In this way they
will be able to obtain our wheat or flour at a
much lower price than we are offering it to
them, and in such circumstances their good
will towards us will certainly net be increased.
Honourable senators are aware that England
can sell the wheat she is buying from us to
anyone she pleases. I quote the paragraph in
the agreement giving ber such authority:
It is agreed that the United Kingdom government may sell or dispose of the wheat and flour
purchased under this agreement in whatsoever
manner the United Kingdom government may
deem expedient both in regard to destination
and price.
Newfoundland played a very important part
in the recent war. She is in a very strategic
position. She bas given full co-operation to
this country in matters of defence, and would
again. Newfoundland finance is mainly controlled by Canada, to mutual advantage. In
being so generous te the United Kingdom with
regard to the price at which we are selling
wheat to them, surely we can find ways and

means to supply our good neighbours nearby
in a manner, whereby they will not have to
pay the top wheat prices of the world. In
this connection I quote a telegram received
this morning from a good friend in Newfoundland:
Wholesale provisions group of Newfoundland
Board of Trade lias given following information.
Cost of flour to England is based on $1.55 wheat.
Cost of flour to Newfoundland today based on
world prices of wheat at $3 per bushel is roughly
$18 per barrel. Flour for Newfoundland in
July, 1946, cost $10 per barrel c.i.f. St. John's.
Advanced in August to $12.50 per barrel, in
December to $13, in February, 1947, to over
$14, and this month touched $18. Canadian
home market price is today $4.90 per barrel.
There is strong feeling here that since Newfoundland has always been one of Canada's best
flour customers, special consideration should be
given her in face of present abnormal price of
flour. In view of very high per capita consumption flour in Newfoundland, present prices are
accounting largely for high cost of living here.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: May I ask the
honourable senator from Southern New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean) a question? Does
he propose that the farmers of Western Canada
should also export to Newfoundland and take
a similar loss to what they are taking on the
wheat being shipped to Great Britain?
Hon. Mr. MeLEAN: I think the whole
country should bear the burden of any of these
transactions.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McLEAN: A delegation will be
coming here soon from Newfoundland to
inquire about the terms of confederation, and
I thought that this wheat situation should be
brought to the attention of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. EULER: May I ask the honourable senator a question. He cited a number
of countries-Egypt, Iraq, Iran, and so onthat are buying Canadian flour and wheat at
the same price at which England is buying it
under the agreement. Is that by reason of the
fact that those countries buy our wheat and
flour from England?
Hon. Mr. MeLEAN: I believe they come
within the price allocation for England.
Hon. F. W. GERSHAW: Honourable senators, I rise to say just a few words on this
bill. The wheat producers of the West are
restless and disturbed about market conditions
at present. The fact that farming is not
profitable is shown by the great migration from
country districts to the small towns, villages
and cities of Western Canada particularly. It
is also stressed by the fact that a few months
ago there was a non-delivery strike among the
producers of farm products in Alberta. That
strike was probably not well organized and

MARCH 25, 1947
was nlot intended ta last very long, but it
appealed to a large number of producers and
was strongly supported by a great majority of
the farmers in Alberta. Most of the strike
activity was in the north of the province, but
even in the southern part there were meetings
at which two or three hundred farmers came
together and, without a dissenting vaice,
appraved of strike methods. At the busy
season of the year farmers in many places left
their work to picket the elevators and producepurchasing stations.
This, I think, indicated that there was real
dissatisfaction. And what was asked for was
vague anâ indefinite-parity prices. What the
farmers meant was that for the products which
they sold they were not receiving a big enough
price in comparison with the prices of products
they had to buy. The Economic Ar&nali.st for
1946 points out that if the 1926 figure be taken
as 100, the farmers in 1946 received only 106-5
for what they soid, but had ta pay 124-6 for
the things they required tQ buy.
Also it was feit by the farmers that they
were not receiving their fuit share of the
national incarne. Just yesterday I noticed a
statement by the Bureau of Statistics that the
net farmi income for 194 was $1,267,400,000.
If one-third of the people of Canada'are
engaged in agriculture and that wias their
income, it is clear that they were not receiving
their fuil share of the eight or nine billion
dollars which is roughiy the national income.
The history of the marketing of grain has
been a stormy one since the early years of the
century, a history of struggle and effort on the
part of the producers to receive better prices.
When the wheat growers first started to farm
in the West elevators were built along the
railways, and the railway companies would
take only the wheat that went through those
elevatars. Farmers tried ta secure elevators
themselves, but the competition soon forced
themn out of business. Then in 1900, as a resuit
of an investigation into the grain marketing
business, the. Canada Grain Act was passed.
It required the railway companies to provide
ioading platforms and spot the cars where
required.
Since that act was passedi the Dominion
Government has had supervision of ,the
marketing of grain-, but has not by any means
settled the problems. Some thirteen investigations into the subject were held between
the time of the setting up of the Grain Act
and the First World War. Each investigation
was prompted- by grievances which the farmers
had, and each resulted in some improvemnent.

205

The province of Manitoba at one stage
went into the elevator business and has 174
elevators. After 1906 the Grain Growers Grain
Company was formed. One of the company
officiaIs acted as president andi manager for
more than twenty years, and made a great
contribution towards the solution of the problems of marketing grain. He is now a member
of the Senate, the honourabie gentleman from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). But there was
constant agitation and trouble.
The pools were established later, and the
discussion was whether they should be voluxýtary or compuisory. In 1935 the wheat board
was estabiished, and for a while marketing
was done partly through the board and partly
through the line companies. Since 1943 the
wheat board has had the marketing of practicaliy ail the grain. The bill now before us
apparently is an expression of governmnent
policy, and gives the board control of aIl the
wheat that is to be marketed in Canada.
The record seems to show that it is not
satisfaetory for a fariner, or for a smail group
of farmers to market their own grain. It
would seem necessary that there be soe
co-operative selling organization in order ta
get the best results. Most countries with
whom. we deal are te somne extent nationalized
and have large purchasing agencies. If we are
to make a good deal, we must converge aur
bargaining powcr at one point compietely ta
t .ransact business with those countries which
do their buying at one point.
This bill- indicates that two agreements have
been made. In the one with the growers the
government says that until July 31, 1950, they
will reeive $1.35 per bushel for Ne. 1 Northern, and a corresponding lower price for lower
grades at the terminale of Fort William and
Vancouver; also that there may be seime particîpating profits ta came at the end of the
perîod. No one can tell whether that agreement is to be a good or bad one. But ta
some extent it does give stahility ta the price.
If the price of wheat on the worid market
keeps up, as it did after the st war, such
an agreement wiil not represent a gaod
arrangement. The farmer will be, as he is at
the present time, takîng a much lower price
for his product than he could get on the world
market. But there have been requeste for
stabiiýity of prices and for an orderiy market,
s0 that the wide variation of prives which
brought such discouragement in the past will
not take place again. Should the market fail
during the next three or four years--and this
seerns to be very likely-with na possibility
of getting a high price on the world market,
this will prove ta be a very good agrQement.

206

SENATE

Two safeguards of the agreernent should in
soine respects avoid disaster. In the first
place, the British people have said that the
price for the 1948-49 and the 1949-50 crops will
be negotiated, having regard for the prices we
are aex-eptixig at the present tirno, that is the
difference between $1.55 and the rnarket price.
There is also the business element to the
agreement. The average ancual Canadian
ci-op is approximately 375 million bushels. If
we allow 125 million bushels for flour, feed
ani seed, and takc 150 million bushels as the
av-erage amount we scnd to Great Britain for
the duration of the contract, and for whicb we
,-hall have a firm price-S1.35 per bixsbel can
be counted on-there will be a balance of
probably 125 to 150 million bushels which can
be sold on the world market, and which wil
iccrease the amount cf money available in
participation at the end of t.he perxod.
We do not have to weigh the wbeat in this
chamber but we do have te weigb the legislatien, because I arn sure we are ahi acxious ta
see that the wbeat producers, wbo have in
the past been at great disadvantage, get the
very best price possible for this preciaus food.
The other phase of the agreement with
Great Britain is that over the next four years
she wilh get 600 million bushels at an, average
price of $1.35 a bushel. Perhaps we are not
making Britain sixch a wonderful gift.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Is my bonourable
friend not mistaken wben be says we shahl
get $1.35 a bushel over the next four years?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I think he is.
Hec. Mr. GEIISHAW: No. The average
price that we shahl get over the :next two
years is $1.55; the minimum for 1948-49 is
$1.25; and for 1949-50 is $1. By adding the
total number of bushels at those prices, the
average will be $1.35 per bushel for the whoIe
four years.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT- That calculation
leaves eut the possibîhity of a higher maximum
price being set at the end of 1947.
Hon. Mr. GERSHAW: Yes, it does.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: What about the expense
in handlicg the grain? Wby nlot take off the
20 cents now?
Hon. Mr. GERSHAW: The price I arn
speaking of is at the terminals.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The terminal price is
$1.55, but the wheat board at the present tirne
charges 18 cents to handle it. Where does that
corne in, in your estimate of $1.35?
Hon. Mr. GERSHAW: The average price
is $1.35, and of course if the producer Iives
sorne distance frein the terminal the 18 cents

will have ta corne off that price. I arn speaking only of the price at the terminals, net at
the farrn.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But the wbeat board at
Winnipeg is now cbarging about 18 cents a
bushel ta handle the grain. That is the reason
the fariner cannoýt get $1.55 or $1.35, and that
is why hie is kicking. My honourable friend in
bis calculation is not providing for that
18 cents.
Hon. Mr. GERSHAW: I think the honourable senator froma Winnipeg will agree that
$1.35 is the price received at Fort William
and Vancouver, net et the farm. That is the
way the price of wheat is usually refé'rred ta.
The fact that five otber countries--Belgium,
Norway, France, Holland and Denmark-have
approacbed the minister regarding the negotiation of a simihar contract, and that not one
cf thern bas followed up the agreement, shows
that tbey hope ýta get the wheat at a Iower
price.
1 think we have faith tbat Britain wilh carry
out ber, part in this agreement. Britain is
going through dark days at present. In order
to make ber contribution te civilization she
had te draw deephy upon ber reserves cf courage and tenacity, and 1 behieve that the sarne
Br.itish spirit will carry ber people tbrougb tbe
economic difficulties wbicb now beset them.
Hon. Mr-. LAMBERT: As a matter of inf ormation, 1 qhould like te ask the honourable
senator frorn Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr.
Gersbaw) wbether or net in bis opinion the
objection made last year by bis fellew citizens
ic Alberta to the prices tbey were receivicg
reflected the opinions of any considerable
percentage cf the graic-growing fax-mers of
that province.
Hon. Mr. GERSHAW: I really tbink it did.
As the honourable member knows wehl, in
farming districts meetings were beld and there
wvas net cne voice raised against the strike.
They were ail in faveur cf it. That sbowed
great dissatisfaction on the part cf the fax-mers.
Hec. Mr. LAMBERT: A desire fer bigber
prices?

Hon. Mr. GERSHAW: That is rigbt.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators, I want te addi a few words te tbe
discussion on this bill. First. I wculdi thank
the honourable senator frcm Medicine Hat
(Hon. Mr-. Gersbaw) for tbe information ho
lias given. Ho lias liehped to clear the situation
ic serne resýpects. But I desire te preserve my
position in reference to tbis matter. because
when the bill is given second reading we shahl
have, in effect approved cf its principle.

MARCH 25, 1947
At the moment I am in the position where,
after as careful a study as I can give this billand I have given it serious study-there are
a great many questions to which I require
answers in order to appreciate and deal intelligently with the principle of the bill. For
that reason I propose to state briefly my position, so that, if the bill does go to committee,
and matters are dealt with in a way which
does not accord with the opinions and conclusions which I form after the information is
furnished, I shall have reserved the right to
vote as I wish on the motion for third reading.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: In view of that stand,
what is the honourable senator's attitude
to the position I took-that we have made
an agreement with Great Britain and that
we must give the government power to carry
out that agreement?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: So far as it is necessary to give power to the government to
implement the agreement it has entered into,
we are tied beyond recall. We must do
what we have engaged to do. But at the
moment I am not satisfied that the provisions
contained in the bill constitute the best
method of doing what is to be done. It is
these points to which I would briefly draw
the attention of the Senate. Certainly, having
entered into the agreement, we have committed ourselves, and somehow or other the
government must secure the wheat required
to fulfil the agreement; and it would appear
that the course which has been adopted has
some measure of support. But, conceding
this, we do not have to admit that the bill
in its present form-with all its provisions
for implementing the action of the government in taking the wheat, and in guarding
against any of the wheat getting into channels
other than those of the board--embodies the
best way of carrying out the contract. Nor
arn I prepared to say whether or not the bill
goes too far.
In effect, what the bill does is to nationalize
the wheat business and industry of Canada.
There may be many who favour that course.
Nationalization of industry has taken place
before, and there are circumstances under
which it can be justified. For instance, an
enterprise may be too big to be dealt with
through individual initiative: it may involve
too much in the way of expenditure. Here
we find every phase of the nationalization of
wheat production and wheat marketing, except
control of acreage; and it may be said that

207

in an indirect way we have accomplished even
that, through the provision for quotas on
deliveries to elevators, and also by the restriction of the right of the individual to sell or
deliver his wheat without obtaining the
necessary permits.
I am not prepared to say at the moment
that the nationalization of the wheat industry
of Canada is not a good thing. We must
face the fact that Canada produces wheat in
such abundance that there is no possibility of
consuming it all ourselves. It is a crop which
in the main is produced for export.
The next question which arises is whether
in these times the provision of a market for
the surplus wheat which we produce in such
abundance is a function which can better be
performed by the government or by permitting individual initiative to take its course
in a free market. Upon that issue I wish to
direct some questions to the authorities who
are supporting this bill, and to point out
certain of its provisions to which I think your
attention should be directed.
For instanoe, in part II appear the provisions entitled "Control of elevators and railways." Under this part, a producer, unless he
has a permit, may not deliver wheat to an
elevator or to a railway, and the railway may
not receive it; and if he is the holder of a
-permit, then that permit specifies the quantity
and directs him to the place where he may
deliver his wheat and where it may be received,
and that quantity is the only quantity which
he may deliver, and the place designated is
the only place to which his wheat may be
delivered. The scope of that provision is
unlimited. We are told that the provisions
generally have become necessary by virtue
of these wheat agreements, but there is no
time limitation in so far as part II of this
bill is concerned.
In part III, which deals with the "pool
period", there is a limitation ending the pool
period on July 31, 1950, and also the provision
with reference to the price of $1.35 a bushel
for No. 1 grade to be paid during the period
ends in 1950.
In part IV of the bill we find complete restriction upon the export and import of wheat
and also upon the movement of wheat from
one province of Canada to another, except
through the medium of the board.
There you have a complete plan and machinery to place in the hands of the board the
sole right to deal with the sale, delivery, transport and export of wheat. That may be necessary: I do not know. But it is quite possible
that these agreements with the United Kingdom may lapse in the 1948-49 period. The

208

SENATE

negotiators may flot agree upon a price ini
which event the agreement may terminate.
This may be to the advtange of Canada: I
do flot know. But the question which bothers
me is whether under these circumstances we
should build up a machinery of control which
os unlimited in time and goes bcyond the
period nceessary te accomplisb the specific
purpose for which, we are teid, this legisiation
os brought down.
1 want to know xvhy it is neccssary to have
the bill drafted in this form; why it is nocessary to go to that extent. I think thoso are
questions upon whicb we should be very
caroful to see that compiete information is
given in committee.
I find, for instance, very broad powers given
to the board. Sub-section (3)(j) of section 2
of the bill provides:
(3) The board is incorporated with the objeet
of marketing in an ordcrly mnanner, in interprovincial and export trade, grain grown in Canada
and shahl possess the following powers,
(j) to act as agent for or on behaif of any
minister or agent of lis Majesty in right of
Canada in respect of any operations that it may
be directed to carry out by the Governor in
Coonicil.
Honourable senators can sec that that is an
unlimited power which goes far beyond the
spocifie powers conferred by this bill in order
te ,lea'l with an orderly and phanned marketing
of whcat under the scbeme in this bill. Thore
are many conditions of that kind. For instance,
the board may at any time say that a permit
holder shahl surrender his permit, and whcn hie
doos so, hie surrenders his market and bis
right to deliver grain to an elevator, and the
right that any manager of an elevator or railway might have to receive grain from him os
taken away.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I ask my
honourable friend a question on that point?
Is it bis opinion that this legisiation, plenary
in authority, as it is, could possibly prevent
a producer of grain within the province of
Alberta from delivering his grain to a miii
elevator in Medicine Hat?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: 1 would not say so,
too definitely. I have read the bill a number
of times, but I do not protend that my
interpretations are one hundred per cent
accurate. I can only express the conclusions I
have taken from the bill. Honourable senaters
will sec this general provision in section 13,
part II of the bill:
Exccpt with the permission of the board, no
persan shall deliver grain te an elevator, and ne
manager or operator thereof shall roceive dolivery or grain unles

Then the conditions are set eut, that the
persi)n must be the actuel producer of the
grain, and that at the time of the delivery hoe
must possess a permit issuod by the board.
Part IV deals with expert trade. Before
answering my honourable fricnd's question,
may I read, a portion of section 27:
Except as permitted under the regulations, ne
persan ether than the board shall
(b) transport or cause te be transported from
one province te anether province, wheat owned
by a persen otber than the board;
(d) buy or agrce te boy wheat situated in one
province for delivery in anotber province or for
dohivery outsido of Canada.
Having regard te these provisions, the conclusion te whicb I ceme is this: that it would
net bo possible for a producer of grain witbout
a permit from the board te deliver grain to
an elevator, rcgardless of whero it mnay be
located. This is only my ewn opinion. But
I think that a producer of grain in Alberta
could dieliver bis grain te a miii in that
province.
However, I say that with great
hesitancy. If the grain were bcing consumed
in the province in a mnetbod tba.t did net
require the use of elevators, I suppese the
delivery migbt be made in a r-estricted way;
but if the use of elevators or storage space
were invohvod, thon you would bave to bave
a permit frem the board. Týhat may bo a
,necessary incident te the macbinery for
taking care of the marketing of wheat. It
may bc nocessary: I do net know. But witb
the inherent objection I bave te more controls
tban are nccessary-an objection that I think
is sbared by a great many people-I am on
the alert, and I want te be satisfied, that that
form of macbinery is necessary and must be
usod if there is going te be any effective funetioning under tbis bill. If I am satisfled on
tbat point, I am prepared te take it in tbc
form it is, subi ct to some restrictions of
broad powers that I do net tbink are nocessary.
Having said tbat, 1 bave net made any
binding commitiiùent as te my position on the
nationalization of whoat. I want te ho satisfied that that is necessary. It may very wehh
be, when you consider the situation. I suppose
if you took the average price of wheat over
the period frem 1930 te 1946, it would ho well
under a dollar a bushel. There bave been
times when Canada bas produced wbeat in
abondance, and due te world situations the
price bas been very low and the farmors have
had littie retura. The influencing factor has
been beyond the control of the Canadian
people or the Canadian governmont. That
factor will persist in the future. Due te
disturhed w'orhd conditions, it may net be
effective this ycar or next year, but I think

MARCH 25, 1947
the wheat producing countries of the. world
are rapidly going to get back into a way of
growing wheat. They are possibly going to
produce for export, and if that should happen
the problem will again be the problemn of the
price of wheat. If we are subi ect to world
rnarkets and world rnarket prices we shall have
a factor there that is difficuit for us to assess
over any period of tirne.
Honourable seliators, in those circurnstances
is it best to provide these measures of caution? la it best for the farmer, in the circumstances, to give him a guaranteed return of an
equitable price per bushel over a period of
years? It rnay be; and if the farmer wants
t.hat, then under the circumstances that miglit
be the thing to do. I arn of the opinion that
we should see and hear these people, and get
Itheir views on these questions. Certainly, that
îs what I want to do before I corne to a final
conclusion on this mratter.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: The honourable
senator from Southern New Brunswick (Hon.
Mr. McLean) ham delivered an excellent
speech. May I ask him a question? If the
agreemnent with the United Kingdom were
abrogated today, how would that help Newfoundland? Would she get hier flour cheaper?
Hou. Mr. McLEAN: I did not follow the
question asked.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: 'Me question is:
If the agreernent with the United Kinigdom
were blotted out, abrogated, done away with
today, how would that help the Newfoundland
people?
Hon. Mr. McLEAN: In times past, as I
stated, the price to Newfoundland was the
Canadian domestie price, but our dornestio
price today is so subsidized and so on, that it
has got extremely out of line with the
Newfoundland pries. The Newfoundland price
has been entirely divorced frorn our domestic
price, and Newfoundland is now paying the
top price in the world.
lion. Mr. CAMPBELL rnoved the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN moved second
reading of Bill D2, an act respecting certain
patents owned by Toronto Type Foundry
Company Limited.
He said: Honourable senators, I wish to
give on]y a brief explanation of the bill,

209

because when it receives second reading I shall
propose that it be referred to the Standing
Cornmittee on Miscelilaneous Private Bils.
The Toronto Type Foundry Company
Limited was the owner of some eight patents
dealing with foldmng and stitching machines in
the rnaking of ledgers and such produots. Two
of the patents expired a year or eighteen
mnonthis ago, and the rest will expire within
the next year or two. The rnanufacturing
operations em.ployed in the use of the»e
patents strictly relate to peacetirne funictions;
so because of allocations of materiale and so,
on the cornpany was not able to eni oy its
patent rights during the major portion of the
war period.
The purpose of the blli is to extend the
life of the patents for six years. Parliamenit
bas the power te do this. The British Parliament bas followed such-.a policy consistently;
it, has recognized that the war represented a
period of national necessity, duTing whieh
people were shut off from the eni oyment, of
their patent rights in respect of which they
had made substantial investments.
This
Toronto company now asks that its patents be
extended so that it may have the benefit of
each of thern f or the normal lifetime of a
patent.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: May I ask the honourable senator a question? Are these patents
on printing macbinery or binding machinery
that is made in this country, or that is made
in the United States and sold here, or made
in Great Britain and sold here?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Ail three things have
happened in the past. The machinery was
manufactured in Canada, but under soine of
the earlier patents there was no umAufacturing
during the depression period. At that tirne
the machines were irnported from Great
Britain, and a few fromn the United States.
The diffculty at the present time is that a
g.reat demand bas been built up over the past
six years in Canada and ini the United Kingdom, and for four or five years in the United
States. The importing situation is not going
to improve much.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: May I ask another
question?
In the opinion of the honourable
senator, will the extension of the life of these
patents, give the Toronto Type Foundry
Company a rnonopoly on a oertain type of
rnachinery which printers have to buy?
Hdn. Mr. HAYDEN:- In the mnain these
patents are what are called "irnprovement
patents", and there are competitive firms
manufacturing other equiprnent, s0 one coinpany lias not got a basic patent which gives
it the whole field and a strong monopoly.

DAIRY INDUSTRY BILL
MOTION FOR
DEBATE

SECOND READINGCONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
March 19, the adjourned debate on the motion
of Hon. Mr.-Euler for the second reading of
Bill B, an Act to amend the Dairy Industry
Act.
Hon. A. K. HIJGESSEN: Honourable senators, I do flot intend to take up much of the
time of the house in my remarks on the
second reading of this bill. When a similar
bill came before the Senate at the last session, I gave the reasons which led me to
support it. Those reasons still appear to me
to be valid. and there is no necessity for mne
to repeat them now. Moreover, during the
course of this debate a number of honour-

able senators 'have expressed arguments in
favour of this bill, and it is unnecessary for

SENATE

me to add to what they have said. Therefore,
should the matter come to a contested division on the second reading, I shall unquestioningly and unhesitatingly vote for the second
reading.
But I would say this: I hope, for reasons
which I shall advance in a few moments, that
it will not be necessary to go to a contested
vote on the second reading of this bill. If I
may say so, I think the honourable senator
from Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) in the
speech he made last week placed this bill in
its proper focus; and I must say that I agree
with practically everything he said in that
connection. He pointed out that the situation
has radically changed since we considered
the similar bill last session, and this bill by
itself is no longer an isolated piece of legislation; it is only part of a larger picture-a
very much larger picture-of the whole international trade relationships of Canada. As
the honourable senator remarked, a preparatory commission under the auspices of the
Economic and Social Council of the United
Nations sat in London, during the months of
October and November of last year, on the
broad general questions of trade and employment. That preparatory conference consisted
of representatives of more than twenty
nations, of which Canada was one. In fact,
Canada was represented at that conference by
a very strong delegation. On page 42 of the
report of this preparatory conference there
are listed the names of the Canadian delegation, which I shall take the liberty of reading to the house:
Mr. H. B. McKinnon, Chairman of the Tariff
Board;
Mr. D. Sim, Deputy Minister of Customs and
Excise;
Mr. L. E. Couillard, of the Department of
Trade and Commerce;
Mr. J. J. Deutsch, Director of Economic Relations, Department of Finance;
Mr. H. R. Kemp, Director of Commercial
Relations and Foreign Tariffs Division, Department of Trade and Commerce;
Mr. F. A. McGregor, Commissioner of Combines, Department of Justice;
Mr. S. D. Pierce, head of the Economic Division, Department of External Affairs.
That was a very strong delegation of some
of our most prominent civil servants.
The preparatory commission, with Canada
a participating party, prepared a draft of
an international trade convention which is
in the report of the proceedings and is to
form the subject of a further conference of
all the nations concerned, in Geneva, starting
next month.
With the permission of the house, I should
like to read again one of the articles of this

draft international convention which the
honourable senator from Queen's (Hon. Mr.
Sinclair) read last week. It is article 25:
Except as otherwise provided in this charter,
no prohibition or restriction, other than duties,
taxes, or other charges, whether made effective
through quotas, import licences or other
measures, shall be imposed or maintained by any
member on the importation of any market product of any other member or on the exportation
or sale for export, of any product destined for
any other member.
The reading of this draft article makes three
things clear, things which I think we can all
agree upon. The first is that the present prohibition upon the importation of margarine,
which this bill seeks to remove, conflicts with
the provisions of the draft article of the
charter. The second is that if, as we all hope,
this convention should be agreed to and
Canada should be a party to it, our government will be bound to ask 'parliament to db
just what this bill now seeks to do. The third,
and I think the most important point of all,
is this: the International Trade Convention,
if it is reached and if it is signed by the
member nations, will confer on our people as
a whole and on our farming community in
particular benefits that will far outweigh any
minor disadvantage which one part of the
farming industry-the dairy industry-might
suffer from the repeal of the prohibition on
margarine. I feel I can go a little further
than that and say that we can also agree
that it is and should be the policy of our
government to make every possible effort to
obtain such an international trade convention.
The reasons for this seem to me to be
obvious, and will appeal to every honourable
senator. We are a great trading nation. By
reason of the nature of our products, we
depend upon the markets of the world. We
produce a number of agricultural -products in
far greater quantities than we can possibly
hope to consume within our own borders. I
have seen estimates to the effect that the
proportion of our total working population,
which is engaged directly or indirectly in the
export trade, runs up as high as 30 per cent,
so that in our capacity as a great trading and
exporting nation, we are vitally interestedperhaps more interested than almost any other
country in the world-in removing the controls, the quotas, the prohibitions and the
excessive tariffs which throttle international
trade.
It is needless to remind honourable senators
of the condition of affairs which existed in the
dismal thirties of this century, a time when
the world was in a period of trade restrictions
run wild and gone mad; of the serious and
evil effects which that world condition had

vote against this bill today, and be obliged
to vote in favour of sometbing very similar
a few montbs hence.
There is a furtber censideration whieb
appeals to me, in view of the practical parliarnentary situation as it exists today. I tbink
it w~ould be a, pity should tbe S-enate give this
bill second and third readings and send it on
to the House of Gommons. We are aIl well
aware that at the moment that bouse is
abundantly occupied with pressing governmrent
legýislation and tbat it pro'bably will bo se
occupied until the end, of April, after which
it wilýl proceed to consider the budget. There
is very littie bope of the Gommons being able
te afford the time necessary te study this
legisiation for a long time to corne.
To sum. up that branch of what I amn now
attempting to say, I feel tbat the Senate shosild
kcep this bill bofore it, and should study it in
eonjunction with and as a part of the various
aspects of the preparatory commission 's report
and of the draft international trade convention. I therefore propose now to make a suggestion. It may bo considered a bold one;
neveithele.-s, I make it. I sugg'est to honourable scnators that they allow this bill to go
to second reading-on division, if you likeHon. Mr. HAIG: No, ne.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: No, no.
I-on. Mr. HUGESSEN: Do I hear objections?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is a straight "No."
Hon. Mr. HUTGESSEN: May I reply to my
friend iii the classical worde, "Strike, but bear
me."
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I will strike.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Let the bill be given
second reading w'ithout a recerded, vote. and
without any honourable senators being committcd as accepting or rejecting its principle;
thon send the bill te a standing committee,Hon. Mr. MORAUD: And there let it die.
lien. Mr. HUGESSE'N: -te hear evidence
and discuss net only tbis bill, but aise some
of the more general questions arising under
tbe proposed agreement.
I put, this question te my honeurable friend
the leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig): Cannot
the best services of the Sonate bo rendered
te the country at the presenit time in this way?
We may be-te use an extraerdinary expressien empleyed in the Ontario Legishature the
other day 'digi tally overpri- ileged"; but we

MARCH 26, 1947
have certain public duties te perforrn. One of
the responsibilities of this house has been very
successfulIy f'ulfilled by the consideration of
matters in its standing committees with a view
te the enlightenment of the public. 1 arn
thinking ef the work performed only last
sesion by the Special Conimittee on Inceme
Tax, the Special Cornrittee on Immigration
and the Standing Commîttee on Natural
Resources. I arn disposed to ask myseif
whether perhaps there is not an advantage
after ail in being "digitally overprivilegedi."
There are many cogent reasons why one of
our standing committees sheuld consider net
only this bill, but the draft trade agreemnent.
I think the country expects it of US.
Considerable public interest has been ardused
in this bill, but I arn free to say that perbaps
the public is flot as well informed as it ought to
lie. Personally, I should be glad indeed to
have the chance of hearing evidence befýre
one of our standing committees fromn people
who are interested, both supporte-rs and opponents of this bill. I should be pleased to hear
representatives of the dairy farmiers, give evidience as te the actual and prospective mnarket
of the dairy inciustry in butter. I should like
to hear also from consurners; and I should be
particularly interested in the opinion of the
OiLs and~Fats Adniinistrator as to whcther or
flot we might expeet to obtain supplies of fats
for the purpose, of rnanufacturing margarine
in this country. I should welcome an opportunity of liste'ning to evidence on a very interesting sidelight to this discussion-a point that
has been raised by one or two henourable
senators--as to whether in the future it will
lie possible for t.his country to produce on its
own farms vegetable oils that are neccasary in
the rnaking of oleomargarine.
1 do flot flatter myscîf, honourable, senators,
that after a comrnittce hadi studied this question and heard ail the evidence, one. single
opinion would lie changed or one vote altered;
but I do say that public opinion on this question would, be rnuch better inforrned than it
is today.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I promised to be
short, and, I have corne to, the end of my
observations. May I venture te summarize in
one sentence what I have very inadequately
atternpted ta say. Let us for the mornent forget
personal preferences, whether they lie for this
bill or against this bill, and let us do a good
job: first, of inforrning the public of the
country; and second, of supporting our goverement in its efforts to obtain an international
trade. agreement.

H'on, W. RUPERT DAVIES: Honourable
senators, I arn going to lie' brief. I intended
to discuas this proposed, amendment, te the
Dairy Industry Act, but since listening to the
honourable senator frorn Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) I arn afraid that I have not much
te say, #because the tangle of international
complications which hie more or less held over
our heads rather frightens me. If the government is of the opinion that the bill should be
withdrawn, or should not be votcd upon in
the. Senate, for fear it might interfere with
the position of thé Canadian delegates at the
international trade conference, we should have
a statement on the mattier fromn the acting
leader of the govcrnrnent in this house (Hon.
Mr. Copp). I do net know whether the hionourable senator frorn Inkerman is speaking for
the governentHon. Mr. HUGESSEN: No.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: -but I do agree with
rnany of the things hie has said. I rose to say
that I was geing te vote for the second read.ing,
because I want the bill te, be sent te a cernmittce se, that both aides of the question can
be threshed out and representatives of the
dairy industry, of consurners, of the Canadian
Legion, of the National Counicil of Womien.
and other bodies rnay orne ami, present their
views, and, give us an oppertunity te question
them. Ahl of us have received telegrarna
about this matter. The honourable senator
frorn Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdýock) read
thcm inte Han.sard. One was from Mr.
Thurston, the Secretary-Manager of the
Ontario Creameries Association, saying:
We vigorously protest proposai to legalize
oleornargarine in Canada, as a hlow at the
f armers in Ontarioe.
Now, I do net believe any honourable
senator wishes te deal a blow at the farmers
of Ontario. I arn sure there is net one who
does. Certainly I de net. Thie Teron-to heaxiquarters cf the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, on behaif of their. creai- producers, forwarded a protest in somewhat sirnilar terms.
On the other hand, the Kingston branch of
the Canadian Legion passed a resolution in
faveur of olcornargarine. And while I arn
trying te think of the interests of the farmers,
I have aIse to think of the interests of the
thousands of workers in the locomotive, aluminurn and nylon factories at Kingston, who
carry lunches put, up by their wives and who
tell me that with the present butter ration they
are having a difficuit tirne. Then I have te
think of the hundreds of thousands -of children
in this country who are net getting enougli
fats. Ahl these considerations make it <lifficult

216

SENATE

for one who wants to be fair, both to the consumer and to the dairy industry, to make up
his mind. That is why I would like to sec
the bill go to a eommittee.
I regret on this occasion that the rules of
this house, as I understand them, do not allow
a bill of this kind to go to a committee until
we have given it second reading. If I vote
for it, as I propose to do if it goes to a
recorded vote, I want to make for myself the
same reservation which the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) permitted
himself yesterday on the bill to amend the
Canadian Wheat Board Act. There, I shall
reserve to myself the right to change my vote
on the third reading if representatives of the
various interests are heard in committee and
I am persuaded that the measure is a blow
at the dairy farmers of this country, and that
it would be more serious to them than it
would be beneficial to the consumers. That is
exactly the position I am in this afternoon.
The manufacture and sale of margarine is
legal in the United States, in Great Britain,
and in practically every other country except
our own.
Another circumstance bas troubled me a
little. A very important official of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board whom I do not
propose to name, has given to a prominent
official of the National Dairy Council of Canada an opinion which is very much opposed to
the bill. Now, I think that the place for that
gentleman to express his views on a bill before
the Senate is before a committee of the Senate,
and not privately to one of the interests
which is dealing with this matter.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Would the honourable
senator read in the record the opinion of this
officer?
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I am quite willing to
read it. Do I have to give his name?
An lon. SENATOR: There is no need to
do so.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, yes.
lon. Mr. EULER: If the honourable senator is going to read it, he should give the
naine.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: It definitely expresses
opposition to oleomargarine. It was written
to the Executive Secretary of the National
Dairy Council, and was sent to a local
industry at Kingston and passed on to me.
It is from the Oils and Fats Administrator:
Fats and oils among the commodities in shortest world supply; supplies are approximately
half of screened import requirements. As a consequence, all importing countries are forced to
consumption levels of frorn seventy-five to ninety

per cent of tbeir pre-war which is scarcely indicative of today's needs by reason'of increases
iu population and industrial demand which is
far greater than the 1935/1939 period used for
comparison purposes.
Through

the International

Emergency

Food

Council, Canada has been allocated for the
calendar year 1947 an inport quota which
amounts to 78,000 metrie tons, whieh is insufficient to meet our needs without stringent controls and a domestie system of allocation to consuming industries. During 1946 we imported a
total of 80,000 metric tons and, with this allocation, we experienced considerable hardship in
maintaining consumption levels.
It is obvious that if margarine were manufactured in Canada, we must reduce production of
shortening whieh product is an essential raw
material for the baking, biscuit and allied
trades, and the varions food industries. Likewise, it would mean a probable reduction in the
availability of refined vegetable cils used for the
production of canned fish and canned foods of
various types. By reason of the shortage of lard
in Canada, any further reduction in the industrial supply of refined vegetable oils would have
a hardship effect on the industries concerned
with a resultant decrease in essential consumer
food commodities.
It has been argued that we should allow the
importation of margarine into Canada to relieve
the butter shortage. J would point out that
margarine, like other fats, is under allocatio1i
by the International Emergency Food Council,
and that any importation would have to be made
at the expense of our overall quota for ý1947.
It is my considered opinion that the supply of
fats and cils will remain below the 1935-1939
level for the next two to three years. Even
when parity with the aforementioned base period
is reached, supplies will continue to lag behind
demand by reason of population and living standard increases and the technological developments in the fats and eils field whith require
mcreased quantities for industrial usage.
For the year 1947 at least. there is no possibility whatsoever from a supply point of view of
making fats and oils available for margarine
manufacture without depriving existing industries of their minimum of supplies.
Hon. Mr. EULER: May I ask who wrote
that?
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: It was written by Mr.
F. H. Lehberg, Oils and Fats Administrator
of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board.
Honourable senators, those may be Mr.
Lehberg's views, but I should like to sec him
appear before a Senate committee so that
we could ask him a few questions, some of
which he may be able to answer easily. One
question which occurs to me is: if the oils
and fats are allocated by the International
Emergency Food Council, how does it happen
that oleomargarine is being sold in the United
States and Great Britain?
Hon. Mr. EULER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I.shall answer that. There
is a reason for it.

MARCH 26, 1947
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: The honourable senator
wilI have an opportunity to speak in a minute.
That is one of the things I sbould like to hear
aniswered. Ag I stated wben I got to rny feet,
I arn going to vote for this proposed amendment because I should like to sea it go to a
comrnittee. I should like to bear more about
it from various representatives 6o that I rnay
be able to corne to a more intelligent decision
than 1 feel able to at the present tirne.
Honourable senators, if by a recorded vote
this afternoon we might in some way tie the
hands of men who will represent us later, I
must confess my very grave doubt as to
whether we should have a recorded vote.
Hon. ANTOINE J. LEGER: Honourable
senators, I may say that I have neyer tasted
oleomargarine.
Hon. Mr.
something.

EULER:

You

have

missed

Hon. Mr. LEGEJI: I bave neyer aven sean
it. Therefore at the incaption of this debate
I had a free and open mind on the question.
I have listened to the arguments advanced,
and I must say that I have become convinced
that butter is a better substance, more palatable, more nutritive than, and in every way
preferable to, oleomargtrine. I have also
becorne convinced that were it not for the
alle ged shortage of butter at this particular
time, this bill would perbaps neyer have been
introduced. I have furtbar become persuaded
that the shortage of butter is not entirely the
fault of the dairv industry, but is, to a certain
extent, attributable to other factors, amongst
which government regulations and controls
could parhaps be included. I arn not ready
at this stage of our history te put anything
in the way of the rehabilitation of the dairy
industry; nor to condemn it for this shortage,
no more than I would condemn the lumbering
industry or the steel industry for the shortage
of materials to build bouses.
Like the senator fromn K-ennebec (Hon. Mr.
Vaillancourt), I do not believe that any ahnormal situation can 'be reniedied by the substitution of another abnormal situation. I
agree with bonourable senators who have
argued that the prosperity of Canada is linked,
to a great extent, to the prosperity of agriculture. If oleornargarine is allowed on our
market it will be difficuit to take it off; and
it is conce<kd, I think, that if it stays on the
market it will have the effect of depressing
butter prices. If that happens the farrning
industry will be detrimentally aff ected, and the
nation's econorny will suifer. Believing as I
do that the controls and regulations affecting
the dairy industry, like those affecting other

217

industries, will not be eternal, but that the
farmers and dairyrnen in their turn will soon
enioy somae of the liberty and freedorn vaunted
by the supporters of this bill, I arn not disposed to put anything in the way of the
farmere and the dairyrnen that may be considered a hindrance at this tirne. I shahl therefore vote against the principle of this bill.
Hon. J. J. DUFFUS: Honourable senators,
I listened to ail the speeches on this subi act
last year, as well as to ail those that have
been made in the present debate. I have concluded that there are several factors involved
in the question bafore us, and I propose to
analyse themn, and to ask a few questions and
offer sorne suggestions on.
My first question is: If and wban butter
is scarce and the price is sufficiently high to
becorne an econornic burden on people in the
lower incorne brackets, would oleornargarine
be a reasonably satisfactory substitute? I
admit it would. But, having regard to the
fact that the ingredients necessary for the
immediate production of oleomargarine are not
obtainable, would the passing of this bill at
the prescrit time ha of advantage to anyone?
I do not think it would be.
My next question is: Even if the fats, oils
and ot.her ingredients necessary for the production of oleomargarine could ha obtained
frorn other countries whose people are suifering infinitely more than we are, would. we be
justifie1 in salfishly appropriating that product
to our use? My answer to this lnst question
is that wa would, obviously not ha .iustified in
sO doing. 1 feel that it would be preposterous
te cause other people te becorne bungrier
than they now are. Considaring that point,
together witb the fact that oui' delegates are
now in London and about to proceed to the
international trade confarence at Geneva,
would we not be unwise to pass this bill at
tbis tirne?
I have the greatest respect and highest
esteern for my bonourable friand the proposer
and sponsor of this bill (Hon. Mr. Euler). He
is a gentleman noted for bis freedom of thought
and, speech. Ha bas bad a wide exparience
in helping te shape the destiny of this country,
and bas rendered- outstanding service to
Canada bath at borne and wbroad. He bas
been a memaber of parliament for thirty years,
havîng first 'bean e'lected to the other bouse
in 1917. Ha wau for soma years a member of
the governrnent of Canada, first as Minister
of National Revenue and later as Minister
of Trade and Commerce. He is a Privy
Councillor, and is now a valued member of
this Upper Bouse. I deem it a great privilage
te have been a colleague of bis in the House

218

SENATE

of Commons and 10 ho bis colleague now in
the Sonate. 1 am hoping that my bonourable
friend, possessing as be does such outstanding
abiiity and characteristirs, may in bis good
judgment see fit 10 withdraw the bill.
An bonourable senator speaking in the debate
last session said that ho bad nover in bis life
miiked a cow. I have not lacked that privilege.
On the contrary, I have bad a wide agricuitural
experience, in wbieb I take a reasona;bie amount
cf pardonable pride. 1 acquired the art of
inilking at an early ag.e. I was vory young
wben I lcarned to plough and to, do ail other
farm work.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: No boastingl
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: My bonourable friend
says "no boasting." May I say to bima that
that was a long lime ago, when men wore
whkers and womcn wore ciothes.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh!
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: At home we operated- a
farm of over five bundred acres, and from lime

It took upwards of a week to tbra'ib our grain
crops. and two days for clover lbrasbing. I
rnay say t0 my honourablo friend. from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies), that I am making
these stalements flot in any boastful sonse, but
rallier as evidence of my background in agriculture, t0 .iustify 'my speaking on Ibis
subi oct.
The most important basic îndustry in the
worid is agriculture. One reason why I am
flot supporting the bill is tbat in my judgment
any action on the part of Ibis bouse tending t0
disc-ourage and upset 10 any appreciable extent
the minds of those engaged in agriculture
bas aiways caused detrimental repercussions.
industry,
Any unrest adversely affecting
emploYers. labour or management would
directly or indiroctly increase the cost of
commodities, 10 the disadvantage of aIl concerned. During the debate on Ibis subjeot a
few days ago Ibere was criticism of the farmers
wbo sbip caIlle to the United States. Wby
sbould tbe farmers not take advantage of a
legitimate opportunity to make money, as
people in any other business would do? Moreover, Ibis oxport of caIlle is a 1)01001 means
towards keeping our dollar on a parity with
United States currency.
At prescrnt farmers are enjoving an incroasing
and profitable trade in the sbipping of highclass tborougbbred livestock to many other
countries. Some years ago if a farmer desired
te raise tlioruugbbred iiveslock ho bad tu

the cost of commodities so as to increase trade
ivith ail other nations willing to trade with us;
and at the same time she must reduce the cost
to the domnestic consumer.
In passing 1 wish to mention what migbt

tourist trade. It is becoming more and more
important t0 the weil-being of the people of
Canada. Precedence is taken over the tourist
trade by only the basic industries of mining.

Il is in order for me to comment on the

Provisions sucb as I bave mentioned would
encourage many families formerly engaged in
agriculture to return to the land, and would
also stimulate others 10 take up agriculture as
a life work. To my mmnd it would be difficult
t0 over-estimate the physical, mental, moral
and economic henefits of sucb a scheme te

thousands of people. Employment of this
type of agricultural help would assist in decentralizing mnany overcrowded centres, make
the workers more confident and more selfsupporting, and lessen in large measure the
possïbility cof another relief problem. And,
honourable senators, 1 do flot think we should
overlook the menace of the atomic bomb, and
the fact that many of our farmers and athers
living in the outlying district& would be in a
much safer position than the residents of
large cities.
I may be asked, how can ail this be
achieved? By immigration. The result would
be seen in more homes, more and more agriculture, more prosperity and happiness. I
realize that thousands of unused farms would
need to be rehabilitated by the use of fertilizers, and millions of acres would need to be
irrigated. I submit all this would eventually
pay handsome dividends.
I am wbolly in favour of satisfactory immigration to this country. I exclude from that
deecription immigrants whose main intention
is to use this country as a back door to the
United States. Too many immigrants of that
type have been admîtted to Canada in the
past The problemn would be eeonomically
solved by bringing to this land of plenty
wholly desirable and capable agriculturalists
and others accustomed to outdoor life, from
wherever they may corne. What more desirab-1e young men could we find than those w.ho
came here and were trained as pilots and
mechanies? Let us concentrate on attracting
young iellows of this type, who would be
happy to corne and would be a wonderful
asset to this great dominion.
Bring to this great and glorious country the
type of immigrant I have recommended.
Extend to thece a hearty welcome. Give
them the hand of fellowship, kindly direction,
expert advice, and reasonabole governmental
assistance. Bring them here, not in the
thousands or tens of thousands, but hy the
hundreds of thousands, by a systematic
arrangement; so many tbousands annually,
and on a five-year basis, to occupy the
wide-open spaces. This wauld eventually add
millions ta the population of aur countrywhich to my mind is one objective that we
must give attention to in the days ta come.
It would bring ta this land of plenty such
prosperity as bas not obtained for many
decedes. Increased population would resuit
in decreasing the per capita debt of Canada,
and would assist rnaterially ini reducing the
obligations caused by two global wars in the
past thirty years.

219

Honourable senators, witb such a programme
and the recommendatians 1 have suggested,
there would be no shortage of butter in this
country. There wauld be no need for offering
undesirable substitutes ta the Canadian
people, who are entitled ta the best in the
world, and who, even at the present time, are
the best fed and the most prosp-erous people
anywhere.
I off er these suggestions with a view ta
xmpraving conditions in agriculture and for
the extension of aur trade with all cauntries
in the world.
Han. FELIX P. QUINN: Honourable senators, I do not propose ta take up much time
in dealing with the bill bef are us. We have
listened ta four very elightening speeches in
the debate today. I was much impressed with
the submission of the honourable senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen). He has
thrown. new light on the matter, and, like the
honourable member from Kingston (Hon. Mr.
Davies), 1 have been converted ta hie idea
that this bill should nat be dealt with too
hastily, but rather that it should be sent ta a
cammittee. There we could have before us
representatives of the daîrying industry of the
country wba are so bitterly opposed ta the
bilI-aIthough
their opposition bas not
impresscd me-and other witnesses, including
the Oils and Fats Administrator. I may say
in passing that I feel, as does the honourable
member from Kingston, that the Administrator had no right ta express his opinion on
this bill elsewhere, 'but that he should put
forward his views before a Senate committee.
By the time these *witnesses have concluded
their statements pro and con we may be in
a better position ta arrive at a decision.
I feel that what the honourable member from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) said witb
regard ta the recammendatian of aur international trade commission shouhd receive every
consideration.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: They did nat recommend
anything. It was, I think, an American suggestion.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: In which the Canadian
representatives cancurred.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: It was the unanimous report of the Preparatory Commission,
based upon tbe original draft submitted by the
United States.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Therefore aur Canadian
repreeentatives must have concurred in it.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Oh, yesl.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. QUINN: I amn convinced that the
contention of representatives of the dairy
industry that the lifting of the ban on the
import, manufacture and sale of oleumargarine
would affect their industry is right. That is
borne out by figures supplied by the Bureau
of Statisties and which have already been
placed on record by the honourable member
frorn Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert). We find
in that submission a comparison of the production of inilk and dairy pruduets in the
years 1920 to 1946.
The total milk production in 1920 was
10,976 million pounds. In 1946 it was 16,937
million pounds. Honourable senators, where
bas that milk production gone? In the first
place, we find fiuid sales of milk increased
from 1,565 million pounds in 1920 to 4,254
million pouinds in 1946. There was flot much
increaso in the quantity consumed on farms.
Under the heading of "Creamery butter" there
is disclosed an increase of fromn 111,692,000
pounds in 1920 to 271,366,000 pounds in 1946.
The "factory cheese" production showed littie
change. Production of evaporated whoie milk
increased fromn 30,470,000 pounds in 1920 to
191,431.000 pounids in 1946.
There ývas a
sliit dccrease shown in the production of
condensed whole milk. The figures for the
production of whioie milk powder are 7,575,000
pounds in 1920 to 15,656,000 pounds in 1946.
The incrca,,e in the production of skirn milk
powder was fromn 5.749.000 pounds in 1921
to 40,900,000 pounds in 1946. Casein, a product which is now largely used and which
involx-es the uýe of large quantities of milk,
bas increased from 110,000 pounds in 1920 to
4,168.000 poundý in 1946. The production of
ice cream inci'eased from 2,996,514 gallons in
1920 to 15.835.668 gallons in 1946.
These figures show that there is a market
for ail the milk that can ho used by the dairy
producers of this country. The demand for
these produets is increasing ail the time and
tberefore 1 maintain that the dairy industry
has nothing at ail to fear from oleomargarine.
Like the member froma L'Acadie (Hon. Mr.
Leger), I have neyer corne in contact with
oleomargarine and do not know what it is
like. If I bad a choice, I should neyer change
my preference for good old butter.
Coming back to the dairy producers' argument honourable senators will recaîl the old
saying "You cannot have yoiir cake and eat
Hon. Mr. EULER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Sufficient milk cannot
be pruduced tu satisfy the demands of not
only the butter and milk consumers but al
other consumers of this country who are

using up the milk supply. I have no fear
whatever that the dairy industry would be
affected in any way, shape or forma by
passage of this bill. If 1 thought it would
harmn the industry I would neyer support the
bill, but until this can be shown I arn
"from Missouri". I arn still of the opinion
that this bill should be supported, and I
shall give it my vote.
H on. J. P. MOLLOY: Honurable senators,
T
a few minutes ago 1 had nu intention of speaking on this matter at the prescrnt time, as I was
of the opinion that the dobate was likely to be
carried ov er until after the recess. However,
I nuw intend to sav a few words. So far as
thc p)eople in rny province are conceraed, there
bas neot heen une single sound, argument
offcred in opposition tu the proposai that this
cuuntry ho ailuwcd to manufacture, offer for
sale, or import oleomargarine. Thero bas been
nu roc1 argument un this. and I defy any
huonourable member of this bouse to corne
forward and say why a free man in & free
countrY cannot produce. sell or import any
-whuile>-ome *article that hie wisbes tu at any
time.
I amn going to ho vcry brief. Tbe wbolýe
inatter boils duwn to what was sai(i in the first
ad(ilre-,s I ext r heard as a schoolboy. It was
deliv creti in thie town of Emnerson. Manitoba,
hy a prurninent iawycr who latur became a,
good judge in tbiat prov ince. Tt concerned the
case of a rCceiver wvho forcibiy ejected a
teach er from une of the town scbools. Court
actien w-as subscquentiy taken against the
ree( iver. andl a great deai of evidence was
given. The principie evidence on behaif of
the reecixor xvas givon by the town constable,
wxho had be(n appoinited hY the receiver. The
lawyer for the plaintiff said that a bcd witness
was a bcd thing, a. guud witness was a goud
thing. but too good a witness was a very bcd
thing. In his aiddress to the court hoe said:
'I arn rcrninded. of my experienco when I sat
in the iegi.iatix e halls in the province of

Ottawa.
I have heard the opposition hring

point in regard to the matter under discussion;
but"-tu use bis uw n language-"it was of

the brute matjority."
Honourabie senators, we bave been told
fromn the very. day this bill was introduced that

told it was a waste of time.

MARCH 26, 1947
There is another point whicb influences my
vote on this matter. Fifty-tree years ago this
coming fai in the town of Emerson I heard
for the first time the then leader of, the
Liheral party, Sir Wilfrid Laurier. I can stiti
recall bis eloquence as be stood on the platform, during a meeting which was described
by Mr. Fisher as perbaps the best meeting they
had addressed in Manitoba. At that time the
tariff question was the issue. Allow me'to put
it this way: the burning issue in Western
Canada was the question of coal oit. Arnong
otber things in his address Sir Wilfrid Laurier
referred to coal oit. He said that in bis tour of
Western Canada he had met thousands of
Conservatives, but no protectionists. He asked,
"Who is the man who will dare stand up in the
light of this oil'"-I arn quoting bis exact
word»-"-ýWho is the man wbo will dare stand
up in tbe Iigbt of this oit, taxed at 100 per
cent, and declare for protection?" The people
would stare at him as at a phenomenon, a
monstrosity, or a freak of nature.
I arn not only a Liberat, but I arn a freetrader. I repeat that it is unjuat and unfair
to give 100 per cent protection to any industry, wbether it be dairying, textiles or the
For that
agricuttural industry generally.
reason, more than any other, 1 wiit not, so far
as I arn able, aliow any organization or industry to force its product upon tbe people at its
own price and under conditions laid down by
it.
If any industry bas been pamapered by the
government, at least during tbe war years, it
bas been agriculture. Sir John A. Macdonatd
is credited witb having said, though I cannot
voucb for it, tbat the farmer was a man who
neyer asked for anytbing, and neyer got anything. But today he asks for everytbing and
gets everytbing, including 100 per cent protection in tbe dairy industry. We pay the
farmer to summer-faltow his land., to crop bis
tand, and to take it out of production. The
Iatest suggestion is that 'we are to give bim
.U an acre to grow bartey.
Hon. Mr. HAIG. No.
Hon: Mr. MOLLOY: I hope, in the interests
of tbe taxpayer, that the Minister of Agriculture and lis associates wilt see to it tbat,
if sucb legislation does go tbrougb, only firstetass land is used for tbat purpose.
I amn going to vote for this bill in the
interests of tbe majority of the people of tbis
country. Tbe bitl would' not antagonize anybody. One bonourable member asked only this
afternoon: Wbat will happen to the farmer if
oteomargarine, is atlowed to be manufactured
bere? Welt, every other country in the world
is manufacturing it.. Wbat does tbe farmer

-221

in tbosýe countries do? He carnies on bis dairy
industry, as be did. fifty or a bundred years
ago. The present set-up in Canada is unfair
to the average man. Tbose engaged in the
dairy industry cannot supply in part wbat ia
dernanded, yet tbey want to dictate that no
produet shahl be altowed to compete with
butter. The producers say, "Give us one bun<fred per cent protection." This reatly means
one tbousand per cent protection, because
tbere is nobody bere to compete with tbern.
In 1041, 541,000 farmers were selting milk;
but only 46,000 of tbose received 50 per cent
of tbeir income from dairy produets. Why
sboutd we cater to 46,000 dairy owners as
against tbe far greater number of people in
otber brancbes of farming? As tbe bonourable
senator from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies)
pointed out today, sucb procedure is againat
the very cbitdren of this country, wbo cannot
get enougb butter and- are unab-le to cdbtain
oleomargarine.
I intend to vote for tbis bitl, in the inter,est of tbe consumera of tbis country. May I
say tbat if tbe largest ctass in tbe country, tbe
consumnera, constituted a party, no time at
ait woutd be required to consider and pass tbis
bitl.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable senators, white tistening te the previous speaker
(Hon. Mr. Mottoy) it occurred to me. that
sornetiines we reach tbe sarne conclusion by a
different tine of reasoning. I do - not agree
witb the reasoning of rny honourable friend,
but I propose to vote for tbe bitt. I voted for
iAat the lest session and gave rny reasons, but
sO much has been said since then tbat I
thought perhaps I shoutd restate somne of
them.
If there was not a shortage of butter tbe
mover of this bill woukt neyer bave introduced
the measure into tbe bouse. I do not think
anyone will dieny tbat a butter shortage exista;
one onty needis to go to the Partiamentary
Restaurant to r.ealize it. I propose ýto vote for
the bill because it is a matter of justice, to
many people who are unable to get butter
or a suitabte substitute. It bas been argued
by a great many people that it bs impossible
to get fats and oils; yet the bonourable senator from Watertoo (Hon. Mr. Euler) bas
totd us that it is offered freely for sale in the
United States. That being so, why can it
no t be brought in here if the prohibition
against its importation is tifted? If it is not
possible to get the ingredients, we are wasting
our time worrying about what is going to
bappen to the d'airy industry. If tbe passage
of the bilt witl have no effeet, it cannot harm
tbe dairy industry.

222

SENATE

Some may wonder why I should vote for the
bill, coming as I do from the county of Bruce,
which produces more cattle than any other
county in Ontario. The cattle business is not
entirely a question of butter or dairy products. There are three or four brecds of dairy
cattle-the Jersey, the Holstein, the Ayrshire.
People who are in the dairy business keep
cattle of a dairy type. It is difficult at the
present time, as has been said, to get labour.
The young men who worked in war industries
got big pay and short hours; they saw the
bright lights, and are not now satisfied to
come back to the farm. The dairy industry
is a seven-day-a-week job-fourteen mornings
and evenings. Young people are not satisfied
to go back to that arduous work, but if they
wish to go into the raising of beef cattle they
can very soon change over to the shorthorns,
the Hereford or the Black Angus. I do a little
beef cattle raising myself, and I know that one
can make a bit more money on beef than
dairy cattle. Less help is required to look
after beef cattle. One man living close to me
has a hundred head of beef cattle. They run
loose in pens, as they do at the market, and
the pens can be cleaned out by the use of a
wagon or spreader. On a Sunday it takes
only an hour to throw in sufficient feed for the
stock.
I am not anxious that dairy people go out
of the business, but with the shortage of labour
I do feel there is every reason why more and
more farmers will go out of it. I do not sec
much prospect of any increase in butter production. One honourable member has said
that there is ample sale for m'ilk and milk
products.
The problem of labour has political implications, but my views on it are not of a partisan
nature. I think one of the troubles concerning labour in this country is that parliaments
under both parties for the past two or three
generations have passed too much paternal
legislation. When I was young one realized
that when he went out into the world he
would make good or go under. Today the
young man does not look at it that way. He
says: "Why should I worry? The political
parties are tumbling over one another to give
me an old age pension and children's bonuses,
and to provide for me in every way. I do not
need to care. Why should I go out and milk
cows on Sunday morning and evening?" The
question of labour is the real difficulty in the
dairy industry.
I have made a few remarks in justification
of my stand in support of this bill.

Hon. NORMAN McL. PATERSON: Honourable senators, I am going to say a few
words. If for no other reason than the one
mentioned by the honourable member from St.
Boniface (Hon. Mr. Howden), I would be in
favour of this bill. He mentioned that he had
been home and had not had butter for eight
days.
Three days ago, on leaving this
chamber, I was told by the constable at the
door that he had received that day a letter
from his daughter in Sudbury stating that for
more than ten days she had had no butter.
The other morning we received a letter from
a relative of mine in England in which she
mentioned that she was better off than we
were, that she had not only butter but three
ounces of oleomargarine a week. That is in
England. These reasons are enough to convince one, after listening to the discussion last
year. We were told, the last time we debated
the matter, that the butter shortage was only
temporary. Every indication is that it is not
a temporary shortage, and that we are worse
off this year than we were last year. For
that reason I am in favour of this bill.
Hon. CAIRINE R. WILSON: Honourable
senators, I did not expect to say anything, but
I confess I am more and more puzzled as to
why such a very small fraction of our agricultural community should be in need of a
monopoly. I listened with great interest to
the honourable senator from South Bruce
(Hon. Mr. Donnelly). I happen to have a
son-in-law who owns a dairy farm, and I can
appreciate the long hours which those who
tend cattle have to work. But I, also, should
like very much to hear more on the question.
Frankly, I am puzzled by the statement of
the Oils and Fats Administrator, for I happened to meet at lunch today a friend who has
just returned from the United States and who
told me, with great satisfaction, "I got without
the slightest difficulty two pails of Crisco".
Those of us who are trying to cook realize that
we in Canada have not any supply of shortening, let alone butter. For this reason I cannot
understand why, if there is an even distribution of oils and fats, there should be so much
more shortening as well as margarine across
the line. I believe that our dairymen will
always have a market for every ounce of milk
they can produce. For that reason I support
the proposal of the honourable senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen).
Hon. W. J. HUSHION: Honourable senators, I wish to say a word or two before
this debate is closed.
Coming from a
large centre, I probably have a different

MARCH 26, 1947
point of view fromi that of most honourable senators who live ln the West and
other country sections.
When a similar bill was brought in last year
I voted against it. Since then 1 have made
some effort to sound out public opinion
through people whom I have met in Montreal,
many of the ladies' organizations, a few labour
organizations, and others, and I have nlot met
one who had, a word to say against oleomargarine. On the contrary, they would welcome
it, especially since the nutritive value of oleomargarine is about equal te that of butter.
Also I have been informed from one of the
laboratories that the fats and other ingredients
of oleomargarine make it a very good substitute for butter.
Sonie honourable senators seem ta fear an
unfavourable reaction from the dairy farmers
of the country because the bill seeks ta promote the manufacture of oleomargarine in
Canada for Canadians. The main object is
to have it available for our own use, not
to expert it. An honourable senator says it
cannot be manufactured here. Weil, if that
cannot be done it will nat be done. Another
honourable senator has suggested that it
would be a shame to take fats from European
countries. 1 agree that what fats they have
they are entitled to keep. I would draw to
the attention of honourable senators that
some farmers ln this country have been
smart enough ta grow quantities of linseed
for oil, and have done very well at it. This
is a commodity which would be a very good
basis or ingredient of oleomargarine.
There bas been much talk about the dairy
farmers. Weil, I have a great respect for the
farmers, as much indeed as has anyone here;
but the farmers are not the only people in
thîs country. Labouring men and other
classes of workers are entitled to be considered.
We in this chamber hear a great deal about
"the farmer" this and "the farmer" that,
but we seldom hear a word on behaîf of the
poor man who la struggling to maintain his
family and keep his home together on an
income of $1,500 to 82,000. The farmer does
not need an exaggerated amaunt of sympathy,
and I do not believe he is looking for it.
Probably the co-operatives are responsîble for
a good deal of the opposition ta this proposai;
and incidentally, 1 have noticed a report that
some investigation is proposed of certain cooperative movements-whether or not it is
suggested that they are making too much
money, 1 do not know. Honaurable senators
may laugh, but 1 contend that men who have
to work bard for a living deserve some consideration in this matter. If they cannot
afford to pay 46 cents a pound for butter

223

they could probably pay 30 cents for margarine, and they should have the right to
do so. I do not believe that the argument
about protecting the farmer is anything more
than a pretext.
A few days ago a prominent women's
organization was making representations here
to the effect that its menibers are worried
about the danger of cbildren not being able to
get enough milk. The measure we are considering should not burt the dairy business.
1 notice that more than $200,000 is being
expended for a check on production and distribution of milk in Ontario. IJnder these circumstances, wby worry about the consequence&
of permitting the use of oleomargarine?
While I have been greatly interested in the
discussion of this subi ect I tbink that, through
the linking of it with world issues, it has
covered too wide a range. Is it suggested that
we must go to Geneva to get permission to
make oleomargarine in Canada for Canadian
consumption? I agree with what was said
recently by a gentleman in the other place:
"Neyer mind what they do in England or in
various part of Europe. Let us attend to our
own business." We do not have to ask anybody 's permission to do that. To me it seems
a lame argument to assert that the introduction of margarine migbt have damaging effects
on a conference in London or Geneva. To
me that is no argument at ail.
Let me repeat, honourable senators, as one
who bas lived ail his life la a tbîckly populated district, and bas seen as mucb hardship
as any bonourable senator here, that to my
mind those who oppose the use of margarine
are acting unfairly and taking too narraw a
view of the needs of the country. If aIeamargarine will fill the shortage caused by lack
of butter, and- if it bas the nutritive value
whieh we are told it has, wby sbauld we not
use it?
For these reasons, honourable senators, 1 arn
supporting the bll, and I hope that it will
pass.
DUPUIS: Honourable
Hon. VINCENT
senators, I am sorry, but I shahl have to put
your patience to test for a few moments. I arn
opposed to tbis 'bill and I want to say why. It
18 because the înteresting speeches that have
been made la favour of the bill put alI honourable members of this bouse in a false
position. Accord.lng to their contentions we
have not been reasonable and we are shown
to be against tbe poorer people of the country
who want ta have something ta put an their
'bread. My honoura:ble friend from Victoria:
(Hon. Mr. Husbion) appealed to the sentiment of bis colleagues with aIl bis babitual

224

SENATE

qualifications. But there is something more
than sentiment and emotion ta be consjdered
in debating legisiation of this kind.
I think we are rnispiacing the question. If
yon will ailow me, honourabie gentlemen, I
should like to answer rny honourable friend
from Victoria. It is true that in some quarters
of this country we might be short of butter,
but a high and well-informed officiai of the
Dcpartment of Agriculture has told us that
ex-en if this ]egisiation were passed we wouid
flot have the ingredients ta make oleomargarine.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: What harm would it
do?
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: It has been said and
nobody denied that.
Han. Mr.
strenuously?

LACASSE: Why oppose it s0

Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: It has been said that the
purpose in apposing tbis 'bill is ta pratect the
farmers. That is not the point at ail. The
main reason why I amn apposed to this bill is
that 1 prefer reai butter ta a substitute like
oleomargarine.
Hon. Mr. EULER: You would not have ta
accept the subostitute.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: It is ail riglit for my
honourable friend ta say that, but 1 am thinkiog of the pcople of this country wharn it is
aur duty ta pratect. The honourable senator
(Hon. Mr. Euler) says, "You would flot need
ta accept the substitute." That is cxactiy the
point. It is very wcil ta say that. but 1 arn
duty-bound ta protcct the citizens of this
country against the falsification that will resuit
if this bill werc passed. Oleomargarine would
be soid, as butter on evcry markct of this
country, and the people wouid be abused as
they were during the last war. I know sornething about the last war.
Hou. Mr. HUSHION: May I suggest ta the
honourable senator that oleornargarine cannot
be handied in that manner any mare, bccüause
it is now contained in seaicd, packages which
are marked "Oleomargarine."
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: The oleamargarine
caver wili be strippcd off and another caver put
on, as is done in the case of some other foods.
Whiat about the Food and Drugs Act? My
honourable colleague from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen), a distinguished ]awyer, knows
very weil that laws are as freeily vioiated, in
this country as in any other country of the
worid. 1 say again that we are mispiacing
the question.
My good and distinguished
friend from Inkerman said that we should not

interfere with the great project of international
trade. Are we not ta interfere, ta, prevent this
country from being fooied with faise produets? This is a frce country. We shahl be
iauded for having prevented this bill from
going through this bouse.
I am a Liberai, but I arn not liberal enough
ta swallow everything that is donce by rny
party. I believe the Liberal party made a mistake for somýe time in subsidizing ta too great
an extent dairy produets like fluid milk and
cheese. Those products were subsidized during the war sa tbat they couid be sent overseas ta hip aur soidiers and allies. I was 100
per cent for that, but the ivar is aver and we
have no reason in the worid now ta subsidize
fjuid miik. But if butter is not produced in
sufficient quantity today, why should we not
subsidize its production for national cansumption?
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: Was the purpose of
subsidice not ta reduce costs for thc people in
the low incarne brackcts?
Hon. Mr. IDUPUIS: That is one of the
purposes. Another was ta encourage production, I arn sure that if the farmers were
encouraged ta increase the manufacture of
butter it would not take a month before we
had a sufficient quantîty.
I have tnt the statistics, but I amn canvineed
that we are exporting a large quantity of butter ovcrseas.
If, as is contended by those
who are in favour of this bill, oleomargarine
were just as good as butter, oleomargarine
would bc made and manufactured in Engiand,
France, Beigium and other European countries. Why do they not manufacture it?
Hon. Mr. EULER: They do.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Why do they not
manufacture it in larger quantities? I wili
answer my own question, honourable senators.
It is because people with common sense know
very w<eii that butter is 100 per cent better
than oleornargarine. That is why other countries want ta import aur butter. Notwithstanding the contention of some chemists who
dlaim that oleomargarine is just as good as
butter, nobody in the worid wili convince me
that butter does not contain more vitamins
than oleornargarine.
My honourabie friend
from. St. Albert (Hon. Mr. Biais) is a good
doctor and I shahl leave the answer ta hin.
Honourable senators, when I rose ta say
a word it was only ta give reasons why I amn
against the bill.
Surne Hon. SENATORS:

Question!

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I bcg to adjourn the

MARCH 26, 1947
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Let us get through with
this now.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, now
that we are discussing this matter can we not
go on tonight and complete the debate? We
should like to clear the order paper before the
end of the week.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I am not prepared to
go on tonight, although I do not want to
leave the house with the impression that the
arguments advanced this afternoon are
unanswerable. I think we should have an
opportunity of studying those formidable
arguments before replying.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I only suggest to the
honourable senator that, if we could carry on,
we could clear the order paper this week.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Honourable senators
will remember that last session a debate
was adjourned for three months. I am just
asking for an adjournment of twenty-four
hours.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Did my honourable
friend say the debate was adjourned for three
months last year?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I did not mean the
debate on this issue. I meant a debate
on another matter.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD BILL
MOTION

FOR

SECOND
READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Copp for the second reading of Bill 23, an act
to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act,
1935.
Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL: Honourable senators, I hesitate to enter into a discussion of
the merits of this bill, particularly in the light
of some remarks previously made. If I have
not had experience in the agricultural industry
to justify the remarks which I make, I trust
honourable senators will bear with me and
excuse my ignorance in anything I may say
as to the merits or demerits of the proposed
legislation.
I should like first to associate myself with
the honourable member from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden), who spoke yesterday in this
debate, and to point out that I propose to
vote in favour of second reading because I
feel that there are many questions which I
83168-15

225

should like to ask the officials when they
appear before the committee to which the bill
will be referred. Also, there are aspects of the
bill to which I wish to give further consideration.
I assume that the bill has been introduced
for the benefit of the wheat farmers of Western
Canada, and that it is in the general interest
of the dominion at large. It has government
sponsorship, and I do not at all question the
policy as being one which the government
considers to be in the best interests of the
agricultural industry and the country at large.
But I feel that we should realize the nature
of the legislation.
We hear a good deal today about free enterprise, socialism and other isms and controls.
It bas been the announced policy of the government to remove all controls as fast as can
reasonably be done without interfering with
the general economy of the country. We must
appreciate that today the world is labouring
under extremely abnormal conditions. The
Dominion of Canada and the United States
have the most ideal conditions, and the
peoples of these two countries are enjoying
life more than any other nation. Bearing
that in mind, I do not think we should
confine ourselves to the effect that such
legislation may have upon Canada alone.
It is tlhe duty of the countries that have,
to share with those who have not.
Speaking in this chamber a couple of years
or se ago I made a statement which I should
now like to repeat in substance, if not in
words. It was to the effect that we were
approaching the time when the allies would
defeat a common enemy, and I expressed the
hope that after that enemy was defeated the
allied cause would not disintegrate and fall
apart; that we would realize there was a
greater enemy to fight-the enemy of poverty.
Today Canada, the United States and other
countries allied with her during the war, can
see poverty on every hand. It is our duty to
produce all we can to help to feed the people
of the United Kingdom, Europe and the
countries which need food so badly. I feel
that ultimately we must reach the position
where the great agricultural producing and
exporting countries will be able to enter into
an international agreement by which surplus
food stocks, required by other countries unable
to produce to meet their needs, will be distributed to them.
I make these preliminary statements because
the question is now being faced at an international meeting in London, where an effort is
being made to reach an agreement with
respect to the price of wheat.

REVISED
EDITION

226

SENATE

With the consent of honourable senators
I should like to put on record part of an
editorial which appeared in this morning's
edition of the Ottawa Citizen. It reads:
A leading article in The Times of London
recently outlined the specific objectives proposed
for the Wheat Council. They are, it says, prices
"fair" alike to consumers and producers; supplies "adequate" at all times for world consumption at "reasonable" prices; "adequate"
stocks against all ceontingencies; the avoidance
of "burdensome surpluses"; "security for efficient producers," but "increased opportunities"
for sources which can supply wheat "most effectively"; replacement of wheat-growing on unsuitable land by the cultivation of more appropriate products; and the promotion of wheat
consumption, "paying attention particularly to
the nutritional programmes of signatory governments."
I suggest to honourable members that a
great deal depends upon the outcome of the
conference taking place in London; and in
considering this proposed legislation we should
bear in mind that that conference in due
course will reach a decision which may be
in direct conflict with the provisions of this
If agreement is net reached this year
bill.
it may be reached at a subsequent period
before the legislation now proposed terminates
under the provisions of the bill. I feel that
the matter should be considered in committee,
and some evidence should be adduced to show
what would be the effect of an agreement
entered into at London upon the bill now
before us; and if an agreement is concluded
in London for a world price, whether this
proposed legislation would not have to be
amended.
The nature of this legislation, I am sure,
troubles all honourable members of this fiouse,
and it no doubt presented problems to members of another place. One must realize that
its provisions amount to nationalization of
the grain trade of Canada. One hears the
argument that the nationalization of the
grain trade of this country is in the best
interests of the agricultural industry as a
whole. On the other hand we hear statements
by agricultural representatives that the legislation is net satisfactory te the grain-growing
farmers of the West.
I do net propose to express my own opinion,
because I do net know enough about the subject; it is impossible for me to reach any
decision with respect to it. But I would point
out that the nature of this legislation means
that the grain trade of this country is to be
nationalized, that we are to have the continuance of controls and the regimentation which
follow the nationalization of any such industry.
Private enterprise is to be eliminated, and the
freedom of the individual engaged in the production and merchandising of wheat inter-

fered with. It also means, I submit, the
destruction of the facilities which have been
used during past years for the marketing of
grain. The grain trade of this and other
countries has been a highly specialized business. From time to time it bas been subjected
to investigation and inquiry by royal commissions and other tribunals. I submit that we
in Canada still believe in free enterprise, yet
we are nationalizing the grain trade at the
same time that, in the great country to the
south there continues freedoni of trade and
a system of merchandising carried out through
the channels which were formerly used in this
country. What effect this may have upon
our ability to sell our grain at large in the
future is very difficult to sec.
In passing this legislation we shall vest in
the Canadian Wheat Board the power of
merchandising wheat, net only domestically
but throughout the world, on a competitive
market in which at all times there has been
the keenest competition. I do net believe
that this board is any more capable of foreseeing the future trend of prices of wheat than
is any honourable member of this chamber.
Anyone who bas ever had anything to do with
the grain business realizes that it is impossible
to foresee the trend of grain prices, because
it is affected so seriously by weather, the crops
from other countries, and surplus stocks which
are available for expert from one place to
another. We must realize that what is being
done by this legislation is te put in the bands
of a board responsible te the minister the
entire problem of buying and selling wheat
for domestic and export purposes.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: It is more than
that. It is for the purpose of benefiting the
farmers, if possible. Is not that an object of
the bill?
lon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I answered the
honourable senator's question when I said that
I assumed that the purpose of the bill was for
the benefit of the farmers, and I suppose that
it is considered to be in the best interests of
the farners that such a board should have
very wide powers. But if that is so, let it be
noted that we are setting up a board with these
extraordinary powers to continue in force
irrespective of what may happen to the wlcat
agreements with the United Kingdom, and
that, irrespective of the provisions of the
agreements, the board is enabled to function
until 1950.
I think there bas been some doubt as to the
meaning of these agreements, and possibly as
to the real purpose of this legislation. If we
are to accept the preamble as indicating the
purposes of the legislation, it simply means

MARCU 26, 1947
that the intention is to, continue in force until
the end of the present crop year, regulations
nmade under the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act ta provide for the carrying
out of the sale and delivery of wheat by the
Government of Canada to, the United Kingdom. If we turn to the provisions of the
agreement, which is contained in Treaty Series
1946, No. 30, we find that there is a firn agreement to seli certain specified quantities of
wheat at prices etipulated to be: $1.55, for
the crop year 1946-47; $1.55, for the crop year
1947-48; not less than $1.25, in respect of
wheat bought and sold in the erop year 194849; and not less than $1 for wheat bought
and sold in the crop year 1949-50. But the
clause which warrants some consideration is
sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 2 of the
treaty, which I should like ta put on Hansard:
The actual prices to be paid for wheat ta be
bought and sold within the crop year 1948-49
shall be negotiated and settled between the
United Kingdom government and the Canadian
government flot later than the 3lst December,
1947, and prices for wheat to be bought and sold
within the crop year 1949-50 shall be niegotiated
and settled flot; later than the 31st December,
1948. In determining the prices for these two
crop years, 1948-49 and 1949-50, the United
Kýingdom government wiIl have regard to any
differeoce hetween the prices paid under this
agreement in the 1946-47 andi 1947-48 crop years
and the world prices for wheat in the 1946-47
and 1947-48 crop years.
If I interpret correctly the provisions of that
agreement, we have a firm contract for the
sale of grain for the crop years 1946-47 and
1947-48 at $1.55 per bushel. But it is pravided
in this agreement that before December 31 of
this year, 1947, the governments of the United
Kingdom and Canada must settle the price
at which wheat will be delivered for the subsequent crop year 1948-49. 1 submait that at that
period the contract will be completely open.
Assuming that as of December 31 of this year
the world price of wheat is, for example, $2.50
per bushel, or anything over $1.25, the abvious
intention of the agreement is that the United
Kingdom governmeit should pay not only a
reasonable pïice, to be negotiated at that time,
which I submait should be something approaching the world price, but in addition thereto,
something ta compensate for the low price
that bas been paid to date, in view of the fact
that the world price bas gone to over $3 a
bushel.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: May I ask the
honourable senator a question? Tbat is over
and above the $1.25 minimum speeified ini the
contract.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Yen.

Hon. Mn. HORNER: Have the words "have
regard" and so on anýy legal meaning, or do
they merely signify that there will be a~
"thank you" for past services?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I always felt that
the words in any agreement meant something.
I shahl answer the honourable senator from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner), by saying
that those words cannot bind the United
Kingdoma Government. That is what disturbs
me, that we are asked to pass legislation which
is gaing to carry on until 1950 although, as a
matter of fact, these agreements may be terminated by reason of an agreement having
been reacbed at the international conference
in London, or by reason of the parties being
unable ta, get tagether.
Honourable senators might have regard ta
these clauses:
6. It is mutually understood that matters ansaing froni, or incidentai to, the operatioti of this
agreement may at the instance of either party
'hecome subleets of discussion between the
,parties 'ta this agreement.
'7. HIaving in mind the general purposes which
this agreement is designed to serve, the two
goveroments have agreed that its terrms and conditions shall be subjeet to, aoy modification or
amendment whieh may be necessary to bring it
iotao conformity with any international agreements or arrangements hereafter entered into ta
which bath gaveroments are parties.
From the general provisions of that last
clause, it is quite obviaus that it is contemplated between the parties that this agreement
may have ta be changed prior ta 1950. What
position shahl we be in if this legislation is
passed and the contract cames ta an end
entirely.
Hon. Mr. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Does not that
clause signify, as I have interpreted it, that
if an international wheat agreement is arrived
at, the cantract expires?
The argument
presented in the House af Commons by the
Minister of Agriculture was along that line.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Witb 411lrespect to
the Minister of Agriculture, I think the words
in the agreement show clearly that it bas been
agreed ta, amend the provisions of this agreement in arder to bring it in lime with the
international agreement that is entered into
between these two governments.
An Hon. SENATOR: Are we talking about
the international trade agreement to be made
in Geneva?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: It dues not stipulate whether it is an international wbeat.
agreement or a trade agreement.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I understand
it is the international wheat agreement, which
tlte delegates in London are discussing at the

Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I submit that this
is one of the questions that should be brought
to the attention of the officials in the coinmittee, and we should be satisfied what will
bappen should these agreements terminate for
one reaon or another, or if it should bu necessairy to amend the agreement.

Mr. Snadden: Can the Right Hon. gentleman

pioducts below cost of production in the country

iindeed.

lion. Mr. CAMPBELL: That may very weli
be. I was dealing with the question of the
xviteat price One of the tltings that concerns
me is the provision of this agreement thtat by
Deceiber 31, 1947, the parties to the agreement inust settle the price at which the grain
is to be delivered for the subsequent crop
year. Witlh all respect to the representatives
of the United Kingdom, I say that they are
necognizedl as the shrewdest traders in the
world, particularly when dealing in cereals,
grain, flour and so forth; and I think it ha s
been the policy of the British people at all

I submit, honourable senators, that that
is a perfetly sound stand for the British
Government to take in an open market. Let
us consider what nay develop by December
31, 1947, when representatives from both
countries sit around a table to settle the price
for the subsequent ciop year. The United
States is a very large producer of wheat,
and from nall we hear, their crop conditions
seem very favourable. The Argentine is a
very large producer of wheat. France will
again enter the market and may have exportable surpluses, and it is assumed that the
United States will offer wheat for sale. But
we are now comnitted to the provisions of
the agreement, and are obligated to sell

tiies to

ecrtain

buy their wheat and other cereals

froim the market where they can get it the
cheape-t. It may be of interest to honourable
senators to see what the Minister of Food,
Mr. Strachey, has to say on this very subject.
It shows that the present government is following tie saime practice that the United Kingdom
las adopted for many years.
With leave of the Senate I should like to
read fromi the debates of the British House
of Coumnmons under date of December 11, 1946,
column 1156, oral answers during the question
period of the house. The subject under discussion was Danish produce, and particularly
the prices. Lieut.-Colonel Bromley-Davenport
asked the Minister of Food:
Whetier lie is aware of the continued dissatisfaction of the Danish people with the prices
paid by this country for Danisb agricultural
producu; and whether, in view of the adverse
effect whicl this is having on their ability and
willingness to buy British goods, be proposes te
review the position in the near future with a
view to some modification of the existing arrangements.
Here is the minister's reply, with a further
question and answer:
Mr. Strachey: I know the Danes would like
to bu paid more under the agreement of July,
1946. That agreement, however, gave Denmark
solid assurances of a large share in the British

specified

quantities of wheat to the

United Kingdom government, at a price
agreed upon between the parties to the contract. I submit that with the floor price of
81.25 stipulated it is net reasonable to expect
Ibat the British government is likelv to agree
to pay a dollar more than the world price at
tHe re-negotiatring time, should the price be
more than $1.25, as we all hope and expect
it will be. The provisions of the agreement
that the United Kingdom government will
have regard to any difference between the
prices fixed by this contract and the world
price. I submit, will net likely have any
effect upon the price to bu agreed upon at
that time.
We shall tîxen find ourselves
forced to meet the world price *because we
at this time sold-and I submit sold shorta very substantial quantity of wheat upon
which the farmers lost considerable money.
Whether or not this bill represents a good
business transaction I am not here to argue.
J simply point out that as a farmer I could
net have a great deal of confidence in the
ability of a board vested with such wide
powers to merchandise my grain, and get the
higheut possible price on the world market,
when we find a situation such as exists
Bearing that in mind, should we

not most carefully consider the necessity for

MARCH 26, 1947
legisiation? We must, however, realize
that a contract has been entered into; it
is hinding upon us, and we must have the
machinery for carrying out its provisions. If
it is necessary to enact legisiation for that
purpose, we must do so.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? Why is it
necessary to do so? Is that the constitutional situation? Do I understand that when
an executive enters into an agreement of
that kind it is taking a chance on whether or
flot parliament wiii support it?

-this

Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I think that parhiament has approved this treaty and the
agreement has been entered into.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Parliament has not
approved it; the House of Commons has.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: 1 tbink that it has
the full authority of the Parliament of Canada
by reason of the fact that the authority
under which the contract was entered into
was a valid order in council and therefore the contract to aIl intents and purposes, is a contract which has been entered into
witb ful authority from the Parliament of
Canada. 1 of course would flot suggest for
one moment that we sbould not carry out the'
contract. Having entered into it with perfect
good faith, and possibly not being able to
anticipate the future world price at any given
date, we must carry out the contract. From
ail indications the farmers' representative
organizations were quite satisfied with the
ternis of the contract and with the stipulated
price they were to get over the ensuing four.
years.
I merely draw ta the attention of honourable members that if a board is vested with
wide powers, and by legisiative authority is
given comnplete control over the grain trade
of this country, we are going a very long way
towards taking the first step in sociaiizing the
grain trade of Canada. The fact that the bill
is limited as to time does not satisfy me at
the present moment. I have some slight
knowledge of the 'provisions of the Canada
Grain Act and the Canadian Wheat Board
Act, and have gone into the powers of the
hoard. I feel that the board, without such
drastie legisiation,, has the power now, with a
few amendments to the bill, to carry out the
provisions of this agreement, and to pay the
farmers the amount of $1.35 to which they are
entitled.
I do not wish f0 take up further time of thîs
honourab]e house, but I point ouf that the
observations I have made are probably preiiminary to a more tborough canvass of the

229

legislation. I say ta honourable senators that
the provisions of part Hl of the bill are entirely
uniimited in, time, and have the effect of
placing the elevafor storage and miii facilifies
in Western Canada under the control of the
board. If I interpret the legisiation correctiy,
it gives the Governor in Council power to
extend controls over elevators in the eastern
division and covers grain produced in Ontario.
I draw the attention of bonourable members
to these provisions, and suhmit that in some
respects this legislation is ultra vires of this
parliament. As an illustration, assuming that
the legisiation is passcd granting the Governor
in Council authority to extend the area, and
include the province of Ontario, the board
wouid then have power over elevators, milis
and facilities in this province if they are so
designated. If would mean that a grower of
wheat in Ont ario, who bias his wheat miiled in
that province, is controled by this legisîstion.
I say wifhout much hesitation that thaf is
ultra vires of this parliament. It represents
a purely domestic transaction, wholiy within
the powers of the province of Ontario, in that
particular case.
Other provisions in tbe bill I feel are
questionabie as fo whether or not fhey are
intra vires. It is the dufy of this bouse, I
submit, to see thaf we do not pass legisiation
that is ultra vires. Legislation of this character should be carefuliy studied and watched,
thaf it may not be a forerunner of. more
socialistie policies to he introduced in another
place af a later date.
ilonourable senators, in closing I submit
that we should examine this particular legisiation moat carefully and make sure that it is
flot ultra vires; that it is in the best interests of
the farmer and of trade and commerce; that
if is advanfageous to the Canadian taxpayer,
and in the interests of free enterprise and true
Liberalism; and that we are not yielding f0 the
forces of socialism in this country, wbich is
one of the lest two countries of the world f0
enjoy free enterprise.

gentleman proceeds, may I restate a question
which I asked yesterday of the boncurable
senator from Inkerman (H1on. Mr. Hugessen)?
As my question appears in, the officiai report
it is flot very chear. The question I intended te
as* was this: Why take ail -the trouble of

231

giving this bill second reading and 8ending it
to committee, if afterwards the government
will have to bring in a bill to ratify the agreement that is made at Geneva?
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: I might answer
my honourable friend in this way: It seemed
to me that it would be, of great interest to a
standing committee of the Senate to examine
the draft international trade convention which
bas been approved by the Preparatory Commission and is to, be the subjeet of further
discussion et the adjourned conference that
is to meet next month.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Which work of course
will have to be done agein when we get the
government bill?
Bon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes, that is so.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Honourable senstors, in the absence of the senator who
adjourned the debate yesterday (Hon. Mr.
Lacasse), I should like to say a few words.
When the bill was before this chamber last
session 1 spoke in favour of it from the viewpoint of the consuming public of Canada.
My views bave not cbanged. In the course of
the debate a good deal bas been said, pro and
con, and to attempt to go through it again
would be imposing beyond ail proper limits
upon the patience of this chamber. I listenred
with particular interest yesterday to the statements of the senator from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen), end wes much impressed by
tbem. I aiso eppreciate the position of those
wbo are besitant about giving this measure
second reading and sending it te committee.
They do flot want te commit themselves at
thîs time to the principle of the bill.
I receli that lest year wbihe dealing with
the Foreign Exchange Control Bill, we adopted
a practice that might be agein followed in this
instance. At that time a motion was mede
that the bill be not now read a second time,
'but tbat tbe subject-matter of the bill be
refterred tu cumiiittee for consideration and
report. After somne consideration of tbet procedure I bave corne to the conclusion that it
might be the solution to the present difficulties.
Therefore et this time I move, seconded by
the honourable senator from Gloucester (Hon.
Mr. Veniot):
That this bill be not 110w read the second time
but that the subject matter thereof be referred
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce for consideration and report.
By aýdopting this motion bonoura-ble senators
will bave an opportunity, without committing
tbemselves to the principhe of, the bill, to bear
evidence in committeen firom tbe consuming
publie of Canada, organized and otherwise, as

they wish to appear, and, from the organized
d.airy industry. We shall also have a chance
to consider the draft report and convention of
the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Employment. Ail that material xviii bci before
us in commrittee; and, I repeat, we shall be
able to gix-e consideration to it witbout having
committed ourseives to the principie of the
bill.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Would it not bie
better and moire appropriate to refer this bill
to the Naturai Resources Committee?

it would provide an easy method of bringing
about filibustering in matters of parliamentary
procedure; and that is the reason, I hehieve,
why it hias neyer been admitted either in the
Huse of Commons or the Senate. Lest year,
as the resuit of an inxestigation made by the
Clerk and covering the peiid since Confederation, it was ascertained that the occasion
I have mentioned was the first time that the
subjcct-matte- of a bill was referred to a
cemmittee befo-e second reading. On these
grounds, therefore, I rule against this motion.

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I arn in the hands of
the Scoate. I would amend my motion to
provide that the bill be referrcd to the appropriate standing committec for consideration
and report. If the motion is adopted wc can
then settie on the appropriate committee.

Hon. Mr. HIAIG: I remember verv wehl
that wlicn we discussed the matter iast year
His Honour the Speaker voiced the same
views as hie bas expressed today, but the
bouse unanimously agrecd tbat the subjeetmatter of a bill then before us for- second
reading should be referred tu cuînrittee. By
unanimous agreement thc bouse may do any:
tbiug it likes, but tbe Speaker may state that
tic action is xvrong. If objection is taken, hie
must ruhe on it; and I submit that in this
case bis ruling is rigit. Last year I w-as one
cf thiose wlîo requested tlîat the subjeetmatter of tie bill referred te siould go
to cuinmitte e, and our group gave unanimous
consent te tbat being donc. The leader of the
goveinent (Hon. Mc. Robertson) teck the
saie stand, tic bouse unanimousx- agreed,
andi tbat is wby it wvas donc. But I object to
stie proeedure' that lias jui-t been proposed, and
I think that the principie cf tbis bill sieuhd
ncw be veteil on.

Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Speaking on a question of prix ilege, not on the question of the
Dairy Industry Bill, may I say that I do flot
think it is good business to accept an amendment to the motion bcfore second rcading.
The hionourabie member from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hax-den) quoted an instanceý of that liaving been donc, but that w-as a speciai arrangemient agrced to by ail members of the Senate.
This measuire bias been before the house on
more occa-,sions-, possibiy, than any othe r piece
of legisiation, at least since I hav e beca a

Some Hon. SENATORS: No.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Those in faveur
of the motion will please say "Content."
Some Hon. MEMBERS: "Content."

MARCH 27, 1947
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Those opposed
to the motion will please say "Non-content."
Some Hon. SENATORS: "Non-content."
The Hon. the SPEAKER: In my opinion
the "non-contents" have it.
An Hon. SENATOR: Division!
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Call in the
members.
Hon. Mr. EULER: May I ask a question?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Order.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It is a matter of
privilege.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: I put the motion
and the vote has been taken. If my honourable friend desires to speakHon. Mr. EULER: I am asking for information. Is this a vote on my motion for second
reading?

Some Hon. SENATORS: Yes.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I thought I had the
privilege of closing the debate before the vote
was taken. If I am not mistaken, I desire to
do that.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I am sorry,
because the honourable member had the right
to close the debate. It was not my fault that
he did not exercise his right. He had the
opportunity to speak when the question was
put.

Hon. Mr. EULER: May I ask the Honourable the Speaker, for whom I have the highest
respect and regard, whether according to the
usual practice in a case of this kind he notifies
the Senate that the senator who makes a
motion has the right of closing the debate?

I wish to inform the bouse that I did not hear
His Honour the Speaker put the question.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, there were two or three gentlemen speaking and some of us did not know just what
was going on. I fully expected the mover of
the motion to close the debate, but he did
not get a chance to do so, because several

others were talking.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Order.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I do not think
there should be any doubt about it. The
question was put on the motion for second
reading.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Mr. Speaker, I still

desire to protest, not against your ruling, but
against the adoption by this bouse of steamroller methods to shut off debate.
- Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

233

Hon. Mr. COPP: I do not know what my
honourable friend means by "steam-roller
methods."

An Hon. SENATOR: It means only one
thing.
Hon. Mr. COPP: So far as I am concerned,
if it is the unanimous will of the Senate that
the honourable gentleman should have the
privilege of replying and making his closing
speech in this debate before the vote is taken,
I should say that this could be done. I myself
am quite willing that he should speak on this
motion, if he receives the unanimous consent
of the house.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: So far as I and my group
are concerned, we are quite willing that the
honourable gentlemen may speak. I heard
the Speaker ask for the division. He said':
"All those in favour. say 'Content'"; and
quite a few said so. Then he said: "Those
opposed, say
'Non-content'"; and many
answered "Non-content." A senator then got
up and asked for a division. I would suggest
to the senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) that the rules do not require the
Speaker to notify the Senate that the mover
of the motion has the right to close the debate.
It is only when the mover rises to speak to
close the debate that the Speaker makes that
announcement.
I repeat that I am quite willing that the
honourable gentleman may speak.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it the unanimous will of this house that the honourable
senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) may
speak?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Honourable senators,
before proceeding with the debate on the bill
itself, I should like to make this explanation
in reply to what the leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) has said. My impression was that some
observations were made after the honourable
the Speaker made his ruling, and that when he
called for the "Contents" and "Non-contents,"
it was on the motion for reference of the
subject-matter to committee. I am perfectly
well aware that if I, as the mover of the motion
for second reading, did not rise in time when
the motion was put, I am out of order. I
desire to thank the leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) and the acting leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Copp) for agreeing that I may make
some observations, although I am convinced
that they will probably not result in changing
the vote of a single senator.

SENATE

In closing the debate I shall endeavour to
confine myself pretty largely to an examination
of the arguments of those who are opposed to
the bill. Some of the speeches in the debate
were informative, some were quite irrelevant,
and none attacked the principle of the bill.
It is indeed difficult to attack a sound principle. One of the surprising and rather discouraging tfhings during the period of this
debate has been the statement, made to me
personally by some members of this bouse,
that there could be no objections to the principle of the bill, yet they were going to vote
against it.
Last evening I was reading a rather interesting book, in which I ran across a statement
thiat particularly attracted my attention. It
was to the effect that there are three strategies
for obseuring an issue: First, the 4ntroduction
of irrelevancies; second, the arousing of prejudices; and third, the exciting of ridicule. As
I cogitated upon the matter I came to the
conclusion that all three of these were present
in the debate yesterday. Irrelevancies, for
instance, were present in the speech of the
senator from Peterborough West (Hon. Mr.
Duffus), who ably discussed immigration and
some other questions that are of importance
in this country but have not the slightest
relevance to the debate on margarine.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: Will the honourable
senator allow me to interrupt him? I referred
to housing, immigration and other matters
wlien suggesting some things that could be
done to help agriculture and the country in
general. I submit those remarks were very
much to the point.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Well, I have no reply
to make to that interjection.
Then there was, as I thought, an attempt
to create prejudice against oleomargarine in
the speech of my friend from Rigaud (Hon.
Mr. Dupuis), who seemed to hold to the longexploded idea that margarine is not a wholesome product.
Thirdly, we had a rather naive remark,
which contained an element of humour as well
as of ridicule, in the speech of my friend from
L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger), who said he was
convinced that butter is a better substance
than oleornargarine, although he had never
tasted oleomargarine.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: My
based on what I had heard.

statement was

Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Hearsay.
Hon. Mr. EULER: When I again bring a
pound of oleomargarine here, which may be
next session, I perhaps shall give my honourable friend an opportunity to taste if.

I want to deal with some observations that
were made in the debate, particularly by the
senator from Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair).
But first I should like to thank the senators
from Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley)
and Peterborough West (Hon. Mr. Duffus) for
their kind and generous remarks with regard
to myself, although I am unable to follow the
arguments made by either of these gentlemen.
My honourable friend from Queen's-Lunenburg
went into the history of oleomargarine in the
United States. He showed that about forty
years or so ago that country had a prohibitory
law similar to ours; that an action was
brought in the courts and the law was declared
to be unconstitutional; and that it has ever
since been legal to manufacture and sell oleomargarine in every state in the union. When
my honourable friend was speaking I thought
that if his argument meant anything, it was
that we should take a lesson from the United
States and make oleomargarine available to
all provinces in Canada.
We heard an address by the senator from
Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt). I regret
verv much I was unable to follow him in the
French language; but later he turned very
ably to the English language, and I literally
'sat up and took notice" when he said that
this bill was an abuse of liberty-whereas
liberty is the very thing which this bill is
trying to restore. I thought that perhaps the
honourabl.e gentleman was adopting the maxim
that the best defence is offence. I recalled
what Foch had to say at the Battle of the
Marne, in the First Great War, when things
were going rather badly. He declared: "My
left is crumbling; my right is in retreat; I will
attack with my centre". So my honourable
friend attacks from the centre and attributes
to the bill the very thing that it is designed
to correct.
I come now to the argument presented by
my honourable friend from Queen's (Hon. Mr.
Sinclair). It attracted more attention than I
expected; and candidly in my view, more
importance was attached to it than it warranted. The senator explained that next month
in Europe there will be a meeting of representatives of some twenty nations, including
Canada and the United States, and that the
purpose of the meeting is to remove obstacles
of international trade, to reduce tariffs and in
general to promote the mutual interests of
countries taking part in the conference.
I am of course in sympathy with the objects
of the conference, but I fail to follow my
friend in the argument he put forth. He said
in effect that if agreements are arrived at
and if one clause of any agreement provides

MARCH 27, 1947
that the prohibition against imports into
various countries be removed, oleomargarine
will automatically beceme available to the
people of Canada. My friend shakes bis
head. Arn I misquoting bim? I arn speaking
from memory.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The honourable
gentleman is quoting quite loosely. I understood him to say I suggested that ail restrictions on imports would be removed. Permit me
to say that I did not go that far. I said thst
certain undesirable restrictions on trade would
have to be considered at the conference, and
that the question of prohibition of imports
would also be considered, wbich would bring
the oleomargarine question before the goverfiment.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I think my bonourable
friend referred to a statement made in another
place. And carlier in the session a remark was
made in this bouse by the leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson)Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: That is right.
Hon. Mr. EULER: -to the effect that if
agreements were concluded at the conference,
oleomargarine migbt become legal in Canada.
Hon. Mr. SIN CLAIR: The question might
corne before the Government.,of Canada.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The impression conveyed was that if the agreements were made
effective it would be necessary for the Canadian Parliament to repeal its present prohibitory law against oleomargarine. As the
senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
said yesterday, if this bill is voted down we
may be placed in the anomalous position of
voting next session, or the following session, or
perhaps the session after that, for a bill whicb
this Senate proposes now to turn down.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: That would cover
trade matters generally.
Hon. Mr. EUJLER: Ail right. I will go a
littie further. My honourable friend advanced
the theory-because to, my mind it is only.
a t.heory-that if we maintain the ban on
oleomargarine our representatives at Geneva
will bave a weapon-or, I think hie said, a
bargaining power-to obtain concessions from
other countries of the world. To that contention I attacli no importance whatsoever; for
this reason. That conference will have to deal
with matters of infinitely greater importance
than the more or less insignificant commodity
known as oleomargarine. I question very
much whether the word "oleomargarine" wil
aven be mentioned in the negotiations.' The
only countries represented at Geneva that
83168-161

235

miglit he interested in that commodity are
the United States and Canada-the United
States, perhaps, from the point of view of
their ability to export a few tons of margarine
to this country. I leave it to the judgment
of honourable senators who know the bardboiled proclivities of United States negotiators,
whether it is at ail reasonable to expect from
them any substantial return for the slight
concession which they might receive by way
of permission to export margarine to this
country. I arn certain that this item does not
bulk at ail largely; in fact it will flot appear
at ail in any negotiations at Geneva.
If indeed that conference should evolve an
agreement which.- wîll make oleomargarine
available to this country, by passing this bill
now we shall merely be anticipating the very
tbing whicb. the government will have to do
next session, or the session after that. Again,
in the not unlikely event-and I mean exactly
what I say, knowing how difficuit it is to
arrive at agreements, and especially between
twenty countries-in the not unlikely event
that no agreement is arrived at, Canada will
not have the benefit of oleomargarine, and we
shahl be' exactly eh'ere we are now.
And I rather suspect that that is exactly
what my friend desires.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD:
smiles in saying it.

But the senator

Hon. Mr. EULIER: I might add, as an
afterthougbt, that perhaps I or somebody else
will be put to the unfortunate necessity of
introducing this bull again next year or the
year after that, or the year after that.
Freedom to export oleomargarine from. the
United States to Canada would not be, I hope,
of any great benefit to that country, for the
simple reason that surely it would be the
desire of every member of the Parliament of
Canada that the product be made in this
country, not imported from the United States.
The senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen), in a speech whose eloquence I
acknowledge, although I do flot agree with
ail he said, quoted from an address that
President Truman made not long ago at a
college in the United States-it was, I believe,
Baylor University-and I should like to quote
a littie more from that same speech. The
Presîdent said:
There was no intention to sacrifice one group
to henefit another group.
I commend that sentiment to those who
are opposed to the use, of oleomargarine. The
President continued:Negotiations will be directed toward obtaining
larger markets. both foreign and domestie, for
the benefit of ail.

236

SENATE

Every one of us will agree with that. Then
he goes on to say-and this is interesting:
No tariff rate will be reduced until an exhsaustive study lias been made, until every person
who wishes a iearing lias been heard, and careful consideration given to bis case.
Can that possibly mean that negotiations
will be completed at Geneva, in Europe? If
the Americans intend to grant a hearing to
anybody who wishes to be heard, those hearings will be in the United States; and I
challenge anybody to maintain that they will
be concluded in a few months-four months,
six months, or even a ytar. They will last a
great deal longer than that. But the President adds that even though an agreement
should come aboutIn every future agreeient there will be a
clause tiat periits this government-or any
otier governiment-to iodify or witlidraw a conuession if it shosîld result. or tireaten to result,
in serious injuiiry to a domestic industry.

Is there anything to indicate that any agreement wlicl might be made under these conditions would permanently restore to the people
of this country the benefits of margarine?
I w ould conclude this part of my remarks
with the statement, which' I commend to
senators who are in favour of Canadianism, if
I May put it that way, thsat as a self-respecting
Canadian and, a self-respecting senator it is to
mie a isuniliating thought that the mass of the
consumssers of this country are to be dependent
upon a casual by-product of a conference of
twentv uninterested countries, for the restoration of a rigbt which we have not the courageI was going to say the guts-to reclaim for
ourselves. This bill, honourable senators, is
based essentially upon a principle-the fundamental right of every citizen in a free country
to produce. to sell, to buy any legitimate article
of commeree. wbether it be margarine, butter,
axle grease, or anything else. Not a single
opponent ias attacked that principle. and all
the side issues which have been dragged into
this debate do not affect it. The claim that
we cannot obtain the oils and fats in Canada,
for instance, is beside the point.
There may
be a temporary searcity because of controls,
but I am authoritatively informed that these
controls may not last mucb longer. Indeed, the
fact that. the capable chairman of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board has given up his
position may well indicate that be thinks his
job is finished and that controls, or most of
thes, will be removed at an early date.

in Canada, you cannot have oleomargarine.
Then why worry? But remember that we are
today exporting some of the ingredients of
oleomargarine, products of this country, to
Newfouîndlsand, where they, are made into
Also it has been
excellent oleomargarine.
su-ggested to me that some of this oleomargarine finds its way back into Canada.
In insisting on the retention of this monopolistic prohibitory law the farmer is taking
bimself out of court. He must come in with
clean bands. For ycars J, in common with
other senators, have beard the farmer complain
that he as to buy in a protected market and
sell in a free market, all to his disadvantage.
I wonder bow in the future he can make any
sucih protest, when he himself is the beneficiary
of a law that is not only protectionist, but
prohibitory, and, that bas established for him
permanently-for it bas lasted sixty years-a
guarantce against competition, not from outside countries alone, but from within Canada
itself. That unîdenocratie condition is not
paralleled, I believe, in any other country with
wiebicwe ave to dieal.
In another debate the leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig) criticized the prices that were being
paid to our farmers for wheat under the
agreement with Britain.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
hiere.

You cannot refer to that

Hon. Mr. EULER: Well, I am referring
to it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I rise on a point of order.
The senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
is referring to the Wheat Board Bill, which
is still before the house and cannot be referred
to in this debate.
Hon. Mr. EULER: My friend does not
wish to have my statement go on the record.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
the record.

You cannot put it on

Hon. Mr. EULER: My friend is not the
dictator whieh he would like to be here. Let
us get a ruling on the point of order. If His
Honour the Speaker rules against me, I shall
be quite content.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: I hope you are right.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: I am sure
honourable senators are thoroughly familiar
with the rule. What is said in an unfinished
debate cannot be used directly or indirectly
in a subsequent debate on a different subject.

Hon. Mr. EULER: I bope so too. In any
case, the objection answers itself. If you cannot get the ingredients to make oleomargarine

Hon. Mr. EULER: While I did not hear
the Speaker, I am quite content to abide
by his ruling.

MARCH 27, 1947
May I say that in another way? On a
certain question I agreed with the leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig), but I also say to
him that there is a good deal on the other
side of the ledger. I do not desire to say
anything of a recriminatory nature, and perhaps there is no great relevancy in my point,
but it is true that the farmers have received
several hundred million dollars in cash by
way of subsidies on milk, cheese and butterthe butter subsidy being 81 cents a pound.
The farmer goes free of tax on gasoline and
many other supplies which he uses on the
farm and on which the ordinary citizen is
taxed. The farmer in western Canada has
been paid millions of dollars on land which
he did not crop and on areas on which he had
a small crop. What other business in Canada
has such government insurance against loss
paid for by the taxpayers?
Hon. Mr. MORAUD:
May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? I understood that all those subsidies were given to
protect the consumer, not the farmer. If the
farmer had been left alone he could have
sold his products at much higher prices and
the consumer would have been the loser.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Large sums, running
into scores of millions were paid to ,the farmers
of western Canada. Did those payments
reduce the price paid by the consumer for
anything the farmer produced?
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: That has nothing to
do with butter.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Honourable senators, I
do not desire to be placed in the position
of criticizing the farmers, but I do think they
are as a group as prosperous as and more independent than any other citizens of Canada.
Unless this bill passes-and I rather expect
that it will not-the farmers will continue to
have a guarantee that nothing will compete
with butter, even though they cannot supply it.
The honourable lady senator from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis), for whom I have
the highest regard and respect, also spoke in
the debate.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: I was hoping the
honourable gentleman would not leave me out.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I am not sure that the
honourable lady desires to be left out.
In response to a question I asked, she stated
it was to the everlasting shame of Canada the
fact that Britain was giving us of her scant
butter reserves some 12,000,000 pounds. I
would have expected her to give a logical
reply: Let Canadians have a little margarine
to cover their butter shortage, and permit
Britain to keep the butter of which she is in
such great need.

237

Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: If the necessary oils
and fats were available I would be quite willing to make that proposition, so as not to
deprive the British people of butter. I thought
I made that quite plain.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The fats and oils
are going to Newfoundland.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Under world allocation.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I have already dealt
with that matter and have not any real hope
of convincing the honourable lady on the
question.
Honourable senators, the present situation
violates the'fundamental principles of freedom
of choice. Free competition without favour or
preference is surely the very essence of our
democracy. Disregard of these principles is, in
my opinion, driving thousands of our people
to the worship of strange gods which offer
them something better. Secondly, we have
established the fact that there is a great shortage of butter, a shortage of long standing and
one.which I believe will continue far into the
future. In the third place, it is certain that
oleomargarine. a wholesome, palatable and
nutritious substitute for butter, can be made
available at a much lower price than butter.
Last week in Philadelphia margarine sold at
32 cents a pound, while butter was 86 cents.
I would ask senators to bear these three
points in mind and ask themselves: What is
the logical thing to do? I believe that 90 per
cent of the consumers of this country would
say, "If you cannot give us butter, give us
margarine to fill our needs." That is plain
common sense.
Contrary to the views of one of the speakers

on this side of the chamber, I think this bill
should go to the House of Commons. But a
senator says, "We must not embarrass the
members of that house."
One of those
estimable gentlemen said not long ago that if
this bill goes to the Commons it will be
dynamite.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Does the honourable
gentleman mean that was privately expressed,
or in the house?
Hon. Mr. EULER: Privately expressed; I
would not repeat anything said elsewhere.
I recall an incident which occurred when I
was a member of another place and a member

of the government. The Right Ilonourable
Mr. Howe suggested, or introduced a bill to
provide that the radio licence fee should be
increased by a dollar or two. Some of the
mcmbers of that chamber almost went into
hysterics. They were afraid to go back ta

SENATE

238

their constituents, feeling that they would
surely be defeated on that issue in the next
election. The fee was raised, and most of us
remember that at the next election there was
never a word said about it.
I believe that this measure ought to go on
to the House of Commons. Let that house
act on its own responsibility, as the Senate
ought to do. Since *when have the members
of this chamber become the protectors of the
House of Commons? I cannot recall any
particular solicitude on the part of the members of that body for the members here.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Quite the contrary. If
this bill goes to the other place the members
there will have the responsibility of considering it; and if they do not wish to pass it they
can do exactly what the Senate has a right
to do, and perhaps will do-defeat the bill.
In my opinion there is no justification-with
this remark some honourable senators may not
agree-for a Senate that is not reasonably free
and independent in its judgments.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. EULER: By the very'method of
their appointment senators are peculiarly
qualified to dispose of questions on their
merits and in the interests of the Canadian
people as a whole.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: May I ask the
senator a question?
Hon. Mr. EULER: Certainly.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Will those who
vote against the bill have the same right of
freedom as my honourable friend reserves for
himself?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I say that senators
ought to be free to vote as they like on any
question, on its merits. We need not go far
into the past to recall that the Senate has
beon strongly criticized. -It has been said to
be undemocratic. Probably there is something
in that remark. It lias also been described as
useless.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: There is nothing to
that statement.
Hlon. Mr. EULER: The charge has been
made that it serves the big interests and that
it ouight to be abolished. As a matter of
fact, abolition of the Senate is a plank in the
platform of one of the parties in this country.
lon. Mr. DUPUIS: You are telling me.
Hon. \r. EULER: These views have been
somewhat modified in the last few years
because the Senate has done good work. I

refer particularly to the activities of the
Standing Comnittee on Banking and Commerce, the Committee on Immigration, which
did a splendid job last year, and the Special
Committees on Mining and Taxation.
I am profoundly convinced that if this bill
is again rejected, when it is so clearly in the
interests of the consumers-the mass millions
of the consumers of this country-the prestige
of the Senate will be seriously impaired.
An Hon. SENATOR: That is your opinion.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It bas often beed said
that one of the functions of the Senate is to
protect minorities. Is it not also the duty of
the Senate to protect the majority of the
consumers?
Finally, and most important of all, what do
the millions of Canadian consumers think of
this bill? Since this bill was introduced I have
had many, many letters and communications
from all classes and from all parts of Canada,
and without exception they are supporting the
bill.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: There are some from
the United States as well.
Hn. Mr. EULER: The senator is referring
to a communication from the president of
the National Dairymen's Union. I think that
would be rather disconcerting to a dairyman
in this country.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It would not be if they
knew about your friend.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It is too bad the leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) did not give the
benefit of his knowledge to the house.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I did not think it was
important enough.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I have detained the
Senate for some considerable time, but I think
I should place a few of these communications
on record. The first is from the Minister of
Knox United Church, Paisley, Ontario:
March 19, 1947.

Senator W. D. Euler,
Ottawa, Ontario.
Dear Sir:
I have been following with interest the fortunes of your bill to legalize the manufacture,
sale and importation of oleomargarine. I want
you to know that I an with you 100 per cent in
this matter. I have no doubt that the great
niajority of the Canadian people are also with
you, though the anti's may be more vocal.
It seems to me that this is the time to pass
this bill. The dairy farmers of Canada are now
unable or unwvilling to produce sufficient butter
at a reasonable price to meet the needs of the
Canadian people. It is surely unjust to deny to
us this product which is available to so many
countries.

MARCH 27, 1947
I am surprised to see that the Federation of
Agriculture is opposed. The farmers have always
taken the position that unnatural and artificial
restrictions on trade are wronge.g, high tariffs.
This law against the sale of oleomargarine is
vicious sectional legislation of the worst kind.
I sincerely hope that your bill will receive the
support that it deserves, and will soon be passed.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Who is the writer
of that letter?
Hon. Mr. EULER: The Reverend H. C.
Linstead, B.A., B.D., Minister, Knox United
Church, Paisley, Ontario. Another communication is from the Secretary of the Winners
Bible Class, Wesley United Church, Toronto.
It encloses a rather lengthy resolution, and
I do not intend to read it. I merely say that
it strongly supports the bill.
A letter from Mrs. C. D. Slater, in Hamilton, Ontario, reads as follows:
Senator W. D. Euler,
Ottawa, Ontario.
Dear Sir:
I am enclosing a letter I have written to the
editor of the Hamilton Spectator in regard to
the butter situation. I sincerely hope i-t brings
you moral support for the stand you have taken
in this matter. There is a great deal of feeling
here, as elsewhere, about the injustice of a small
group being able to dictate the policy of a government, but whether the people have the courage of their convictions remains to be seen. It
is easy to talk; harder to do, of course.
I represent no group or party. I am just an
indignant housewife who thinks that we should
back up someone who is trying to right this
situation.
Here is a letter from Montreal:
March 20, 1947.
Dear Sir:
Allow me to congratulate you on your stand
regarding the producing of margarine in Canada. While appreciating the dairy and farm
attitude, I feel that the struggling poorer people
should have encouragement. The price of butter
is beyond many of them and anyway we never
have enough to go around. The producers must
observe the Golden Rule and stop being "dogs
in the manger." Keep up your good work.
Sincerely yours
(Miss) E. M. Davidson.
Dr. J. C. Johnston, of the Mountain Sanatorium at Hamilton, Ontario, writes:
March 19, 1947.
Dear Sir:
I am enclosing a copy of a letter to the
Editor, Hamilton Spectator, March 18, 1947,
which speaks for itself. I wish to state that I
am in complete accord.
It is desired to point out that aside from the
economics of the introduction of margarine, that
it has all the health giving qualities of butter
and can be further improved if need be, in its
manufacture.
We have heard, and hear, much about cartels
-the dairy industry may not be one in strict
definition, but the selfishness it exerts is similar
to the monopolies usurped by cartels.
Please accept my support in your struggle for
common sense in this matter.

An Hon. SENATOR: What is the name of
the writer?

Hon. Mr. EULER: I gave the name at the
beginning. It is Dr. J. C. Johnston, Mountain
Sanatorium, Hamilton, Ontario.
I have another letter, of which I shall only

read the last paragraph because the letter is
unsigned. It is from a housewife:
Here's to every success in your undertaking.
You have the housewives behind you one hundred
per cent.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. EULER: The following letter is
from. Doctor G. W. Carrow, M.D., M.S.,
F.R.C.S.(C), 2700 Dundas Street West,
Toronto:
March 14, 1947.
Senator W. D. Euler,
Parliament Buildings,
Ottawa, Ontario.
Dear Sir:
The purpose of this letter is to inform you
of what you undoubtedly know, that by your
continued and repeated proposition of the manufacture, sale and importation of margarine, you
are espousing the cause and interest of the
forgotten man, the consumer. In our daily life
now, all one hears is of the interests and rights
of the miner, auto-worker, labourer, farmer and
now of the dairy interests, but not a word of the
consumer, the largest group in the country.
During the war and even yet, the populace as a
whole is suffering from a shortage of fats. This
makes it even more advisable that margarine
be made available. I wish you well in your
endeavours and hope that your words and efforts
will not find barren ground in governmental
circles but rather fertile soil so that your
labours shall be rewarded by an enactment
which will make available this very necessary
food element in the nutrition of man.
The workers have declared for this bill by
resolutions of their organizations. So have
the returned men. The housewives, as you will
appreciate. are all for it. With the exception of
the resolution passed by the Federation of
Agriculture and the Dairymen's Association
not one of the communications I have received
bas been unfavourable to the bill.
I think newspapers may also be regarded as
fairly representative of the opinions of their
readers. There bas been half-hearted opposition by one.paper in this city-not the Citizen
-but so far as I know every other newspaper
that bas discussed the oleomargarine question
in such cities as Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg,
Windsor, Hamilton, Toronto, Montreal, and
right down to Halifax, bas been in favour of
this bill.

Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: Not the Toronto Star.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I am not sure of its
editorials, because I do not read the Star

MARCH 27, 1947

I am an absolute individualist. I am positively against all forms of Socialism. There are
many strong anti-socialists in this house, many
as strong as I, but none str.onger.
I do not like government control except in
those cases where it is completely essential.
I can go farther than many of the men and
women in public life in Canada, in that I feel
that governmental industrial operations should
pay taxes just as private industrial operations
do.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: On the other hand,
I must join with the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell), in the warning he threw out yesterday to the effect that
we are approaching the time when there will
be a direct conflict between individualism, or
liberalism-call it what you like-and Socialism. I must add to that general warning the
thought that a great deal of Socialistie feeling
comes from a confusion of thoughts; and that
this confusion arises from a mixture of the
desire for social reform with the desire for
pure Socialism, under which the government
would operate everything.
Having said that, I want to state that I am
going to support this bill. I think that under
the circumstances confronting Canada, Great
Britain, and the world today, it is essential
to have this bill pâssed and become enacted
into law as soon as possible. Like many
senators I have had the experience, as I have
said before, of visiting the United Kingdom
and many European countries during the last
fifteen months. And I am once more warning
every individual here 'that of all the men and
women I met who were representatives of
other countries, not more than four or five had
not something of what I might call "the taint
of Socialism". When talking with them you
could see that there was some confusion as to
what was good for the common people; the
thought of what was good for individuals was
mixed up with the thought as to how that
should be carried out by economic interference
or industrial operations of the state.
I make another declaration of policy.
Speaking generally, I am one of those in
favour of the operation of the Winnipeg Grain
Exchange. I may be wrong but, taking everything all in al], I think Canada would be better
off with futures trading. But again I say
something that is directly contrary-that at
this moment, provided we are going to confirm
the agreement made between the Canadian
government and the government of Great
Britain with respect to wheat we cannot permit futures trading in wheat on the, Winnipeg

Grain Exchange. It must remain closed if we
are going to carry out properIy the agreement
concerning the sale of wheat by Canada to
Great Britain.
Another thought that I wish to leave with
honourable members is, indirectly, at least,
related to the question of futures trading in
wheat. Canada is a country of small population and of wide areas that are naturally
adapted to the production of wheat and other
grains. Canada produces wheat that cannot
possibly be absorbed in her domestic market.
The wheat produced in the United States can
to a much larger extent be absorbed in the
domestic market of that country. Canada is
utterly dependent upon export markets. It
is not necessary to call attention of senators
to the destruction of all European export
markets between the first Great War and the
last one. That destruction was brought about
in large degree deliberately by actions of
governments of European countries, not because
they were antagonistic to Canada and the
United States or any other country that produces grain, but largely because of the fear
that if war came again they would be deprived
of food unless they themselves produced
wheat. So wheat production was encouraged
through the payment of subsidies to producers, through the imposition of import
duties on wheat, and in other ways. The net
result was that Canada's wheat producers,
dependent almost entirely upon export markets, found themselves with wheat that they
could not sell at any price whatever.
I might be told that that will not happen
again. But I must call attention to the fact
that those same European countries, which
after the first World War decided that they
needed all the foreign exchange and currencies
that they could secure, are face to face with
the same situation again.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: May I ask the
honourable senator to name a date when
wheat couldi not be sold? I have been in the
market for thirty years, and not once during
that time did I experience an occasion when
wheat could not be sold.
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: Perhaps I should
have said when wheat could not be sold at a
price that would permit the prairie farmers to
live in decency. That is truer in fact than the
expression that wheat could not be sold. Many
senators sitting near me in this chamber saw
wheat produced in Alberta and Saskatchewan
that could not be sold at a price high enough
to enable the people to live in decency.

242

SENATE

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I ask the
senator if he is now referring to the years
1930, 1931 and 1932?
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: I refer to those years
and to some previous years as well.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Surely my friend
does not refer to the period from 1921 to 1929?
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: The same condition
with respect to export markets of wheat
existed in 1930 to 1935. I do not know just
what the senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) has in mind. Does he doubt the
accuracy of my statement that part of the
trouble inflicted upon the producers of wheat
was due to the inability to sell on the open
markets?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I should like my
honourable friend's opinion in connection with
his statement that wheat could not be produced profitably in certain years.
I am
attempting to get him to identify the years.
I believe the year in which the price reached
an all-time low was 1932, when it went d'own
below 40 cents a bushel. I should like him to
develop the question of the cause a little more.
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: There were many
causes, and I would be glad to develop the
subject; but at the moment I am dealing
strictly with the bil. that is before the house.
I am thankful to the honourable senator 'for
his invitation to express a thought on that
subject. There are of course other causes
than poor markets or lack of markets.
I have listened with rapt interest to most
of the speeches during this debate. The first
question I believe is one which concerns the
taxpayers.
The
government
may
have
accepted the costs, losses, expenses-call it
what you will-that accompanies the agreement between Canada and the United Kingdom. There is a further question, as to
whether the receipts in the form of participations paid by the board should not be distributed annually, rather than at the end of
the four-year period.
Also, would it be
wiser to have the proposed legislation expire
at the end of 1948, with the provision that it
may be continued by Order in Council.
Part Il of the bill, dealing with permits and
quotas, gives direct authority to the wheat
board to make regulations and to a large
extent to interfere with the freedom of action
on the part of individuals, railway and elevator companies. Part IV gives certain definite
authority to the board with respect to interprovincial and export trade in wheat.
I should like to dwell for a moment on the
provisions of Part II. But first I say again
that some of my opinions may appear to clash

with others. Since I am a declared individualist, honourable senators may be surprised
by my statement, that I believe conditions
which now exist will continue as long as we
are engaged actively in carrying out the
provisions of the wheat agreement between
Canada and the United Kingdom, and that
therefore there is a necessity for all of the
authority given to the board respecting quotas
and permits.
I have referred to the Peace River wheatgrowing district in British Columbia; but it
must be remembered that there is a greater
Peace River wheat-growing area in Alberta.
I know positively of many ind'ividual farmers
vho, because of the lack of use of existing
facilities, would not have been able to sell
their wheat during the war, had, the wheat
board not been authorized to issue permits
and arrange for quotas. Some of the wheat
producers in the Peace River area are a
hundred miles from the railway. There are
only twenty-four miles of rail in that part of
British Columbia. I have had many requests
and urgent appeals from farmers and elevator
companies in the area of Dawson Creek and
Pouce Coupé for assistance because of the
serious shortage of elevator and railway
facilities.
This problem naturally affected the wheat
producer, and the difficulties in respect to
railway rolling stock affected the elevator
companies. Had there not been a body authorized to fix quotas and require railway cars to
go to the end of steel instead of stopping at
intermediate points to be loaded and return
to Edmonton, all that part of British Columbia would have been without facilities for the
storage and transportation of wheat. Many of
the farmers in that area live a considerable
distance from the railways and elevators, and
in consequence their wheat had to be trucked
as far as 75 miles. Had they brought their
grain in on their own they would have found
the elevator company, with perhaps the utmost
goodwill in the world, unable to provide
storage facilities.
The Canada Grain Act bas been amended
several times through the years-the honourable gentleman from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr.
Paterson) will correct me if I am wrongbecause of bookings for cars, limiting the
number that any company, individual or group
of individuals could be provided with, so that
others might also have available to them
transportation for their grain to the elevators,
whether they were selling it to the company
or on their own.
I mention these things simply to explain why
I, a profound individualist, am not only ready
to accept, but anxious to have, this sort of

MARCH 27, 1947
authority vested in the Wheat Board for the
period during which there is a shortage of
facilities and while the wheat agreement with
the United Kingdom is under execution. I
ar n ot sure whether wheat agreements of this
nature should be made directly between governments, ae has been done in this case, or
lef t entirely to private individuals. Ordinarily, I arn for the latter course. However, I
ar n ot certain whether the wheat-producing
business is of such a nature as to permit
cîther individual wheat preducers or greups
of wheat producers or companies to make a
deal of this kind, although I would much
prefer that it be done by them if that were
possible.
But under the circurnstances of the moment
I feel that the Governrnent of Canada took
the best possible course in rnaking this agreement with Great Britain. To rny mind the
agreernent will be of high value to Canada,
but wîll be of even greater value to the people
of the United Kingdom. As bas been pointed
out in this chamber over and over again,
practically everybody in Canada wants to do
everything possible to help the sorely afflicted
people of the United Kingdorn. So far as I
amn concerned, while I detest Socialism, when
thinking of the people of the UJnited Kingdom
I do not envisage them in terras of the political-social-econornic nature of their governments; 1 arn thinking, as 1 believe other senators are, only of the agreernent between
Canada and the United Kingdom which will
assure thern of a supply of wheat at a price
that their resources will permit them to pay.
This brings us back to the question whether
the Governrnent of Canada should provide al
the costs brought about by the implementation ..of these wheat agreements. Considering everything, I arn ready to support that
feature of the bill, in addition to others.
Speaking as one who represented for many
years a wheat-growing district, I recognize
that the taxpayers of Canada provide the
means for carrying into effect the Prairie iFarm
Assistance Act, and for the work which bas
been done for many years under the Prairie
Farm Rehabilitation Act. I have advocated
for a long tirne that the benefits of the Prairie
Farm Rehabilitation Act should be extended
to ail Canada, and not confined to the
southern portions of the three Prairie provinces. In any event, it falis upon the taxpayers as a whole to defray the cost of helping in these directions those engaged in a particular industry in a particular place, and I
arn wholly in favour of this being done.
These operations and many others, which I
shahl net occupy tirne in rnentioning, must be
taken inte consideratien in their bearing on
cost, if a loss occurs. Without question, with

243

prices of wheat as they are today, there, will
be a loss. Those who produce and those who
(leal in wheat could secure a better price for
wbeat today than they will obtain through
this agreemnent between Canada and Great
Britain. That staternent will hold true even
when the participation accounts are ahl squared
up. But suppose that during the hast two
years of that agreeme~nt, namely the crop
years of 1948-49 and 1949-50, world prices of
wheat shouhd faîl, t-hen the other side of the
picture would turn up and the farmers' pesitien would be much irnproved. However, 1
î'ealize the seriousness ofl trying te forecast
the future and this perhaps is the weakest
ground upon which I arn standing today. But,
taken ail in ail, rernembering that we are
rnaking certain of a market for ahl our wheat
-because, while this agrement. does flot cover
ail the wheat, it embraces se large a percentage
of it that a full market will be possibleHon. Mr. ASELTINE: Only fourteen
bushels to the acre.
Hlon. Mr. TUB GEON: Well, some years I
have net seen rnuch more than that produced.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: And that is not on
the ful acreage; that is on just the basic
acreage.
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: I know. That is al
there is in this agreemnent.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Wheat averages
only about fourteen bushels te the acre in
Western Canada.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: But this is only on
the basic acreage, net on the full acreage.
The board takes fourteen bushels te the acre,
net on the full acreage, but enly on the
acreage you are allowed te market from.
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: I know that the
senator frorn Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseitine)
is an authority on wheat. My peint is that,
as the farmers are assured for four years of
a definite market at a profit for this percentage
of their wheat, they can be practically certain
of having a market for ail they can produce,
unless--which is possible, though I do net
think it is probable-the world gees berserk
again, Apart from that eventualîty, with a
censiderable percentage of wheat production
assured of a market for a period of four
years, those who toil in order that Canada's
wheat production shahl be well rnaintained will
enjoy more assurance during the terra of
this agreement than they would have enjoyed
if the agreernent had net been made.
The question bas been raised whether part
IV of the bill, which wihl automaticahly expire
at the end of 1950, should net be ended in

SENATE
1948. The only objection I have to this suggestion-end it appiies gennreily in a reverse
manner to some of the powers at present
essigned to the wheat board hy order in council
-is tisat it takes away the legialative authority
and assignas to purely government authority,

amending act causing it to expire at any date
we wished. In the meantime, the government
of Canada will have full authority and power
to carry out the agreement that has been
entered into between this country and the
United Kingdom.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON moved the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to.

There is also a contract to ship 10 million
pounds of mutton and lamb at prices ranging
up to $31.25 per hundred pounds to the end

The three contracts I have mentioned come
under the jurisdiction of the Meat Board.

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS BILL

Hon. Mr. McDONALD: Bacon and hams
for Great Britain.
The fourth contract 'calls for 83 million

per dozen. covering a two-year period ending
in 1948. The contract is under the Special
Products Board, of which Mr. A. M. Shaw

MOTION FOR. SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED

Hon. A. B. COPP moved the second reading
of Bill 25, an Act to provide for the Sale and
Export of Agricultural Products.
He said: Honourable senators, this is
entirely an agricultural bill. I have asked the
honourable gentleman from King's (Hon. Mr.
McDonald) to explain the bill, and he bas
consented to do so.
Hon. J. A. McDONALD (King's): Honourable senators, I feel certain that in this house
there are others-especially among the senior
members, and among the junior members also
-who could explain the bill much more satisHowever, I shall
factorily than I can.
endeavour to do my best.
Discussion on the motion for second reading
of the bill occupied considerable time in
another place, as is evidenced by this folder
that I have before me, and I hope to bring
out some of the main points. Perhaps others
here who wish to help could answer some of
the questions that may be asked, and details
could later be studied in committee.
One of the saving features of this proposed
legislation is that it has a time limit. The
bill, if passed, will expire on December 31 next,
if there is a session of Parliament in November or December. If there is not another
session this year, then the bill will expire on
the sixtieth day after Parliament re-assembles
next year. I should think, however, that
because of the nature of existing contracts this
legislation will be up for review and extension
at the next session.
The outstanding commitments which have
been made are as follows. We have contracted
to ship 350 million pounds of bacon to Britain
at prices of about $27 per hundred pounds,
Grade A Wiltshires. These agreements provide
for minimum quantities down to the end of
1949. The prices have been agreed to down
to the end of 1948.
We have also contracted> to ship 120 million
pounds of beef annually. These agreements
also specify quantities down to the end of

Hon. Mr. LEGER: May I ask what the
figure 400 million refers to?

is chairman.
The fifth contract is for 125 million pounds
of cheese at a price of 20 cents a pound, plus

the subsidy now being paid, and will continue
to May, 1948.

Contract number six bas to do with evaporated milk products, financed down to the end
of March, 1948, calling for 600,000 cases per
year at a price of $4.95 per case. The chairman of the Dairy Board is Mr. J. F. Singleton.
The responsibility for purchasing, storing and
selling surplus agricultural products for the
purpose of fulfilling United Kingdom contracts
is exercised by commodity boards under the
direction of the Minister of Agriculture. Sujlies available for domestic consumption are
controlled by a regulation to ensure equitable
distribution, and the surplus is channelled to
fill British requirements. In some instances it
bas not been possible tQ ship the full quantities specified in the contract; in others, the
United Kingdom bas taken in excess of the
contractual minimum. The aim has been to
ship to Britain as much food as possible with-

out unduly restricting domestic consumption.
At times it bas proved necessary to requisition
supplies of commodities under regulations
made by order in council, but on the whole
the producers and processors have co-operated
to carry out the programme of exports to the
United Kingdom.

The powers contained in this bill are, generally speaking, similar to those exercised since
1939 under the emergency powers legislation.

The Minister of Agriculture is empowered to
purchase and sell agricultural commodities
to the governments of other countries, and to
make contracts for storing and processing.
These functions and powers may be delegated

to commodity boards established by the Governor in Council, which operate under tihe

246

SENATE

direction of the minister. Advisory committees
are to assist the minister in the administration
of the act. By amendments accepted in the
House of Commons, both the commodity
boards and the advisory boards would include
adequate representation of the producers concerned. In the debate in another place it was
pointed out that the functions under this act
could not very well be exercised by the
provincinal marketing boards, except in the
case of apples, as this is the only commodity
for which provincial marketing boards exist in
all the producing provinces.
After listening to nuch of the debate on
the motion for second reading in another place,
J am con\inced that if we are to continue the
aid that we agreed to give the British people,
this legislation is necessary. They need our
help in food supplies as much now as they
did during war years.
It is only fair to state that our farmers have
given outstanding service in supplying necessities to our harassed friends in Britain. They
have done this with much less labour than
would be employed in normal times, and I
think all will agree that they have net been
too generously paid for their products. Had
it not been for the subsidies paid by the government, we could not have produced nearly
as much food as we have produced since 1939.
I feel sure that I am expressing the views
of most, if nat all, of the farmers of Canada
when I state that they are very grateful for
the help given by the government, and the
financial assistance in the marketing of many
farm products in recent years.
Frankly, this is not the kind of marketing
legislation we willingly support. The marketing legislation that would be best for our
country and the government is a natural
products marketing act, such as I dealt with
at some length on March 21, a little more
than a year ago, in the debate on the address
in reply to the Speech froin the Throne.
Such iegislation would place the authority
for the marketing of agricultural products in
boards appointed by the farmers, where it
properly belongs, rather than in the minister
and commodity boards set up by him. It will
not be long, I trust, before the government
will introduce such a measure. I feel confident that the complained-of shortage of
farmers' boards to handle the situation will be
overcome when an overall marketing bill is
passed. Although a number of farm products
boards have been established throughout
Canada, it has beei said in another place that
there are net enough to handle the present
supplies in the way they would be taken care

of by an overall marketing bill such as was
suggested by the Canadian Federation of
Agriculture.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Would my honourable friend explain further the proposed overall marketing board? I presume it would be of
federal character.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD (King's): Yes.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: And each province
would have a marketing board which would
dovetail in with a federal marketing board for
each commodity that would be affected. Is
that the thought my friend has in mind?
Hon. Mr. MeDONALD (King's): That is
the idea. Every province in Canada has, I
believe, a marketing board, provided for by
provincial legislation. In the fruit industry,
to which I have referred, there are apple
marketing boards set up in the apple producing provinces. It was therefore not difficult
for the dominion Department of Agriculture
to deal with the provincial boards in the sale
of apples during the war years. But the fruit
growers were what might be termed war
casualties, because a large percentage of their
product could not be marketed in Great
Britain, as had been donc before the war.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The overall marketing board would net have power or authority
to function without the provincial marketing
boards.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD (King's): At the
present time provincial marketing boards can
market only within the province; they cannot operate in respect to interprovincial or
export trade. Canada requires a federal board
to function in co-operation with the provincial
boards, and to have authority to supervise
marketing net only within the provinces but
in interprovincial and export trade as well.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: The federal legislation would have to be dovetailed in with
the provincial laws?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD (King's): Yes.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Is that the plan my
honourable friend is advocating now?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD (King's): That is
the plan I advocated a year ago in my
remarks on the address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: This measure does
net do that yet.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:

It

never will do

MARCH 27, 1947
Hon. Mr. McDONALD (King's): I might
mention that when this bill was under discussion in another place the minister was asked
if the overaîl marketing bill, which had been
suggested a few days before, would not do
what hie wanted done at the present time;
and hie stated that it would not, that the bill
whieh had been suggested by the Canadian
Federation of Agriculture could not be made
to do this emergency job, and that the bill we
are now considering was necessary for that
purpose-that is, to help him to funnel the
agricultural prodticts as to which he has made
commitments to the Old Country, for this
year and probably for the next two or three
years.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I am sorry to interrupt again, but in ail ýthese agreements now
in force are the prices for each commodity
determined ahead?
(King's): Yes.
Hlon. Mr. McDONALD
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The prices are
established?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD (King's): Yes. A
very important amendment was made in cammittee in another place, by adding subsection
(b) ta section 5 of the measure, making it
possible for the government ta continue the
co-operation which it has given to our apple
marketing boards under the war measures and
emergency legisiation since 1939 in disposing
of aur apple crop..
So that honourable senators who are not
familiar with the marketing of our apples may
understand it better, may I explain that
before the war 85 per cent of Nova Scotia
apples were marketed in Britain. A smaller
percentage of the British Columbia crop also
went overseas. In other fruit-growing provinces most of their supplies found a market
at home. It will be readily understood that,
had we not been able to market the large
quan'tity which we did market in Britain, it
would have been impossible for Ontario,
Quebec and New Brunswick to market their
apples at home, because British Columbia and
Nova Scotia would have over-loaded the
home markets.
In the first year of the war, when shipping
was most dificuit, that portion of our apple
crop that was sold abroad had to be disposed
of as processed apples, that is either dehydrated
or canned; but as shipping has eased we have
been gradually getting more and more of our
green fruit on the English market, until last
year 600,000 barrels were sold in Britain from
Nova Scotia alone.
It had been our'earnest hope that Britain
could take a like quantity again this year.
Then the balance could have been marketed

247

at home. But recently our fruit-marketing
board, which had been endeavouring to arrange
an agreement for this year, received word that
the British Government was desirous of
spending their limited means for more concentrated food produets.
At the present time, however, our government officiaIs are reopening negotiations. Since
this country contributed a billion dollars,
hesides lending another billion, ta Britain,
and in view of the fact that aur appleis wauld
give their people a welcome'change in dietwhich should also strengthen their moralewe sincerely trust that they may change their
decision.
Should these negotiations between the
British and Canadian Goveraments break
down, or a decision nat be arrived at within
the next few days which would guarantee aur
fruit growers the cost of production, the situation wauld indeed be very seriaus and wauld
seem ta justify a continuation of gavernment
financial assistance for the marketing of this
year's crop.
It is important that the fruit growers know
within a few days that they will reýceive cost
of production, for the flrst spraying, which is
sa important in growing a goad crop of fruit
and in contralling some of the pests, must be
applied very soon: in fact, it should be already
under way in British Columbia.
I say this because I know from experience
that it is going ta be very difficuit, ta protect
orchards and the moneythat has been invested
by the goverament during the war years ta
save this valuable industry, uniess the fruit
grorwers knoyw that they are assured of a fair
return on the considerable investment which
is required in successfully *growing a crop of
apples. Our fruit growers properly argue that
the unfortunate situation in Great Britain is
nat of their making, but is a direct result of
the war.
The critjcism. has been raised that the minister ought not ta be empowered ta enter into
new agreements without the ratification of
parliament. The minister indicated, that it was
nat the intention of the goverament ta enter
into new agreements except as ta apples. The
power is necessary in order to. make revisions
fram time ta time in the ternis of existing
agreements. Obviously, it would be impractical ta insist that no agreement corne into
force unless ratified by parliament; the long
delays which wauid resuit from such a provision would icave the producers in doubt as
ta the market for their commodities, and make
intelligent advance planning of their market
production impossible.

248

SENATE

Finally, it has been argued that the coinmodities concerned could be sold at much
higher prices elsewhere, and. that the farmer is,
in effect, subsidizing cheap foodstuffs. There
is sume ti uth in this contention; but it must
be realized that to open the American market
to our farmn products, for instance, would make
it impossible to bold down food ýprices in this
country, and would cause Britain hardships
wvhich might prevent bier recovery as our best
long-term market for agricultural produce. It
would be a short-sighted policy, I submit, for
the farmers to sacrifice the British market for
immediate gains. If a world fond surplus
develops in a few years, the generous treatment niow being afforded the United Kingdom
should pay handsome, dividends to the producers of this country.
Detailcd criticism of this bill migbt perhaps
he dealt with more adequately in committc,
where the proper officiaIs can supply foul
information on the various points which may
ýbe brought up for discussion.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I am seeking information, and I know that the honourable senator
who explained this bill to us is well informed
on ail tliese agricultural matters. As I understand it, only the dominion Marketing Board
can ship to Britain. Is that correct?
Hon. Mr. McDON'\ALD (King's):
riglit.

That is

Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I want to know whether
any tbought bas, been given to sending perishable fruits overseas by air. I have often
wondered why we do not try to transport by
air some of our Canadian peaches to the
British market, so that they would compete
with other peaches whicb some of us saw
there, and wbicb were selling at very high
prices. I believe a valuable market is available
in Britain for the Canadian fruit grower.
Could the honourable senator tell me anytbing
about that?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD (King's): I suppose that the determing factor in that situation
would be the almost prohibitive cost. Tbe
fruit packages are quite bulky, and I arn
afraid that enough could not be transported by
plane to make the enterprise profitable, unless
the peaches were sold at a tremendously bigh
price in the Old Country.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: When we were there
last year, peaches were selling as bigb as $1
and 81.50 apiece, which seemed to me a pretty
good price.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Would the senator
think it possible to attach tn that bill an
appendix showing the agreements that are
being effected by it?

Hon. Mr. McDOýNALD (King's): I should
say yes; but I might add that they are to be
fotind in pampblets wbicb bave been printed.
1 bave in my office a pamphlet sbowing tbe
various contracts that bave been entered into
and tbe ones flow in existence.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I wondered if a

-could be attached to the bill. That is a
small matter tbat could be attended to in

Hon. Mr. McDONALD (King's): Informqtien on quantities and prices may be found

BEAIJHARNOIS LIGHT, HEAT AND
POWER COMPANY BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. A. B. COPP moved the second reading
of Bill S4, an Act respecting the Beauharnois
Light, Heat and Power Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to authorize the Governor General in Council to grant the application of the

SENATE
Beaubarnois Ligbt, Heat and Power Company
for the right to divert for power purposes
frorn the St. Lawrence River, through the
cornpany's power canal, ail the surplus water
available over and above the amount required
for navigation and for other companies holding
leases to water rights on this section of the
river. At the present time this cornpany and
three other companies are authorized te divert
a total of 167,472 cubie feet of water per
second, and I arn informed by the dopartmental engineers that 240,000 cubic feet per
second can be diverted without in any way
interfering with navigation on the river. The
right to use water was first given to the
Beauharnois cornpany in 1931. The procoduro
is that parliarnent authorizes the Governor
General in Council to grant rights to these
diversions aftor careful investigation as to
whether they will interfere in any way with
navigation. It is reported to me that the
Departrnent of Transport, under whose jurisdiction this matter cornes, has rnade certain
investigations and is of opinion that the diversion applied for by the Beauharnois cornpany
can properly be rnade. The bill does flot
confer any powers on the cornpany; it rnerely
authovizes the Governor in Council to permit
the additional diversion if investigation shows
that it would flot interfere with navigation on
the river.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Did this bill originate
in the Senate?
Hon. Mr. COPP: Yos.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: I assume that it wjll
be referred to a cemmitteo. I recali that the last
tirne that it was proposed te grant additional
water to this cornpany the bill was referred
to our Cornmittee on Banking and Commerce,
to whior representations wore made by the
Canada Stearnship Lines, arnong other interests. to the effect that the granting of the
additional water would cause navigation to
be irnpeded.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Tbat is se.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: It is my impression
that we inserted in that bill a clause reserving
to the Canada Stearnship Linos the right to
dlaim darnages frorn the Beauharnois Liglit,
Heat and Power Company if the diversion
interfered with the navigation of thoir sbips
frorn Kingston to Montreal through the rapids.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCIC: Why is this bill flot

The Hon. the SPEAKER: I think the point
of the hônourable senator from Parkdale (Hon.

My honourable friend was a littie late in

second reading could flot have heen proceeded
with.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I made mny objection as soon as I could get to my feet. This
is another instance of the steam-roller methods
tba.t are being used in this bouse.

BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. COPP: HÉonourable senators, I
wish to make a short statement as to some
matters in whicb we are all interested. It bad
been hoped that the Senate would adjourn
today for a three weeks' .vacation, but we shall
onlýy be able to do this if we receive the
supplementary and interim supply bills this
afternoon or evening. It has always been the
practice to delay the sending of supply bills
to us--perhaps I should say, rather, that that
bas been the practice ever since. I have been
a member of the Senate. I have neyer been
close enough to the different governiments in
power to learn just why these measures are
delayed to almost the very last minute. This
is not said in any spirit of criticismn at ail,
because there may he some very good reasons
for this delay. It bas been quite a number of
years sin-ce I was a member of the government
and familiar witb the inside workings.
I was in communication witb the Minister
of Finance this morning and was led to believe
from him, as well as fromn a statement i the
press, that he was to introduce the suýpplementary and interim supply bills in tbe other
bouse at the openîng of this afternoon's sitting.
H1e hoped that if the debate there was not
prolonged the bills could be sent over to the
Senate by five or six o'clock, or probably a
little later. It is expected that that bouse will
flot sit tonight, but that it will adjourn at six
o'clock, for a reason not disclosed to me.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I can tell the bonourable
gentleman wby.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I hope we shall receive
the bills in tirne to have the Royal Assent this
afternoon or early in the evening. I therefore suggest that the Senate adjourn during
pleasure, to, resume at the cail of the bell.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I can tell the acting
leader (Hon. Mr. Copp) tbat a very important
meeting is to be beld tonigbt, starting at seven
o'clock. I might also inform him that I said
to the acting leader of the opposition in
another place: "You will eitber get the bills
over to the Senate today or starve to deatb."
I tbink we can rely on bis assurance that tbey
will be sent over to us today.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
The sitting was resumed.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, tbe
interim and supplementary supply bills have
not yet been received, but they are expected
in the course of a few minutes. I suggest
that we adi ourn during pleasure.
The Senate adj ourned during pleasure.

The sitting was resumed.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, I
have to make another explanation to the
bouse. A few minutes ago word came to us
that the other house was going to meet at
eight o'cloek and finish the bis, and then
send them to us. The Speaker of that house
had left the chair, but hoe bas now returned.
For the time being ail that we can do is take
a further recess.
Hon. Mr. JONES: Shall wo meet again at
eigbt o'clock?
Hon. Mi. COPP: We hope to be able to
comiplete the business this afternoon.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: May I ask if it
is expectcd that tbis bill will come ovcr to us
this afternoon?
Hon. -.
%I. COPP: That is the understainding
now.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Should we not adjourn
to a dcfinite time?
Hon. Mr. COPP: In the circumstanccs it is
not possible to do that.
The Scnatc adjourned during pleasure.

The ýzittiog wvas resumed.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, the
supply bis have not yoî bcen passed in the
othor house, which 1 undcîstand is going to

now suggest that His Hlonour the Speaker
eall it six o'clock, and that wo roassomblo at

message of congratulations was sent to 11cr
Royal Highness by the Governor General, and
yesterday afternoon the other bouse associated
itself witb this message. I feel sure that the

as joining in the expression of hearty and loyal
felicitations and good wishes to Her Royal
Highness.
Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. G. V. WHITE: Honourable senators,
in the unavoidable absence of our leader on
this side (Hon. -Mr. Haig), I desire on his
behaif to associate ail our colleagues here
witb the expression of hearty and loyal
congratulations to Her Royal Highness
Princess Elizabeth.
Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN (Translation): Hlonourable senators, on hehaîf of ail the Frenchspeaking members of this bouse, I arn happy
to support the remarks made by the acting
leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Copp).
We rejoice most heartily at the. coming of
age of aur most gracious Princess Elizabeth.
We are proud to associate ourselves with the
leaders of the Governmenit and of the Opposition in extendîng to Her Royal Highness,
with aur respectful homage, our most sincere
wishes -that she may enjoy health, prosperity
and happiness and, in due course, a long and
auspicious reign aver her peoples, amnongst
whom none are more loving or more faitbful
than the French Canadian people.
We pray that Providence may grant ber in
abundance the gifts of the Holy Ghost, wisdom, intelligence and knowledge, to help ber
to discharge the heavy duties of ber exalted
office with the dignity, zeal and devotion at
ahl times exempfified by our gracious
Sovereigns and their forebears.
We join with the leaders of the Government

w-ho followed closely the spectacular tour of
our countn- by Their Majesties, a few years
back, were moved by the manner in which
the King and Queen carried out tbeir duties,
without regard for their own fatigue or inconvenience. That was in accord witb wh&t I
consider the finest tradition of the English
Royal Family. Whenever the Royal Family
accepts a duty it fulfils it faithfully and with
serenity.
It is my wi that our future Queen may
be endowed with ail the qualities of ber forebears. 1 wish particularly that she may
possess the smile of ber mother, a smile that

CANADIAN

WHEAT BOARD BILL

SECOND

READING

The Senate resumed fromn Thursday, March

27, the adi ourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Copp for the second reading of
Bill 23, an Act to amend the Canadian Wheat
Board Act, 1935.
Hon. NORMAN McL. PATERSON: Honcurable senators, statisties and figures are as
a rule tiresome, but I have seine te present
to the house tcday. which I think you may
find informative and perhaps interesting. The
first wheat shîpment out cf the Canadian
West was in the year 1872-less than one
thousand bushels. As production was increasing rapidly each year, an effort was made in
1883 to estahlish a common trading market.
This did not succeed till 1887, by which time
the West was producing fourteen million and
exporting approximately 10,500,000 bushels cf
wheat. The first president cf the Winnipeg
Grain Exchange was D. H. McMillan, afterwards Sir Daniel MeMillan, LieutenantGovernor of Manitoba. In bis remarks at
the first meeting cf the exchange in 1887just sixty years agc--he said;
By regularly meeting, we have already dons
much te secure a regularity in the methods cf
purchase, sale, shipment and delivery of grain
and by general consultation and discussion we
have made possible if net easy the prompt
settlement of disputes. I think that our associatien bas been eminently successful in facilitating
the efficient rapid transaction cf business between its members and shows in marked contrast
with the difficulties formerly experienced when
those engaged in this business were scattered
over the city without any general resort or time
cf meeting. The benefits cf the exehange are
net confined te those doing business in the city
and, that persons engaged in the foeur and grain
83168-17
5EV15

257

trade throughout the province appreciate its advantages, is established by -the fact that we have
twenty-one non-resident members.
The exehange had as its ebject then, as
nuw, the following.
stitution:

I quote frein its con-

(a) Te compile, record and publish statistics
and acquire and distribute information respecting the grain trade, te premote the establishment and maintenance of uniform-ity in the busi-

ness. custems and regulations among the persons
engaged in the grain trade, te ýinaugurate just
and equitable principles in trade and generally
te secure to its members the benefit of legitimate
ce-operation in -the furtherance cf their business
pursuits.
(b) To organize, establish and maintain an
association, net for pecuniary profit or gain, but
for the purpose cf promoting objects and
measures for the advancement cf trade and comnmerce respecting the grain trade for the general
benefit of the Dominion cf Canada.
As the wheat acreage grew, se did the

exehange. Let me give this honourable body
somne amazing figures. For the first, three
decades the wheat crop only is given, as no
record is available cf the coarse grains till
1910. The crop for Manitoba, Saskatcewan
and Alberta cf wheat oniy was:
Bushels
1880.........................
1,154,000
1890 .........................
17,884,000
1900 .........................
23,457,000
From 1910 -on the figures are available for
the total crop, including coarse grains.

Wheat
(Bushele)
110,000,000

234,000,000
397,000,000

Total crop,
includinýg coarse
grains

(Bushels)
232,000,00a
605,000,000
784,000,000

513,000,000
840,000,000
565,000,000
1,3-43,000,00e
Those figures are really amazing.
1946 ......
400,000,000
834,000,000
The Winnipeg Grain Exchange grew with
the tremendous responsibility cf handling this
huge crop; and the gathering together cf elevater intereats, brokers, ship charterers, grain and
vessel insurance officers, government grain
inspectors, Board cf Grain Commissioners,
wheat pool officers, telegraph offices, weather
reportîng bureaus, etc., necessitated the building cf what at one time was the largest office

ling comprised the collection of grain from the
grower at country points, the loading into
railway cars and transferring to mills and/or
terminals or storage elevators, the shipment
by rail or steamer to seaboard and, finally,
shipment abroad, and the covering by insurance at each point. All of this movement
required huge bank credits, as cash must be
paid to the producer.
In 1933. at the world's grain conference in
Regina, Mr. R. A. Ramsey, then Assistant
General Manager of the Bank of Commerce,
said:
I should like to emphasize the importance of
the part whiclh the grain exchange takes in the
way of facilitating the financing of the marketing of our grain crop. The exchange is a highly
organized and efficient body which through the
operation of its associate company, the clearing association, serves to protect the trade, the
banks and the community at large, especially
the farmer. By reason of this protection, it is
possible for the trading companies to operate on
a capital, small in relation to the magnitude of
the transactions involved, with a saving which
is felt by all parties from the farmer to the
consumer.
I mention these incidents as I go along to
show the use and value of collective trading.
Investigations into the grain trade were
made in 1897 by a special conmittee of the
House of Commons; in 1899, by a royal commission to investigate the marketing of grain;
in 1906, by a second royal commission on the
marketing of grain. Neither of these two
royal commissions reported adversely on the
Winnipeg Grain Exchange. In 1907 the late
Judge Phippen gave a clean bill of health to
the exchange. In 1909 the Manitoba government entered the grain business. It bought
and operated a large number of country eleva.tors. thus applying the principle of public
ownership and operation to the grain trade for
the first time in Canada. The venture was not
prosperous and the elevators were sold back to
the trade. In 1921 the Dominion government
created a royal inquiry commission to investigate the handling and marketing of grain. It
is a noteworthy fact that not one of the commissions, either provincial or federal, that
nvestigated the grain trade, reported adversely
on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange. In 1925
the Royal Grain Inquiry Commission presented the Turgeon report-and by the way,
the author of that report is a brother of the
senator from Cariboo-and it found the grain
exchange and futures trading to be of great
benefit by facilitating transactions and saving
costs to tle producer. The next royal inquiry
commission, known as the Stamp Commission,
concluded its report by saying:
However, in brief our answer to the questions
submitted is that in addition to the benefits
reflected to the producer in furnishing a systein

of insurance for the handling of his grain, and
in providing an ever-ready and convenient means
for marketing the same, futures trading, even
with its disadvantages of numerous minor price
fluctuations, is of distinct benefit to the producer in the price whichl he receives.
In the report of the Royal Grain Inquiry
Commission appointed June 27, 1936, Commissioner W. F. A. Turgeon reported in part
as follows:
Whatever attractions a compulsory government board may present at first sight, its practicability, in my opinion, will not stand analysis,
either from the point of view of overseas markets
or that of domestic conditions.
I have no doubt that the creation by Canada
of such a compulsory board, that is, a complete
selling monopoly of Canadian wheat, would be
regarded abroad as a further restriction upon
the freedom of trade and commerce, coming at a
time when our efforts should rather be directed
toward the removal of such restrictions. Within
the ambit of the grain trade itself, that is, in
the eyes of millers, merchants, etc., it would of
course be considered as an attempt or a design
to revert, in more intensified form, to the situation which existed, and which came in for
unanimous criticism overseas, in the last years
of pool marketing and under stabilization. It
would meet, I am sure with antagonism, at least
passive, and perhaps even active in some places.
There eau be no doubt that our overseas eustomers dislike and distrust monopoly, in itself,
and also because there is no saying where
successful monopoly miglt lead, and they will
certainly not contribute to making a success o
it. We would consequently be going into diminished markets, among many free conpetitors,
under a great handicap; because goodwill is in
itself a considerable aid in business and its imnow than
portance in our grain trade is greaterposition of
ever before. Besides, the technical
such a board would be most delicate. The great
volume of its holdings would add to its difficulties, because it would be under constant observation, and its actions in times of uncertainty
would have a magnified effect upon the market.
In regard to its difficulties, these have already
been touched upon. Not the least of them is
the fact that there could be no bargaining in
Canadian wheat as there is now and as there
would continue to be in respect of other wheats.
There being only one seller, there could be only
one price to all buyers instead of a number of
merchants and agents, all dealing in our wheat,
but on a competitive basis by reason of their
different positions, as was exemplified iu the
evidence given in London and quoted in chapter

IV.

The situation at home would also be disadvantageous to the producer, in my opinion.
This opinion is held by many whose experience
qualifies thein to express well-considered views.
Mr. John I. McFarland, who gave so much of
his time and ability to handling stabilization
and who was the first Chief Commissioner of
the Canadian Wheat Board, did not favour the
closing of the Winnipeg Exchange, nor did Mr.
J. R. Murray, who succeeded Mr. McFarland
as Chief Commissioner. Mr. McFarland thought
that our best policy for the future was to continue the futures market, under supervision,
with the present wheat board in operation, but
te was opposed to a compulsory board except in
case of emergency.

APRIL 23, 1947
Whenever world conditions cause a fall inprices, there are always voluble agitators who
blame the exchange and want it closed.
When the present wheat agreement was
under consideration, no doubt the minister
had in mind the possibility of a rapid fall in
prices influenced by the stricken nations
going back to increased crops and being unable
to buy and pay cash. In case this consideration influenced the short sale of six hundred
million bushels, let us look at what happened
after the first war. It is reasonable to think
history will repeat itself.
Trading in grain was prohibited by order of
the board effective September 1, 1917. The
price of wheat, fixed by the board from September, 1917, to August, 1918, one northern
basis Fort William, was $2.21; fromn August,
1918, to August, 1919, one northern basis,
Fort William, was S2.24-ý. The market
was opened July 21, 1919, and by July
29, 1919, it had ad'vanced to $2.45. The
market was then closed by order of the
government. It had been open only six days
and was closed in a somewhat peculiar way.
The government cs.lled a conference ini
Ottawa on July 28, without the exchange
being represented. No apparent investigations
were miade of the transactions that had taken
place while the market was open. No questions were asked of the amount of trading
done or the quality of the trading. No provisions were made with regard to such trades
,as had been negotiated. It is suggested that
the increase in price was what led the
government to change its plan. It had been
stated that farmers were in favour of closing
the markets and of the government undertaking to buy and sell the wheat. But there
was no evidence whiatever that the producers
of grain at that stage asked the governent
to close the markets. On July 31, 1919, the
government issued an order in council under
the War Measures Act providing for the
marketing of the wheat crop during the
coming twelve months. The Canadian Wheat
Board came into operation. The systema
adopted by the government wasias follows:
The governmerÀt eommnandeéred the wheat
after'it had been shipped from the farma and
taken to the elevator or railway. Then, after
having commandeered the wheat, the government acted as agent or commission merchant
for the producer. The governmnent gave the
producer an advance and a promise of a
balance at the end of the year. The advance,
which was set at $2.15 per bushel, amounted
in reality to a fixed minimum price. But as
the price of wheat in the internationâl market
would vary during the year, the government
83168-17J

259

did not pay each farmer the full prie of the
wheat as based on the international price at
the time hie delivered his wheat. What the
government received over $2.15 per bushel
was divided at the end of the year among
the farmers, according to the grade and weight
of their wheat. During this period while
wheat prices were controlled by the Canadian
Wheat Board, the producer received from
August 16, 1919, to August 17, 1920, for one
northern wheat, a cash payment of $2.15; on
July 9 an interimn payment of 30 cents per
bushel, and on November 4 an interim payment of 18 cents; a total of $2.63 per bushel.
The market was again re-opened by the
government on August 18, 1920. The price
at the close that day was $2.73ý, and climbed
to $2.77ý by the end of August.
It would be easy to go baek over the record
-beginaing in 1920, with the inerease in tariffs
in the United States, and carrying through
to the Ottawa treaties of 1932-to show that,
far from being a time of free trade, the 1930's
marked the culmination of swiftly rising protectionist policies the world over. This was
indeed the hey-day of bilateral deals like the
present wheat agreement; of quotas; of
embargos; of exchange devaluations and
restrictions; of arbitrary valuations for customns
purposes; of prohibitive ad valorem and
specifie tariff duýties. France in 1920 had a
tariff on wheat in Canadan money of Il
cents per bushel. In 1935 it was 85 cents per
bushel, but in the years of extremely low
prices it had been 81.70 per bushel. Germany
in 1922 had imported wheat duty free. In
1935, the tariff was $2.27 per bushel. Italy'had
no tariff in 1921, and in 1935 a rate of $1.07
per bush el. The United States had admitted
wheat iii 1921 at 10 cents per bushel; in 1935,
at 42 cents per 'bushel. The United Kingdom
had put in a fixed domestic price and import
restrictions. What happened in the 1930's was
that Canada's export surplus of wheat feil upon
a restrjcted world market, which was unable to
sustain it. The market was restricted, flot
because this was the hey-day of free enterprise, but for the opposite reason. Freedoni
was the one thing lacking. This was the
hey-day of state interference with trade. This
will show more than anything else the cause
of falling prices: not the free and open
market, but just the reverse. But in any case
prices did not fall tii] 1930, or sixteen years
after the war was over.
The wheat dollar of 1939 is worth in goods
today just 79 cents so the price negotiated for
our wheat of 81.55 is not what it seems, but
on this basis will buy only $1.22J worth of

260

SENATE

goods; and if prices rise further in the goods
the producer buys, the negotiated price for
whcat may look worse.
Let us look at the situation today. First,
let us look et wbat happened in England. As
Englýand is a country of approximately forty
million people and their estimated requiremeots are six bushels per capita, their requirements normally would be 240,000,000 hushe1s.
In 1938 Great Britain and, Northern Ireland
grew 73.000,000 bu,,hels of wheat off 1,930,000
acres. For the following years the figures are:

In 1942, it was a matter of life or deatb to
grow grain on accotant of lack of shipping to
import, and the government gave very bigh
bonuses. Since the war is over the land bas
been put back to grazing for mucb needed livestock and partly because the miller is not very
fond of Engliali wheat. They will not encourage increased production again until they find
it impossible to get credit or dollars to import.
World wheat production in 1946 was 100
million helow the 1935-39 average, and in 1945
it was 700 million below the 1935-39 average.
The bogey of over-production is not yet at
our door, and the world price in the free market hovers around $3 per bushel for our wheat,
basis Fort William.
Great efforts are being made to get the
western producer te deliver bis wheat te
country elevators, but bie is vcry slow in doing
so, at the lower guaranteed price. The elevators at Fort William bave a cspacity of
90,867.000 bushels, and since last faîl have not
been one-third full. The samne is true of eIevators at stations in tbe country.
This short sale of 600 million bushels over
four years means the closing of the Winnipeg
Grain Exchange for four years more and in
that time the magnificent machinery developed
over sixty years may in great part ho destroyed. Already, the realization is growing in
England that governiment officials and ministers are incapable of showing the foresigbt
snd judgmenit of private traders who, in competing with one another and animated by the
profit motive, are corrected constantly by the
fear of loss and by the continuaI elimination
of the inefficent. Mr. Churcbill reeognized
this pninciple when he ssid in the British
House of Commons on March 12, 1947, in
part:

destruction of
The wanton and partisan ...
the Liverpool Cotton Exchange will be forever
lield against the distinguished record of the
President of the Board of Trade as an act of
folly aud of pedantry, amnounting to littie less
than bad citizenship.
An example of the effect of government
control is that memberships in the Winnipeg
exehange sold at $25.000 each in 1929 and
are now valucd at $2,500, just one tenth.
Through tax exemption the co-operatives have
taken fulil advantage of their preferred position and cut deeply into the business of the
members. For your information I would like
to give you a few more figures. Under private
initiative. partly government and co-operative,
there has developed in Western Canada perlisps the finest systemr of grain storage and
cleaning elevators in the world. In the three
prairie provinces the country elevators number 5,451, with capacity of 191,536,000 bushels.
The terminais at the head of the lakes numbcr 28, with storage capacity of 90,867,000
The elevators in eastern Canada
bushels.
have a capacity of 85.100,000 bushels. The
total license1 storage capacity of elevators in
the eastcrn and wvestern divisions in Canada,
not including temporary storage, is about
423,339,000 bushels, and to close the market
and nationalize the grain trade requires the
most careful consideration.
At this point migbt 1 quote from our
respected Ambassador from the United States,
the ilonourable Ray Atherton, who said in an
address before the Canadian Lumbermen's
Association in Montreal:
The economists and other experts discuss state
trading in teclinical and beautiful language; no
constellation of words, however, can alter the
f act that government monopoly in external trade
cannot for long exist except in combination with
goveromneut monopoly in (lomestie business. You
can start at either end. if you decide to substitute government control for private freedom
Again, 1 believe that North
of enterprise.
Americans will start at nieither end. But let no
deceive himscîf that state trading is not
mnan
starting at one enl. IT IS. We North Amenicana believe in f reedom of choice. But let us
bo dlear as to what our method, our idea, is,
what it bas done for us and what it will continue to do for us. 1 refer, of course, to the
Canadian-American idea of the trade of free
men. This idea bas worked out pretty well. It
bas crested a volume of international trade unmatched by any otber system or comnbination of
systems. Applied internally it bas created within
each of our two countries greater prosperity
thian any other idea bas ever created anywhere
at sny time in bistory. This ides may not be
perfect, but bow mucb do you expect of an
ides, anyhow? Cannot weak sud mortal mankind bc excused for respecting and cleaving to
an idea, wbicb is demonstrably tbe best one yet,
even if it is. equally demonstrably, flot perfect?

APRIL 23, 1947
To follow this up, the government has now
issued orders controlling aIl coarse grains
except rye, which, by the way, is quoted
currently at $2.85 per bushel of 56 ibs.
This bill, honourahie members, must he
looked at very closely. Part II bas no time
limit and it puts under direct control ail elevators, steamships, railways and every facility
concerned with the grain trade. It must,
therefore, be apparent to thjs honourable body
that this bill should be carefully considered by
a committee. Every effort should be made
to get ail the best information possible, as
certain things which might happen-perhaps
further inflation, or buyers' inabiity or
unwillingness to carry out this deal-may
make it of very littie value; and in any case
powers should certainly flot be granted beyond
the fixed price date now decided on, namely
1948. To the best of my knowledge, no
exporter or member of the exchange has been
so far consulted about the deal; and a short
sale of 600 million bushels should have had
consideration and advice from aIl parties tobe affected. This matter in another place
was flot referred to a standing committee
where witnesses could be called.
The bill raises many and serious questions.
For example: whether the public should
underwrite this colossal and unprecedented sale
of wheat futures; wbether the pool period
should be an annual or a five-year period;
whether the legislation should expire in 1948,
with the provision that it mnay be continued
by order in council; whether part II, with the
board's permanent control over elevators, milîs
and railways, is necessary; whether part IV,
with its prohibition of interprovincial. trade,
goes further than need be and strikes a new
history-making blow at freedom of 'trade
between the provinces. Truly these are grave
questions.
Part II gives the board an all-embracing control, and for aIl time, upon elevators, mills,
grist-mills and railway transportation in so
far as it is related to the grain industry.
I am convinced that these controls are
excessive and dangerous and entirely unnecessary to enable our governmrent to carry out
its obligations under the United Kingdom
wheat agreement.
As I read section 121 of the British North
America Act, which says:
Ail articles of the growth, produce, or manufacture of any one of the provinces shail, from
and after the Union, be admitted free into each
of the other provinces,
I consider the spirit which moved the Fathers
of Confederation, and I feel that they will
turn over in their graves upon the day this
parliament sets up barriers to interprovincial

261

trade in Canada. Let us try every other means
before we split this dominion into nine watertight trading compartments. Particularly I
am aghast at the idea that this chamber should
now pass this bill and then, if study convinces
us that we were wrong in not making provision
for its earlier termination, should bring in a
new bill next season to take care of today's
haste and carelessness. I cannot be a party to
such procedures.
In my view a committee. of the whole
chamber will effectively shut us off from
enlightening information and is precisely the
opposite of what is required. What is wanted
are facts, and then debate upon facts, not
debate alone. In another place legislators did
not have the advantage of the assistance of
board officiais and other witnesses. I believe
the board officials-knowing them as I do to be
the capable and efficient gentlemen that they
are-will concede that the bill goes further
than they require.
We require to be satisfied that the controls
of this bill are essential. We should be derelict
in our duty and abandon the prime functon
cf this chamber if we approved this far-reaching bill in its present formi before we were
satisfied, after reasonable inquiry, that to do
so was our clear duty. If our inquiry convinces us that amendiments to the bill are in
the public interest, we must not shirk the
effort of study which will lead us to the proposing of such changes.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
we are deeply indebted to our colleague who
bas just spoken to the house on this important
measure, labelled "Bill 23." To those of us
who corne from Western Canada, and who are
familiar with the development of grain growing and marketing, the useful information hie
bas given is not new, but it is of very definite
value to us in our consideration of this
measure.
In a few weeks the war with Germany will
have heen over two years; and the war with
Japan, twenty months. It seems to me strange
that after this lapse of time we should still
be considering legislation based on a state of
emergency arising out of the war. By any test
that we wish to apply, this bill is an extraordinary measure. It is particularly so, when
we consider that we bave been at peace for
almost two years.
The underlyîng principle of this bill is
simnl,, fo make the business of handlinz and
marketing of grain a completely rigid state
monopoly. The bill in its effeet goes even
further than that.

262

SENATE

The government of 1935, headed by the
Right Honourable Mr. Bennett, now Viscount
Bennett, passed the Canadian Wheat Board
Act. The board wvas made to a considerable
extent an independent body. By the provisions of the bill now before us the board
is given extraordinary powers and is ma&an agent of the Crown in the business of
marketing Canadian grains produced over a
large area in Canada. This bill provides that
a farmer cannot seli his grain on the prairie
provinces, a railway company cannot transport it, nor can a grain clevator bandie it
witbout the permission of the wheat board
and in accordance with its regulations.
I do flot wish to be unduly critical of this
proposed measure, but it is wortby of note
that bv the existing order in council under
whieh the wheat board is operating, the board
-and it is not going ton far' to say thisis simply a braacb of the Department of
'rradc and Commerce.
Ia effect, this legisiation puts the whole
business of marketing grain ia western
Canada in a strait-jacket from whicb there
is no escape. For instance, if 1 am a farmer
in Manitoba 1 cannot buy a hundred bushels
of seed wheat from a farmer in Saskatchewan
without permission of the w'heat board; and
if in tbe ordinary course of my business 1
send a truck across the provincial boundary
to Saskatchewan to buy or take delivery of
a hundred bushels of wheat, and bring it
back to my farm for seed purposes, 1 can
be baled before the regular courts, and, as 1
understand it, can be fined or even imprisoned.
Another illustration of unusual power is that
no one can import breakfast fonds from the
ITnited States or elsewbere witbout authority
from the board.
Apart from the wisdom or lack of wisdom
of the wheat agreement, these are surely
extraordinary powers that are not necessary
to vcst in a wheat board for the purpose of
deiivery of 600 million bushels of wbcat to
Great Britain over a period of four years.
The senator from Tbunder Bay (Hon. Mr.
Paterson) bas given tbe bouse an idea of
the magnitude of the operations in grain. It
is an industry dealing witb hundreds of millions of dollars worth of property aad scores
of thousands of individuais. But the effeet
of making the wheat board an agent of tbe
Crown is that if any agent of the board at
any place or at any time does something
that works an injury to an individual grnwing grain or hiandling grain through an
elevator, that individual rannot sue in the
ordinary courts to seek compensation: bis
only recourse is to come, bat in hand, to

the Attorney General of Canada at Ottawa,
get permnission to sue the Crown, and tion
plead his case before the Exebequer Court.
Surely a provision of that kind is not necessary for carryiag out the simple objeet of
tbe wheat agrecment witb Britain.
Tbere are miany otber restrictions and limitations in this bill. 1 wish to make a protest
agaiast the principle that seems to guide
the framers of legislatinn 'these days. For
example, if it is sougbt to give some board
or other authority certain pnwers by Act of
Parhiament in order that certain tbiags may
be donc, there is a tendency to make these
pnwers as all-embratýing as possible, instead
of restricting tbem to what is necessary for
carrying out tbe immediate purpose. I submit to the bouse that this is not . a sound
principle of legislation. This wheat board or
any other public autbority tbat may be set up
under any other act sbould not hie given any
more tbaa the minimum power necessary to
carry out tbe purposes for wbicb it was
brought into being.
Some lion. SENATORS:

Ilear, bear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I wish simply to register tbat as my strong view on tbe principhe.
Wbat has occasioned this bill with these
extraordinary powers? It is tbe wheat agreemient negýotiated hast summer between the governmen:t of Canada and the government of
Britain. Under that agreement, which I dare
say ail bonourable senators have read, tbe
Canadian goverament selîs and undertakes to
deliver to tbe Britisb government in the period
commencing August 1, 1946, and ending July
31, 1950, 600 million bushels of wbeat. If I
wisbed to be really facetinus about this I
might say tbat it is one of tbe greatest
sbort sales ever known in -tbe bistory of the
world. Ia tbe first two years of this transaction tha Canadian gnvernment agrees to
deliver 160 million bushels eacb year at a
price of $1.55 f.o.b. Fort William.
In the
third year it agrees to dehiver 140 million
bushels at a price of $1.25, subjeet to further
negotiation; and in the fourtb year at a
price of $1, also subjeet to furtber negotiatien. I think -tbat under this agreement tbe
British government is obliged to ýtake these
quantities of wbeat at the prices I bave
mentioned for those respective years. It is
true that in December of ýthis year there are
to bie further negotiations hetween 'tbe
Canadian and British goveraments to consider a revhion upward of the price for tbe
tbird year, but tbat is going to be difficult
to arrange, because they are to meet in December of 1947 to consider wbat price sbould

APRIL 23, 1947
be charged seven months later. Who will
know what sort of crops will be produced in
that period? Who can tell what situation will
develop in international grain trade? I can
foresee for the Canadian negotiators considerable difficulty ini endeavouring to get our English friends to pay a higher price than $125.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: They are usually very
shrewd 'bargainers in matters of this kind. The
fact is that, while the British government
is paying $1.55 for wheat out of the 1946 crap,
which is now being marketed, the farmers are
receiving only $1.35 a bushal. In other words,
the purpose of the agreement quite obviously
was ta ansure the farmer a price of $1.35 a
bushel over a four-year period. Thýerefore,
the extra 20 cents per 'bushel received now,
plus the much higher prices received for grain
solci autside the agreement ta other countries,
will go into a pool fund and ho available to be
drawn an in the final years of the contract
should wheat values at that time have. declined
to, say, $1 a bushel.
However, in working that out there will be
seine injustices. For instance, as everyone
knows, in Western Canada we are subject to
drought periods over large areas of the country.
A farmer who in the years 194 and, 1947 has
a good crop, may have a very light crop or no
crop at ail in 1948 and 1949. IUnder this plan
such a farmer would be deprived of the privilege of getting the world price for his wbeat
when hie had wheat to salI. Although I have
not cheeked it recently, I think the world
price today is something of the order of $2.80
a bushel. Take another actual case-I arn
basing these points on facts within my ow~n
knowledga, and nlot on anything theoretical.
A Manitoba farmer produced a good crop of
wheat in 1946 and. sold it for $1.35 to the
Wheat Board., taking his chance that at the
end of the four-year period hie may get something back fromn the pool. However, hie has
since solcI bis farm. and moved off it, and somneone else is farming the land. Ha dos not
procluce any more wheat during the contract
period. What position is he going to be in
at the end of the four-year period, when perhaps tha pool may be required-this is possible,
though not likely-to supplement the lower
prices in the.final years. to bring it up to the
average of $1.35? If that should happen hae
would get no more than $1.35 for bis wheat,
whereas if he had been able to sell it in the
ordinary fashion, independently of these controis, hae might have realized, $1.75 or $2 or

I mention these thing)s, flot particularly in
criticisin but as an indication of the immense

difficulties that always arise when governments
get into this sort of business. It does seem to
Me' that, whiie proponents of the agreement
may have a fair argument to justify it on the
larger grounds, they must admit that in many
individual cases--yes, in thousands of individual cases-hardship is going to be worked.
This bill, which I described in opening as
an ëxtraordinary bill, is necessary if the wheat
bdard is ta be given the powers ta carry out
the ternis of the agreement, because the
National Emergency Transitional Powers Act
shortly lapses. When the agreement was made,
the order in council giving the wheat board the
extra powers necessary ta enable it ta carry
through the ternis of that agreement was
passed under the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act. Not only that, but as late as
April 3 this year an order in council was
passed for taking ov-er ahl the stocks of barley
and oats in western Canada, wherever they
were, fram the head of the lakes west. Quite
obviously soine injustices were done there.
For instance, I think it is quite an arbitrary
set ta axpropriate grain that a merchant bas
paid for-perhaps a merchant residing outside
of Canada-and ta deprive him of the oppartunity ta use it as he intended.
Be that as it may, what I want ta point out
is that this order in counicîl was passed under
the sa called emergency condition. I read from
the preamble of the order in council:
Wbereas it is necessary, by reason of the continued existence of the national emergency arising out of tha war against Germany and Japan,
for the purpose of maintaining, controlling and
regulating supplies and prices ta ensure ecanomie
stability and an orderly transition to conditions
of peace, ta make provision forTien follow the ternis of the order in council.
Naw, is there in Canada today any amergency that justifies the use of that legislation?
How long is the emergency going ta st? It
seems ta me inconceivable ta argue that there
is todlay a national emergency that justifies the
governmetnt iu passing an order in council
which completd-y monopolizes the handling
of grains in western Canada.
H1on. Mr. HARDY: Hear, hlear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I cannot understand it.
And in the preamble te this bill the samne
tbing is ciied. But where in this country was
the national emergency that justifled the passing of a aneasure to validate a wheat agreement
with anothar country? Was there a shortage
of foodstuffs in Canada? Was thera any
shortage of fleur? Was there any shortage of
any cereai praduct? Was thtere not a distribu.

Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN:

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The honourable
senator from Margaree Forks says there was
a shortage in Britain. That is true. But how
can you justify dealing with an emergency
in Britain under legislation that can only
deal with a national emergency in Canada?
I say the procedure was wrong. The government had other ways of implementing this
agreement with Britain. There is no doubt
that it could have gone into the open market
and purchased the wheat for Britain. The
United States Government is following that
procedure today. It was not necessary to
resort to this type of legislation to carry out
the terms of the agreement. The National
Emergency Transitional Powers Act, passed a
year ago last autumn, will soon expire. It
seems to me an extraordinary use of the
powers under that act to pass an order in
couneil, which we are now asked to validate,
creating a
complete government
wheat
monopoly in this country.
Honourable senators, I speak with some
conviction on this subject, because I deplore
the tendency everywhere today to increase
the powers of government and give it more
authority over the people. If under the
National Emergency
Transitional Powers
Act, the measure now before the house is
justifiable, it would be just as reasonable for
the government to ask that the lumber manufacturing business or the export and sale of
pulpwood and paper within Canada be
placed under a board similar to the wheat
board.
I wish to emphasize strongly that no
emergency existed in Canada to justify this
proposed measure. Because of the shortage of
food an emergency may have existed in
Great Britain, and Canada quite properly
should attempt to assist in relieving that
condition, but that does not constitute an
emergency in Canada. I am not a lawyerand I am sometimes thankful for it-but
it does seem to me to be stretching the
National Emergency Transitional Powers Act
a great deal to make it a basis for this
legislation.
The agreement has been made and, no
matter what I may think of it, J believe the
honour of the country is committed to it.
If the government of our country makes an
agreement, rightly or wrongly, with Great
Britain or any other country, on any matter
that is not subject to ratification by parliament, I believe that we are obligated to carry
through the terms of that agreement.

Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: The honourable
gentleman is not alone in that view.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I am sure that is the
view of all honourable senators. This bill
should go no farther than to give the government the powers necessary to carry out the
terms of the agreement. I therefore make the
suggestion that the bill be sent to a committee.
The honourable gentleman who explained the
bill (Hon. Mr. Johnston) suggested that it be
referred to the Standing Committee on Natural
Resources. I believe that the bill bas to do
with a matter of commerce, not with the production of wheat; 'and banking also may be
rather remotely related to it. For that reason
I think the bill should go to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
I have gone through the bill twice rather
carefully, and some sections are not at all
clear to me. For instance, section 2 (3) (d)
gives the board power to acquire, hold and
dispose of real and personal property. Does
that extend to the point of empowering the
board to acquire elevators to store and trucks
to deliver grain? The same subsection provides for the operation of elevators. I should
like some clarification as to why power to
operate elevators either directly or by agents
is required.
Section 2 (3) (j) empowers the board:
to act as agent for or on behalf of any minister or agent of His Majesty in right of Canada
in respect of any operations that it may be
directed to carry out by the Governor in Couneil.
Those are some features which require clarification. Honourable senators, we should not
take the passing of laws in a light manner. We
have no more important duty than to see that
the laws put on our statute books are, as far
as we are able so to make them, fair and just.
One further provision of the bill appears to
me to require some explanation. Section 18
(1), on page 9 reads as follows:
The Governor in Council may, from time to
time, empower the board to make inquiries and
investigations to ascertain the availability of
delivery and transportation facilities, supplies
of grain and all matters connected with the
interprovincial or export marketing of grain,
and for such purpose empower the board and the
several members thereof to exercise the powers
of commissioners or a commissioner, respectively, under Part I of the Inquiries Act.
Should the Board of Grain Commissioners
have a difference with one of the elevator
companies, or a transportation company, it
would seem rather an extraordinary procedure to appoint one party as a commissioner
to investigate the dispute. But as I interpret
the subsection, that could be done.
There is another point, which to my mind
I think is most important. I want to know
whether or not this bill would give wbat-ver

APRIL 23, 1947
governrnent rnay be in power, say, in the ear]y
part of 1950, authority to negotiate a new
agreement for a five-year period. That point
should be definitely cleared up. In part III
of the bill there is 'a section indicating that
these powers are intended to be carried beyond
the year 1950. 1 have no besitation in saying
that I would be utterly opposed, in a situation
anytbing like the present, to extending powers
of that kind to any goverfiment. If we are
going to move into the business of state trading, let the governrnent of the day. whatever
it is, tell parliament frankly whiat it proposes
ta do, and get the judgment of parliament on
the powers it seeks.
It seems to me that the penalties imposed
under this act need some scrutiny. For
instance, under section 34 no farmer ean
deliver a bushel of wheat to an elevator
without a permit book. That is the autbority
from the Wheat Board for the farmner to
deliver the grain, and the elevator agent to
accept it. If sorne police officer or inspecter of
the Board thusnks that a farmer bas donc
sornetbing wrong, hie can require the fermer to
surrender bis permit book, and it cen be beld
for fifteen days, during wbicb periodi the
farmer cannot deliver a busbel of grain to an
elevator. If the reguletians are violated in
certain ways, the farmer can be deprived of bis
permit book for a year. I am n ft bere to
excuse or defend any wrongdoing: of any
individual under the law, beceuse 1 am sure
I amn in agreement witb aIl my colleagues in
the bouse when I say tbat even if a law is a
bad one it is tbe duty of the citizen to observe
it and work to bave it cbanged. However, a
section that provides a fine or impriso.nment
for wbat rnay be relatively saah offences
sbould be studied before a committee in order
to see what justification there is for the
penalty.
Honourable senators, I have taken up more
time than I intended. The bill is very farreecbing in its implications. I see no national
emergency in Canada that justifies tbis legislation, wbicb to my mind is extraordinary
legislation. I repeat that if it is witbin tbe
poiwers of parliament to enact this bill, then
next week or next montb a me-asure could, be
brougbt in ta do preciseiy the same tbing to
the lumber and the pyulp and, paper industries,
and to any other industry in this country thet
experts or carnies on interprovinýcial trade. I
bope that those in autbority will refleet upon
the vast field ta wbicb the door is opened by
tbis Iegislation. If we are bea.ded for a
socialistie and, authoritarian state, let us proceed witb. our eyes open; let us bave the

I arn as convinced, that, as surely as I arn
standing bere adýdressing yýou tbis afternoon,
an overwhelming mai ority of the Canadien
people are against the principle embodied in
this measure. The bill sbould be considered by
a committee, and improved., if possible. It
sbould limit the board's powers to those necessary for carrying out tbe terms of the agreement. We sbould bave a definite and clear
understanding tbat no suibsequent agreement
will be made under eny powers given by this

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. A. B. COPP: Honoureble senators, I
bad no intention of taking part in this disc'ussion. My býonourable friend from Thunder
Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson) placed on our

the grain trade in the West, and I feel that
from an oratorical standpoint the discussion
on this bill bas been a very pleasant one. I bave
bad no experience wbatsoever in conneetion
witb the grain trade and would not for a

I have no doubt that officiels of the wbeAt

wes discussed in the other bouse for some
weeks, and wes finally passed and sent over

AGRICULTURAL

PRODUCTS BILL

SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Thursday, March
27, the edjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Copp for the second, reading of Bih!
25, an act to provide for the Sale and Export
of Agricultural Produets.

Hon. ANTOINE J. LEGER: Honourable
senators, the honourable senator from. King's
(Hon. Mr. McDonald), in explaining this bill
on the motion for second reading, dealt with
it from his own point of view and as such
acquitted himself admirably. He will excuse
me if in the discussion of the bill I take an
altogether different view and therefore do flot
The difference arises
meet bis arguments.
from the fact that he has accepted the gratuitous assertions contained in the preamble,
whilst I join issue on practically every one
of them.
The preamble reveals that the government
has entered into agreements with other governments for the sale and export of food
produets and supplies, and that these agreements wiIl continue in force. No net can
take exception to this, so long as it does not
interfere with the rights and liberties of the
people. But the context discloses that the
government wishes to fulfil these agreements
by requisitioning ahl kinds of needed agriculturel products, except wheat, anywhere, at
any time, in its own way, at its own price

wonderful resuit the government proposes
to establish commodity boards and advisory
committeles, appoint professional, technical
and other oficers-your guess is as good as
mine as to who they will be-employ clerks
and others. The number of each group and
the salaries to be paid are not reveahed.
We are told, however, that this body of
men will be paid out of money appropriated
by the Parliament of Canada and out of the

under the provisions of this bill. This would
suggest thet the government expeets to make
profits out of the requisitioned goods.
Disobedience to or non-compliance with
any of the provisions of the hi!!, or regulations yet to be made, will be subject to
criminal prosecution.
A definite period of duration, which may
become indefinite, is mentioned in the bill.
That, in niy view, is a brief analysis of the
objects and purposes of the proposcd legislatien, apart from the possibilities that may
arise froin its broad language and as yet
unframed regulations.
On the whole, this bu!l displays some of the
ingenuity and dexterity prevailing in some
of the depertments of the government since
the beginning of the recent war and used const-antly to create an excessive bureaucracy
and to centralize everything into one system
under the control of the federal government.
Although the Allies have enforced "unconditional surrender" upon the hostile nations,

APRIL 23, 1947
the preamble of this bill avers that the powers
sought to be obtained are still necessary to
assist in the "more efficient prosecution of
the war." A war where and with whom, we
may ask.
The preamble further reads:
.in order to assist in the relief of suffering
and the distribution of food supplies the Government of Canada entered into agreements for the
sale or export of food supplies to other governments or agencies thereof, which agreements
stili continue in force;
It continues:
it is necessary by reason of the existing
national emergency . . . to continue to seil and
export food supplies to distressed countries...
The two dominant positions advanced by the
government are the national emergeney and
the agreements for sale or expert of food supplies. My flrst contention is that the government cannot create a national emergency by
just mentioning it in the preamble of a bill
Such a condition must exist as a matter of
fact, and the government must prove that the
non-delivery of these food supplies would
affect in some detrimental way the wbole country as a nation actualIy engaged in the settlement of the peace of the world, before it can
oust the jurisdiction of the provinces or
encroach upon their rights in the matter of
property and civil rigbts. 1 need nlot mention
the position we occupy in the settiement of the
peace of the world.
The government must further estahlish that
it has tried to obtain these food productsin
the regular way, and that it has failed to do
so. I submit that if the governiment is wilhing
tô pay the usual and prevailing prices it can
thereby acquire more food supplies than hy
any means of direction,* requisition, compulsion or punishment as provided by this bill.
May I ask, has the governmçnt in any way
sought the aid of the provinces before trenching on one of the subject-matters entrusted
to the provincial legislatures under the Britisb
North America Act? If not, I say that this
bill must be consîdered neot only as ultra vires
but also as premature, not necessary and
against public policy. While I shaîl admit
that it will be easier to acquire these food
supplies 'by the regimentation, direction,
requisition, compulsion and punition provided
in this bill, yet un-der our constitution that
does not constitute a justification for the
infringement of the provincial prerogatives.
Some may say that the government bas now
to fulfil its obligations. The government knew
or should have known before it entered into
these agreements that no national emergency
nuch as contemplated by section 91 of the
British North America Act existed, and that
it bad therefore no contrai over property and
83168-18j

267

civil rigbts. I dlaim that the proper and only
way to deal with such a matter was either
to pay the prevailing prices or else to seek
the aid of the provinces. This bill is nlot only
unnecessary but it is unreasonable, as a measure more severe, stringent, imperative,
autocratic and against aIl rulea would not be
framed even for a people in flagrant default
and in open disobedience. And, would you
believe it, it bas the suave and virtuous title
of "The Agrîcultural Products Act." What a
farce!1
I assert that this bill is against public po.hicy
because it eneroaches upon a class of subjects
wbich is exclusively assigned to provincial
legisiatures by Section 92 of the British Nortb
America Act. It is an abuse of power because
it compels, witbout legal authority and witbout affording sufficient protection, tbe arbitrary delivery of food. supplies to the government for resale and tbereby restrains a man's
liberty to carry on bis trade or occupation ini
bis own way.
For instance, suppose a man bas contracted
in advance for the sale of the food supplies
whicb bie controls, and then the governiment
cornes along and says to tbat mari, "We bave
requisitioned these food supplies and you must
deliver them to us." H1e would be in this
dilemma, that if bie does not deliver these food
supplies Wo
wbere tbey were contracted for in
the first instance be will be liable to an action
of breacb of contract; and, on tbe other band,
if bie does not deliver tbe samne food supplies
to the government bie is hiable to prosecution
under this bill. So you can see in what position the agricultural elass migbt be placed
under this bill.
I do not want ta convey tbe impression that
this bill, if it 'becomes law, will be tyrannicahly
enforced; but aIl sorts of possibilities are
created under this legislation, and good laws
make good. government.
My conclusions are: that this bill is nlot
necessary, as the goverriment can abtain the
agricultural supplies wbich it needs by paying the usual and prevailing prices, and
bence there is no need of compulsion; that
the bill presupposes an emergency tbat does
not exist; that it is against public policy;
that it is ultra vires of the Dominion goverfiment; tbat the title is irrelevant to this bill;
tbat tbe preamble bas no foundation in factthat it is just a make-believe in a desperate
attempt to acquire jurisdiction-and that tbe
bill bas no menit per se, as the obligations
sought to be imposed are directed against
tbat class of people wýho are the least
favoured and the least organized, the agricultural class.

SENATE

Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators, I have just a few words to say on
this bill. I am not prepared to go as far
as the honourable senator who has just spoken
(Hon. Mr. Leger), but I gather from his
remarks that he can find no virtue whatsoever
in this bill.
May I point out that the greatest single
virtue that I find in the bill is that it provides-an exceptional thing in legislation
coming forward to us-for its own early
demise. To that extent I think it is commendable.
It recôgnizes the extraordinary
feature of the compulsion part of the bill,
and that it should receive an early termination as soon as it has served its purpose.
I am not too concerned at the present
t
ime about the suggestion that the bill is
unconstitutional, because fortunately we have
law courts.
If the government and the
proponents of this bill, under the guise of
national emergency, are attempting to enact
something that is not constitutional, then the
citizens who are affected by a law of that kind
have their remedy in the courts to question
its constitutionality. In considering approval
of such a bill as this, honourable senators
might very well find it advisable to give not
only their own consideration but to get the
opinion of our Law Clerk as to the constitutionality of the measure, because I do not
think we want deliberately to give our
approval to a measure as law, if we feel reasonably certain that it is not constitutional.
However, the question of constitutionality, in
the circumstance that there is a very short life
to the bill, does not give the same concern to
me as do some other measures that have been
before us. I might point out, however, that
the purpose of the bill is to enable the government to complete and carry through ta conclusion certain agreements that were entered
into in a time of real emergency. Some of
them were entered into during the period of
the prosecution of the war and still have some
time ta run. It is the desire of the government to complete these agreements, and I
think, as a previous speaker said this afternoon
in relation ta another bill, if our country is
committed ta an agreement we must find some
way of keeping our obligation under that
However, whether or not we
agreement.
approve of the principle that the government,
in order to carry -out its obligation under an
agreement, may by compulsion confiscate or
commandeer agricultural products, wherever
they may be found in the country, at prices
not greater than the prices to which they have
committed themselves in the sale of these
products, is another question. When the

government commits itself ta an agreement to
sell agricultural products at a specific price,
shall we thereafter put our stamp upon a law
by which supplies can be commandeered from
people in the country at a price which will
enable the government to fulfil its agreement?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: On this very interesting
point, I wonder if the honourable senator can
tell us what is provided by the existing orders
in council under which these agreements are
being carried out?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I cannot answer that
question with any too great definiteness. I can
say that I think the bill is an attempt to put
in legislative form an authority that is already
provided by order in council. In other words,
it is an attempt to make legislative what is
now in force by order in council. What leads
me ta that conclusion is that it is provided that
the commencement date of this bill, even after
it bas been passed by both huses, shall be the
date on which the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act ceases ta have any force
and effect.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Do I understand the
honourable senator to say that this bill does
nat extend the powers of the Governor in
Council beyond those assumed under the
National Emergency Transitional Powers Act?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I understand from the
honourable senator who explained the bill
(Hon. Mr. McDonald, King's) that in only one
respect does it extend the powers beyond those
that have been exercised by order in council
and continued by the National Emergency
Transitional Powers Act. That one respect
applies to the handling of the apple crop.
May I say that the real principle involved
in this bill is whether the government, having
committed itself to an agreement, is willing to
purchase agricultural products at the prevailing market prices from those who produce
them, or whether parliament is to give the government legislative power to commandeer
those products at an arbitrary price, having
regard ta its commitments under the agreement.
For the purpose of voluntary purchasing
the government bas ample authority to act
now under two statutes passed by the Parliament of Canada in 1944 and 1946. They provide that the things contemplated under this
bill could be done, without any element of
For instance, the Agricultural
compulsion.
Prices Support Act, passed in 1944, provides
all the power required for the government to
purchase and export products to meet its contract. That act is found in the Statutes of

APRIL 23, 1947
Canada, 1944-45, Chapter 29. The board set
up under that act was given power under section 9 (1) (g) as follows:
To purchase at market or contract prices and
expert any agricultural produet under any contract between His Majesty in right of Canada
and any other government or -agency thereof and
to do ail things necessarily incidentai thereto.
So by an existing statute of Canada the
government lias the power it may require
under these agreements, except for the feature
of compulsion.
Under the Canadian Commercial Corporation Act, passed in 1946, Chapter 40 of the
Statutes of Canada, a corporation was set
up to be operated by the government. Section
4 of the act provides for the establishment
of the corporation for the following purposes:
(a) to assist in the development of trade between Canada and other nations, and
(b) to assist persons in Canada
(i) to obtain goods and commodities from
outside Canada; ad
(ii) to dispose of gods and commodities that
are available for export from Canada.
So under that statute of 1946 the government lias ail the power necessary to carry
through to a completion its obligation under
these agreements except, the power of requisitioning products in a compulsory fashion
and at an arbitrary price to be determined by
the government.
The word "extraordinary" bas been used
sO frequently that it has become almost
commonplace in talking about legislation.
Section 3 of this bill is an empowering section,
and sets out the powers of the minister, subj ect to any regulations that ma7y be made
by the Governor in Council. Having regard
to the section which I read from the Agricultural Prices Support Act, honourable members
will note the provisions of section 3 of this
bill.
Paragrapli (a) provides that the minister
May:
seIl or export agricultural produets to the government of any country or any ageney thereof
pursuant to any agreement made hy the Government of Canada with the government of such
country or with sucli agency and for those purposes may purchase agricultural produets and
make suc% arrangements for the purchase, sale
or export of agricultural produets as he conaiders
necessary or desirable;
There are more words in this paragraph
than in the one which I read from the Agricultural Prices Support Act, but one will
observe that the substance of each is the
same. Section 3 (a) of this bill gives the
minister power to do certain things. Strangely,
the compulsory feature of this bill cornes in
the power to make regulations. This strikes
me as an unusual feature, and honourable
senators may think sO too.

269

I wish to read section 5, but before doing
so, May I make the general observation that,
as I understand them, regulations are for the
purpose of împiementing the authority and
power granted under statute; they provide
machinery, like bylaws in a company, for the
purpose of making workable the authority
and power granted under the act. Section
5 (1) of the bill rmads as follows:
The Governor in Council may make regulations for carrying any of the purposes or provisions of this Act into effeet and, in particular,
but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, May make regulations requiring the shipment or delivery to or to the order of the minister or the storing for future delivery to the
minister of such agricultural products as the
Governor -in Council considers necessary for the
fulfilment of any contract for the sale or export
by Ris Majesty of the said agricultural products to the government of any other country or
any agency thereof and determining the prices
to be paid for or in respect of any of the said
products so shipped, delivered or stored, which
prices shail be based on the appropriate contract price and shahl bear -a proper and reasonable relationship thereto.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Would the honourable senator clarify my mind on the meaning
of the last few words of that paragrapli? I
cannot make head or tail out of themn.
Hon. Mr. RAYDEN: The only conclusion
I can corne to as to their meaning is that
the goverament is committed to agreements
with other governments, and is obligated to
supply certain agricultural products at stipulated prices. The regulations require the
owner of agricultural. products to dehiver them
at the order of the minister, who may determine the price which. shall be paid for the
products when they are expropriated. In
fixing the price, regard must be had to the
contract price at whieh the government has
committed itself to deliver the products to
other governments. That is the only interpretation I can give to those words. Whether
they are susceptible to any other interpretatien I do not know.
Honourable senators, I think that of necessity, bills involving such principle of compulsion should go to committee, in order
that we may learn the why and wherefore of
presenting legislation in this forma. I am
assuming that there will be a reference to
committee, and therefore have confined myself to a discussion of the principle of the
bill.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG- Honourable senators, the stand of the party of which I have
the honour to be leader in this bouse has been
very well stated by the honourable senator
who first spoke on this sida (Hon. Mr. Leger).

SENATE

I heartily ag-rer with all lie said, but I wish
to give to the house briefly the impression
that the bill has left with me.
First, it is a direct encroachment on the
jurisdiction of provincial legislatures of this
country. Second, it is a direct compulsion on
the agricultural producers of this country.
Third, it is substituting a fixed price for a
negotiated price.
There is a little history behind this legislation. If one looks up the record of another
place in the session of 1935, lie will find that
the government of that day introduced, a bill
dealing with wheat, in which this same principle was involved. It provided for a compulsory wheat board that could take grain
at a fixed price. The leader of the opposition
of that day, now leader of the government of
this country, objected, to that principle in very
clear and unequivocal language. With deference to that objection the then Prime Minister
referred the bill to a seven-man committee of
that house, composed of four men from the
government and three from the opposition.
The result of the investigation was a voluntary
bill.
Co-operatives, wherever they have been
successful, have been on a voluntary basis.
For instance, the great English co-operatives
are built on a voluntary basis. I am wholeheartedly behind the co-operative principle,
but it must have no compulsory features.
This bill is an attempt to take away provincial powers, something which we as members
of this house should vigorously protect. One
of our strongest obligations is to see that the
Parliament of Canada does not encroacli upon
provincial rights. Secondly, the bill evidences
the increasing determination of officials to
take over the arbitrary control of goods, on
the ground that they can sell them better
on the world market than the producers acting
through free agents. If that is the principle
that the majority of the people of this country want, well and good, but I personally do
not like it. I am much more strongly opposed
to this bill than to the Canadian Wheat
Board Bill. But, as was pointed out by the
honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden), the last section of this bill provides
that the Act shall expire on the 31st of
December this year, if parliament is meeting
in November or December; otherwise it will
expire not later than the 31st of March next
year, though by resolution of both houses it
may be extended for one more year. This
means that the Act will die. That very section
convinces me that the bill is not needed at all.
By purchasing on the open market the government could obtain all the commodities it
requires to carry out its contracts.

The bill has these three bad features: First,
the encroachment on matters within the
jurisdiction of provincial legislatures; second,
compulsion on farmers; and third, the fixing of
arbitrary prices by officials. I am opposed to
all three features. As was stated last session
or the session before by the honourable senator
from Lincoin (Hon. Mr. Bench), there seems
to be a feeling that permanent officials at
Ottawa are better able to judge what the
country needs than are the people themselves.
In these matters the difference between an
official at Ottawa and a business man is that
the official is gambling with other people's
money. That is a very important difference.
We as senators have on our shoulders a
tremendous obligation to sec to it that the
freedom of the individual to carry on his own
business is not interfered with except in cases
where it can be shown beyond a shadow of
a doubt that interference is in the interest
of the whole community.
Throughout all the years of the war I did
not raise my voice against any legislation
brought down by the government or any order
in council. I had no way of knowing whetlier
everything that we were asked to approve
was necessary for the winning of the war, but
I trusted the government. But now that the
war is over we as senators should be very
zealous to protect the rights of the people
to carry on business in their own way. If
we are not, there is no telling how far controls
may be extended. Today we are dealing with
restrictions on the sale of agricultural products,
but tomorrow restrictions may be proposed
on the sale of fish, and the next day on the
sale of pulpwood, and the next day on the
sale of men's labour. I should like to sec
this bill referred to a committee, and I
imagine that will be agreeable to the government. But I want to repeat a warning, that
as the war is over there should not be any
further encroachment on the liberty of the
individual.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, the question is on the motion for
the second reading of Bill 25, an Act to provide for the sale and export of agricultural
products. Is it your pleasure to concur in the

GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES COMPENSATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hlon. A. B. COPP moved the second reading of Bill 105, an Act respecting Compensation for Government Employees.
H1e said: My honourable friend from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden), has kindly consented to explain this bill.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators, there is nothing contentious in this
bill. Since the year 1918 we have had legislation providing for compensation for government employees. You will notice that the
hast clause of the bill provides for the repeal
of the act that is now in force, which is found
in the Revised Statuites of 1927.
I would say that the main differences
between this bill and the original act are
made necessary because of situations that
have developed by the setting up of boards
and Crown companies, and such things as
that, and the movement of government
employees outside Canada into positions of
danger or where they might be injured. These
situations were provided for during the period
of war by order in council, and now are being
taken care of by a government employees
compensation bill. Workmen's compensation
is, of course, a matter of provincial jurisdiction except as to Dominion government
In these cases government
employees.
emphoyees who suifer accidents are paid compensation by the Dominion government in
accordance with the workmen's compensation
laws of the province in which the accident
occurs. The scale of compensation is determined. by the provincial board, except in
Quebea, where I understand the system is
somewhat different.
The main provisions of this bill are as follows. FYirst, it continues the government employees compensation act as it now stands.
Secondly, it provides compensation for cases of
industrial diseases according to the prevailing
provincial haws; and thirdly, it extends compensation to employees of government corporations and boards. In addition, it provides for
compensation to employees in the Northwest
Territories, according to the laws of the Yukon.
It also provides for compensation to employees
temporarily working in the Yukon and the
Northwest Territories, according to the laws of
the province in which. they ordinarily reside.
It provides, too, for compensation to government employees who are injured in the course
of their work outside Canada, and it empowers

SENATE
the Governor in Council to make regulations
for providing compensation to government
employees who contract pulmonary tuberculosis in government liospitals.

stated that, I was unable to support the

APRIL 24, 1947
masure. I now wish ta give the bouse in a
few words tbe reasons why I intend to vote
against the mot-ion for third reading.
The bill was brauglit forward on behaif of
the Toronto Type Foundry Company Limited,
as the awners of certain Canadian patents
relating ta printing machinery. Honourable
senatars know that a patent is an exclusive
right gran'ted ta an inventor, for a period of
eighteen years, ta manufacture and use bis
invention ta the exclusion of everyane else.
Two of the patents ta wbicb tbis bill refers
have expired, and a number of others will
expire in the course af the next twa or three
years. Tbe bill seeks ta revive the twa patents
wbich bave expired and ta continue tbe life
of atber patents which have not yet expired, in
bath cases for an additional six-year period.
The reason given for seeking the revival and
extension of tbe life of these patents is tbat
tbe owners were unable ta use tbem during
tbe period of the war, and tbat they suffered
lass an tbat account. Tbey contend that it is
anly fair that they sbould be given the right
ta bave the exclusive use of tbese patents continued for a period raugbly equivalent ta tbe
periad of the war.
May I at once say, bonourable senatars, that
I have no criticism of the pramoters of this
bill. I tbink tbat in committee tbey proved
tbeir case that during the war tbey were unable
ta use these patents, at least ta their full
extent, and -that as a resuit tbey suffered lass.
Han. Mr. DAVID: What patents could they
flot use?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Ail the patents are
enumerated in tbe bull. They relate ta prînting machinery.
My apposition ta the bill is based entirely
an general graunds of public poiicy. In that
cannection may I say ta bonourable senators
what the practice is in the twa cauntries with
wbicb we are most clasely associated, Great
Britain and the United States?
In Great Britain general legisiation is provided under wbicb any owner of a patent wbo
dlaims he was unable to use bis patent during
tbe war and on account of war conditions, may
apply ta a court; and upon proper proof of
bis case the patent may be extended for a
period of five years, and ini some cases ten
years.
Han. Mr. QUINN: Can the same thing be
done in Canada?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: No, it cannot. I
sball presently deal witb tbat feature.
There is a good deal of reasan and justice in
tbe contention that a man who was unable ta
use his patent during the war, particularly in

273

Great Britain, where the whole industry of the
country was diverted ta war purposes for a
period of six years, shauld bave the life of the
patents extended.
On the other band, similar legisistion was
pro posed in the United States. but the Congress
refused ta adopt it. That country bas followed
tbe policy of refusing to allow any extension
of patents by reason of dlaims for inability ta
use tbem during the war. There are goad
reasons, no doubt, for that policy too. I
suppose the reasons would go something like
this: A patent is an exclusive right given ta a
man against the whole worid. It is a right
wbicb has ta be strîctly construed, and a man
accepts it subi ect ta any conditions or events
*-including war-that may occur during tbe
period that bis patent runs. After ail, one can
conceive of many other circumatances than
war wbich iniight prevent a man from using
bis patent as effectively as be wisbed wbile
it was valid.
Tbose are the practices adopted respectively
in Great Britain and the United States, and,
as I have suggested, there is sometbing ta be
said for eacb. But I submit tbat there is
littie, if anytbîing, to be saîd for tbe practice
ta which we should give our sanction if we
were ta adopt this bull. Tbat wouid be the
practice of introducing a private, bill in every
cas wbere a man desired tbe duration of his
patent ta ha extended, and of baving Parliament deal with every individual case on its
merits. I suggest to a niurable senators that
they consider wbat that would involve. I
suppose there are hundreds, if not tbausands,
of patent owneris in this country who could
dlaim with more or less justification tbat
tbey bad been prevented, in some degree
fromn using their patents as a result of
war conditions. I put it ta the bouse
that if we pass this bull we are likely
ta be inundateL dauring tbe next two or tbree
ye'ars witb similar private bis from, a large
number of patent owners.
I suggest that it is not tbe function of
parliament ta consider every single one of
tbese cases on its merits. As I bave said, in
Great Britain a man who seeks ta bave the
term of bis patent extended on the ground
of inability ta use during the war, may apply
ta the courts.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: We cannat do that
in Canada? We have no recourse ta the
courts in this country?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I am going ta
came ta that, if the hanaurabie senator wihl
permit me.

274

SENATE

There is this further consideration. If we
adopt the policy of allowing each individual
case to be decided upon a private bill brought
before parliament, shall we not be doing an
injustice to the patent owners who have not
sufficient resources to bring their cases before

could afford the not inconsiderable expense of
coming here and making an application to
parliament, but it would be a far different
thing for a man of moderate means who had
to come here from, say, Halifax or Vancouver.
May I interrupt
Hon. Mr. MORAUD:
the honourable senator? For the benefit of
those who were not at the committee meeting
will he, before he finishes, give us the opinion
of the departmental officers?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I entirely object to
that suggestion. Nothing that took place
in the committee should be discùssed in this
house. The rule forbids it.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I had no intention
of referring to a memorandum which had
been submitted by the officers of the department. I agree with my honourable friend
from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger), because
the Senate can reach its own conclusion on
this matter without the benefit of any outside
opinion.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Then what was the
use of having these experts appear before
the committee?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: To give information
to the committee.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I should like to hear
cited the rule upon which the honourable
gentleman from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger)
bases the assertion that no reference can be
made in this chamber to what has taken place
in a committee.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: If the Clerk will hand
me May's Parliamentary Practice I think I

shall be able to find the rule in a few seconds.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: This question does
not arise in connection with my remarks, as
I have no intention of referring to what took
place before the committee. The basis of my
objection to the bill is that it attempts to
deal by private legislation and for the advantage of one applicant with a matter which, if
it is to bc the subject of legislation at all,
should be the subject of general legislation
for the benefit of all.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: It would be interesting
to know when the patents were acquired and
if they were exploited before the war.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I think there is
no question that they were exploited.
It may be that any one of three courses is
open to a senator who opposes the third
reading of the bill, as I do. One would be to
move for reference back to the committee.
It seems to me that that is not necessary in
this case, because the question presented by
the bill is one of general policy, as to which
the Senate itself should decide. The second
would be the time-honoured device of moving
that the bill be read the third time this day
six months, but I do not know that it is
necessary to indulge in that technicality.
The third course, and the one that I propose
to follow is to vote against the motion for
third reading.
I do suggest to my honourable colleagues
that they give careful consideration to my
point that it would be a very serious matter
to attempt to deal by private legislation with
a matter which, if it is to be dealt with at all,
should form the subject of public legislation.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Does the company
need this legislation in order to continue
operating successfully?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: No evidence on
that point was adduced before the committee.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: The honourable senator
promised to answer my question, but he has
not donc so yet.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: My honourable
friend's question was whether under existing
legislation there is any provision whereby
owners of patents may have the term of
their patents extended by the courts, on the
ground of inability to use the patents during
the war. The answer is, that there is not. The
point I was trying to make is that there either
should or should not be such a provision, as
parliament may sec fit, but that the matter
should not be dealt with piecemeal by legislation applicable to only one patentee.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: But in the meantime
what is the company going to do?
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Its only recourse is to
apply for private legislation.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Until we hear quoted
in this ehamber the rule referred to by the
honourable gentleman from L'Acadie (Hon.
Mr. Leger), I must insist upon having the
opinion of the experts who appeared before
the committee.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Can't you take a
joke?

APRIL 24, 1947
Hon. Mr. NICOL: I did net have the privilege of being at the committea when this bill
was studied. Can the honourable senator state
wbat is covared by patents referred te by number in thae bill?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: They are patents
in relation te, printing machines.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: Linotype machines?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I arn unable te
anlawer that.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Different types of printing machinery.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Honourable senators, I
bad the privilege of heing present at the
meeting of the Standing Committee 'on
Miscallaneous Private Bills yasterday when
this measure was undar consideration. Net
being a member of the cemmittee I was
unable te vote, but if I had been permitted
te do se I should have votad against reporting
the bill. I intend te vote against the motien
for third reading. I heard ahi that want
on at 'the committee yesterday, and, with
great deference te the opinion held by the
honourable gentleman from. Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugassen), I certainly was net satisfied
that the petitioners in this case had suffered
any very spacial injury because of interfarenca with the use of their patents during
the war. I arn sure there must be a great
nuinbr of patent owners in this country
whosa anjeyment of thair patents was interfered with in seme way or another by the
war. It doas net seani te me that the Toronto
Type Foundry Company is in any vary
peculiar position in that regard. In fact, it
was stated at the committee yiestarday that
somawhat more than 100,000 persons in Canada
wouid be in axactly the saine position as the
Toronto Type Feundry Comnpany.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Who was in a position
te give that figure?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: The Commnissionar of
Patents.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Did ihe know what hie
was talking about?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: As a matter of fact, the
figure hie gave was largaly in axcass of 100,000,
but te be on the safe side I arn using a minimum figure. I suggest that the passing of this
bill would be a very dangerous precedent for
this parliament. As -one resuit, it seenis te
me, our Committea on Miscallaneous Private
Bills wouid be busier for the next few years
than our Divorce Cornmittee is now.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: It is net over-werked
now.

275

Hon. M1r. BENCH:- That is nlot what I have
heard about the Divorce Committee on. numerI do fnot thin~k that the
ous occasions.
honourbale senators who compose the Cernrnittee on Miscellaneous Private Bis would
favour inviting more than a hundred thousand
people te corne here seeking private bil te
extend the life of patents.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: We woukl welcome
anything that would remedy an injustice.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: My honourable friend
bas bis own views in that regard. I myseif
satisfied that there bas been any
amrn ft
injustice.
Another feature is that patents comparable
to the ones mentioned in this bill exist in the
United States and will expire at approxintely
the same tirne as the Canadian patents. No
extension of the life of the United States
patents will be granted, and wben they expire
the typesetting equipment covered by them
may be manufactured in that country free of
any royalty or licence frora any patent ewner.
People in the printing indiustry in Canada
would be unable te take advantage of the
freedoen of manufacture of those machines in
another .iurisdiction. For those reasons alone
I arn opposing this bill.
I should like te suggest to tbe sponsor of
tbe bill (Hon. Mr. Hayden) that hie consider
withd>rawing this, measure and proposing tbat
there be included in Bill 16. an Act te arnend
the Patent Act, 1935, wbich is now on our
Order Paper, apprepriate sections te give the
courts of this country the power which. the
English courts bave, te extend upon proper
proof the life of patents. If it can be said
tha.t this bill should be passect, it might he
said with considerahly greater force that there
is good ground fer amending the general public
law of the country rel-ating te patents along
the line I have just mentioned. After Bill
16 is given. second reading it will probably go
te a committee. I respectfully suggest te my
bonourable frien-d from, Toronto that hie ask
the cernrnittee te consider including in it some
provisions to take care of this situation.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Henourahie senators, like the member from Lincoln (Hon.
Mr. Bench) I arn net a member of the Private
Bis Cornrittee, and I aise was in the cernînîttee roem while this bill was being considered, -having gene there hecause I was
interested in another matter.
I wishi te make seme rernarks about the
discussion in committee, but hefore doing se
I should like to know if there is any such rule
as the oe referred te by the senater freni
L'Acadia (Hon. Mr. Leger), which would pre-

276

SENATE

vent me from making my point. I have been
in the Senate a long time, and I know of no
such rule. Could the honourable gentleman
enlighten me on that point?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I have not got exactly
what I want, but I shall get it. I believe
that I can convince the chamber that no
minority report from a committee can be
received. In that connection I wish to read
from May's Parliamentary Practice, 14th edition, at page 605:
It is the opinion of the committee, as a committee, not that of the individual members, which
is required by the house, and, failing unanimity,
the conclusions agreed to by the majority are
the conclusions of the committee. No signatures
may, therefore, be attached to the report for the
purpose of showing any difference of opinion in
the committee or the absence thereof; nor may
the report be accompanied by any counterstatement, memorandum of dissent, or protest
from any dissenting or non-assenting member or
membersHon. Mr. MORAUD: That has nothing to
do with the point in question.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: It continues:
. nor ought the committee to include in its
report any observations which the minority or
any individual member desires to offer, but
which are not subscribed to by the majorityHon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, I rise te a point of order. When the
senator from La Salle (Hon. Mr. Moraud)
asked the senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) te refer to the opinion filed in
committee by the officers of the Crown, the
senator from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger)
raised a point of order that we could not now
refer here to proceedings in committee. Am
I correct in my understanding of the point
raised?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: That is it.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Is the honourable senator
now speaking on the motion for the third
reading of the bill, or on the point of order
that he has raised, or is he raising a new point
of order?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I am just saying that a
minority report from a committee cannot be
received by this house.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: That is not on the
point of order.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: If the committee had
ordered the proceedings to be printed, I have
no doubt that they would be public documents and could be referred to and in fact
quoted from in this house. But the point is
that there was simply a hearing in committee, and nothing was said as to publicity.

Subject to correction, I maintain that under
those circumstances the proceedings of the
committee must remain where they were held,
and cannot be brought into this house unless
it was directed that they accompany the committee's report.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: May I interrupt?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: I merely asked if a
memorandum had been produced before the
committee setting forth the opinion of departmental officers; and, if so, what that opinion
was.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: They were against the
bill.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD:
My honourable
friend from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger) objected to that question, and he is now quoting
a rule to the effect that no minority report
from a committee can be received in this
chamber.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I did not understand
my honourable friend to ask whether or not
a memorandum had been filed. May I be
permitted to say that no memorandum as
such was filed.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: The senator from
L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger) should inform the
senator from La Salle (Hon. Mr. Moraud)
that the officer of the Crown who appeared
before the committee, was strongly opposed
to this measure.

Hon. Mr. VIEN: Mr. Speaker, there is no
point of order before the chairman, so that
part of the discussion is out of order.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I think the situation went like this: Yesterday when the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) presented his report on this bill
he was charged to report from the committee
tlieir findings, and could not dilate upon or
indicate what took place in committee for or
against the bill. The bill having been reported
without amendment I immediately asked when
should the bill be read the third time, and it
was then indicated that it would stand over
until today.
It is now before us for third reading, and
there is no rule against information being
given to the Senate as to the merits or demer-

APRIL 24, 1947
its of a: bill at the third reading stage. I
believe that is well understood, and is a
reasonable conclusion.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: After listening ta
the ruling of the Speaker I think I am justified
in making some remarks as ta what took place
in committee. In relation ta what my honourable friend from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger)
has said, I wish ta state that this is a report
from a majority of the members of the coinmittee present at that time. I have no desire
ta reflect on the gentleman who presided. I
have found that he has been a very efficient
and capable chairman, and while I would not
say that the proceedings were irregular they
appeared ta me ta be rather unusual.
Honourable senators have before them today
a report from a committee which, although
composed of 35 members, consisted of only a
chairman and eight members during the last
ten minutes that the committee was sitting.
One member of the committee moved that the
preamble had not been proved. The question
was then put, and four members voted that
it had not been proved, while four voted
ta the contrary. The chairman apparently did
not vote, with the result that, as there had
not been a majority in favour of the motion,
the motion was declared lost. The chairman
today declared himself as being opposed ta the
bill. As I said a while ago, I think the procedure was a little unusual.
There is another point which I should like
ta stress. This bill originated in the Senate.
We are always anxious ta have as much legislation as possible initiated here, but for the
good name of the Senate we must be careful
ta see that our bills are in good order before
they are sent ta the House of Commons. The
chairman of the committee which considered
this bill strongly opposes the motion for third
reading. He said that if this bill were passed
parliament would be flooded with applications
for similar bills.
In view of what I have said, I think the bill
should not be passed by the Senate. .
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, patents and copyrights are matters of
great importance. They are of such importance that they are the subject of international agreements between most of the civilized countries of the world. These agreements
cover not only the teris and conditions of
patents and the rights thereunder, but as well
the teri of duration of patents. The last
mentioned point is in fact one of the most
important questions dealt with in international
agreements. Therefore, it would seea ta be
extremely inexpedient and dangerous ta pass
a private bill exempting one patentee froin

277

the conditions under which patentees generally in this country exercise their rights
and privileges. I feel that if anything is to
be done in connection with the term of duration of patents in Canada, this should be the
subject of a general law applicable to all
patents. I entirely agree with the honourable
senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
that all patentees should have similar rights,
and that the term of all patents should be
the same under the general laws of the
country.
If it is deemed that situations brought
about by war conditions justify a certain
extension of the life of patents, I think this
should be done on a general basis. I say this
because some patentees certainly would be
placed in a most unfavourable position if they
had not 'the means ta enable them ta come to
parliament with private bills of their own.
In addition ta that, the rights of patentees
exist in all countries which adhere to the
international agreements. If we extend the
term of patents in this country, and other
countries do not, a very serious disturbance
might be created: we might find ourselves
unable ta manufacture an article covered by
patents when our competitors in other
countries had complete freedom in respect
thereto. A number of complications might
arise. Some seem obvious at first glance,
whereas others equally substantial are more
difficult to foresee. I therefore suggest ta the
Senate that it would be most unwise ta
attempt ta change the fundamental basis of
our patent rights without the advice of
officers of the Crown who keep in touch with
international conferences on patents and copyrights and make a study of these questions.
There is another aspect ta patents and
copyrights. In a number of countries-in the
United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, for instance-many patents were abused
and some very ugly things were done by
international cartels priar ta and during the
war. It might be expedient and wise for us
not ta attempt ta touch this matter of
patents except after a very careful and farreaching investigation. It should not be
treated piecemeal, as b'y a bill such as we now
have before us.
I would therefore suggest, honourable senators, that this bill be not now read a third
time, but that it be referred back ta committee
for a fuller investigation, and that the proceedings of the committee be printed and presented with the report of the committee.
Honourable senators would then be able ta
deal with the bill in the light of advice by
officers of the Crown who are experts on this
intricate subject.

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, before that motion is putHon. Mr. BENCH: There is no motion.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I wish to, adjourn the
debate on this bill, in order to give the sponsor
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) an opportunity to consider
the suggestion of the senator from Lincoln
(Hon. Mr. Bench) and also to ascertain what
the English act provides in respect to extension of the life of patents. I would suggest
to the sponsor that when we meet again he
be prepared to say whether or not he accepts
the suggestion made by the senator from
Lincoln.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Are we prepared to deal
with the matter now?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not think that al
honourable senators are prepared to vote now.
It seems t.o me that ail features involved in

The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

Hon. Mr. COPP moved the second reading
of Bill 2, an act respecting a National Wild
Life Week.
H1e said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) to explain this bill.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable senators, this bill is relatively short, and I tbink
its language clearly indicates its purpose.
The conservation of wild life in Canada bas
been engaging a good deal of attention from
one end of the country to the other. Countries more advanced in years than Canada
have found it necessary for the preservation
of their wild life, particularly of birds, to
enaet legislation of this kind.
One feature only of the bill calîs for comment. It provides that eachi year the week
in which April 10 occurs should be known
and obýerx c( as National Wild Life Week.
That appears to be the week in which the late
Jack Miner, one of the most noted naturalists
in North America, was born. Everyone is
familiar with the work done by the late Mr.
Miner, who developed a bird sanctuary on his
farm near Kingsville, Ontario, and the renown
which bis work brought not only to the district in which he iived but to the whole
dominion. It is most aippropriate that bis
name should be associated with the proposa]
for a national wild life weck. I have spoken
before of the very e-xcellent accomplishments
of Mr. Miner, and I arn delighted to sec bis
name associated with this measure.

support in this house.

PATENT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. B. COPP moved the second reading
of Bill 16, an Act to amend the Patent Act,
1935.
He said: Honourable senators, the honourable senator from Lincoln (Hon. Mr. Bench)
has kindly consented to expiain this bill.
Hon. J. J. -BENCH: Honourabie senators,
apart from certain minet changes designed to
improve the practice in the Patent Office
and to clarify the language of existing sections
of the statute, the bill introduces two new
features into the Patent Act.
Firstly, there are important new provisions
relating to inventions in the fiehd of national
defence. A procedure is set ýup under which
sucb inventions can be acquired by the Crown
at the instance of the Minister of National
Defence, and of course the bill provides for
compensation to the inventors. There is also
provision for comimunication and co-operation
between the Commissioner of Patents and the
Atornic Energy Control Board, so as hetter to
effect arrangements for adequate control, in
the national interest, of inventions wbieh may
be the subject of patents and relate to the
uses of atomic energy.
The honourable senator from Toronto (Ilon.
Mr. Hayden) wilh perhaps be interested in this.
next feature.. The bill contains a new section
designed to relieve against certain hardiships
wbich may bave resuhIted from the occurrence
of the recent war. I dio not tbink this section,
as it appears in the bill, goes so far as te cover'
the situation of the Toronto Type Foundry
Company, latehy the matter of discussion
hiere. During the war many circumestances arose
which made it impossible for inventors of
Canada and other countries to comply with
the provisions of the Patent Act within the
v 1arious tîme limits therein set forth.
Inventors on active service, for instance, or
many who were in other countries during the

war period, were prevented by Lack of communication facilities, foreign exchange regulations and the diffculty of travel, from
filing or prosecuting applications within the
prescribed time, or from making appeals and
perhaps paying !the necessary fees. As a
resuit -they may have lest certain rights
which they otberwise would have had. It is
therefore proposed to extend these time limits
in order that inventors in Canada, and in
other countries which. extend similar privileges to Canadians, may comply with the
regulations of the Patent Act. I may say that
both Engliand and the- United States off er
Canadians reciprocal privileges of this kind.
Another important feature of the bill is jts
provision for an increase of approximately 25
per cent in the tariff of fees charged by the
Patent Office.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: What section is that?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Section 19.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: It is section 19. 1 have
just computed the figure roughly, but I think
the increases are of the order of 25 per cent.
It is proposed to apply this increased revenue
for the purpose of printing Canadian patents
-75 copies of each-so as to facilitate searches
in our Patent Office. So f ar Canada, I think,
has charged the lowest fees of any country
operating a patent system. I believe the cost
of the issue of a patent heretofore bas been
SM5. This will be raised to $50. The country
charging the nextlowest fee, which 1 believe
is 360, is the United States. So even with
the increase we would stiil be charging lesa
than any other country..
The remaining sections of the bill deal with
miner administrative matters, designed to improve the practice of the office and s0 on.
I do not pretend to belong to that select
company of people who are specialists in the
law of industrial property, but I presume
this bill will go to a committee where honourable senators who have any inquiry in their
minds about the wbrkings of any particular
section will have an opportunity of examining
departmental officiais.
I may say that in another place this bill
was rather extensively discussed, and afterwards referred to a standing committee, wbere
it received very careful study and treatment.
It was amended in many respects and it comes
to us, not as a measure having just lef t the
hands of the executive branch of the government, but as one having already been studied
with great care by a standing committee of the
other place.
If the bill receives second reading I shall
move, with the concurrence of the.- acting
leader of the bouse (Hon. Mr. Copp), tbat it

SENATE
be referred to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce, where the various provisions could
be explained. Th honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) may there have

include in the bill some provision to take care
of the situation which was under discussion
on an earlier order today.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK moved the
second reading of Bill R5, an Act to incorporate Workmen's Circle of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, little explanation is necessary in connection with this
bill which provides for the incorporation of
an ordinary friendly society for the purpose
of insurance benefits. The Workmen's Circle
was an American institution- carrying on
business as a fraternal society with branches
in the Dominion of Canada. It has become
desirable to disassociate the Canadian business from the American institution, so as to
have the control of that business in Canada.
I understand that the Canadian branch has
made arrangements to take over the assets
and obligations of the society. The bill is a
standard one for the incorporation of such
a society.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK:

Honourable sena-

tors, I now move that the bill be referred to
the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills.

He said: This, honourable senators, is a
private bill relating to the Ottawa Electrie
Railway Company, in amendment to its act
of incorporation secured from this parliament
in 1894.
At that time the authorized capitalization
of the company was fixed at 40,000 shares
without nominal or par value. The main
purpose of this amending bill is to permit
the company to subdivide this authorized
capital into 160,000 shares without nominal
or par value. This will permit of the wider
distribution that is considered desirable.
In securing the necessary consent of the
shareholders to this enlargement of the
capital structure it is proposed to invoke the
provisions of the Companies Act in such cases
instead of those of the Railway Act. This
method is much more practical.
It is my intention, if the bill is read a
second time, to move that it be referred to
the Standing Committee on Transport and
Communications, where the promoters of
the bill will be represented and furnish whatever detailed information the committee may
require.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

EXPORT AND IMPORT PERMITS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. COPP moved the second reading
of Bill 11, an Act respecting export and
import permits.
He said: The honourable senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) has consented
to speak te this bill.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable
senators, the object of this bill is to continue
certain import and export controls now exercised by the Governor in Council under the
National
Emergency
Transitional Powers
Act until sixty days after the first session of
the parliament of 1948.
The bill permits the Governor in Council
to establish a List of articles which cannot be
exported from Canada without a permit, but
he must be satisfied that any such article is to
be so restricted in order to ensure an adequate
supply and distribution in Canada of such
article or to implement an intergovernmental
arrangement
or commitment in respect
thereto.

It also permits the Governor in Council to
establish a list of articles which cannot be
imported into Canada without a permit; and
in that case the Governor in Council has to
be satisfied that such control is necessary by
reason of scarcity in world markets or governmental controls in the countries of origin or
allocation by intergovernmental arrangement
of such articles.
It provides for the issue of permits for
import or for export, as the case may be, in
respect of articles which are so restricted, and
it contains penalties for importing or exporting such articles without having obtained a
permit.
It further provides that the lists of such
articles so restricted must be published in the
Canada Gazette, and that the Governor in
Council will have the right from time to time
to alter that list.
I suppose the most convenient way of
explaining the measure would be to deal first
of all with its control of exports, and secondly
with its control of imports.
The reasons for the control of exports are
probably obvious enough. This country is now
producing a number of articles for which there
is an overwhelming demand throughout the
world at prices considerably in excess of
domestic prices. A striking example is lumber.
I think it is fair to say that if there was no
control over exports today, practically the
whole of our production of lumber would be
swallowed up by countries which are willing
to pay almost fantastic prices for it; and as a
result we would not be able to supply our
domestic requirements of lumber for housing
and other purposes. Then, we have entered
into agreements with other countries to export
to them certain quantities of a large number
of our agricultural products. The most outstanding of these agreements is the wheat
agreement with Great Britain. It is clear,
I think, that in order to enable our government to fulfil these contracts with other countries, there must necessarily be control over
the expert of such agricultural commodities.
I might say that it is the general policy of
the government to free from control as many
items as possible and as soon as possible. That
is not merely a statement of my own; it is
a statement that was made by the Minister of
Trade and Commerce in another place on the
18th of February last. Honourable senators
will perhaps recall that about a fortnight ago
there was published a long list of domestically
produced articles upon which the control of
exports had been lifted.
I would point out that it is necessary to
provide for the reimposition of these controls
in certain cases where they have been released,

APRIL 30, 1947
and'this bill sa provides. A case of that kind
arose last summer when the production of steel
was severely restricted in the United States
as a resuit of the coal strike there. The expert
of steel from Canada had been freed froim
contrai before that time, but it became, imperative to reimpose that control sa as to prevent
this coun.try from being denuded of large
quantities of necessary steel by the suddenly
inereased demand south of the border. Similar
conditions may arise in future during the life
of this measure, and it is therefore provided
in the bill that the governor in council may
reimpose controls if it should be found necessary to do sa.
There is another point in connection with
the control of exports. Where subsidies have
been paid on goods in order to keep the
domestie price down, the government may
recapture the subsidies paid upon any of the
goods which have been exported. An example
would be textiles. As honourable senators
know, textile manufacturers are paid subsidies
upon the raw cotton which they have to purchase from other countries in order to produce
textiles liere, the objeet of the subsidies being
to keep the domestie price of textiles down.
Obviously, if an.y of these textiles are exported
the manufacturer would not be entitled ta
retain the subsidy which was paîd to him
in respect of domestie production.
May I now deal for a moment with the
contrai of importe?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Will my friend
allow me before hie leaves the subi ect of
exporte, ta ask him a question with reference
to lumber? It bas frequently heen reported
ta me that the best grades of lumber, particularly in British Columbia, are exported,
and that the domestia market gets poor and
unseasoned grades. Do these controls provide
that only a certain quota of high grade, wellseasoned lum'ber shahl be exported, and that a
eufficient quantity shall be kept here for
Canadian use? I feel that the very opposite
bais been the case, that the Canadian builders
have had to use poor lumber and the expert
trades have been getting the good quality.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: That is a question
ta which 1 cannot give a specifie answer, as I
have no personal knowledge of the subject.
But I do suggest that if the bill is given second
reading and referred ta a standing committee,
that question, and others of a similar nature
which honourable senators may have, may be
raised in cammittee.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: How does this measure
fit in with free trade?

283

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I leave my honourable friend from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger)
ta answer that question. H1e can do it as welI
as I can.
I wu~ abaut to discuss the necessity for the
contrai of importe. Under present conditions
of international tradap, control of certain classes
of importe is, I submit, every bit as ne-cessary
as control of certain classes of exports,
although perhaps the reasans for controlling
importe are not quite as apparent as 'thase for
controlling experts. For instance, this country
requires ta import certain commadities which
are subj ect ta international allacation by agreement amangat -the nations of the world. An
example is ails and fats.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I thought my friend was
caming ta that point.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: What about the price of
butter today?
Hon. Mr. HIUGESSEN: I understand the
rule ta be that an honourable senator cannot
refer to a subjeet on which debate has taken
place previously during the current session.
As ta ails and fats, every country that is
a party to the agreemenit bas undertaken net
ta import mare of those commodities than the
quota assigned ta it. It is therefore essential
that aur government, in order ta fulfil the
undertaking by Canada, should control
importe ta ensure that we do not violate the
international agreement.
Hon. Mr. EULER: May I ask my honourable friend whether oils and fats are included
in the list of experts under control?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I have no detailed
information of any particular commodities subject ta either expert or import contrai.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: May I ask a question on
that point? Sections 3 and 4 of the bill pro-.
vide that a list of goods may be established
by order in council. Does the government
nat know what these goods are, and should
they not be shown in this bill?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: The list is ta be
established by order in council and must be
published in the Canada Gazette within fifteen
days after the paasing of the order.
Han. Mr. FARRIS: But parliament bas not
a word ta say about it?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: That is perfectly
true.
Certain other classes of commodities wbicb
this country requires ta import are in restricted
supply, a.nd the countries of arigin contrai the
propartion of those commodities which can

SENATE
be brougbf to Canada. 0f course the country
of origin bas no control over who the ultimate
recipient of those commodities xviii be, once
they arrive in Canada. Under these circumstances if is necessary for the government te0
exercise a measure of control on imported
commodifies so as to ensure that when tbey
do reach this country in re.-tricted quantifies
they shail be equitably distribiîted among the
various users. If there xvas no sucb control it
is quite conceivable and, I submit, quite likeiy,
that the largest or the ricbest importer might
manage to obtain for himself the wbole allotment to which Canada is entitled, to the
disadvantage of smaller imporfers.
1 think my honourabie friend from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) showed by
bis question that legisiation-paternalistic
l-egisi;ation-of this character is not generally
popular; and 1 think he tbereby expressed
the view wbich the great majority of us in
this chamber hold. But I must say that,
thoughi I boid that view myseif, if does seem
that under the very extraordinary conditions
under whicb international trade is carried on
at the present time, and having regard to the
world shortages of so many commodities wbich
we botb import and export, some temporary
legisiation of tbis kind must he faced; it bas
gof to be stomacbed. wbefber we like if or not.
I would oniy add tbat tbis bill received mosf
cart-ful consideration from, the Banking and
Commerce Commitfee of another place, wbîcb
sat for many days f0 consider it. The evidence
whicb that committee heard bas been pubiisbed and has no diouibt been read by many
bonoiirabi'e senators.
I close with the same statement witb wbich
I beganý, that tbere may be one liffie element
of iight in this bill, in thaf it hasts oniy until
sixty days affer the commencement of tbe
1948 session of parliament, and tbat if the
power f0 cont roi experts and imports shouid
be required after that time the government
of the day will bave t0 come back to parl-iament f0 obtain a renewal of that power.
I would venture to suggest that, if the bill
gets second readinýg. the appropriafe committee
f0 which it might be referred is tbe Standing
Commit tee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: May I ask my honourabie friend if tbere is any reason why this
bill was not incorporated in, the flfty-seven
other bills, ail of wbicba xere emergency
measares, and whicb are now before the otber
chamber? Or is there any speciai reason wby
theýýe provisions sbn>uli nof be part of the
budget, so thaf we would bave a iist of the
goods whose import or exporf wouid be
permitted?

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I am certain that
if tbe bill is referred te0 a standing committee,
arrangements can be made for deparfmenfai
officiais f0 be present with i-ists of ail articles
which are now siibjecf f0 export and import
cont roi.
In repiy f0 my bonourabie friend's flrsf
question, I can only say that that is a matter
whicb is beyond my province. 1 did nof draft
this legisiation, and I am not responsibie for
the forma if takes in coming f0 this bouse.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Are you in favour of if?
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: I shall delay the
bouse oniy a moment. I nm probably invading part of the territory of the honourabie
senafor froma Cburcbill (Hon. Mr. Crerar),
whomn I look upon as the leader in fbis
ebamber of those xvbo profest against tbhe continuai pufting of power in tbe hands of tbe
governmenf and the xitbdrawing of if from
the counfry's represenfatives in parhiament.
As I listened to tbe bonourable member wbo
bas .Iusf spoken. 1 wondered whetber, liad fbis
legisiation been introduced by a C.C.F. government, be wouid so caimiy bave taken the

member frorn Lincoln (Hon. Mr. Bencb) or
the honourable member from Toronto (Han.
Mr. Campbell)-I do not want ta attribute
the statement ta the wrong person-who said,
on some other occasion, that the best point
about another contrai bill was that it wauld
run out within a year, as this one wili. 1 quite
agree, although I do not think it completely
answers the objections ta the measure. As
the honourable member from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) said when he was speaking an
war contrai legislation, in rnen's minds there
seems ta be. an this subjeet a psychological
condition which they cannot rid themseives
of. Incidentally, the senator gave in his
chamber a very fine address on iiberalism.
Hon. Mr. EULE-R: With a small 'T'.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It seema ta me that the
present gavernment have ceased ta rememnbèr
that they are supposed ta be the apostlès of
liberalism in this country. What disturbs me,
and, I arn sure, many other members of this
bouse, is nat that the Liberais have hast their
sense of iiberalism, but that they are putting
an the statute books of this country legishation
which may be difficuit ta remove if a certain
other palitical party obtaîns office in this
country. No man or woman can predict what
the next gavernment, or the gavernmnent after
the next wiil be. I arn apposed nat merely ta
this particular piece of legislation, but ta al
legishatian which takes power away from
pari ament and puts it ini the bands of a
ministry or of any single minister. 1 think
we are on the wrong track, and if we continue
ta do this sort of thing we are going ta get
into trouble.
Several bills of this type have been bef are
the Senate. This kind of thing disturbs ail of
us, and ours is the chamber which sbould protest against it. When you have in another
place four or five parties, it is very difficuit
ta maintain an attitude of impartiality, of
hooking at such questions cleariy from what.
in the long view, is best for the country. I
speak with same knowledge of this, because
I sat in a legisîsture where for many years
we had six parties. In sucb circumstances the
tendency is ta consider legisiation as tbough
an election were just around the camner. When
there are only twa parties facing each other
one may be sure that the long view will he
taken by bath sides, but that attitude is very
difficuit; ta preserve when you have tbree or
four parties represented, or, as in another
place, five parties. I hope that we in this
chamber may be able ta do something ta stop
that trend. We did a great job last year an
fareign exchange control. I say that without
any fear of contradiction. We impressed the

people of Canada. We sometimes talk of
the use and purpose of the Senate. To mY
mind the real use and purpose of the Senate
is, flot to talk, but to do things which. are in
the best interests of the country as a whole,
irrespective of any pa.rty or any organizatian.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The honourable
gentleman from LaSalle (Hon. Mr. Moraud)
asked as to the list of goods that could be
imported-from the United States, I assume,
or from any other country-and the honourable gentleman from. Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) stated that the information might
be produced before one of our committees.
I bave had only a cursory look at this measure,
but it is not the fact that one bas ta get an
import order for anything that a Canadian
wishes ta buy in the United States?
Han. Mr. HIJGESSEN - Oh, noa. I think my
honourable friend is confusing present conditions with those which existed in tirne of
war, when it was necessary ta get permits ta
import anything frein the United States. The
purpose then was ta conserve United States
dollars.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: 1 thank the
honourabie gentleman for his answer. It
would be quite in order for us ta expeet that
in committee a list of goads under export
contrai will be produced. I fear it will be
a very long one.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: But the llst can be
modified by order in concil.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: The Iist can be
changed from. time ta, time.

SENATE
DIVORCE
DISCUSSION

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the one hundred and forty-first report of the
Standing Committee on Divorce, as follows:
1. With respect to the petition of Robert
Lussier, of the village of St. Joseph, in the district of St. Hyacinthe, in the province of Quebec,
radio technician, for an act to dissolve his
marriage with Laure Armande Chicoine Lussier,
cook, the committee find that the requirements
of the Rules of the Senate have been complied
with in all material respects.
2. The committee recommend the passage of
an Act to dissolve the said marriage.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Honourable senators, I move adoption of the report.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I do not wish to delay the house, but
I take advantage of this opportunity of saying a few words on the subject of divorce.
The press of this country for the past six
months has been carrying on a campaign to
the effect that there are too many divorces
in Canada. It is true that our divorce committee has more petitions before it this year
than it has had in any previous year.
If one reviews the records back about
thirteen or fourteen years he will find that
the number has tripled.
Hon. Mr. QUINN:

Shame.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: At meetings of synods,
presbyteries and other organizations of every
religious denomination in this country suggestions are made from time to time as to
what should be done. Only yesterday a suggestion came out of such a meeting. I should
like to see these church people and others
who say they do not believe in divorce-and
I am not saying that I believe in it-given
the opportunity of visiting the divorce conmittee of this house, or any provincial court,
and listening to the facts as they are brought
out. After hearing the evidence, let them
give their solution of the problem.
Nothing is to be gained by the suggestion
such as one read yesterday, that those who
are married by the church should have to
say they would never apply for divorce.
Everybody would agree that it would be a
fine thing if divorce were never necessary.
But we have had before the committee people
whose stories would bring tears to your eyes.
A young women of 24 to 28 years of age,
at the most under 35, married to a man who
turned out to be a rascal and left her-that
is the situation in nearly balf the cases we
hear. One could net refuse to hear the petition of such a young woman and say that
for the rest of her life she must be tied
to a beast.

The church to which I belong is against
divorce. I am not saying anything against
the church itself, but I do believe that church
authorities should come and see what is going
on. There seems to me to be the real cure
for the situation in this country.
Hon. Mr. DUFF:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: The fathers and mothers
in the homes of Canada should tell their boys
and girls of the whole situation and just
what is going on here and in the courts
across the country.
The increase in the
number of cases in the Senate divorce
committee is typical of the whole of Canada.
If the situation is growing worse it does no
good to say that we should not grant divorces.
We want to find out the cause. I have sat
as Chairman of the sub-committee on divorce
through this session, and I have felt about this
subject more keenly than ever. Sometimes I
can hardly rest content in the afternoon after
hearing evidence in the morning. I do net
suggest that it is of a disgusting nature, but
it is pitiable.
Permit me, honourable senators, to give
you briefly the facts of one case. A girl of
twenty-four married in England a Canadian
soldier, who brought ber out to this country
and left ber in a dump in Montreal. He
then ran off and lived, with another woman.
His wife did not know anybody in Montreal;
but, thank God, the Red Cross took up ber
case, and secured ber a job looking after an
old lady and ber house; and now the deserted
wife and her baby are living there. She
receives, besides board and room for herself
and the child, $35 a month. She is only twentyfour, and she cannot go back to the Old
Country unless she gets a divorce. What are
you to do with such a case? That is a problem
we face in this country.
It is not a question of extending the grounds
for divorce. That may be necessary, but I
am not very much interested in it. We are
confronted with a problem that is eating out
the very lives of the people of this country,
and unless ministers of the gospel, heads of
the churches and other people realize the situation, their own boys and girls may some day be
among the unfortunates.
Only yesterday a senator-I will not mention his name-came to me with this problem:
a young woman married in this country an
airman. who went back overseas; and it is not
known whether he was lost at sea, went
crooked in the Old Country, or what happened.
She is tied up for life to this man. I have in
my office in Winnipeg a similar case, where a
woman is also tied for life. At my age, and

APRIL 30, 1947
that of many of my honourable friends, it
does flot matter whether one is tied for life,
but it is different for young men and women
of from twenty-two to thirty-flve years of age.
Ministers of the gospel have got to get parents
to. understand the problem. If they do not,
it will eat out the very lives of the people of
our countiry.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, the question that has just been raised is
of great importance. It goes to the very
foundation of Society. I agree with the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) that
the primary duty in such matters rests within
the precinets of the family. Undoubtedly,
fathers and mothers of children have the duty
of bringing themn up properly, educating them
and teaching them the responsibilities they
assume when they marry.
The problem that the Senate now faces,
however, arises out of the number of divorces,
which is increasing by leaps and ýbounds. It
becomes difficult in these circumstances for
this house to continue to act -as a court of
justice. Some other way should be found to
deal with these cases. But let us be extremely
careful not to adopt a systemn the effeet of
which might be a multiplication of divorce
cases. We should try to reduce them, and even
to stamp them out.
All over the world the number of divorces
bas increased. to such an extent that religious,
social and political leaders are very much
concerned. In some states of the United
States the number of divorces exceeds the
number of marriages. The proportion of
divorces to marriages throughout that country
is something like one to six.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: One to three.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: That is still worse.
At the request of certain provinces this
parliament granted to thema the right to
organize divorce courts. The net resmît has
been a tremendous increase in the number of
divorces. This may flot be entirely due to
the creation of divorce courts; other factors
were present during the war and since. But
we must admit that the easier access to courts
bas been one of the causes of this rapid
increase.
It is our duty to do everything in our power
to stabilize the foundation of society, of the
social order; and we must start with its first
cell, the family. I sympathize with the members of the Senate divorce committee, but the
additional time and effort învolved in their

M

work is a small price to pay, having regard to
the importance of the Services rendered to
Society.
I amn not speaking here as a Roman Catholic
only. I do not believe in divorce, and it is
well known that the church to which I belong
does flot recognize the validity of divorce.
Neither does the Church of England. These
two churches hold that if young people are
given the means of dissolving their marriage
and marrying again, they will enter too lightly
into the marriage bond. If young people knew
when they married that it was for life, and
that if they separated they would flot have
the right to marry again during the lifetime
of their consort, they would ponder on
marriage far more deeply before entering
into, it.
I concur in the suggestion of my, honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Haig) that the leaders of
our churches and social organizations throughout the country should be invited. to study
this probILm very seriously. They have
studied it seriously already, but the job is not
finished,. No adequate solution bas yet heen
found. In the meantime let us refrain from
making it easier for young people to obtain
a dissolution of their marriages.
Somebody may have to suifer for the common good. When tihe war broke out young
men and women of this country were called
to serve for a common cause. They accepted
the caîl with seif-denial and patriotie inspiration. Similarly, ini time of peace the duty
rests on us all to accept heavy sacrifices for
the salvation of the nation..
If through inadvertence or lack of proper
consideration, a marriage comes to grief,
separation might be in ordex, but not divorce.
If the right of -re-marriage were abolished,
were expunged from, our legislation, on the
ground, of public interest, the number of
people who comne to grief in their married
lives would be considerably reduced. They
would "mend their fences"; ýthey would compose their differences; they would live more
harmoniously together; they would avoid the
things that lead to an impasse, the blind
alleys; they would flot so lightly ruin their
whole lives.
Un-der aur present system divorce is not
recognized by law. Each case requires a
private bill, a law of exception, a special act
of parliament. Il, as in the pathetic cases to
which the leader opposite (Hon. M.r. Haig)
has referred, some have to suifer, let us take
into aceount, first and foremost, the common
good, the public interest. In my opinion,
public interest demands that instead of facilitating divorce we should make it more difficult,
and even. impossible.

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. C. B. HOWARD: Honourable senators, before the Orders of the Day are called
I think it is oniy right that as goverament
whip I should express the feeling of pleasure
which I amn sure is in the minds of every
member on both sides of the Senate at seeing
our leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) back in his
place once more.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: It is hardly necessary to say in what a fine state of bealth
hie now is, for bis looks show it. I know
that we are ail glad that bis rest bas done
bim good. We appreciate the sympathetie and
able manner in which hie bas guided this bouse
ever since hjs appointment, and wve aIl join
in a wbole-hearted welcome to birn on bis
return.
Before taking my seat may I also express
thanks to our colleague wbo bas acted as
leader of the house during the past few
weeks (Hon. Mr. Copp), for the very capable
way in which bie bas carried on his duties.
Here again 1 know ail senators on botb sides
will join with me.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.

Hon. Mr. HOWARD:
I wish to assure
1dm. that we ail appreciate bis valuable services
very mucb.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
we ail join wif h the senator from. Wellington
(Hon. Mr. Howard) in tbe words bie bas
uttcred on the return of the government leader
(Hon. Mr. Robertson). I am very glad to
welcome bim back, but 1 have a littie regret
wben I realize that the senator fromn Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Copp) will no longer be
leading the bouse. I probably have a better
opportunity than any other member to judge
the quality of the leader, because naturally I
have to deal witb hlm aIl the time. Before
the senator from Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson) became ill I believed tbat no one
could he as fine a leader as he was.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But since then I have
found tha;t there is another senator who can
lead the house very ably, and, 1 arn most happy
to bave had the fine experience of working
witb him. We on tbis side of the house hove
that the bealth of the leader is fully restored.
I tbink hie worried a littie too much about
tihose of us over here. We should have caused
him little worry; perbaps he should have been
more concerned about others. We are most
delight-ed to see him. back, and pleased that
when bie was absent bie bad such a capable
lieutenant.
Hon. A. B. COPP: Honourable senators. I
wish to join with those who have spoken ia
welcoming back the leader of this bouse. For
MY part I amn pleased that hae has returned,
not only because it is good to sec hlm among
us again, but because the responsibilties tbat
I bave had during tbe past few weeks, can
now be shifted back to his able abouldýers.
I wish to thank my honourahie friend6 on
this side of the bouse for tbeir very willing
and able assistance tbroughout the leader's
absence. Also 1 wisb to express appreciation
to the members opposite for their bearty
cooperation and gond will, and for the very
fine and altogether undeserved compliment
whieb they have paid me.

Honourable senators-

ROBERTSON:

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: -I
appreciate
more than I can say the very kind references
to the fact that I amn back in my seat after
some absence from the deliberations of the
Senate. I wislh to express my tbanks for tbe
remarks that have been made and for the

MAY 1, 1947
cordial reception given to them. Particularly
I wish to thank the honourable gentleman on
my right (Hon. Mr. Copp), whom, I asked
to assume the responsibilities of leader in my
absence, for the very able way in which he
has carrieci on. I amn deeply grateful for the
co-operation extended to him by honourable
senators on this side of the house, and also
by those opposite-for, while maintaining
their right and indeed their duty to be critical, they have ncverthelcss facilitated the proccedings in every way possible.
It was rny good pleasure while in Georgia
to visit the Legisiature and Senate there.
Because of the position I hold in the Senate
of Canada I was extendeci, by a formai resolution, the courtesy of admission to the floor
of the state Senate. In some instances the
methocis of deliberation presented quite a
contrast to those of our body. But there is
one striking similarity between their political
institutions and ours, andi I commenteci upon
this in the fcw remarks which. I made to the
Senate. The Iower bouse bas one lady representative, and the Senate bas two; and when
Iistenîng to, deliberations in the upper house
I could not fail to note -that there, as here,
both of the lady senators flot -only possessed
good looks, but gave every evidence of outstanding intelligence.
I thank you, honourabie senators, for the
very kind welcome you have given me.

Bill 12, an Act respecting certain patents
owned by Toronto Type Foundry Company
Limiteci.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, I
adjourneci the debate, but I yield to> the
honourable member from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden).
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators, this is one of the few occasions on
which wc finci opposition developing to the
third rcading of a bill which, besides having
hiad first andi second rcadings, *has been
reporteci' by a committee; and I think possibly
my first job-I recognize that it may be a
difficult one-is to disabuse your mincis of any
feeling you may have that matters of tremendous importance andi much public interest
are involveci in this bill, a feeling cvidenceci by the attitude of two of the senators
'who are weil-ikn'own champions of greait
causes. Whcn the chairman of the Private
Bills Committee (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) opposes
the third reading of a bill which has been
reported by that committee, one might be
inclineci to conclude that some important principle must be involveci, some very dangerous
precedent sought to, be created-. Sureiy enough,
he pictureci the prospect of a deluge of applications to the Patent Office if this bill were
passeci. H1e forcsaw a dangerous precedent if
we recogoizeci the right of an individual to
apply to parliament for the remedy sought in
this bill-and parliament is the only place
where he may get the remedy, for there is no
provision in any particular law which gives
him that remedy. We are told that the granting of this application might leaci to the
receipt of a great many other applications
andi establish a, dangerous precedent.
I may be pcrmitted, to wonder upon what
basis we decide upon principles and rights.
Do we determine a question of principle from
the inherent merits of the particular matter
under consideration, or from the viewpoint
of a number of other people who may think
they have rights wh.ich have not yet been
determineci? And, in an effort to shut out
ail dlaims to those rights, are we prepareci to
deny wha.t mýay be in principle an inherent
right, and one measutrable in termas of the
justice of the particular submission? While
I arn not obj ecting to the right of this or any
other legisiative chamber to refuse to paso a
particular bill, 1 think this measure should be
considered upon its own iperits and, upon
principle, rather than upon the assumption
that to consent to it might lead to a floodiing
of the Patent Office with other applications.

SENATE

We were also told that we should wait
until the amendments ta the Patent Act now
before us are being considered, and that we
could then pass an amendment providing that
in situations of this kind application for
extension of the life of patents may be made
to the courts. But if by any chance such an
amendment is made to the Patent Act, this
is the only application of its kind that will
have to be considered by parliament. In
that event there will be no flood of applications. And if such an amendment is not
passed, and if we have not approached this
question from the point of view of the rights
of the applicant, we may have denied to the
applicant the assertion of rights, which rights
would then be lost for all time.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the
honourable senator a question on a point
that I am not clear about? Does this bill
contemplate resurrecting a patent that expired
in December, 1944, and making it good for
six years from that date?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The patent expired
in December, 1944, and it is now proposed
to resurrect it?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes; that is what
the bill says. I intend to deal with that in a
moment, but first I wish to point out what
the facts are.
The bill seeks an extension of the life of
eight patents. Two of them have already
expired, and the others will expire at various
periods between now and 1950. The basis of the
application is that by reason of wartime
regulations which prohibited the securing of
materials and manpower to exploit these
patents, their owner bas suffered a loss. To
some people it may seem extraordinary that
there should be an application to extend the
life of patents on that account, so I shall
state briefly why this application is made.
The parliament of Canada gives to patentees,
the owners of patents, an exclusive right to
the enjoyment of patent rights for a definite
period. But during the life of the eight
patents in question the war intervened, and
because of war necessities, over which of
course neither these patentees nor the government of Canada had any control, the
patentees were deprived entirely of ability
to use the patents. Net only that, but there
was no other purpose to which they could
apply their equipment which was designed
to produce the machine covered by these
patents. It is what might be called a tailormade machine, a machine that is made to

specifications. It does a number of operations;
it prints, cuts, folds and punches ledger
sheets and other things of that kind. So this
is different from a situation where the patentee
would have some use for his patent during
the war or would be able to convert his
manufacturing equipment to other purposes.
What is being asked for here is not an
extraordinary thing. In the English Patents
and Designs Act there is a provision under
which application may be made to the courts
for extension of the life of patents. In fact,
the British company which owns the United
Kingdom patents corresponding to these has
already applied to the courts in that country
for extension of the life of two of the eight.
The application was in respect of only two
because the act provides that such application
may be made only within six months before
the date of expiration of the patent or patents.
Section 18 (6) of the English act says:
Where, by reason of hostilities between His
Majesty and any foreign state, the patentee as
such has suffered loss or danage (including loss
of opportunity of dealing in or developing his
invention owing to his having been engaged in
work of national importance connected with
such hostilities) an application under this section may be made by originating summons instead of by petition, and the court in considering
its decision may have regard solely ta the loss
or damage so suffered by the patentee.
The conditions under which application for
an extension may be made are set forth in
the section. But in addition to the general
right there is a particular right, and in the
case of the two patents to which I have
referred the only ground set out in the petition is that the patentee was not able to manufacture during the war, by reason of certain
conditions, such as shortage of materials
rcquired for war purposes and scarcity of
manpower.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: May I ask the
honourable senator a question?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Under our Patent
Act is there any provision by which application may be made for extension of the life
of a patent for any purpose?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: If there were any
such provision applicable ta a case of this
kind, the application for extension naturally
would be made under the Patent Act rather
than by petition asking parliament ta exercise
its inherent right*to legislate.
I find that at least three applications to
extend the life of patents have been dealt with
in the past by the Parliament of Canada.
These are referred to in the statutes of 1930,

MAY 1, 1947
1928 and 17 Geo. V. So no precedent is being
created in asking that parliament, by way of
a private bill, extend the life of a patent.
I emphasize that the sole basis of the
application is the loss suffered by reason of
the war.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Were the other applications to which the honourable gentleman
refers granted?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The three applications
to which I refer were granted.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Was the life of the
patents extended or were they revived?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I am advised that
they were extended.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Why did this company
not make an application to parliament before
the expiry of some of the patents?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Eight patents are
involved. Two of them expired during the
period of the war, and to make an application
to parliament at that time would have been
an idle gesture. No one knew then how long
the war would continue.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: As I understand it, this
bill refers to eight patents, of which two have
expired and six are still alive?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: That is correct. Six
of the patents will expire at various intervals
between now and 1950.
The public interest will not be hurt at all
if an extension is granted, because there are
manufactured in the United States and England machines and equipment which can be
used in a competitive way for the same purpose as the machine covered by these patents.
I was informed, and I believe the committee
also was aware, that there are competitive
machines. In other words, there is more than
one source of supply, so by extending the life
of these patents parliament will net be extending a monopoly which might penalize the
people. Therefore, the problem which presents
itself is a consideration only of the interest of
the patentees, who were given a monopoly for
a definite number of years, but by reason of
the war and of government action in war
time were prevented from exploiting their
patents during that period.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I do not like to interrupt the honourable senator, but may I ask
him a question?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: If this bill is net passed,
will other Canadian manufacturers of printing
machinery be allowed to use these patents
when they expire?
83168-19

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The patents, of
course, would fall into the public demain. This
company has equipped itself and made
expenditures to go into the manufacturing of
this machinery, and of course those investments would be a total loss.
Also to be considered is the fact that there
is competition in the same type of machine
from Great Britain. Any person manufacturing it in Canada at the present time would
have to manufacture for Canadian production:
he would not be able to go into the English
market competitively, because patents there
would shut him out. But if there were not
patent protection in Canada the British manufacturer could ship into Canada in competitien with any Canadian manufacturer. It
would be practically a prohibition from going
into the manufacture of these machines in
Canada if you had to get started against the
competition in the same type of machine from
the United Kingdom. These machines are
also manufactured in the United States.
The question, therefore, is whether this
manufacturer, who enjoyed certain patent
rights and had the equipment to manufacture
under them, is to be permitted to get that
balance of the life of patents which he lest by
reason of the war, and to utilize during the
short period of six years for which the extension of the life of these patents is asked, the
equipment upon which so much money has
been spent.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I also dislike very much
to interrupt my honourable friend, but may I
ask him a question? If this bill were defeated,
and an amendment were placed in the Patent
Act-which I sec is coming before the Senate,
anyway-providing that application for renewal
or extension of a patent may be made to the
courts, would the Toronto Type Foundry Company lose its right to make such an application?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No, I do net think
it would. I should think that if there were
any way by which the court hearing the
application could be informed that the petition to parliament for an extension, on the
ground of loss by reason of war, had been
refused, that might have some evidentiary
value.
However, I have no assurance that parliament-and I refer particularly to another place
-woúld consent to such an amendment to the
Patent Act. While I must state it quite
unofficially, I certainly gathered from questions
asked and answered in the course of the hearing that the attitude of the Patent Office is
one of opposition to any provision: for exten-

292

SENATE

sion, even extension by application to the
court. The only reason given was that they
would be flooded with applications. Now, may
I submit in all seriousness to this house that
there could not be a flood of applications based
on the principle on which this matter is being
submitted to the Senate, namely, that the
patentee suffered a complete loss by reason of
the war.
The majority of the patents in the Patent
Office relate to the radio industry, chemistry,
and automotive engineering, and all these
types of patents were used more in war time
than they were in peace time. Indeed, as
honourable senators will recall, in the war
years it was necessary for one department of
government to set up a royalties committee
to determine arbitrarily what royalties would
be paid because of increased use by reason of
the war. So, as regards most patents in the
Patent Office, my submission is that the war,
instead of having caused a loss of use or a
loss of income, led to such an increased use
of patented devices in the fields which I have
mentioned that the government saw fit
arbitrarily to eut down the royalties on that
increased use.
In these circumstances. I subnit, it cannot
reasonably be suggested ·that there would be
any flood of applications if this bill were
passed. Therefore I ask in all seriousness
that the rights in this particular case be
considered.
I am not quoting as a precedent the English
attitude towards applications for extension of
the life of patents. I am only indicating that
England was faced with a similar problem.
Its war situation from day to day was more
critical, and its concentration on the war job
was of necessity more intensive, if anything,
But the principle behind its
than ours.
approach to the problem was the same as the
principle here; that is, that a greater interest
intervened, and therefore the government
took a course of action as a result of which
a right that had been granted for a certain
period of time was taken away. In this case
and in the English case the right was taken
away completely for that period. In England
the right was granted to go back and ask
for an extension. In Canada the only place
where you can apply for an extension is
parliament, because our Patent Act does not
provide for application to the courts.
It
should not be wrong for a person in Canada,
company or individual, to ask parliament to
recognize a right which he thinks in justice is
inherently his.

Some objection is made to what is called
resurrecting or reviving sornething which has
been dead for a few years. Of course, no
such application as the present one could be
made to parliament except upon the basis
that a right has been lost. It is correct to say
that the bill calls for a revival or restoration,
but only of a right which has been lest. That
is the basis of the application.
Something was said the other day about
the desirability of walking warily because of
international
conventions.
Well,
strange
things have been thrown across the path of
discussion from time to time, but nothing
stranger than that. For years the English act
bas contained a provision whereby extension
may be granted by the courts, yet that bas
net prevented England from being a member
of and participating in the international convention relating to patents. To suggest that
in some future case or in many cases parliament night sec fit to recognize the same
principle on which this bill is based and grant
one or more similar applications, is irrelevant.
And in no sense does the bill reflect upon
problems arising out of the international
convention.
I trust that I have not trespassed too greatly
upon the time of the Senate, but I consider
the matter an important one. The owner of
the patents is a family corporation. The son
of the president was not available during the
war, as he had accepted the call to service
and was engaged overseas for four years.
The bill is so important that upon its passage
or defeat depends the answer to the question
whether the company will be able to manufacture in Canada or will be prevented from
doing so and must on that account suffer
a serious loss.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question

MERCHANT SEAMEN COMPENSATION
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill W5, an Act to amend the
Merchant Seamen Compensation Act.
Hon. Mr. DUEF: Would my honourable
friend 'be good enough to explain what this is
aill about? I have tried to read it; and while
I admit I do not understand English. very
well, it seems to me that the whole thing is
ixed up. This looks like a seasick amendment, to me. Perhaps my honourable friend
cau throw some light on it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I understand that
the regulations covering compensation for
merchant seamen were first macle under the
emergency powers but were made statutory
last year. The object of this bill is to provide
that there shahl be no prejudice to the
interests of any seamen for whom proceedings
were taken under the regulations pursuant to
the War Mea.sures Act, before they were made
statutory. That is ail the bill contemplates.
Is the honourable gentleman satisfied?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Honourable senators, perhaps my friend the leader of the government
has given a clear expianation. But surely, if
you read this bill, you can come to ne other
conclusion than that it is ail mixed up. Here
is what it says:
'The Merchant Seamen Compensation Reguhations, 1945, estahlished by order of the Governor
in Council made on the seventeenth day of
July, one thousand nine hundred and fortyfive-That is, two years ago.
4755), 'are deemed te have been re-(P.C.
voked...
Listen to this:
. . . deemed to have been revoked on the 3lst
day of August, 1946,...
Well then, why do we revoke them?
for the purposes of section nineteen of
*..and
thîe'Interpretation Act this Act is deemed te be
substituted for the said regulations.
Weli, as the regulatiowx were revoked, how
are you going to revive themn?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Read the page
opposite the bill.
Hon. Mr. DUTFF: I have donc that. Here
is the expIanatory note on the starboard side
of the bill. I wonder whether my honourable
friend knows which is, the starboard side?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: He knows something
about port.
Hon. Mr. DUFE: The note says:
The Merchant Seamen Compensation Act was
enacted as chapter fifty-eight of the statutes of
1946 and provides for continuance in statutory

294

SENATE

form of the provisions of the Merchant Seamen
Compensation Regulations, 1945, which were
made under the War Measures Act.
The sole purpose of the bill is to preserve
rights to compensation acquired under the regulations before the act came into force and to
continue under the act all proceedings taken
under the regulations.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The act does not come
into force until this bill is adopted.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: The act was in force during the war by order in council P.C. 4755, and
merchant seamen were protected. Now the
war is over, and I do not see why merchant
seamen should come in and ask for special
privileges or compensation. I think the whole
thing is a nuisance. There are sorne people
in departments of government who lie awake
at nights trying to justify their existence, and
they have got to bring in legislation in order
to do so; and this is one of the foolish
things for which they are responsible. If we
do not pass this legislation, P.C. 4755 will still
be in effect, and that is good enough. Merchant seamen do not expect any particular
legislation from this government. They go
to sea to earn their pay; they work hard, and
get it. This is only, shall I say, a gurn game,
whereby departmental officials bring in legislation to try to justify their existence as
officials; and I am opposed to it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think no useful
purpose will be served by the honourable
senator from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff) and
myself engaging in a legal argument. May I
say again that my information is that the
object of t'he bill is to preserve rights to compensation which were acquired under the
regulations.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: What compensation?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Rights to any
compensation which may have been acquired
by virtue of regulations that existed under the
War Measures Act before the Merchant Seamen Compensation Act came into effect. I
am not in a position to argue the point as to
whether the phraseology sets forth that intention, or whether, as my honourable friend says,
the bill is unnecessary. It would seem to me
that the procedure is simple. No honourable
senator would want to deprive any seaman
of rights he has acquired for compensation
under the regulations of the War Measures
Act. It is the intention of this bill to safeguard those rights. If the bill does not clearly
do so, my suggestion to the house is that we
give the bill second reading and send it to
the committee which is now considering other
matters, and let some honourable senator who

is more versed in the law than I am explain
as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of the
particular phraseology. I think the intent is
clear-that any merchant seaman who acquired
any right of compensation or whose case is
being considered under regulations which
existed under the War Measures Act before
this bill came into effect shall not be prejudiced. That, so far as I understand it, is
all that the bill contemplates.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: But this clause does not
say so. It is the exact reverse of what my
honourable friend says.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That may be.
But the intention is as I have explained. I
suggest to my honourable friend that the
draftsman could come before the committee,
where my honourable friend could discuss the
legal phraseology with him.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I think we all agree
that the principle of compensation is a good
one. The principle of this bill is compensation.
Compensation for seamen is a more difficult
matter than for people on shore, because seamen serve, if not beyond the jurisdiction of
the country, certainly beyond the jurisdiction
of the provinces. It seems to me that the
intent of the bill is clear. If there is the
difficulty which my honourable friend from
Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff) suggests, we
should carefully look over it in committee,
but the proper thing to do at this time is to
send the bill to committee.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I do not object to its going
to committee, but I do object to the bringing
-before this house or another place of any bill
which reads as this one does. I say that it
contradicts itself in four different places. It
looks as though someone stayed up all night
trying to devise something to justify his existence in the Department of Transport. I am
in agreement with the suggestion of the leader
of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson), and
of course I would nnt think of disagreeing with
ny honourable friend from Queen's-Lunenburg
(Hon. Mr. Kinley), because lie and I are nextdoor neighbours: we chat over the fence and
smoke the pipe of peace together, and so forth.
I am quite willing that the bill should go to
committee, but I say that any department
which brings d:own legislation of this kind
should be spanked, and spanked with its pants
down. There is no justification for this at all.
Under P.C. 4755 merchant seamen can still
secure compensation, so why introduce this
measure?

295

MAY 1, 1947
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I want to express
somne sympathy with the honourable senator
for Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff), because I,
too have read this document and I find it
entirely unintelligible.
Hon. Mr. DUFE: Hear, hear. 1 am not a
lawyer.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: It is true that there
is an explanatory note. The principle stated
in that note appeals te, me, and I arn ready to
vote for the bill on the undcrstandling that the
bill shahl in some way coincide with the
explanation of it.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: It does not.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: There is nothing on
the Lace of this document which would indicate
that the one is the equivalent of the other.
Hon. Mr. DUFE: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: 1 have no doubt that
it is all right, and that when we get to the
committee it wilh be found that the Interpretation Act, which is quoted here, gives the
key to what the section means. But I join
in -the protest against bringing a document
of his kind before the Senate withýout giving
us the clause in the Interpretation Act which
evidently affords the key and makes it
possible to understand the measure. When
everything is before us it may appear that the
draftsmanship is aIl riglit, but this is net the
way in which a bill should be presented.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
bill he referred to the Standing Committee on

BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE
On the motion to adjourn:
Honourable
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
senators, I should like to point out that, as
matters stand at the moment and will probably remain over the next day or two, there
is not likely 'to be much legîslation immediately before the Senate. On the oCher hand
a very considerable amount of business is
before the standing committees, particularly
those on Banking and Commerce and on
Divorce. I therefore suggest that when this
house adjourns today it stand adjourned
until Tuesday afternoon at 3 o'clock. I understand that the Banking and Commerce Com-

mittee has adjourned until the Senate rises
this afternoon; and perhaps it would consider
meeting when the Senate rises on Tuesday
afternoon as well. The Divorce Committee
will have an opportunity to continue with its
business tomorrow, Saturday and Monday.
The Senate adj ourned until Tuesday, May
6, at 3 p.m.

CONTINUATION 0F TRANSITIONAL
MEASURES BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received fromn the Huse of
Commons with Bill 104, an Act to provide
for the continuation of certain orders and
regulations of the Governor in Council for a
limited period during the national emergency
arisiog out of the war.
The bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall the
bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: With leave of the
Senate, next sitting.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: May I ask the leader
of the government how it is proposed to deal
with this particular bill when it cornes up for
second reading? Will it be read in the
ordinary way? Or shall we take up the
schedule seriotim? Is there any provision for
supplyîng niembers with the text of the orders
in council which are here referred to? Perhaps
the leader has, some idea of how he will proceed with this measure. Certain items are
interesting to some of us, but n5t to others.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The honourable
senator is asking about the supplying of copies
of the orders in council. I understand copies
have been circulated, and if for any reason
he has not received a copy, I arn sure that the
Clerk will put him in possession of one.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: They are in the mail.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I arn advised that
they are in the mail. As to the method of
procedure, I assume that the bill will be dealt
with in the ordinary way, but I am open to
suggestions.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The governiment
leader bais answered my principal question,
but hie bas flot said what is in bis mind witb
regard to bow tbe bill will be deait witb. It
contains, including tbe scbedule, a great many
items. Does tbe government propose to take
up tbese ail a't once, or in wbat manner? I
believe that in the Commons -tbey were
divided and considered day by day.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSO-N: Well, I arn open
to any suggestions. I have asked an bonourable senator to explain the bill on the motion
for second reading. So far as I am concerned,
wbether it can be more effcctively deait witb
in tbis bouse or in cornrittee is for tbe bouse
to decide.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourabie members, I
bave given some attention to tbis question.
Tbis morning I received in the mail the orders
in council, which bave been printed. My own
idea w'as that we would proceed witb the bill
in the usual way; tbat the senator explaining
it on bebalf of tbe goveroment would not go
into a detailed explanation of eacb of the
orders in counicil. 11e may do tbat, altbougb
I do not thirik bo wouid. 1 tbougbt tbat the
goverilment leader wouid then move tbat the
bill be referred te cornrittee. Tbat coinmittee wouid take up the first order in council
and, if there were any questions asked, tbe
proper officiais wouid, be present to answer
tbem. If no questions were asked, discussion
tben could be directed to the next order in
council. As a matter of fact, if there were
any questions to, be asked on an order in
council wben it was cnlled in cornmittee, it
would probably be best to set it aside. After
tbe bill bad been gone tbrougb once, sucb
witnesses as were necessary to, give explanations of tbose ordéers in counil on wbicb tbere
were, questions, could be called before tbe
cornrittee and cross-ýexamined. Tbat seems
to me to be tbe fairest way.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUTCK: Wouid tbis flot be
a proper bill fo be sent to tbe committee of
the wbole bouse?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. Under our ruies we
cannot question officiais in committee of tbe
wbole bouse. I understand we are going to be
sitting next week-tbe leader (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) can advise as to tbis-and I
tbougbt tbat if we got the second reading
tbrougb thbe bouse tbis week we could start
bearings on tbe bill next Tuesday rnorning.
I was of tbe opinion tbat we could go tbrougb
the bill in one sitting, and on Wednesday
start deaiing witb tbe orders in counicil to
wbicb tbere are objections. I tbink tbis bill
would bave to be sent to a special cornmittee.

MILK PRICES
MOTION-DISCUSSION

Hon. JAMES MURDOCK moved:
That the Senate instruct the Natural Resources Committee to ascertain by official inquiry
how much the mi.lk producing farmers of Canada
secure for their milk product less than five cents
a quart, and to also inquire how much the milk
collectors and distributors of Canada secure for
milk collecting -and distributing at better than
ten cents a quart.
He said: Honourable senators, notice of
this motion has been standing on the Order
Paper in my name since March 25, and the
point I now want to deal with concerna
generally the farmers of Canada. We are
told that there are more than 700,000 farmers
in the dominion, and I presume they can be
regarded as representing the most important
industry in the country.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS:

Hear, hear.

I presume also
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
that we want to deal fairly, consistently and
logically, first, last and always with the
farmers.
Many references have been made by distinguished senators to the rights and the work
of the farmer. According to report many
farmers' sons who a few years ago went
overseas to fight for us do not want to go
back on the land and put up with the work
and drudgery, the early and late hours of the
farm. Many of them, we are told, have
undertaken to secure positions in other walks
of life. We know officially that two or three
thousand othér gentlemen from overseas
have been brought to Canada to take the
places of perhaps some of the farmers' sons
who are tired of long hours and heavy work.
The point I wish to deal with particularly is
whether we are giving the farmers a square
deal.

I have in my hand an editorial from the
Ottawa Journal of April 18, last. It reads:
If (says a report) the current subsidy on

butter fat is dropped on April 30, the retail
price of butter will jump 10 cents a pound.
Well, assuming that the farmer, in order to
live, must have either a subsidy or a price increase, what of it?
So far as the consumer is concerned, nothing
much. Between paying for butter by giving
more to the retailer and paying for it by giving
more to the tax collector, there is precious little
difference.
Subsidies are prices. Taxes are prices. As
much as anything we find on price tags, they
make up the cost of living. The only difference
is that the subsidies and taxes are hiddenhidden, that is, until the tax collector comes
around.
For ourselves, we prefer, in buying an article,
to pay the full price to some dealer, not to have
to pay another part of the price to somebody
else later on. Under subsidies, people do pay
to somebody else later on.
Under straight prices, free of subsidies, -a
man knows what he is paying; if he thinks the
price high, he can complaiin, can even refuse
to buy. Under subsidized prices, he never
knows what he is paying; doesn't know whether
the subsidy is going to people who deserve it
or to people who don't. He just pays.
I have a further article from the Ottawa
Journal of May 2, under the caption "Butter
Controversy".
Canadian consumers are paying an authorized
ten-cent increase for butter, and this will set
off a controversy the end of which no one can
see. Butter will be much in the news in the
next few months.
The government subsidy of 8j cents a pound
has been removed, and the producers are being
allowed an extra lj cents a pound as from May
1. Many consumers will forget that to the
amount of the subsidy they are simply taking
the money out of another pocket, and they will
accuse-quite unfairly-the farmers of greed
and extortion. They overlook the fact that the
farmer gets only a small part of the increase
and that the butter producer, like everyone
else, is faced with the problems of rising costs.
But even when the initial controversy is over
butter will still be in the news. Later rationing
may be discontinued, and quite possibly ceiling
prices, but a floor price is almost certain to
remain as a result of the workings of the Agricultural Prices Support Act, under which the
government promised ftarmers a minimum return
for a period of yea-rs after the war to make
up for fixed wartime prices.
Between this floor price, and the disrupting
effect of a threat trom imports of New Zealand
butter such as had to be resorted to last winter,
wholesale trade may be very cautious about
buying butter for storage. The trade is an important factor in our butter distribution system, financing the big summer make and enabling it to be spread out over the twelve
months. It is big business as 50 to 60 million
dollars is required to finance the holdover for
winter. The creameries who make the butter
could not do it, have not the starage space. It
is quite possible the Canadian government may
own a lot of butter by next fall.

REVISED EDITION

298

SENATE

May I briefly explain my interest in this
matter? On the 30th day of September, 1919,
I was sitting in Chicago, in an office which I
had occupied for three years, when I received
a telegram notifying me that I had been
appointed a member of the Board of Commerce of Canada, and was expected in an
official capacity at the city hall, Toronto, the
next day. I could not get there the next day,
but at 8.30 a.m. on October 2, 1919, I arrived
at my home in Toronto, and at 10.30 I was
sitting on the bench, feeling silly-I say I
was feeling silly, because I did not know what
we had under consideration. What resulted?

The salary was $8,000 a year.
Hon. Mr. DUFF:

Pretty good.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: But the chairman of
the board resigned in less than five months,
and I resigned in less than nine months.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Shame.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The distinguished
gentleman who used to be Law Clerk of the
Senate, and, has now gone to his last reward,
stayed on for two or three weeks longer, and
then he resigned. During the nine months that
I was a member of the board I sat on many
hearings in which the rights and the revenues
of farmers were involved; for example, we
investigated the milk situation at Toronto,
Hamilton, Ottawa and Winnipeg. I do not
think we did much good. On April 6, 1920,
the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that we
had no jurisdiction to deal with the subject
of newsprint; the matter was carried further;
and a little later the Board of Commerce,
which was created by the government in 1919,
was put out of business.
The reason I have made that explanationand I trust the personal reference will be pardoned-is that in the nine months when I
was receiving a salary at the rate of $8,000 a
year I learned something, I believe, about
how Canadian farmers were being treated,
and also, perhaps, the effects of a wire-pulling
technique in enabling certain other individuals
in this dominion to rise from comparative
poverty to comparative riches. Those of you
who would like to know what I have in mind
should look at pages 161 and 162 of Senate
Hansard, where you will sec how the milkproducing farmer is getting "rolled" first, last,
and all the time. Incidentally, I heard that
someone intended to argue that I am entirely
out of order in discussing this matter, and
would attempt to prevent me from going on.
Well, let us sece.
According to information given upon the
introduction of the recent budget, it is
expected that the cost of family allowances,

which in 1945-46 was $172,632,000, will be
$245,225,000 in the fiscaî year 1946-47. We
find that subsidies on milk and milk products.
which in 1944-45 amounted to $42,330,000, and
in 1945-46 to 841,659,000, will, through the
reduction brought about in the budget, amount
in 1946-47 to $37,950,000.
Who is paying this money, and for what
purpose? This year the baby bonuses will
cost more than $245,000,000. Where will that
money go? If my judgment is reasonably
correct, it will mostly be spent in the purchase
of milk for the babies and the young folk of
the family, to bring thom up to be happier,
stronger and wiser individuals in the years to
come. Who paid the 1945-46 midk subsidy of
$41,659,000? It came from the federal government and was paid to the milk producers
of Canada. For what? Presumably for the
benefit of the farmers and the real milk
producers of Canada. But in my humble
judgment a very substantial portion of that
sum did not get to them at all. I do not
bclieve that the farmer is paid by any means
what he deserves. However, my judgment
may be entirely incorrect, and if so I wish
to be put right. I should like a complete
investigation of the entire matter in order to
ascertain who is getting the benefit of the
215 million dollars of baby bonuses, and the
41 million dollars spent on milk subsidies for
farmers.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Was the milk subsidy
not intended to keep milk at a reasonable
price for consumers?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My honourable
friend may be right, but my personal judgment has always been that this was given
to assist the real producers. This is the first
time I have ever heard it said that the subsidy was entirely for the consumer.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I think so. The
butter price was kept down for the consumers.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My personal judgment has been that the producers were entitled
to it, and that the producers were to get substantial benefit from it. But let us pass along
hurriedly. If honourable senators will look at
pages 161 and 162 of the Debates of the
Senate, which I mentioned a few moments ago,
they will see one striking illustration of the
increased cost of milk in Ottawa. There are
thirty-two cities in Ontario. Incidentally, I
should say right now that the province has
complete jurisdiction over this question of milk
prices and milk products. According to the
news that sifts through to us, the Milk Board
of Ontario thoroughly investigated this matter
some weeks ago, but as yet it bas failed to

MAY 6, 1947

make its report and recommendation. Why?
Because some distinguished gentlemen are
going to argue with it about what it should
do in making such a report and recommendation.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May I ask my
honourable friend if he will tell this chamber
what price the producer gets per hundred
pounds of fluid milk in Ontario or any other
province?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Now, wouldn't I
like to do that?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I can do it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Well, then, we shall
certainly be glad to hear from you; although,
if you will pardon me, and with all due
respect to your judgment, I should like to
have the matter analysed and thoroughly
investigated by the committee. My motion
1s:

That the Senate instruct the Natural Resources Committee to ascertain by official inquiry

how much the milk producing farmers of Canada secure for their milk product less than five
cents a quart, and to also inquire how much the
milk collectors and distributors of Canada secure

for milk collecting and distributing at better
than ten cents a quart.

Honourable senators, I know of course that
in Ontario and other provinces of this Canada
of ours there are some gentlemen closely

enough in touch with milk producers and
distributors to be able to say how much we
give the farmers.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: If the honourable senator would permit me: It is $3.45
per hundred pounds net in the province of
Ontario, and $3.30 in the province of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: How much does
that amount to per quart?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: There are supposed to be ten gallons of milk in one
hundred pounds.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is very interesting and I am glad to have that much
information. I am told that in the county of
Carleton a few weeks ago the farmer was
getting 51 cents a quart for cream, and that
the distributors were getting $1.05 a quart for
the same cream. Now, I do not know whether
that is correct or not, but I should like to
know. It seems to me that if in all the
thirty-two Ontario cities conditions are the
same as I think obtain here in Ottawa, we
ought to have an inquiry and a full investigation, because of the federal money that is
being expended by the Dominion government
in subsidies and baby bonuses.

Honourable senators will recall that a few
months ago there was a report of a farmers'
miniature revolution in Alberta. We heard of
milk wagons being dumped, and of milk being
upset and spilled on the ground. I do not
know whether there was anything to that
report or not, but for many years my own
humble judgment has been that we should
have had a revolution by farmers, because
I do not think they get what they are entitled
to for their early rising and late retiring and
the long hours of their daily work.
There is a good deal that might be said
on this question, and I hope that some honourable senators will give us information additional to what we have received here this
afternoon. I thank you.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is there a
seconder to this motion?
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I second the motion.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable senators, I do not rise for the purpose of offering
any objections to the arguments that have
been presented by the member from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) or to say anything
in support of those arguments. However, as
Chairman of the Committee on Natural
Resources, I wish to point out what, so far
as I can see, would be the effect of this
motion that the Senate instruet the committee
to ascertain the cost of milk and the selling
price of it-for that, in effect, is what is
proposed.
Now, the cost of milk varies a great deal
in different parts of Canada, according to the
length of the winter season, the cost of labour,
and the elimate. Therefore, in order to fulfil
this motion it would be necessary to call
witnesses from different parts of Canada-at
least, that is my view-and that would mean
great expense. Also, it is late in the session
to go into any matter so extensively.
Besides, the great majority of the people in
the dairy business are also mixed farmers, and
I believe they would object to being called to
Ottawa at this busy season to give the required
information. That is another reason why I
feel this matter should stand.
Last fall the province of Ontario appointed
a Royal Commission, presided over by an
Ontario judge-Mr. Justice Wells, I believeto inquire into the whole matter of dairy
products. That commission has completed its
hearings and, as has been said, is now oonsider-

ing its findings. A report, I understand. will
be available in June. Perhaps my honourable
friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock)
would get the information which he desires

SENATE
from that report. It will not cover all Canada,
but conditions are practically the same in the
various provinces. If the Senate passes this
motion, I think it would be wise to get some
advice as to whether the necessary funds will
be provided to carry on the inquiry.
I do not wish to shirk my duties as Chairman
of the Committee on Niatural Resources, and
I am sure every member of the committee
would wish to do his part. If the motion is
passed we shall carry on such an investigation
as a majority of the members of the committee
d'eem fit and proper.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, I wish to speak briefly on the resolution
before the house. As the motion is worded
it is hard for me to grasp its real meaning, and
after listening attentively to the remarks of
my honourable friend from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock) I am still unable to comprehend it.
Every province in the dominion of Canada
has a milk board and, as my honourable friend
the Chairman of the Natural Resources Committee (Hon. Mr. D.onnelly) said, Ontario
appointed a royal commission to investigate
the subject. The milk board is a permanent
institution in all the provinces, and the members of the various boards are aware of the
cost of production and distribution and are in
close contact with representatives of the
farmers. Surely such a group is much more
competent to inquire into this subject than
is the Senate Committee on Natural Resources.
I have no objection to the resolution, but
I repeat that I do not understand its real
meaning. For years the provinces have had
bodies whose purpose it is to see that the
producer gets reasonable prices in relation to
the cost to tlhe consumer, and I think that we
should leave the matter in their hands. My
honourable friend from Alma (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) said that the farmer was given
$3.20Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I said that he
got $3.45 net in the province of Ontario, and
$3.30 in the province of Quebec. That is for
3-4 butterfat.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I will take the
bonourable gentleman's lowest figure. Assuming a hundredweight of milk contains ten
gallons, forty quarts, and sells at $3.20-the
honourable gentleman said $3.30-the producer
gets 8 cents a quart for fluid milk, without
an investigation.
There is proof for my
honourable friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) that the producer is getting not less
tban 8 cents a quart for milk.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The honourable
gentleman bas just proved that he is mistaken.

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: My arithmetic
may not be as good as that of my honourable
friend, but I venture to say that it is as good
as the wording of his resolution.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, it seems to me that this resolutien either does not go far enough or goes toc
far. In a general way I wish te support the
member from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock),
with a view to attacking the cartel which I
assume and suspect is engaged in the distribution of milk.
I come from an industrial centre where we
buy milk at what seems to be a very high
price, and every fraction of a cent that is
added to the price has an important effect on
the development of the future generation.
The subject is an exceedingly important one,
but this resolution merely asks that one of our
committees inquire into the price of milk.
There is no reason why the resolution should
not pass, and when the committee reports on
how much milk producers receive for their
milk and what milk collectors and distributors
get for handling it, the committee will have
done all that is required by this resolution.
On one hand, the resolution does not go far
enough to answer the real question of the
mover. On the other hand, perhaps it goes
too far, in that when the amounts have been
ascertained they will mean nothing to us.
Honourable senators, I suggest that we pass
this motion in order te learn the price of
milk; but I would recommend te the mover
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) that he reconsider the
wording, with a view to having the committee conduet a well-ordered and welldefined investigation into this subject so as
to expose the cartel, if there is one, in the
distribution of milk to consumers. If the
honourable gentleman will bring in a resolutien of that kind, I can assure him of my
support.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators,
I surely appreciate the coming of the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) to the defence of the farmers. He
referred to the strike by farmers in the West,
when they dumped their cream and so on.
The feature of the strike that seemed strange
to me was that it occurred when the farmers
were getting higher prices than ever before in
my memory of the West. It did not seem to
help their cause to spill cream or leave eggs
at home until they spoiled, when there was
a great shortage of labour and elevators were
rejecting grain and being closed up.

301

MAY 6, 1947
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I was not agreeing
with their actions.
Hon. Mr. HORNER:- I asked some of the
farmers who I knew were associated in the
strike what they wanted the government to
do about the prices of butter and wheat, and
they said they wanted parity. As nearly as
I could find out, the strikers were people who
had caused a lot of other trouble and whom I
would call Communists; they were carrying
out orders from another country, striking and
causing all the trouble they could.
This whole question of the price of fluid
milk and cost of distribution has been
investigated thoroughly. In one inquiry
about bread-I do not remember what inquiry
it was-the evidence, as I recall it, was that
the cost for wrapping and delivering the
bread was more than for the wheat that went
into it. In an endeavour to eut down the
cost of delivering milk, it was decided in
Winnipeg to make one wagon alone deliver
to a certain area. That scheme did not work
out, because the women wanted ta be able
to buy their milk and cream from their
regular milkman.
My honourable friend from Parkdale
referred to cream selling at $1.05 per quart.
That is certainly unusual, and I am afraid
there would be no rush on that market.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am told that that
is what is charged in Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I doubt it. I should
like that ta be verified. However, the representative of a milk company poinited out that
merely because some lady bad forgotten to
order a pint of cream, they might have to
harness a horse and rig and go a mile to
deliver it. Such a transaction might cause
them a loss, even at the price of $1.05.
The honourable senator remarked that a
good many returned men were unwilling to
take up land. I may be out of order in discussing this, but my complaint is that, in the
section of the -country in which I live, the
authorities are altogether too strict; they are
refusing to men with a good overseas record,
fellows raised on the farm, propositions which
seem very reasonable to me. I have here a
letter from a young fellow at Marcelin,
Saskatchewan. He was offered a half-section
of land, with full equipment, which belonged
to his father-in-law, for $5,000. I know this
particular land, and without the equipment it
would sell for seven or eight thousand dollars
cash; but the deal has not been approved. He
had written on the matter to a bank manager

who has undertaken to answer correspondence
and assist the boys in these matters. I know
of similar cases. On one farm eleven children
were raised, and four of the boys went overseas. The place is mortgaged, but it is a
quarter-section which, I believe, would sell for
$7,000, and the mortgage company offered to
return it to the father, the original owner, for
$3,000. The boy applied to the Department
of Veterans Affairs with a view to getting this
place, but he was turned down, because, not
being entirely up to date as to the newest
types of oats to seed, he could not answer
some questions. I cannot understand the attitude of the board, which I am told, is located
at Prince Albert; instead of being anxious to
help some of these boys, it seems anxious to
put obstacles in their way. Perhaps if they
were exceptionally clever they would not need
assistance, but as I understand it, the object of
the scheme is to assist the average returned
man, and I have been very disappointed at
the way it has been administered. I would
like the government to look into the workings
of the Prince Albert board which is in charge
of the placing of these returned men.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Dropped.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR moved the adjournment of the debate.

IN PRINTING OF COMMITTEE

PROCEEDINGS
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, I
wonder if the leader of the government (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) would see that something is
done to hasten the printing of the Divorce
Committee proceedings? It was only yesterday, for instance, that I received reports of
a nearing held on the 17th or 18th or 20th
of March. The passage of divorce bills will
be held up either in this house or in another
place until the evidence taken in the various
cases is printed. Since we re-assembled on
the 23rd of April we must have already heard
about 48 cases. After making inquiries I
understand that the Printing Bureau is so
busy that it cannot handle the committee's
proceedings at all, and this work has been
let out to jobbers. I feel that if we are
to have these divorce bills passed this session
we must get some push behind the printing
of evidence.

CONTINUATION 0F TRANSITIONAL
MEASURES BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 104, an Act to provide for the
continuation of certain orders and regulations
of the Governor in Council for a limited period
during the national emergency arising out of
the war.
He said: I would ask the honourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr Farris)
to explain this bill
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. W. deB. FARRIS: Honourable senators, I amn glad to hear some applause at the
opening, because 1 do not expeet to hear any
at the conclusion.
The bhill in question declares itself on the
first page to .he:
An Act to provide for the continuation of
certain orders and regulations of the Governor
in Counicil for a limited period during the
national emergeney arising out of 'the war.
In view of some comments which, were made
when the bill was introduced and given first
reading, I mnight emphasize a fact that we are
aIl familiar with-and I think it is more apparent in this bill than in most-that consideration naturally faIts into two divisions: one, a
consideration of the principle of the bill; and
the other, a consideration in detai! of the
various parts of the bill in their relation to
that principle. The principle, of course, is a
matter proporly for consideration on second
reading. If that principle is found to be
acceptable to the bouse, we can tjien have
detailed consideration of the various provisions.
I might recaîl to honourable senators the
history of the dwindling degrees of this logislation. First, there was the War Measures
Act itself, which was hrought into its full
operation at the commencement of the war,
and which very properly and with the approval
of everyone, for reasons of national necessity
and seif-preservation, gave absolute powers to
the government. Thon, at the immediate termination of the war, there was brought into
effeet the National Emergency Transitional
Powers Act, which was passed in 1945 and
would, I helieve have expired at the end of
March this year. However, a short extension
was made whereby, I understand, the act wilt
expire on the l4th of this month. From
Hansard of the other bouse I have taken an
analysis of the power of that bill, because I
think it is important that we should keep
these in mmnd. The powers, exactly as the

304

SENATE

Minister of Justice, the Right Honourable Mr.
Ilsley, stated them in another place, are as
follows:
(a) providing for and maintaining the armed
forces of Canada during the occupation 'of euemy
territory anà demobilization and providing for
the rehiabilitation of members thereof;
(b) facilitating the readjustmenýt of industry
and commerce to the requirements of the coinmunity in time of peace.
(c) maintaining, eontrolling ani regulating
supplies and services, prices, transportation, use
and occupation of property, rentais, employment,
salaries and wages to ensure economic stability
and an urderly transition to conditions of peace;
(d) assisting the relief of suffering and the
restoration and distribution of essential supplies
and services in any part of lus Majesty's dominions or in foreign countries that are in grave
distress as the result of the war, or
(e)

continuing or discontinuing-

Again the expression "in an orderly mariner", is used.
-in an orderly nianner, as tlie emergeney per.
maits, measures adopted during and by reason of
the war.
Honourable senators, that was the second
stage. The National Emergency Transitional
Powers Act was not as broad and cumprehensive as the War Measures Act. We have
now reached the third stage in what I am
glad to say is a dwindling of the extraordinary powers given to tho government
bccause of the emerguncy.
The present bill is designed to continue in
a stili more modified furm the period of
transition from war to pcace. There are some
important facts that I think I should state
to honourablu senaturs in that respect, andý
t'hey are reassuring. The first is that this
bill gix us'tle government nu power to initiate any nuw orders or regulations. That power
is (liscontiOtied. The second fact, which I have
learned mostly front the statements by the
Minister of Justice, is that a dcpartmnental
committee-primarily
I think
from the
Department of Justice, but with personnel
from other departments-has been in uperation since last August, studying these extraordinary puovcrs that the guverrimient hias
hiad and endeavouring to see hiow soon they
can bu cut down or completely eliminated.
Honourable senators know that a great
many measures, orders and regulations have
been entiruly dune away with in the last
year. If I had had time, I should have liked
to find out the exact numbur. This may be
a good timu to tell the leader of the government (Mon. Mr. Robertson) that that question unduubtedly will bu asked in committue,
so that we may judge of the progressive
nature of this dwindling process by compar-

ing the numbur of orders and regtîlations now
tu bu continuud with the number actually
rescinded up to this timu.
What this bill dues is te, presunt to parliamient 57 orders and regulations selucted by
the goverrnent, on the advice of its officials
and, particularly, of the departmuntal coinmittue which hias been functioning. Whun we
recaîl the stacks upon stacks of ordurs and
regtilations that we have been deluged with
since the buginning of the war, 57 dues flot
seein a very large number. Those regulations
and urders are contained in about twelvu
specified grotîps. 1 notice that Mr. Ilsley said
thîcre were fifteen groups and classifications,
btît as I analysed and chuckued them I think
there are only twelve. The bill provides that
the orders and regulations enumeratud-and
which will be fotind in the printed document
that lias been circtîlatud to ahl members of
tlîis house-are to continue for one year or
less. I say less, for this reason: that, although
the govurnment lias nu power to extend any
extraordinary regulations or to pass new ones.
it is expressly empowered te; abolish or rescind
any of tlhesu orders or rugulations prier to
the expiry of the yuar tvhich is granted by
the proposed bill.
Honourable
senators, with
that
short
explanation I comu to what I consider to bu
the express principle of the bill. The principlc of thc bill is: shaîl parliamunt reognizu that this country bas not fully recovered
from the calamity of the war, and that the
consequences of that calamity still leave us
with a national umergency; and shaîl parliament recognizu that it is desirablu to dual
wîth this continuing emergency for anothur
ycar, preserving a reasunable degrue ut ernergency powers in the govurniment, t0 the end
that there shiaîl continue to bu progressive transition froin the emergency into normal
conditions?
I take it. honotîrablu senators, that there is
not a membur of this bouse of parliament wlio
xxill not say "Yes" to thosu twu questions.
I-owcx'er, membcrs may say: "We accedu tu
that part of your propostion, but xvhat are
tbose emergency conditions? Wc do not propose to accede to meruly conjured-up suggestions of emerguncy in order tu perpettiate
in the governiment powurs tbat it rcally dues
not nced."
Mr. Ilsley presented in the other housu an
analysis of what lie considered to bu the outstanding problems which constitute an emergcncy requiring thuse 57 eunerated extensions
uf power. Any bonourable senators who have
flot read the analysis and wish te, do su may
find if in the Commons Housard, at page 1584.
I shall not take the time of the bouse f0 out-

MAY 7, 1947
line the extensions requested; the schedule
at the end of this bill gives a complete general
picture of them. The requests come from
of
department
departments-the
various
Agriculture, the Department of Fisheries, the
Civil Service Commission and so on. The
Department of Finance requires extension of
a large number of provisions under the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, having to do
with leasing and matters of that kind. Honourable senators who are nembers of the legal
profession will find it interesting to consider
in committee the extensions asked for by the
Department of Justice.
The Department of Labour has some
requests with respect to order in council 1003
which may require particular consideration in
committee. I have been making an investigation of the way in which this order in council
applies to the problems of British Columbia,
and at the moment I am not quite satisfied
that this proposed legislation is in the proper
form. I do not intend to go into the details
of that matter, because I may be misinformed.
The British Columbia legislature, in its session
that closed only a few weeks ago, passed a
labour bill which, in my opinion, is very
important legislation and may weIl be a model
for the rest of Canada. It recognizes the fact
that when a strike vote is taken men are, for
their own protection, entitled to a secret ballot.
It recognizes the principle that a secret ballot
is just as essential to the voter and to the
welfare of the country as a whole in a strike
vote as it is in an ordinary election. This
new legislation provides that before a strike
may be called in the province of British
Columbia there must be a report by a conciliation board., and after the report has been considered by both sides a vote shall be taken
by a secret ballot under the supervision of
properly constituted governmental officials.
Because of P.C. 1003, that new act is not
operative as yet in British Columbia. When
the bill now before the Senate is being considered in committee I *ant to be clear, as
no doubt senators from other parts of Canada
do, that we are not continuing this order in
couneil for one year. For my part-and I am
sure the Minister of Labour is in agreementI believe the sooner the dominion gets out of
certain fields of labour and turns the authority
over to the provinces, which are capable of
handling it in a most effective way, the better
it will be for all parties concerned.
In another place opposition to the bill was
directed along two distinct lines. If I were
on the defence on this subject I could not
think of any better strategy than to read one
line of criticism against the other. If that

305

were done one would pretty well cancel the
other, and leave the supporters of the bill in
occupancy of the entire field.
The C.C.F. leader in another place complained that there was too much decontrol,
that, the government, was going too fast in
doing away with the regulations and orders
and the great degree of regimentation imposed
upon the people during the past few years. As
I read his speech I felt that the honourable
gentleman rather liked controls for control's
sake; that he believed they were good things
in themselves and that instead of doing away
with them we ought to be looking around with
a view to adding to their number. The honourable gentleman cited the Gallup Poll. I
certainly do not agree with the suggestion by
the C.C.F. that these controls are good in
themselves. I feel sure all honourable members would support a measure to continue
controls based on necessity and nothing else;
but I think the house would be united in
opposing a suggestion that regimentation in
the form of controls is a good thing in itself.
The results of the Gallup Poll disturbed me
a little. I take the figures given by the C.C.F.
leader and I assume they are correct. The
results suggest that within the past seven or
eight years there has grown up in Canada a
generation that has never known the full
benefit of freedom that we in this country
used to enjoy. Therefore it seems to me that,
even if we were not subjected to personal
inconvenience by controls we ought to accelerate this so-called decontrol, in order that the
younger generation may not become inured to
regimentation before it is too late for them
to appreciate fully and impartially the benefits
of the kind of life we enjoyed in this country
before controls were necessary. I am reminded
of a quotation that has stuck in my memory
for many years. Perhaps it offers an extreme
illustration, but this is it:
Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,
As to be hated needs but to be seen;
Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,
We first endure, then pity, then embrace.
For my part this regimentation is a form
of vice that ought to be outgrown in Canada
as fast as possible.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: In another place the
great Conservative party-I omit the prefix,
which I sometimes cannot remember-has
taken a definite position, with the principle
of which I am in full accord. I do not sec
how any lawyer who practises under our constitution and has a full conception of what
the administration of justice has meant in this

306

SENATE

country could theoretically take any other
It is that the manifold control
position.
organizations, with their officers and their
petty authorities, offering no right of appeal
from their decisions and none of the safeguards that have been thrown around our
rights, are interfering with our civil liberties.
They do that, I suggest, a great deal more
in the appearance and form of legislation than
in actual practice.
I was much impressed with a quotation
which the Minister of Justice read from a
book that I have in my own library, although
I have not yet had an opportunity to read it
through.
That is Professor Lower's book,
Froin Colony to Nation. In this work, after
having been extremely critical of the present
administration, the author stated:
The kindliest thing the historian can say about
the King war administration is that it consisted
of men most of whom were too thoroughly saturated in Liberal principles to take advantage of
the arbitrary powers they 'had assumed. Despite defence of Canada regulations, despite
neglect of parliament, Canada remained a free
country, her press remained free, her citizens
substantially retained their freedom of speech,
and their representative institutions.
The men charged with government had not
within their breasts the spirit of the despo.t,
and although they erected a machine for war
which, along with the other qualities of fine
mechanism, had all the powers of the despotic
state, they could not bring themselves to harness
it to the ways of despotism.
I would not for one minute confine that
statement to the Liberal party. I believe that
had honourable members opposite formed the
government of this country, that same spirit
of liberalism-I am using the word in its wider
sense-would have prevailed.
Perhaps even
had another party been in power-unless their
preaching of a doctrine makes them believe in
it so thoroughly as to lead them away from
their basic principles-or had any other group
of men in Canada been in office, their actions
would have qualified them for what the professor says here about the men who at the
present time administer the affairs of Canada.
So, although we may read extracts from certain
orders and regulations which, when considered
as detached from realities and the power exercised under them, might make us shiver, it
can be said that we have come through this
war with a mighty good record in the maintenance of the freedom and independence of
action of our people. I do not think we need
have any serious apprehension because of
the extension of these rights, in a dwindling
form, for another year.

In a way, details stand out more prominently
in this bill than they do in the ordinary bill.
The measures are divided into fifty-seven
varieties-if I may use that expression without
making too close a comparison with something
else-and in committee we shall be able to
sample each variety, one by one.
I commend the principle of this bill to the
favourable consideration of the house.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Will the honourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris) inform this chamber whether, had
this bill not been introduced into parliament
at all, parliament could not have taken care of
all the so-called emergencies which the Right
Honourable Mr. Ilsley referred to?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I have no doubt that
it could. Many times in my experience of
parliamentary and other matters I have seen
a good proposal objected to on the ground
that, "Well, there is something else you
could have donc." I do not want to speak at
all facetiously to my honourable friend; I
know he is asking a proper question, and I
wish to answer him in that spirit. But it
seems to me that in view of the continuous
working of the system under these orders,
and the assurance of their progressive dwindling, the most practical way to deal with
them is the way the government bas taken.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
senators, this bill could not have been
entrusted to a more capable senator than the
honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris). I cannot compete with
him for one moment in knowledge of legal
questions, as he is a very talented lawyer
and I have had no training whatever in that
respect. I prefer to deal with this bill from
a business and a practical angle, and to point
out how it is restrictive of the development
of this country, not only from an industrial
point of view, but also from the standpoint
of those who are engaged in wholesale and
retail business.
When the war broke out the government
was fully justified in creating, under the War
Measures Act, the Wartime Prices and Trade
Board. I have said before, and I repeat, that
no more capable gentleman could have been
appointed to administer that important and
very difficult department than Mr. Donald
Gordon. I would point out to honourable
senators that another great strength, probably
undisclosed, was behind Mr. Gordon and
the wartime prices board: I refer to an
enthusiastic public opinion and support.

MAY 7, 1947
The bill which has just been introduced is
supposed to terminate at the end of this year,
if parliament is in session. But parliament
will not be in session; therefore this bill will
remain in force until the end of March, 1948.
The bill, as my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Farris) no doubt is aware, is not popular.
A great many people think that it was unnecessary to prepare this bill and submit it to
parliament. That is the reason why I asked
the honourable senator whether parliament
in its wisdom could not by necessary legislation have taken control and provided for all
these emergencies which the Minister of
Justice enumerated in another place and
which have been emphasized here this afternoon. I believe that the business men of this
country are of the opinion that this is not an
emergency bill, and that its contents, outlining controls of 57 varieties, are unnecessary.
After all, the war ended two years ago.
No doubt the honourable senator from
Vancouver South has read the presidential
addresses of the heads of our large financial
institutions of the presidents of the Canadian
Manufacturers' Association, Chambers of Commerce, and other important bodies, who
presuinably have a thorough knowledge of
business conditions in this country and are
as interested as is the government or anybody
else in a wise conduct of our affairs.
Let us turn to the cost of living. My
honourable friend said nothing whatever about
the increased cost of living. While I am on
that subject, may I say, with all due respect
to my honourable friends across the way that
they have never been fair or just to the
Union Government that was in power during
the first war. We did not have all the controls that were in force during the last war;
but again and again when my Liberal friends,
inside this house and outside, were making
speeches over the radio or elsewhere they
said: "Contrast the cost of living in this war
with the cost of living in the first war."
Large cards were displayed in Montreal
departmental stores comparing the cost of
living from 1914-18 with current costs. Of
course, there was a wide difference, but no
mention was made of the hundreds of millions
of subsidies that the taxpayers of this country
have had to pay to keep the cost of living
down.
A great deal has been said about controls
and decontrols. I venture the opinion that
if not a single control whatever had been
lifted the cost of living would have gone up,
and it would have been beyond the power of
the Wartime Prices and Trade Board to prevent manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers

307

from getting certain advances in prices. I
make that statement because controls, after
all, play only a minor part in regard to the
increased cost of living. Ve have to consider
the increased wages, how they have advanced
during the last year, and the demands that
are still being made from one end of this
country to the other. Canada has unfortunately experienced strike after strike, resulting
in hundreds of millions of dollars being lost
to wage-earners and to the industries affected.
Those strikes have been a big factor in the
increased cost of living.
,Let us turn to the industrialist for a moment.
What are the problems that he has to contend with? Every raw material that he buys
is not only scarce and difficult to obtain, but
hs increased in value. His payroll has
increased, working hours are shorter, and the
ultimate result is an increased cost of production, causing an increase in the cost of
goods purchased by the consumer.
I am very grateful to the government for
removing a certain number of controls, but I
must say that I am not in sympathy with the
57 varieties that are outlined in this bill. Might
I also point out that more than a year ago
our neighbour across the line was forced by
public opinion to remove all controls except
those on rentals, sugar and rice. The chief
executive of the United States government, in
addressing a press conference a few days ago,
said that controls could not be reimposed in
that country, even if the government decided
it wanted them. I venture the opinion that the
majority of Canadians also feel that way. I
stated a short time ago and I reiterate, the
complete removal of controls would mean
increased. production, increased employment
and, eventually, lower cost of goods to the
consumer. There. is not any doubt in my mind
that this would be so.
The industries of Canada co-operated with
the government, as they should have, all during
the war. They turned their plants from peacetime production to wartime production; now
they are operating again on peacetime production. The people in industries are longing for
the freedom to go to their own offices and manage their own affairs and issue whatever directions they think are proper. Therefore, I cannot but regret that this bill is going to hold
good until March, 1948. The government, of
course, may remove a certain number of controls in what it calls an orderly fashion, but I
do not think the country would suffer in any
degree if all controls with the exception of the
rental control-and I am not so sure about
that one-were removed.

308

SENATE

My honourable friend from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) probably noticed in
a newspaper article of a few days ago a statement by a very clever and efficient lady, Mrs.
Leslie Hodges of Montreal, who was in charge
of the womens organization in connection with
the Wartime Prices and Trade Board. While
addressing lier organization and thanking them
for the splendid work they had done during
the war, she said, that in her opinion the time
had come when all controls ought to be
abolished.
I say this in a most friendly manner to my
honourable friend and to the members of the
government.
After having had such strict
controls in operation during the war it is
very difficult for the government to be brought
to feel that the war has been over for two
years, and that it is now time for cessation of
those controls. The ministers have no doubt
been largely influenced both by the controllers
and the large organizations that have been
under them. We have far teo many of these
officials in Canada today; I should say thousands too many, from one end of the country
to the other. And when the government ask
these so-called; experts what should be done,
the reply is: "Oh, you must continue this, and
you must continue that, and you must continue
the other thing".
I have looked over this bill only in a very
hurried manner, but I have noticed one very
important clause in it with reference to seamen. The honourable senator from Lunenburg
(Hon. Mr. D.uff) knows more about this subject than I do, but I am aware that under the
Shipping Act, to be a ship's master you must
hold a master's certificate, and to be a chief
engineer you must hold a chief engineer's
certificate. If this bill were passed without this
clause being altered, almost any man could be
master of a ship; the second engineer or the
third engineer could be appointed first engineer-all this being left te the discretion of
the Minister of Transport.
Honourable senators, I have perhaps spoken
too long on this very important bill, but I
want to reiterate that if the government
desired to please the majority of the people,
and not the minority, it would never have
introduced the bill. I do net profess to be a
constitutional lawyer in any way, but I sayand my honourable friend from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) will agree with me-that
if this bill had never been introduced parliament could have functioned and carried on
in a constitutional and regular manner in
spite of every emergency that my honourable
friend from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) bas referred to.

In conclusion, may I say that I am lining
up with the financiers and business men of
this country in a protest that the time is long
overdue when controls should have been
abolished. I know that we on this side of
the house are too few in number to prevent
the passage of the bill; but I do hope that
it will be pared down and that it will receive
the usal careful consideration when it is
referred to comrnittee.
Speaking more as a business man than anything else, for I am still closely associated
with that class, I say that we shall continue
to operate, but expansion will not be as great
and costs will net be as low as if this bill
bad never been introduced into parliament.
Hon. THOMAS A. CRERAR: Honourable
senators, we are all indebted to the honourable
senator who explained this bill (Hon. Mr.
Farris) for the clear exposition he gave of
the necessity for the measure and of this
manner of proceeding to enable the government to retain necessary powers for another
vear.
Other methods of procedure might
have been adopted. The government could
have introduced 57 different bills, covering
the matters referred te in this so-called omnibus bill. I think the procedure adopted is
perhaps the best.
I do not like controls any more than does
the honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris), or any other member of
this bouse. There is a good deal of truth in
the honourable gentleman's statement that
through the exercise of controls people become
more or less habituated to them; and our
younger generation grows up in an atmosphere
of control and perhaps does net fully recognize
and realize the value of liberty and freedom
of the individual.
But I differ with my
honourable friend from Alma (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) in his rather sweeping statement
that all the controls might well have been
abolished.
Certain ones, I think, must be
maintained for another year-perhaps two or
three years.
The «immense dislocations created by the
greatest war in history are still with us. I have
no doubt w-atever that if, for instance, rental
controls were abolished there would be a
sharp increase in rentals and continuing dissatisfaction
therefrom;
and
that
would
immediately become a factor in creating labour
and other unrest. Therefore, I think it is
essential that some measure of rental control
be eontinued until conditions in the country
become much more normal than they are
today.

MAY 7, 1947
If we discontinued the control over the
disposition of timber I venture 10 say Ibat we
would get very litIle lumber or building
material for houses or any other kind of construction ini Canada, except at mucli higher
prices than we pay today. That condition
would also lcad 10 discontent among the people
wbo want 10 build houses, and il would promole labour and other unrest. Controls on
other commodities, sucli as sugar, are essential
and should he maintained until we have more
ample supplies.
I have no fault 10 find witb the government
for proceeding as it bas with this bill. I do
hope and expeet that the controls will lie
rcmoved as rapidly as can reasonably lie doue.
Certainly wc in this country do not want 10
gel mbt

a continuing atmosphere of regimen-

talion and regulation of the individual. I
believe honourable senalors are sufficicntly
aware of my generàl views on that question so
thal I do nol need 10 elaborate them.
The bill covcrs one order in council wbich I
certainly should not like to see pass the
Senate withoul a word of prolcat: il bas to do
with the control of Canadian citizens of
Japanese origin. I know Ibis subi ect is a
delicate one, and I do not wish to discuss il
in any way thal will arouse feelings or antagonisms. I realize how strýongly, and I tbink quite
mistakenly, the people of Britisb Columbia
feel about this question, and I shahl deal wilb
il briefly from the angle of the elementiary
fundamental, riglits of Canadian citizen-s.
In Ibis country we have several thousand
Canadian cilizens of Japanese origin.

Some

of them are naturalizcd; some were born in
Ibis country of naturalived parents and are

For security reasons during the war il was

Under subparagraph (ài) of section 3--which
appears on page 110 of Office Consolidation of
Orders in Council-the Minister of Labour
may "determine from time to lime the oealities in wbicb persons of the Japanese race shall
be placed or may reside". Furtbermore, under
subparagraph (iv), be may "employ persons of
the Japanese race for such purposes at such
rates of wagcs and on such tcrms and conditions as he deems advisablc". Wbat dees that
mean? That the Minister of Labour may take
Canadian citizens, British subjects, simply
because they happen to be, of Japancsc origin,
and put them aI any sort of labour in Canada
that ha wisbcs 10 put lhemn at and pay any rate
of wages lie wishcs to pay. That is a crastic
and unjustified control over a British subject
and a Canadian citizen. If we get into the
easy habit of accepting these restrictions, why
could not this process lie applied to some other
minorities in Canada if some govcrnment in
the future did not like them. and, wisbed 10
harass them?
That is wby 1 wholly agrce witb wbat
the honourable senator who introduced the
blli said, that we 8hould have in mind that
il is easy 10 gel our people thinking along
these lines and difficult, sometimes, to gel them
10 retrace their steps.
The order contains other rcmarkable provisions. The minister may prevent Japanese
from moving from one place to another, and
they cannot move from one place of residence
10 another place of residence without a permit
from the minister. The persons subject 10
these restrictions are not alien enemies, but
Canadian citizens and British subjects who
happen to lie of Japanese origin. Frankly, I
tbink Ibis trcatment of a 'helplcss minority is
a blot on the good standards of our Canadian
citizenship.
On the larger question 1 have very definite
views. I arn opposed 10 any wbolcsale or even
moderate migration of Orientais 10 Canada.
But wc may have an opportunity of dealing
with this aspect o.f our immigration problems
at another time. 1 say this, thal we in Canada,
baving acccpted Japanese immigrants and
given them naturalization papers--and their
cbildren, bmr here, lieing entitled to ah Ithe
rights of Canadian citizens--it is a harsh and
unjustified discrimination to maintain these
provisions in the law. I was broughl up in a
school of libcraiism that did not believe in
that sort of thing, and ai Ibis time of life
I amn not going to change t3hose convictions
on any grounds of expediency, no matter how
mucli the expedicncy may lie urged.
1 jusl wisb, bonourable senators, 10 make

SENATE

Hon. G. P. BURCHILL:
Honourable
senators, the purpose of this bill, as explained
sa ably by the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris), is to
provide legislation whereby certain controls
which operated under war emergency measures
can be continued.
I want to detain the house for just a few
minutes, because I feel that I cannot let the
opportunity pass without saying a word about
one of these controls which it is proposed
to continue, namely, the timber control.
First, I should like to pay tribute to the
men who organized the timber control and
made it work, and were willing by their unselfish devotion to the cause, and at great personal sacrifice, to undertake
this very
unpopular and demanding commission. All
of them have done a good job. But I
refer particularly to Mr. MacMillan, Mr.
Nicholson, Mr. Williamson, Mr. Rosenberry,
Mr. Flahiff, and to their loyal and hardworking staffs, many of whom left their
homes and worked long hours, day after day,
here in Ottawa, doing a very thankless job.
I think we are apt to forget the services
these men rendered to the state, and particularly the job they had to do in the lumber
industry, in which pioneering individualism bas
been conspicuous down through Canada's
history, and in which still the risks and
adventure and speculation involved mark it
as an industry for men who hunt alone or in
very small tcams, preferring to swim or sink
on their own judgment.
The first object of the timber control was
ta assist in stimulating increased production.
Hon. Mr. LESAGE: May I ask the honourable senator whether the gentlemen he
mentioned were dollar-a-year, big-salaried
gentlemen?
Hon. Mr. BURCHILL: I think that most
of them were.
Some of them were paid by
their own firms who sent them here. How
these men succeeded or how in that period
success was attained in increasing production,
I think is shown in very striking figures. In
1939 the total lumber production of Canada
was 3,976,000,000 feet. In 1946 production
had increased ta almost five billion, or an
increase of over one billion feet. Of this
total the Maritime Provinces' production in
1939 was 420,000,000 feet; and last year, 1946,
it was 632,000,000 feet, or an increase of
almost fifty per cent.
Now, while I wish to give the timber control all possible credit for its share in
directing and assisting, I feel that these
figures could only have been possible by the

co-operation and achievements of the lumber
industry itself. Over the whole home front
during the war years, I do not think that any
other industry excelled the achievement of
the lumbermen of Canada; and when I say
that I wish to include not only the executive
and management, but I am thinking also of
labour, with particular reference to that
permanent staff in the office, in the mill and
in the woods which every lumber operator
from east to west depends upon, and without
whose loyalty and devotion to the job the
colossal output which I have mentioned
would not have been possible.
The next function of the timber control
was distribution, to allocate lumber to the
various war industries here in Canada where
the need was greatest. This distribution
created many difficulties and encountered
many obstacles; but Canada's war effort, which
was not exceeded by any other of the United
Nations on the basis of population, is, I think,
the best proof of how fully that control succeeded. However, when you think of distribution you must also include the important
question of export, for it must bc remembered
that previous to the war Canada's lumber
industry was entirely dependent upon export
trade. In fact, Canadian wood was one of
the first products of this country shipped
abroad. Down through the entire history of
our land this trade bas always been one of
the main arteries through which circulated
that world trade which is so essential to our
growth and development and economic wellbeing.
Under the export regulations of the timber
control you will find that much more lumber
is being retained in Canada at the present
time than in pre-war days. In 1939, of the
3,976,000,000 feet produced, 2,211,000,000 feet,
or 55 per cent. was sent out of Canada, while
in 1946 only 2,075,000,000 feet, or 42 per cent,
was allowed to leave Canada. This means
that in 1939 only 1,765,000,000 feet were sold
in this country, while in 1946 nearly three
billion feet of Canadian lumber was used in
the domestic market. Of the Maritimes production, in the seven pre-war years, an average
of approximately 90 million feet remained in
Canada, while last year, under the regulations of the timber control, we were obliged
to sell for consumption here not less than
240 million feet.
Honourable senators, to us in the Maritimes
the question of export is a matter of life and
death.
Our natural market is the United
Kingdom, where we have been shipping since
the earliest times. 'Ihe domestic markets of
Ontario and Quebec are economic impossibili-

MAY 7, 1947
ties, on account of the long freight haul. And
in addition to ail this there is at the present
time a difference of from $15 to $25 per
thousand feet in the net return to the Maritimes mili between the Canadian ceiling price
and the worid price. In fact, there is flot a
single sawmill in the Maritime Provinces
whieh could turn a wheel today if we were
confined entirely to the Canadian market.
1 would estimate an actual difference of $10
to $12 per thousand feet as between this
year's cost of production and the figure the
Canadian ceiling would bring in an -average
lumber operation in the Maritime Provinces
this year.
No one disiikes controls more than I do,
but I think the honourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) expressed al
our feelings very ably this afternoon when he
said that it was necessary, under present conditions, to removýe these restrictions gradually.
While the present demand for lumber exists
in Canada, with the shortage of houses, which
particularly affects our veterans, and for that
matter a large percentage of our population,
I cannot loin with those in the industry who
favour immediate de-control. I think the
poiicy of releasing controls gradually, as conditions permit is sound and is in the best
interests of ail concerned; but control of the
liimber industry, or, in fact, of any industry,
under war emergency, is one thing, and control
in peace-time is quite another. To maintain
a price structure and enforce it by government
regulation which will suit the producer, the
wholesaler, the broker, the retailer, the consumer and the exporter, seems to me to be
rather beyond man's ingenuity. The result is
that today there are some sections of the trade
where the restrictions are bearing very heavily
and creating many difficulties.
As I have mentioned above, the Maritimes
industry-and I arn speaking particularly for
them. because the West bas no lack of cbampions-must have more air in order to live.
In other words, they must be allowed to export
a larger proportion of their output if they are
to be compelled to take, for wbat they sel
in Canada, prices which are many dollars
below their actual cost of production. As I
have indicated, 240 million feet were sold in
Canada in 1946 as against a normal sale of 90
million feet in, 1939; 40 per cent as comparcd
with 21 per cent.
The retailer in my section of Canada is very
much dissatisfied because hie cannot buy lumber. H1e cannot meet the prices which are
being offered the operator for export shipment,
and seli in the Canadian market. Personally,
1 think tbat many of these dîfficulties would

311

be lessened, il not eliminated, if the Canadian
ceiling price sehedule was revised upwards,
and a dloser relationship established between
world prices and the domestie ceiling, so that
when the timp comes to lift restrictions prices
would be more in uine and the readjustments
would not be so acute.
Just recently some adjustments were made
in the regulations as they affect certain milis
in British Columbia and otber sections of
western Canada. I want to plead for the industry in the East, where production was stepped
up 50 per cent during the war and wbere the
control authorities will agree they always
received 100 per cent co-operation. I wouid
earnestiy suggest to the presýent control authorities that a close study be made of conditions
in the industry in the Maritimes, with particular reference to our export trade, and also
witb a view to making adjustments which will,
if not entirely eliminate, tend to correct some
of these grievances. wbich I have indicated
and of which certain sections of the industry
are complaining very much at present.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Hlonourable senators, may I join witb the senator
from Aima (Hon. Mr. Baliantyne) in the comnpiimentary remarks he made respecting the
honourable gentleman from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris), who so ably and iucidly
explained this bill.
I cannot go ail the way with the views of the
senator from Vancouver South, nor can I agree
entirely witb the senator from Aima in bis
suggestion that ail controis be aboiisbed. 1
think perhaps it would be somewhat redundant
on my part if I said that I too amn not in
favour of controls as such.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Wili the bonourable gentleman pardon me? I said that possibly we ought to retain the control of rentais.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I was about to mention that point, but 1 thank the bon-ourable
gentleman for correcting my previous statement.
We -are ail anxious to sec controls abolished
as this becomes possible, but I hesitate to. contempiate the picture that would present itself
in this country if we at t-his time withdrew
our controis over rentais and tenants. In an
economy wbere housing is an absolute necessity to ail the people, andi where there are
fewer bouses tban tenants, 1 hesitate to visualize what wouid bappen if we had unrestricted
competition for bousing accommodation. I
can imagine that the reaction of those who
own bouses would iead to a spiraliing increase
in rentais, and the eviction of people would be
scanclalous and distastrous. Until we get at

SENATE
least a little closer to the ideal conditions of
a house for each family, we must continue this
form of control.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Will mv honourable friend
answer a question?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Under what principle does
the government assume the right to place controls on one particular kind of property and on
no other. What I mean is this. Why should
a man or woman who has invested money in
a house be prohibited from getting the earned
value of that property, when someone who has
money in another type of investment can
dispose of it at whatever price he or she likes?
May I further illustrate it this way? If one
has his money in stocks or bonds, and the
price goes up, be is allowed to sell and take
his profit. On the other hand. to the investor
who has his money in houses the government
says, "You must take only the rent you could
get in 1941, when the cost of building was half
what it is today". I have never been able
to understand the principle of that type of
J can appreciate the demand for
control.
housing, becausie there are ten thousand
people renting compared to one thousand who
are owners. I should like to have someone
explain that principle to me.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: J do not know that
I can enter into a philosophical dissertation on
the right of the government with respect to
the control of individual property, but so far
as the investment of money is concerned I can
perhaps explain it this way. If I invest my
money in bricks and you invest yours in straw,
and your straw burns and my bricks do not,
you have no complaint so far as I am concerned. If on the other hand, you invest
your money in a house, and I invest mine in
an automobile, you may rent the louse, but
I cannot claim the right to run over people
on the street.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is not answering my
question.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: There is a control
over how one may use property. The mere
investment of money in property does not
change the character of the property. It is not
right that the members of a community who
have invested in bouses should be allowed to
take advantage of their fellow citizens, and by
virtue of their ownership of a necessity of life
to mulet themn for undue amounts or to exercise in an oppressive manner the right of
eviction.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I add one more
thought?
No houses have been built for
rental since the control measure went on.
That is the logical result of such action.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I can scarcely agree
with that observation of my honourable friend,
for the reason that there was practically no
new construction of houses in Canada since
the market upset of about 1929. I have had
the figures as to how little building was donc
in the years preceding the war. We were then
ten years behind in the construction of houses,
and of course during the war we built practically none. To some extent the government
has a paternal responsibility to protect the
weak against the strong. It has a responsibility at this time to say that those who own
houses shall not take unjust advantage of and
mulet their fellow citizens who are tenants.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: It is all right to say
that the owner shall not take unjust advantage,
but these regulations do not contemplate that
he will get any advantage, even a just one.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I have heard some
great wails from the landlord class, but we
should not forget that during the past five
or six years owners of buildings and property
have had no expense in the renting of their
properties: they have paid practically no
commissions, incurred no bad debts, suffered
no vacancies, and, as somebody has suggested,
they have made no repairs. Landlords have
derived a steady return from their property,
notwithstanding the controls, and values have
greatly increased. I think one condition offsets
the other.
May I recall to my honourable colleagues
in this house that there is no other factor
in a community which tends more rapidly and
certainly to business recession, breakdown and
stagnation than an undue increase in land
values and rentals. Do not forget tIhat rents
have two characteristics. There is the rent
of the bouse, w'hich is produced by industry,
by the bands of men, and as to which there
can be some competition under normal
circumstances; and there is the rent of the
land itself, which is purely a matter of
monopoly, the right accorded to an individual
to own a part of the earth to the exclusion
of all his fellows, and, after paying a portion
of its value in taxes, to keep the balance for
himself. The latter is a monopoly; and there
is no limitation, beyond the ability of the
nation to pay, of the height to which those
values may be boosted. I tbhink we are
entirely justified in retaining rent controls, and
I sec nothing but disaster ahead of us if we
allow them to go.

313

MAY 7, 1947
But I did not intend to make a speech on
that subi ect. It was my purpose to say a few
words on something else.

The gentleman who explained the bill said
that the men who had run Canada during
this war could not hring themselves to act
the part of despots. He generously extended
that compliment to tbe opposition parties
and to aIl of us, and so hie has included me
along with the rest. And I say to you,
gentlemen, that I cannot bring myscîf at this
time to act the part of a despot, either in
dealing with this bill or in any other way.
I, like the honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar), am a liberal. I mean it.
1 do not propose to vote for a measure, which
in my j udgment is anti-liberal to the last
degrce. mercly because it is included in what
is known as an omnibus bill. I am not going
into the question of whctber this legislation
migbt have been brought before us in a more
convenient form. It is here in this form, and
we shaîl baye to deal with it as it is.
I do not go along with the honourable
senator fromn Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) when hoe says that the principle of
the bill consists in the omnibus, to the total
disrcgard of the passengers that the omnibus
carries. I find included in the freight within
this vehicle is the order in counicil to which
the honourable senator fromn Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) bas rcferred with such eloquence,
such force, and, 1 think, such logic. I wish to
adopt every sentence whicb hie bas cxpressed,
and to say that I cannot vote for this measure
while it contains this particular objectionable
feature. It is only one of the 57 vanieties,
but honourable gentlemen will remember that
a littie yeast leaveneth the whole. So a very
little virus will, perhaps, spoil the whole, and
a drop of poison makes an entire batch

unacceptable.

The drop of poison which I

find in this omnibus bill makes it impossible
for me to vote for the whole measure. I refer
to Order in Counicil P.C. 946, at page 109 of

the O/lice Consolidationts of Orders in Co'uncil,
a copy of which bas been supplied to us.
Section 2 of the order, reproduced on page 110,
states:
2. It shahl be the duty of the minister to plan,
supervise and direct the evacuation from the

protected areas of British Columbia of all persons of the Japanese race and the placement and
control of such persons elsewhere, in Canada and

to take sncb measure-And so on. 0f course thiB order was passed
some little time ago, on February 5, 1943.
It provided for the evacuation of the Japanesc. I arn not going to, criticize that action;
it wa.s done under pressure of war. Apparently
the Japanese themselves hold no animus
9gainst us for what we did, at that time, in

the removal of those of Japanese origin froîn
coast districts. But they do hold resentînent,
and I think justly and rightly so, for the
treatment which was accorded them. Incidentally to this experience their property was
seized. Also it was sold, and sold at knockdown and sacrifice prices which, I think, are
a scandai. I join with those who now demand
an investigation into the sale of these people's
properties and a just compensation to them for
what they have unnecessarily suffered at our
hands.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Why were they sold?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I know of no good
I can guess
public reason and no excuse.
reasons, but tbey would flot be complimentary
te, some people, and 1 arn not so fully posted
that 1 can prove my suspicions. But they were
sold, and sold at prices wbich in my judgmcnt,
and according to, the knowledge which I now
posscss, were a disgrace. However, that episode is past. But this order heaps insuit upon
injury, and in a most unnecessary way. The
crisis which justified the remnoval of the
Japanese has gone hy. It is dishonest and
insincere to suggest now that that crisis justifies
us in the control which we continue to exercise
over this minority group.
1 further read that:
3. (1) The Minister rnay(ji) determine f rom time to time the loealties in which persons of the Japanese race shall
be placed or iuay reside.
The Japanese are a small group, a minority.
Tbey number about 24,000 of our whole population of some twelve million. To say that
there is any e.mergency which justifies this
measure and should put that smali group under
control of officiais of the goverament, is to
be insincere and undemocratic.
Further, the minister may employ persons of
the Japanese race under the conditions which
have been referred to by the honourable member from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). Also,
hie may(vii) require, by order, any person of the
Japanese race in any place in Canada to proceed
to any other place in Canada at such time and
in such manner as he may prescribe.

Once again:

hie may-

(viii) . .. prohibit sucb persons of the Japanesc race or such other persons f rom moving or
travelling anywhere in Canada, or from. residîng
in any place or area in Canada, except subject
to a permit issued by or on behaîf of the Minister and on such terras and conditions as may
be prescribed by 'him or by any person authorized to act on his behaîf under these regulations.
That means, honourable senators, that so far
as these Canadian citizens are concerned, Canada becomes a police state and they, like the

SENATE
Helots of Russia, are tied to the land where
they happen to stand and cannot move freely
from place to place as British subjects should
be allowed to move and as Canadian citizens
have a right to move.
I object. I gag at legislation of that kind.
I will have none of it. Honourable senators,
let me point out that it provides penalties. It
says:
The deputy minister may exercise all powers
conferred on the minister under these regulations.
That is to say, this arbitrary control of the
lives of individuals is in the hands of a civil
servant.
Then the order says--and mark this:
There shall be a Commissioner of Japanese
Placement w-ho shall, under the minister and the
deputy minister, be the chief executive officer
charged with the administration of these regulations and who may under their control and direction exercise each and every power conferred
by these regulations on the minister.
You talk about controllers. We have complained that controllers have interfered with
our right to- buy and sell, but what do you
think of a controller who is appointed by the
executive and has the right to say to a
Canadian citizen: "You shall go from this
spot to that spot. You may not stay here.
You must go somewhere else."? Why, honourable senators, that is an interference with
civil liberty.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: We are attempting
to teach them democracy over in Japan.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I hope the Japanese
people do not learn their democracy from
this particular order in council.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: From a Toronto
barrister I have received a letter which says
in part:
This order provides that persons of Japanese
origin shall not travel in British Columbia or
reside there without permit. This as you will
realize, raises important questions of principle
in regard to civil liberties and racial discrimination. It applies to veterans, an seens ineonsistent with our international obligations. It is
based upon a supposed emergency which no
longer exists.
We believe that it is the funetion of the
Senate amongst other things to defend civil
liberties, and that the Senate may be free from
that pressure of sectional interest which sometimes affects the elected members of the House
of Commons.
I have listened to representatives of British
Columbia speaking on this or allied questions,
and felt ashamed of their extreme statements

and the loss, it seemed to me, of their grip
upon liberal principles or common decency
between man and man.
The situation of the Japanese group in
Canada bears, in my mind, a striking resemblance to that of the Jewish group under
Hitler. Except that we do not perpetrate
murder upon them as he did, I find it
rather difficult to differentiate between the
principles of Hitlerism as it applied to the
Jew in Germany and the principles of this
order as it applies to the Japanese in Canada.
I say to my fellow members in the Senate
that I would have none of this kind of legislation; that I would not soil my hands or
my reputation by voting for legislation that
contains a measure of that kind. I would
have none of it.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN: It was not my
intention to participate in the discussion, but
since the honourable senator for Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) and the fhonourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) have
touched on a phase of the controls as to which
I am in complete accord with their views,
I feel I should express my feelings at this
time.
I go back to the First Great War, when
most of us went about the country saying
that Britain and Canada were standing for
the pledged word that Britain had given to
Belgium. We boasted to the new citizens of
Canada at that time, and have done so ever
since, that Britain and Canada stood by their
word.
When I come to deal with the question of
the Japanese who have become citizens of
this country, I feel that we are breaking our
pledged word to them by the action we took
during the war and have been taking since
the end of the war.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: When we allowed
them to become citizens of Canada they
pledged themselves to live up to
the
obligations of Canadian citizenship, and we
accepted them as Canadian citizens under
these circumstances.
We have not treated
them as Canadian citizens and have not
trusted them as they were entitled to be
trusted. I have had enough experience with
them to say this: during the period of the
war and since that time, the Japanese have
been just as good citizens of this country as
has any other element. We had no crime
in which they participated during the war
years, and as far as I could ascertain, they

;

MAY 7, 1947

wsrs thoroughly loyal to us; at any rate,
they wsrs citizens of Canada and deserved
the same treatment as ahl other citizens of
this country.
I think a dangerous precedent bas been
established in that, under certain circumstances, with a certain type of government in
control of tbe affairs of Canada, we could
endanger the position of many minorities in
Canada by penalizing tbemn on the ground of
colour, race or religion. That would ho disastrous. I agree completely with the senator fromn
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Roebuek) and the senator
fromn Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) that this is
entirely contrary to libsraiism-and I mean
with a lower-case 'T'. I am not speaking of

party polities at ail. I feel it is a danger-ous
precedent that we are estahlishing.

I myseif

think it would be an advantage to the Japanese element and to Canada if they were
distributed more evenly over the country at
large and not settlsd in ons province. I am
opposed to group-settlement anywhere in this
dominion. If we are going to allow citizens
of ýother countries to enter Canada and become
acquainted with our principles of government and standard of living, it is hetter that
they mix with people who have been here for a
long psriod of time.
May I say something else in respect to the
They have sougbt and
Japanese people?
obtained. education in the schools and universities of Canada. They have been taugbt in
these schools that Canad'a and Britain stood
for certain bigh principles. These young people
have grown up witb these thougbts impressed
upon themn by teachers in schools sud, by
professors in universities and what has bappened bas been ahsolutsly in contradiction to
wbat they wers taught.
Honourable senators, I do feel very seriously
that this is dangerous legisiation, and that
it shoul-d not be placsd upon our statuts books
and maintained. It is not only hypocritical ou
our own part, but in the minds of people whu
have come bere from other land-s and taken the
oath of Canadian citizenship it creates the feeling that Canada does not live up to the
obligations it bas imposed, upon them.

without any amendment.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, when shall this bill be read the third
ti-me?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Though my memory of
these matters is flot always reliable, it is my
recollection that this bill was discussed the
other day in the Senate. Because of what
Was said at that time, I arn surprised that no0

ainendment was made in comrnittee. I cannot
understand that. Two distinguished members
of this house objected very strenuously to
the draftsmanship of the bihl-a matter on
which I did flot comment-and I am astonished that they have flot something to say
now about the reporting of the bill without
amcndment. I wonder what was wrong with
flic
committee
this morning.
Was
it
improperly advised as to how this bill should
be drawn, or what, happened? It seems te
me that, the two distinguishied gentlemen wbo
crificized the bill shouhd tbink twice before
making statements that lead to so much
publicity as we received the other day. I
have fno objection to the third reading of
the bill.
Hon.
Mr.
ROBERTSON:
Honourable
senators, unless there is some objection the
bihl might wehl be given third reading now.
I believe the points brought up the other
day by the senator from Lunenburg (Hon
Mr. Duif) have been thoroughhy explained te
bis satisfaction.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I tbink the bilh should
hav e third reading. whether a "spanking" is
given or not.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Being a layman.
I did not. participate in the legal discussion;
but some of my brethren who arc versed in
thes law gave their most careful consideration
te the points that were raised, and the committee bias reported the bill without amendment.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I was one of those
wbo raised objection te the bill. However,
the bill was referred to committee: it was
evidenthy studied there, and it is now rcported
withbut amendaient. My objection w4s flot
te the substance of the bill, but enly to its
form. I sf iii think the objection was a salntary one, because the bill recited things as
facfs--which is 'bad draughtsmanship-and. the
notes did not explain it se that it wouhd be
undýerstood. But I have no objection to ýthird
reading if the committee's study shows that
the bill dýoes in fact carry eut the substance
of the exphanatory note.

IMMIGRAION
INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hlon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, may I ask a question of the
leader .of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson)? I believe that either yesterday or the
day before hie laid on the table a number of
treaties of peace. The question of whether
those treaties are now in effeet is of great
importance fromn the standpoint of immigratien, because for immigration purposes the
natioinals of those countries are considered
alien enemies. It would be of service if the
government leader would informi the house
what countries are involved in the treaties, laid
on the table. and whether the nationals are
still alien enemies fromn the stanctpoint of
immigration. Is Finland, for instance, still
considered an &lien enemy? Probably the
honourable gentleman cannot answer my question off-band, but if hie would provide the
information tomorrow it would be, of re-al
service.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I shaHl be glad to secure whatever information I eau, but the matter would be facilitated if the honoutrable gentleman would prepare a draft of bis specific question, 'which
could be banded to the appropriate department.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I shall do so.

SENATE
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD BILL
MOTION FOR TIIIRD READING POSTPONED

On the Order:
Third reading of Bill 23, as amended, an Act
to amend the Can'adian Wheat Board Act, 1935.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I had intended that third reading of this
bill should be proceeded with today, but yesterday the honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) intimated to me that
there was a question he wished me to have
answered before this order was proceeded with.
I am not in a position to give the answer
today, and therefore I ask that this order stand,
to be proceeded with tomorrow afternoon.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members, I
have no authority to say so, but I understand
that bills of this character will be considered
in another place tom.orrow night. This bill
should get there by that time.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: It will.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I wish to facilitate the progress of the bill as much as possible, but since I am not able to answer the
honourable gentleman's question I ask that
the order stand until tomorrow.
The order stands.
CONTINUATION OF TRANSITIONAL
MEASURES BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson for the second reading of Bill 104,
an Act to provide for the continuation of
certain orders and regulations of the Governor
in Council for a limited period during the
national emergency arising out of the war.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable cenators, I do not intend to speak at any great
length, but there are a number of phases of
the bill which I wish to touch on.
May I say first that J enjoyed listening to
the explanation of the bill by the senator
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris).
The honourable gentleman likes to joke a little
about the name of the official opposition party.
A number of other members have seemed to
imply that because they belong to the Liberal
party they are the only Simon-pure liberals.
I must say right now that I have been a
liberal all my life; in fact, I grew up under
the great old party which was then named the
Liberal Conservative party. There is a part
of this bill that I would call mature socialism
or communism or dictatorship; and another
part strikes me as being green or undeveloped

socialism. I may tell the honourable senator
from Vancouver South that his party, if it
keeps on leaning over backwards and sponsoring this kind of legislation, will take on not
merely a double name, but a triple name.
I consider that good law is reasonable law, and
my colleagues who are members of the legal
profession will no doubt agree with me. From
my experience I believe that even in managing
a family a man should give only such orders
as are capable of being obeyed, and he should
see to it that they are obeyed.
As to the sale of used cars, I can think
of nothing more ridiculous than the abolition
last spring of the ceiling on prices. In Western
Canda, at least, there is a great difference
between the amount of use which cars receive
in one employment and in another. A farmer
may own a car, give it special care, and use
it only to take drives on Sundays. Another
car of the same make and the same year may
be driven forty thousand miles more than the
farmer's car. Yet there was a uniform ceiling
price, and a great many men were fined for
selling their cars above that price, and orders
were issued from Ottawa to refund this or
that person $600, and so on. When the order
was ignored and new court proceedings were
taken, the judge, considering that the defendant had been fined on the first occasion, would
impose a fine of about $25; and in many
cases the order from Ottawa bas not been
obeyed to this day.
Then, tractors needed by farmers to handle
their crops have been sold, even when three
or four years old, for $1,000 or more above the
price of new tractors. Apparently no objection bas been taken to machine men gathering
up a train-load of second-hand machines to
sell at these inflated prices. At any rate, we
heard no word of protest from the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) ; he seems to think it is all right for
people to make money in that way.
But the situation is viewed differently when
a man happens to own a house. In this connection I speak for myself; I do not profess
to represent anyone. I honestly believe that
we would not have had any trouble with
housing if either we had not had rent control, or it had been abolished long ago.
Last fall I received a fine pamphlet in which
the author told the story of the San Francisco
fire and the housing shortage which resulted;
and he stated-giving percentages to support
his statement-that when there was interference with private enterprise the great
majority of houses were for sale and not for
rent, while as soon as control was relaxed any

319

MAY 8, 1947

number of houses were available for rent and
not for sale. People were satisfied because
they had control of their property.
While I agree absolutely with the senator
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
as to the order affecting Japanese Canadians,
1 disagrec with his view that an increase of
prices is a sure forerunner of a general breakdown. To me that is a strange argumentas strange as the idea that money is bad for
the farmer but good for everyone else,
especially the machine companies.
I am coming to the defence of the average
man and woman. The person who makes a
study of company statements and company
finance, and is thoroughly capable of sizing
up industrial prospects and stock values, can
invest his money safely in industrial enterprises and receive a satisfactory return.
Nbbody would deprive him of that opportunity. But average men and women whose
experience is less specialized feel that their
money is safer in a bouse, in a bit of property. I know of women who are struggling
to live and would like to sell their house
property, so as to get some money; but they
cannot sell, because the tenants in occupation are paying less than the rental value and
will not move out, and no one will buy a
bouse unless the vendor can give possession.
Such a state of affairs amounts to pure
dictatorship.
As to shortage of houses, the evidence of
the daily newspapers confirms what the author
of the pamphlet said. Take, for example, the
Victoria Daily Colonist. We find two full
pages advertising houses for sale. I read at
random:
Reasonably priced house, bargain price Gorge;
special five-room modern bungalow, white siding,
large living room, dinette, kitchen, tiled sink,
two lovely bedrooms, tiled bath and shower
room, full basement, $7,300.
There are any number of bouses for sale,
but not for rent.
Hon.

Mr.

ASELTINE:

With

immediate

possession?

Hon. Mr. HORNER: With immediate
possession of a whole lot of them, yes. I
certainly do not want to see the government
build any more houses. Here is a Toronto
paper in which any number of bouses and
apartment buildings are offered, with immediate possession, and at what look like reasonable prices. I do not know why they would
want to build any more bouses in Toronto;
I think there are too many people there now.
Here is a Vancouver paper with pages of

advertisements of houses for sale, the great
majority of them with possession immediately
or by the 1st of June or the lst of July.
You will find the same story in the Calgary
newspapers: two pages of advertisements,
showing that there are plenty of reasonably
priced houses. I have before me an Edmonton
newspaper and once again there is the same
thing-houses for sale, with immediate possession. The prices look reasonable. For every
house offered for rent there are a hundred
offered for sale. That bears out what was said
in the pamphlet I mentioned.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Does my honourable friend feel that these prices are reasonable?
Hon Mr. HORNER: I think they are. Perhaps in your judgment they are not.
Hon. Mr. A. L. BEAUBIEN: You have not
seen the houses, have you?
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
Calgary.

He has seen them in

Hon. Mr. HORNER: I have seen some in
Calgary, yes. In Saskatoon it is the same
story: houses are going down in price.
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD:
Quebec?

What about

Hon. Mr. HAIG: And Winnipeg?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: There are houses for
sale in Quebec and Montreal. I have the
Montreal Gazette here, and its advertisement
pages contain any amount of offers that look
to me like good bargains. The same is true of
the Leader Post of Regina and the Saskatoon
Star Phoenix.
I can take you on a trip fifty miles from
Ottawa and in an hour or two show you a
dozen vacant houses that would suit the need
of returned men who are anxious to get on
the land. These are farm houses, in some of
which as many as twelve children have been
raised. Surely it ought to be made possible
for veterans to live for some time in these
houses. The difficulty arises from rent control.
To my mind there is no justification for continuing that control. It is interfering, not with
the wealthy people, but with the poorer class.
Owners have been allowed a slight increase in
rents, but because of the control they find it
almost impossible to seil property.
There is another feature of the argument in
opposition to rent control. We all know of
people having large apartments with far more
room than they need. They secured, them at
reasonable rentals prior to the war; and they
hang on to them; whereas, if there was no
rent control they would take smaller quarters

SENATE
and make their present apartments available to
larger families.
That condition is pretty
general. All over the country there are people
using more space than they need.
Somebody stated that there has not been
any construction work going on. If he took a
look at the building records for the past year
in Calgary or Victoria or Vancouver he would
change his mind. I was visiting Calgary and
Edmonton a year ago, and I would be taken for
a drive and shown new building sites here and
there, each with perhaps fifty bouses under construction. It is net right to say that there bas
been no building. Construction is going on
today, and there would be more if private
enterprise were allowed and a man could
bandle his own property.
I say that the control means discrimination
against one class of investor. After all, from
the standpoint of the country's welfare the best
investor is the man who has the faith to put his
money in the land, in a house. He is the real
Canadian, the real citizen. It is the worst
kind of dictatorship to continue now, two years
after the war, to single out owners of residential property as a class and say to them,
"You cannot do this and you cannot do that".
And this nonsense has been carried even to the
villages. In the village of Blaine Lake, where
I live, there are people who bought houses but
cannot get into them. Rent control may have
been needed at one time, in the larger cities,
but it is no longer necessary even there. It
never should have been extended te villages,
where it has worked much hardship.
I am going to remain free and opposed te
Socialism here. I got a dose of it out in
Saskatchewan. and that will keep me going for
quite a while.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: May I give one
instance to show how public ownership works
out? The Canadian National Railway serves
the town in which I live, and yet the government bas gone inte the bus business there. It
has incurred the expense of grading the highway and widening it by eight feet, net because
the community had any particular need of the
improvement, but simply so that a bus could
be operated parallel te the railway from Battleford to Prince Albert. The people are paying
out of their pockets for two government-owned
transportation systems, running side by side,
and taking business away from each other. I
say again that I have seen enough of that sort
of thing, and as long as I have a vote I will
vote against it.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

Hon. W. D. EULER: Honourable senators,
while it is my hope that the many controls
continued by this bill will not remain in effect
long, it is my intention to deal only with that
part of the measure that has to do with the
rights, privileges and disabilities of Canadian
citizens of the Japanese race, especially those
born in Canada. This matter was discussed at
some length yesterday.
Some years ago, during the war, I expressed
my disapprov al of the harsh treatment of these
people. It may be felt by many that the
treatment was justified under war conditions.
But the war is now over, and this bill proposes
to continue the treatment. Under the bill and
its regulations no Japanese Canadian-I do not
like the term, but it expresses what I meanHon. Mr. CRERAR: Canadian of Japanese
origin.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The term is still cumbersome.
Under the provisions of the bill no Japanese
Canadian may set foot upon the sacred soil
of his native province of British Columbia.
Surely that is bad enough, but the bill goes
on to provide that upon the order of a prescribed government official be may be forced
to remain at any other place in Canada, or to
go to work in any other part of Canada. I was
much interested in the remarks of the senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), and particularly in his quotation from the order in
council embodied in the bill now before us.
May I read it? It says that the minister may:
employ persons of the Japanese race for such
purposes at such rates of wages and on such
ternms and conditions as he deens advisable.
I admit that that provision was a surprise to
me. If this regulation is as I interpret it, that
the minister or official may direct any Canadian citizen of the Japanese race to go te any
part of Canada and be compelled to work for
wages and on such terms as ho may decide, I
say that it is nothing short of slavery and is a
disgrace te the parliament of Canada.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: What does it mean?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I do net know if my
interpretation is the correct one, but the provision is certainly capable of being interpreted
in that way. I should like the leader of the
government to explain what that portion of
the bill is intended te mean.
I wonder if we are losing sight of the fact
that Canadian citizenship implies duties and
responsibilities, as well as privileges and, rights.
This bill does nothing to exempt these particular people from tax-paying and other responsibilities which they, as citizens, have; it does,

MAY 8, 1947
however, rob them of the greatest right that
any free citizen may have-the right to move
about at will, as every other Canadian may do.
What is really behind this particular legislation? We may as well be frank. It is not
fear of the Japanese as a race, or the Japanese
Canadian, but fear of business competition in
some parts of Canada. I might even say that,
so far as parliament is concerned, it is fear
of the votes of people opposed to Canadian
citizens of Japanese origin. Surely no one
will contend that the comparatively few
thousand Japanese Canadians are or can be
a menace to the 12 million Canadians of other
origin. I emphasize, and I speak ad.visedly,
that in this bill principle again yields to
political expediency, as it so often does. I
say that democracy-a word we use too freely,
and perhaps insincerely-is in danger of
becoming a synonym for autocracy and, if you
will, hypocrisy.
The argument is sometimes heard that Japanese Canadians will not assimilate with other
Canadians. That may be true, and if so it
would be a good argument against further
But these
immigration from the Orient.
people are here under the law of Canada, and
if there bc any fauit for that fact it is the
fault of those governments, whatever their
political complexion may have been, which
permitted immigration from Japan.
Inevitably this thought comes to my mind:
if the government can do this to Canadians
of one racial origin, it may do the same thing
to other minority groups in the country.
I am particularly shocked at this legislation.
Perhaps I speak with a little more feeling than
I otherwise should because of the fact that I
might personally become subject to legislation of this kind. Though I was born in this
country, honourable senators know that I
come of a race recently at war with Canada.
I may be the only member of this honourable
body who is in that position. I am no more
a citizen of Canada than are these Canadians
of the Japanese race. It could consistently be
demanded that nearly half a million Canadians of the same ancestry as mine be subjected to such outrageous discrimination as
that to which Japanese Canadians are subjected. I add, without fear of contradiction,
that the war record of these citizens of the
that
German race will bear comparison wi
of any other race in Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I wonder if any government would insult these thousands of fine
Canadians with the same sublime courage that
is shown in the treatment of a few thousand
helpless Canadians of the Japanese race.
83168-21

I emphasize that this legislation is based
upon political expediency, and I judge by
what has taken place here and in the other
house that the fear which prompts it possesses
the members of both political parties, with
some honourable exceptions. Nevertheless, the
government of Canada has initiated this
measure, and with some reluctance I say that
it must take the greater blame. If this is an
indication of the trend of liberal thought, I
must dissociate myself from it. I trust that
this unprincipled and unjust part of this bill
will receive short shrift in the committee, if
the bill does go to a committee. If it does not,
tfhen in the interests of justice and decency
and of the honour of Canada I shall vote
against the bill, and I shall only wish I had
enough votes to defeat it.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, I do not wish to detain the
chamber for any length of time in the discussion of this bill. With the general statements of the senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris), who explained the purpose
of limiting the application of controls to one
year, I am in full agreement. I think it is in
the minds of a majority of the members of the
Senate that the limited period of application is
the bill's chief merit.
I take no exception ta the majority of the
provisions relating to the economie and financial interests of this country. I do, however,
associate myself with those who have expressed
as a matter of principle their regret at having
to deal, among these fifty-seven orders in
council, with order No. 946, relating ta citizens
of Japanese origin. Essentialay this bill lends
itself to discussion in committee, where any
one of the 57 orders in council to which it
relates may bc dissected and examined. I
trust that the particular order in council to
which I have referred and which is exceptional,
may bc discussed further and if possible
amended by agreement. My chief objection to
it is that it applies a discriminatory and
invidious yard-stick in measuring rights of
citizenship in Canada; and this, in a year when
great emphasis has been placed upon our
independent national status in relation to other
countries, and particularly as a North American
country with increasing responsibilities on this
continent. It also affects the very essence of
Canadian citizenship as expressed in the
Citizenship Act, which so recently was introduced to the people of this country with some
ceremony and fanfare. I think it is regrettable
that sa discordant a note should be sounded,
especially at this time. In my opinion the very
suggestion of discrimination in the status of
Canadian citizens is a blot on the national
escutoheon, and particularly so just now, when

REVISED
EDITION

SENATE
the full strength of a national aspiration on
the part of all our people is needed for the
future.
Having made that expression of opposition
in principle to this order in council, I trust
that the bill will be referred to committee,
where it can be discussed further.
Hon. Mr. McKEEN. I wish to move the
adjournment of the debate.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Perhaps the honourable gentleman would move his motion
after I have spoken.
* Honourable members. I do not intend to
indulge in any detailed discussion of the 57
orders and regulations. I wish to congratulate
the senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) on the very able way in which he
explained the bill. I would also express my
appreciation of the speech of the member
from Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne); I agree
with the thoughts he expressed. I might add
that I find myself in agreement with the
other speeches.
I rise more particularly, however, to- support the views put forward by the senator
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner). The
orders comprised in this legislation may be
necessary for some time-a year, or a year
and a half-but the greatest merit of the
bill is that they will expire within a year,
although by resolution they may be extended
for another year. The best feature of the
bill is that it contemplates an end of controls. I believe that the government is making a political mistake in the way it is
handling de-control. From a political point
of view I am quite willing that it should go
on with that kind of policy, but I do not
believe it is in the interests of the country.
What I mean is this. The governnent discontinues the subsidy on a commodity and
allows the price to rise to the amount of the
subsidy. Take butter as an example. The
subsidy on it was 8) cents a pound. The government dropped the subsidy and let the
ceiling go up ten cents a pound. That caused
an agitation all over the country. Unfortunately for the government the removal of
the subsidy occurred the saine morning that
the budget speech was reported, and I venture to suggest that huhdreds of people said,
"Though I save so much on my income tax,
I have to pay it back in the extra cost of
butter."
They did not go into a detailed
examination of how the 81 cents was contributed; they just decided that the loss
counterbalanced the gain.
The government policy upsets the national
cquilibrium. We are used to doing business
only when full knowledge of the subject-

matter is before us, whether or not we choose
to exercise our knowledge. But here are 57
controls which are outside the area of normal
conditions and understanding. For instance,
if I want to build a house, or some houses,
I have first to find ont what are the controls
in connection with house building, what
materials required for houses are under control. In fact, all the items which enter into
the construction of a house are under control;
and I have to take that into consideration.
One factor to which the senator from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) called particular attention is rent control. Whether you
live in Winnipeg or Montreal or Vancouver,
you can find, I suggest, two solid pages in
your local newspaper advertising houses for
sale, with possession within two months. What
is wrong with our economy that accounts for
that state of affairs? There can be only one
thing amiss: the nature of the control is such
that people will not rent their houses, but
they will sell them. In my own city of Winnipeg, the Free Press and the Tribune carry
in their Saturday issues four pages of advertisements of houses for sale. While I know
something of the value of houses, I would not
pronounce as to the value of those at present
offered, but my point is that possession may be
had by the first of June or the first of July,
or at latest by the first of September. Why is
that?
An Hon. SENATOR: The very high price?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, that is not the reason.
I have been in the building business and I
know what I am talking about. When you
built a house you naturally built to sell, but
you always knew that if you did not sell you
could rent the house at a reasonable figure.
But what is the situation to-day? I know of
many people in Winnipeg who are living in
houses that are completely equipped on each
floor and have six bedrooms and the owners
are asked, "Why do you not rent some of the
rooms?" The answer is that the owners do
not know where they will get off at if they
rent them.
Once you start a control-and here is the
danger in these 57 varieties-you encounter
difficulties all along the line. The senators
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert), Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) and
Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) have been
talking about the situation of the Japanese in
Canada. That situation is the result of a control. Once you start a control it is very hard
to stop it, because of demands for its continuation. That is the difficulty.

MAY 8, 1947
The senator from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris) said the other day that some of
our young people have got to the point of
li.king controls. There are 57 varieties of these
controls, and there are tens of thousands, or
bundreds of thousands of people interested in
every one of them. When a control helps
people, they are for it; and wben it is flot in
their interest, they are opposed to it. You
have that reaction ail over the country, and
there is turmoil every day.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: What about giving
away the property of poor people?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I arn not going to discuss
this fully, but the bonourable senator from.
Biaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) is quite rigbt.
Labour Progressive buildings in my city-I
think tbey were called Communist buildings;
tbey were owned by the Communists anywaywere seized, and sold at a sacrifice. I certainly
do not agree witb the Communists, but I
think they sb.ould get the same deal for their
property as I would want for mine.
The sooner it is recognized that controls are
interfering witb generai trade and busineds, the
sooner we shall get back to economic stability.
My bonourable. friend frorn Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) says tbat greedy landlords want the money from the poor peopie.
But under the government's present control
arrangement poor people cannot get any place
at ail to live in, and there neyer will be any
homes for tbem as long as there is rent control.
In the city of Winnipeg I know a young
lawyer-he is flot so young perbaps; about
fifty-who is well ta do. He mioved into a
house wbich he happened to refit at a low
rentaI. WiIl he get out? Not at ail. He hangs
rigbt on. If be can rent a bouse wor*th $100
for $50, wby should he move?
I have been connected witb the building
business and I know a good deai, about rent
control. Wben this country was going tbrough
tbe depression period the dominion government and the municipalîties under its control
put a minimum rentai of $12 to $16 a month
on certain bouses. At least, that was done in
my city, and I presumne it was done in other
Canadian cities. A man who was employed
continued to, rent a bouse at the rent be had
been paying, say $35 a rnontb.; but to an
unemployed man the same bouse woulcl be
rented ta tbem at $16 a month. With today's
cost of building, a bouse that rented for $35 at
that tirne should now in order to yield the
sarne return, rent for approximately $65. Wbat
bappened to the decent land-lord? Perbaps
be owned only two or three bouses. When the
war came along be did flot raise tbe rent; and
even by October 1, 1941, be bad flot raisued it.
83168-211

320

He. qaid to bimself: "Eacb of these tenants is
a good fellow. He bas looked after the bouse,
not wanted too mnany repairs, and he bas paid
bis rent punctually." That type of landiord
dîd not raise the rent. But the sharp landJord
raised- the rent in 1940, and by October 1941
he bad managed to get it up to a pretty fair level,
at which it was frozen, wbile the decent landlord's rent was frozen'at the lower level. That
no doubt happened ahl over tbe country as
well as in Manitoba.
Wby should one form of wealth be specially
taxed and flot another? Well, this control is
placed on rent hecause of the effect it bas on
the cost-of-living index. 1 do not know the
exact figures, but I understand rent makes up
about twenty per cent of the index; and so
long as rent is held down, the cost-of-living
index can be ktpt down. But the only people
wbo benefit by this are those wbo rent. That is
absolutely unfair. It is a tax on the property
owners. 0f course, 1 know that there are ten
renters to one owner. From a political point
of view, once you start a control it is awfully
bard to stop it.
Anybody wbo knows anytbing about building
conditions knows that controls are interfering
with construction. A-ny builder will tell you
that be would not build a bouse to rent under
present conditions.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: There is no doubt about
that. You do not bave to be a builder to
understand tbat principle. Would any bonourable senator enter into an enterprise in whicb
bis opportunities are cut in two by legisiation
before be starts? In the bousing business there
sbould be an opportunity to seli and an opportunity to rent, but the renting alternative bias
been eut off altogether. You rnay say that
the rent control board will fix the rate. Yes;
but bow do you know what rate will be fixed?
In Winnipeg I bave s-een a new bouse standing
side by side witb one fifteen years old. The
fifteen ycar-old bouse is perhaps mucb the
better; but, under control, it rents at only $35.
Assessors for tbe rent control board corne to tbe
new bouse and say that it sbouid rent at $55
a montb. Who is rigbt? Tbat is tbe test.
I bave talked longer than 1 sbould bave,
but I arn delighted to tbink that the bill wil
go to eornmittee. I arn not going to esk anybody to put up any great resistance to tbe bill
there. I accept the principle of the bill, that
these controis will expire in one year. T
strongly advise the government,-tbougb I do
not suppose it wili listen to my advice-to get
out of this contrat business just as fast as it
can. I suggest too that it neyer go back to
tbese contrais, because there are 57 reasons

SENATE
wby the people of this country will be angry
at thum if they do. There may be inýdividual
cases of opposite opinion, but throughout tho
country there is an agitation and an irritation
that will exist so long as these controls last.
I will not vote against tbe bill. Owing to, the
difficulty wc, are in. I persenally want to help
the governmont. I beliove that if I were the
govorument today, under these conditions, I
woulci not smash the contrels ail at once. I
would bhave clone se right after tbe ivor, wheo
people had a lot of money and we were ridiog
high, wide and býandsome.
I wenld have
dropped the cuntrols thon and token the consolquencos. But the goveroment bas waited too
long now to, do tbat. However, we in ibis
chamber ought to do all we can to assist chu
governiment in getting rid of thuro cootrols.
We should urge if to, de tbNs, in the uconomie

MAY S, 1947
For sorne weeks I have been sitting on tbe
Joint Comrnittee inquiring into tbe Indian Act,
and wben I beard sonie bonourabie senators
plead for the Japanese I began- to wonder.
Tbe Indians, who are the original owne-rs of
thîs country, are restricted to reservations and
are not allowed tbe privilege of going wbere
everyone else rnay go; they are preventeL from
taking various kinds of employrnent, are not
permitted to attend certain sehools or accept
public office. I tbink we sbould dlean our own
bouse first before we concern ourselves about
otbers. The time bas corne, I believe, wben
we sbould talk about the rights, flot of minorities but of majorities in this country. In this
instance we sbould be f air to and consider the
great maj ority for at least one year.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? Are not
tbe restrictions whieh bie mentions wjtb
regard to Indians imposed only on those who
are on governent reservations? Wben tbey
renounce their privilege of being wards of the
Crown do they not assume ail tbe rights of
a citizen of Canada?
know that an
Hon. Mr. McKEEN:-I
Indian cannot go into a beer parlour or a
tavern.
,Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is wbile hie is
a ward of tbe state.
An enfrancbised
Hon. Mr. McKEEN:
Indian, I understand, cannot get a liquor
licence.
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: Honourable senators, inay 1 rise to ask a question concerning
procedure? Naturally I arn interested in tbe
subjeet of this debate. I understand from tbe
honourable leader of the governent tbat
the bill will be referred to committee, and I
presume tbere will br an opportunity for
furtber discussion wben it returns froro
cornmittee.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes, there will be
an opportunity for furtber discussion on third
reading.
Honourable senators, I bad not intended to
speak at this time, but before tbe 'question
is put I perhaps sbould say sornetbing. A
nurnber of specifie points bave been brought
up by tbe honourable senator frorn Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) and others. Tbe bill covers
so many subj ects tbat I felt it would be wise
to have the ministers of the various departrnents concerned, appear before a cornrittee,
where they could give much more intelligent
answers tban I could secure and provide to

the bouse. Consequently, it would seemn
desirabie to give the bill second reading and
refer it to comrnittee.
I wish to rernind honourable senators that
the controls incorporated in this bill are put
there because of the reasonable and probable
likelibood tbat they will flot be necessary for
a longer period than one year, and in somne
instances less tban tbat.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, bear.
Hon.
Mr.
ROBERTSON:
Honourable
senators know that other legislation is proposed in regard to measures of longer
duration.
I speak as one baving liberal instints--not
in tbe party sense-wben I say we ail know
that the problern of controls 15 flot a simple
one. Can)ada bas emerged from a perioL ôf
war when, rigbtly or wrongly. passions .were
high, and it was niot always possible to, legisiate
so that every person wouldi do the kindly tbing
to, others. To my mind it is very gratifyiiig
that public opinion in Canada since tbe war
bas shown sucb a commendabie cbange. Only
a short wbile ago, thiere was a terrifie protest
against the deportation of certain people from
Canada.
As time went on public opinion cbanged.
Let us bear in mmndi that public opinion is
changing now, and, that, perbaps even in tbe
rnterests of the individuals for wbýom sucb
eloquent pleas bave been made, it is arguable
that if the statutory restrictions were rernoved
too soon and deep feelings were ardusedt there
might stili be discrimination againet individuials. Tbe question is neither easy nor simple;
and I bespeak fromn honourable senators their
customary calrn consideration in dealing 'with
these matters in tbe days wbîcb lie abead.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senators, the question is on the motion for tbe
second reading of this bill. Is it your plea:sure
to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK:

On division.

The motion was agreed to, and tbe bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the

Among the business for tomorrow afternoon
will be the third reading of the Canadian
Wheat Board Bili. the second reading of the
bill to amend the Immigration Act and. Vo
repeal the Chînese Immigration Act, and
the third reading of the Export and Import
Permaits Dili. Altbough the committee adjourned until this evening, I would point out
that I arn in no position to know how long the
inquiry regarding details of the Transitional
Measures Bill will continue.
Therefore,
unless there is some objection on the part of
the chairman of that committee, I shouid like
to bave it resume its sittings immediately aftcr
the sen-ate rises, as well as this evening.
Hon. Mr, MeLEAN: Why not refer Vhis
bill Vo the Canadian Trade Relations Committee? It seems to me that every bill before
the 8enate is sent Vo the Banking and Commerce Committee, and, those of us who are on
other committees waik up nnd down the corridors witb very littie Vo do. 0f course, we
can attend the sessions of the Banking and
Commerce Committee, but 1 suggest that
some of t.bis legisiation shouid go Vo otber
committees.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The point which
my honourable friend bas raised in regard Vo
this and some other bis is not without importance, and I gave hima an undertaking tbat if
1 enjoy the honour of continuing the leadership of this bouse 1 shall make an effort Vo
see Vo it that this work is more equaliy distributed. However, as the Banking and Commerce Committee is now in session and the
bill in question bas been referred Vo it, matVers might be facilitated if my honourable
friend would withdraw bis objection in this
particular case. The bill covers a great many
different items which perhaps are more properiy referable Vo the Banking and Commerce
Committee than are some of the bis at present before it; for instance, the one relating
Vo export and import permits. What my bonourable friend says is very mucli in point, and
I shahl endeavour Vo correct tbis situation in
future. Let me remind honourable senators
that while Vhey can vote oniy in the committees of whichi they are members, they are
welcome. to attend any committee meeting
and noV only listen Vo but Vake part in the discussions. On behalf of the members of the
Banking and Commerce Committee, I extend
Vo the honourable senator from Soutbern New

invitation to attend its meetings.

Hon. Mr. PATERSON: Honourable senators, I would like to ask the Chairman of the
Divorce Committee (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) a
question. When so many of these bills are put
through at one time we get a blast from
another place. Would it not be advisable to
have a smaller number put through at one
time? I would like to point out, for the
information of the other house, that while the
number of Quebec divorces to be put through
this year is large, it is, after all, only about
four .hundred, as against Ontario's sixteen or
eighteen hundred. The matter is far more
serious in Ontario, but nothing is ever said
here about that. There will be another blast
from the other house when these bills get
there.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: In answer to the
honourable senator from Thunder Bay (Hon.
Mr. Paterson), I say: the more the merrier.

328

SENATE

I welcome those blasts from the other house,
because the more of sncb blasts we get, the
sooner this work will be taken out of the

proper way.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
The motion was agreed to, and the bills
were read the third time, and passed, on

CANADIAN

WHEAT

BOARD

BILL

THIRD READINGS

Hon. A. B. COPP. on behalf of Hon. Mr.
Robertson, moved the third reading of Bill
23, as amended, an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act, 1935.
Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, I crave the indulgence of the Senate
to make some remarks in connection with one
paragraph of this bill. If I proposed to deal
with the merits of the bill as a whole, I should
feel very much out of place. A senator coning, as I do, from British Columbia and being
a lawyer should not presume to take from
those with more experience and more immediate interest a discussion in this connection.
But one section, in my opinion, involves questions entirely outside the scope of the bill
itself, and has such wide ramifications that
I am presuming to ask you to hear me for
a short while this afternoon.
Section 39 of the bill reads:
For greater certainty . . . it is hereby declared
that each and every one of the grain elevators
and mills mentioned or described in the schedule
to this act is a work for the general advantage
of Canada.
At the end of the bill there is a sciedule
setting out the varions flour mills. The mills
in Alberta are enumerated on pages 18 and
19; those in Manitoba, on page 20. and those
in Saskatchewan, on page 21. These mills
are for the first time declared to be for the
general advantage of Canada.
I wish to cal] attention of the house to just
what we are doing and what the constitutional
implications are, on the basis of the information we have. Ilonourable senators, and
particularly those who are members of the
legal profession, know that the general powers
as between the Parliament of Canada and the
provincial legislatures are set forth in sections
91 and 92 of the British North America Act.
Section 91 enumerates the powers given to
the dominion, and also contains a residual
clause which includes anything net specifically
given to the provinces. Section 92 enumerates
sixteen specific classes of subjects as to which
the provinces are given exclusive jurisdiction.
One of these, and perhaps the most important,

is "property and civil rights," which embraces
a great range of matters. One of the things
falling within that exclusive jurisdiction under
"property and civil rights" would be fleur
mills.
Subsection 10 of section 92 contains a rather
unusual provision. It says the provinces may
exclusively make laws in relation to:
Local works and undertakings, other thanI emphasize the words "other than".
such as are of the following classes:
(a) Lines of steam or other ships, railways,
canals, telegraphs, and other works and undertakings connecting the province with any other
or others of the provinces, or extending beyond
the limits of the province;
(b) Lines of steamships between the province
and any British or foreign country.
There is a third exception to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the provinces over local works
and undertakings. That exception is:
(C) Such works as, although wholly situate
within the province, are before or after their
execution declared by the Parlianent of
Canada to be for the general advantage of
Canada or for the advantage of two or more
of the provinces.
That is what we are doing here. Although
a fleur mill is as muci within provincial
jurisdiction as, say, a sawmill in British
Columbia, parliament bas power, by making
what Chief Justice Duff termed "a solemn
statutory declaration," to transfer that jurisdiction from the province to the dominion.
So by passing this bill parliament will in
effect be making an amendment of the British
North America Act to take away a province's
jurisdiction and substitute dominion jurisdiction, without the leave or consent or sanction of the provinces involved.
What I am concerned about, honourable
senators, is net the particular effect this enactment will have on some flour mills in
Saskatchewan. I want to go on record bere
as pointing out the wide effect of the precedent we are setting by what we are doing
now and the way we are doing it. I submit
that it is a bad practice, and that it may
lead to consequences seriously detrimental
to the rigits of the provinces.
In my opinion the section presents for our
consideration two very definite questions.
The first is, what is a "work"? The second
is, when is parliament justified in declaring
that a local work is "for the general advantage
of Canada", and in taking it out of provincial
jurisdiction and, contrary to the general provisions of the British North Anerica Act,
transferring it to federal jurisdiction?
Now, what is a "work"? On this question
the courts have helped us somewhat, but not
a great deal. They have already said that a
"work" is not a service; that it is a physical

MAY 9,1947
act. That was said in the through-traffic
case, which, as we ail remember, began in
Montreal and went to, the Privy Council
quite a number of years ago.
Then, the British North America Act itseif
contains illustrations of what are "local
wvorks". For instance, ships and rallways
and canais and telegraphs are ail "works"
ivithin the meaning of section 92; and so are
lines of steamships between provinces. The
Privy Council held in the Bryden case that a
Eoal mine is a "work".
I arn not here raising any question whether
a flour miii is a "work" within the meaning
of the act; but I arn emphasizing the wide
range of things that are "works". Ships, coal
mines, telegraph lines, telephone lines-all
these are "works"; and if a flour miii is a
"work", so aiso is a sawmiil, a shîngle miii,
a shoe fact.ory; and I arn debating in my
mmnd whether, if we are to think of grain
elevators and flour milîs as "works", we may
be creating a tenable argument that a farm,
being the physical thing on which wheat grows,
is itseif a "work".
Honourable senators can see the very comprehensive field of provincial jurisdiction that
rnight be affected by parliament's tarnpering
with "works" in a province. Once we declare
sornething to be a work for the general advantage of Canada. then-provided that declaration is upheld by the courts--ail provincial
jurisdiction over it is gone and is lef t entireiy
to the Dominion government.
Honourable senators are familiar with the
expression "works" as used in the phrase "public works." For instance, in that sense a highway is a "work", a bridge is a "work", and so
on.
Having that appreciation of the wide range
of things within the potential power of parliament to transfer by statute from provincial
to dominion jurisdiction, the next question we
mîust consider-this is what I want to impress
on the Senate--is: When is parliament justified in declaring a work to be for the general
advantage of Canada? That involves two
questions; a legal one, and one that strictly is
a parliamentary question. I want to mention
the legal one-not to presume to offer an
opinion here, but merely to suggest the possibilities of the legal question that may arise
after our legisiation bas been disposed of here.
If honourable senators will look again at section 92 (10) they wiil see that the provincial
legisiature bas exclusive jurisdiction over local
works except:
Such works as ...
are . . . deeiared by the
Parliament of Canada to be for the general advantage of Canada..

329

Honourable senators, what is it that is
declared to be for the general advantage of
Canada? It is not the jurisdiction; it is not
the legisiation; it is the work itseif. I have a
strong suspicion that in this bill the government bas got the cart before the horse. I am
going to eall attention in a minute to section
39 of the bill, and I want to say that we are
not seriously deciding that a flour miii is a
work for the generai advantage of Canada,
and that, having so declared, it necessarily
foilows that we have jurisdiction here. I have
a strong suspicion that what we are really
doing is this: we are saying we want jurisdiction and that we wili acquire it by declaring each of these elevators and milis to be a
work for the general advantage of Canada,
whether it is or not. Now, it may possibly
not be within our jurîsdiction to do that. If
parliament reaches an honest conclusion, based
on known facts, that it is a work for the ad'vantage of Canada, and so declares by a soiemn
statutory declaration then, of course, it follows,
as night the day, that parliament has jurisdiction. But in a few minutes I shahl leave it
to your judgment to decide if we have
solemniy investigated the question or if we
have in our minde the remotest information as
to, whether, for instance, a flour miii in the
province of Saskatchewan is a work for the
general advantage of Canada or not. Let us
just keep that in mind.
So far as I can see by reading the court
decisions no absolute test bas been laid down
as to what constitutes a work for the general
advantage of Canada, but there bas been some
discussion about it. It came up in the Eastern
Terminal Elevatiors case, when the former
Chief Justice of Canada-then Mr. Justice
Duff--suggested thet parliament might acquire
jurisdliction by a declaration of this kind. But
hie did not suggest that parliament should. do
so, nor did he suggest a procedure by which
the facts could be investigated as a condition
precedent to the making of such a solemn
declaration by parliament.
In the through-traffic case-the Montreal
Street Railway case-the samne question came
up. Lawyers in the Senate will recahi that
there was a-dispute between a dominion railway and 'the Montreal Street Railway Company, and the Raiiway Board imposed certain
,obligations on the street railway-a purely
provincial railway--and it was held that the
board, acting under authority -of parliament,
did not have jurisdiction to do so. However,
the court saicl that if the street railway had
acquired such a status in Canada that its
operations affected the body politic as a
whole, then parliament might invoke section

83168-22
nsVISmD
EDITION

SENATE
92 (10) of the British North America Act and
declare 'the railway to be "a work for the
general advantage of Canada". I am not saying
that it is only 'in cases of that kind that
parliament may declare a work to be for the
general advantage of Canada. I would not
presume to go that far. But I say that there
must be some test in the mind of parliament,
not as to what constitutes n benefit to Canada
but as to what makes a physical work of
general benefit of Canada.
I suggest-and I do so because this body is
not a tribunal that makes decisions on legal
points-that if parliament, und.er the guise
of investigating whether or not this measure
is for the general advantage of Canada, has as
its real purpose the acquiring of jurisdiction.
the courts may decide that the legislation is
colourable. The Privy Council bas decided
many times that parliament cannot do indirectly what it cannot do directly; and if what
parliament seeks to do is in fact outside its
jurisdiction, it cannot be done by camouflage.
One of the earliest cases in that connection
was the Bryden case from British Columbia,
which had to do with regulations under the
coal mining act, a matter within provincial
jurisdiction. The province declared, among
other things, that no Chinaman should work
underground. The Privy Council held that
if the province had really legislated in regard
to the safety of coal mines, it would have had
complete jurisdiction; but that the pith and
substance of the legislation was to prevent
Chinamen, as Chinamen, from working underground. The legislation wuas ýtherefore held
to be ultra vires.
There are many cases on the subject, but
i shall refer to only one more-the Quebec
Insurance Reference, cited in Plaxton's Canadian Constitutional Decisions of the Judicial
Conmittee, at page 81. That case bas to do
with a dominion statute requiring insurance
companies to obtain a federal licence. The
Privy Council had held in three previous
cases that the conduct of insurance business
was a subject exclusively within provincial
authority; and in this case it held that the
dominion could not "in the guise of legislation as to aliens and immigration, matters
within the dominion authority, seek to intermeddle with the conduct of insurance
business."
There is a chance that owing to the off-hand
way in which we are proceeding, this legislation
snay be held by the courts to be ultra vires
because it is colourable, under the written
declaration-without investigation-that these
mills are works for the general advantage of
Canada. That is a question for the courts,
but it is important that we keep it in mind.

· I wish to proceed on the assumption that
the courts decide that the dominion bas absolute jurisdiction to make the declaration, and
that they cannot investigate it. On that
assumption, do we realize the responsibility
that is being put on parliament?
If the
courts cannot investigate the declaration, we
are on our honour as members of parliament
to make sure that what we are doing is done
honestly and with no ulterior motive. That
is a duty not to be taken lightly or illadvisedly. The honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig) will appreciate the importance of that statement.
May I read what the former Chief Justice
of Canada had to say about what we do when
we declare a work to be for the general
advantage of Canada? I quote from Reference
re Waters and Water-Powers, in 1929 Supreme
Court Reports, at page 220:
The authority created by section 92 (10c)That is the section we are talking about.
-is of a most unusual nature. It is an author-

ity given to the Dominion Parliament to clothe

itself with jurisdiction-exclusive jurisdiction
-in
respect of subjects over which, in the
absence of such action by parliament, exclusive
control is, and would remain vested in the
provinces. Parliament is empowered to withdraw froin that control matters coming within
such subjects, and to assume jurisdiction itself.
It wields an authority which enaibles it, in
effect, to rearrange the distribution of legislative powers effected directly by the Act, and, in
some views of the enactment, to bring about
changes of the most radical import, in that
distribution; and the basis and condition of its
action must be the decision by parliament that
the work or undertaking or class of works or
undertakings affected by that action is for the

general advantage of Canada, or of two or more
of the provinces; which decisionI ask honourable senators, in view of the
vote they have to give in this case, to listen
to these next words.
-must be evidenced and authenticated 'by a
solemn declaration, in that sense, by parliament itself.
So, in the words of the former Chief Justice,
when we vote on this section, we as members
of parliament are taking a solemn declaration
that these four pages of works which we have
looked over here are, ta our knowledge,
"works for the general advantage of Canada."
I ask honourable senators how many of them
are prepared to stand up and say, "Yes, we
have investigated, and we have information
and we know that this enumerated list is for
the general advantage of Canada." Let us
look at the section itself. Sometimes one
gets information from the side-notes.
On
page 17A it is stated:
This is the third declaration of this kind.
One was in 1927; another was in 1935.

MAY 9, 1947
The proposed section 39 brings the list up to
date and includes mills in Western Canada.
They have never been included before.
That does not say much, honourable senators.
Let us turn to the language of the section
itself:
39. For greater certainty . . . it is hereby
declared that each and every one of the grain
elevators and mills mentioned or described in
the schedule to this act is a work for the general
advantage of Canada.
Greater certainty of what, and by whom?
Are we presuming to establish by "greater
certainty" that in our wisdom, based on our
knowledge, these are "works for the advantage
of Canada"? Not that they may become works
which will be for the advantage of Canada.
That is not the point at all. I thought that
this explanation did not enlighten us much
so two days ago I gave our leader (Hon.
Mr. Robertson), who is not here today, written
notes. I inquired: What information bas the
Department of Trade and Commerce on which
to ,base a request to parliament to declare
certain mills mentioned in the schedule to
Bill 23 to be "works for the general advantage of Canada"? Here is the answer: "The
government is informed by the Canadian
Wheat Board that the mills referred to in the
schedule accept delivery"-listen to this-"or
are in a position to accept delivery of relatively large quantities of grain from producers.
They are therefore important as a factor affecting the regulation of deliveries of grain for
the general advantage of Canada."
Honourable senators, are we prepared, should
we be prepared, on a statement that some
flour mills are in a position to deliver wheat
in large quantities if they wish to do so, to say
that that constitutes them in fact and in law
"works for the general advantage of Canada"?
So far as this particular case in concerned, I
do not object, I am not interested in it, nor
do I intend to move any amendment. But
what I am saying is that if this provision goes
through without protest, if the actions of this
parliament are to be based on that kind of
flimsy nothingness, if we assume the right to
remove jurisdiction in regard to a flour mill
from the province of Manitoba and vest it
exclusively in the dominion, we may in the
like manner do so in regard to every sawmill,
shingle mill and factory, and, step by step,
every kind of work in the Dominion of Canada
which can be conceived. That is a wrong principle. It creates a sense of insecurity. I say
that in adopting it we are not being honest
with ourselves or performing our duties
properly; and I feel, honourable senators, that
I should call attention to this and express
83168-22J

331

the hope that the next time parliament is
asked to declare that any work is for the
"general advantage of Canada" we shall be
provided with real reasons to show that the
declaration is honestly in accord with the facts,
and that when we vote on the matter we shall
be able to vote as our consciences direct us
to do in the light of our knowledge.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, may I express on behalf of
myself and, I think, of all other members
of this bouse, appreciation of the very learned
and capable discussion which we have just
heard on the application of the British North
America Act in this particular instance. It is
not for me to presume off-hand to answer
adequately the excellent arguments advanced
by the honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris); but he must
remember that all members of this bouse are
constitutional lawyers. Of necessity we must
be so, and I do not think that the fact that
a person is by profession a lawyer puts him
in any special class in the study of these
more or less simple, fundamental, primary
questions of law with regard to our constitution. All of us in this chamber are constitutional lawyers, and each one of us is as
well qualified as the others to apply bis mind
to the facts as they present themselves to us.
With all respect to the honourable member
who bas just sat down, I do not go with him
in bis argument on the two main contentions
that have been laid before us. First, that this
is an amendment of the British North America
Act which, he says, may seriously impair the
jurisdiction of the provinces. I take issue
with the word "amendment", and that is the
word be used.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I would agree with my
honourable friend. But its effect is that of
an amendment.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCJK: It is an act in .pursuance of the British North America Act.
The British North America Act provides that
the Parliament of Canada may declare a
work which is wholly local, within the bounds
of a province, to be for the "general advantage of Canada", and as soon as the parliament of Canada bas made that declaration,
the work, although it is entirely local in its
boundaries and its location, is in fact within
the jurisdiction of this parliament.
Furthermore, the grant of the privilege and
the power also confers upon the Parliament
of Canada the obligation and the duty to
act in that way under appropriate 'circumstances. So that when these mills--and, I

332

SENATE

think, elevators as well-are declared, as they
will be when the bill is passed, to be for
the general advantage of Canada, irrespective
of the methods or the facts by or upon which
we act, they will then be classified and deemed
to be "for the general advantage of Canada"
within the meaning of the British North
America Act, and therefore within the jurisdiction of this parliament.
I point out to my fellow-members of the
Senate that this is not the first time parliament has made a declaration of this kind in
very sinilar circumstancoes. The explanatory
note opposite section 39 of the bill says:
This is the third declaration of this kind. The
Canada Grain Act, 1927, listed the elevators
then existing, and the 1939 amendment to the
Act added additional elevators constructed in
the interval. The proposed section 39 brings
the list up to date and includes mills in Western
Canada.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: May I ask my honourable friend if any information was given
parliament wien those statutes were passed?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Far be it from me
to say that in enacting those statutes parliament acted without knowledge. Every member of this house, and I suppose every member
of the other place, has a general knowledge
of the facts connected with this business. It
is not necessary that he know the metes and
bounds of each individual elevator or mill to

know the type of business that a certain
elevator or mill is doing, and to decide
whether or not that type of trade can be
honestly and properly declared to be for the
general advantage of Canada. If you know
what a miill is doing you do not need to see it
to be able to make a declaration with regard
to its business.
May I recall to the members of this house
the fact that we ourselves have passed bills
for expending out of the consolidated revenue
fund very large sums in the bonusing of
wheat-growing. Why? Because the growing
of wheat was a local matter? Because the
fields were within the boundaries of the provinces and therefore within the jurisdiction,
and under the property and civil rights of the
respective provinces? Not at all. We made
those grants because the production of wheat
within the dominion was for the general
advantage of Canada. In this instance what
do you find? You find a trade consisting in
the growing of wheat all the way across
Canada, fron British Columbia to Nova
Scotia. You find that wheat is transported
by our general railroad system, which is
interprovincial in its character. Yeu find that
on its way, incidental to transportation, the
wheat is handled by elevators and sometimes

the mills. Export trade is a Canadian-wide
by the mills. Expert trade is a Canadian-wide
dominion law whose maladjustment would be
a national disaster; and therefore, legislation
with regard to it is essentially, normally, and
naturally legislation with regard to a matter
for the general advantage of Canada.
I do not propose to pass upon this general
measure because I approach it with the same
diffidence as did the member for Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris). That is to say, as
a lawyer he rather apologized for discussing
a matiter as to which others may have greater
knowledge and certainly a more direct interest.
I feel the same way about it. I have not as
yet discussed the merits of the bill on the
floor of the house, but when it comes to the
legal rights of parliament with regard to an
enactment of this kind, I feel that I have as
much right and ability to address myself to
the problem as have those engaged in the
industry itself. Therefore, I presume in an
off-hand, way to offer my suggestions.
Se far as I can see. the British North
America Act has given to the parliament of
Canada the right and privilege, and has
imposed upon it the duty, of decliaring works
to be for the general advantage of Canada.
In my judgment, no court will go behind the
exercise of that right on our part and substitute its opinion for the opinion of parliament.
It is truc that were somebody able to show
that these things about which we legislated
were not "works" within the meaning of the
British North America Act, then we would
have exceeded our powers. But it is admitted
thaýt these elevators and mills are works; and
when we decide-as we have both the right
and the obligation to decide-that these works
are "for the general advantage of Canada", no
court will properly substitue its judgment
for ours.
That brings us down to the one question:
are we justified te ourselves, are our consciences free, when we declare these works to
be "for the general advantage of Canada"?
If each member decides that point as he sees
fit, he will have satisfied the obligations that
are on bis shoulders.
I do net think honourable senators need
worry very much about the legal interpretation of this problem. These mills are works.
Is there anyone in this chamber who would
declare, on his responsibility as a member
of this louse, that these works are not for
the general advantage of Canada? My friend
asks us to consider whether we know what
we are talking about before we pass this

MAY 9,1947
inensure, but is he ready to tell us that these
works arc not for the general advantage e'
Canada?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That, is not the issue
lion. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is the issue.
If they arc not for the general advantage of
Canada, then we sbould not pass this bill.
If thcy are for the general advantage of
Canada, then we should pass this bill, and it
is as muchi up to those who oppose the bill
to make their case as it is for thiose who
favour the bill to make their's.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: If a member found
that hie did not have enough information,
how should hie vote?
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Vote for the government.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: He should take a little
course.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: He should go for
knowledge, because as a member of this
chamber it is his obligation to know what hie
is doing and not to act in the dark. But w.ill
my honourable fricnd say that we are in the
dark in regard to this matter?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yes.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT.- May I ask my
honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hion.
Mr. Roobuck) a question? If I am not satisfied that wheat accepted by a miii located in
a certain province is 100 per cent devoted to
the generai benefit of Canada-in other words,
if a considerabie percentage of its operation
is for the exclusive benefit of the local coinmunity where the miii is situated-am I justified in siupporting a measure that declares the
miii to be "a work for the general benefit of
Canada"?
Hion. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is a very good
question, but I point out that if it is necessary for a work to be 100 per cent devoted to
the general ad'varitage of Canada, as distinguîshed fromn the local advantage, there is no
work which will fali within that classification.
Interprovincial railways, which by the British
North America Act itself are placed under
the jurisdiction of tbe dominion parliament,
bave a local as well as a general 'henefit; and
local railways which have assumed a character sufficient for us te declare them to he for
the general ad'vantage of Canada, have
general as well as a local benefit. The fact
that some "work" per.forms a local service
does not take it out of the character of being
also for the generai advantage of Canada. If
it is for the gencrai advantage, then the local
advantage must stand aside in the national
interest.

3w3

The British North America Act recognizes
throughout the principle of the supreme authority of the dominion government. That is 'a
vital and most important distinction bctween
our act and the constitution of the United
States. In that country the final sovereignty
rests with the people; a secondary sovereignty
being with the states, and a third degree of
sovereignty with the federal authority. In our
country the government of Canada is vested
in the Queen-to use the words of the actand from this fiows the conclusion that the
highest and, most important authority is the
Parliament of Canada. If a work bas local
significance and benefit, and also is of advantage to Canada at large, parliament is justified
in dcclaring that it is a work for the general
advantage of Canada.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? What is the
effect of declaring in a bill like this that a work
is for the general ad'vantage of Canada?
Hion. Mr. ROEBUCK: The only effect that
I know of is to place the work under the jurisdiction of the dominion parliamient.
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: The exclusive
jurisdiction.
.Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is correct, the
exclusive jurisdiction of the dominion parliament. Such a declaration docs nlot interfere
with ownership or operation, but simply places
under federal jurisdiction a work which may
previously have been under provincial jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: I have a further question. Might such a declaration not constitute
a precedent for dieclaring ail "works" to be for
tic general advantage of Canada, thus depriving the provinces of control over those works?
I have in mind coal mines and textile works
which by their nature could he said to be for
the general advantage of Canada. If we proceed in this direction long enough, would the
provincial governments not become useless?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I recaîl to the memory of my honourable friend a statement I
made previously, that this does not create a
precedent. This is the third time that a similar declaration bas been made.
It must be remembcred also that section 92
of the British North America Act applies to
"works" only. It is agreed that milis and
elevators are "works." There is a distinct
limitation to physicai properties.
If the federal parliament chose to exercise
its jurisdiction to the fullest extent it could
steal the rights of the provincial legislatures.

It is an old gaine for, a stronger body 10
filch jurisdiction of a weaker body. But oui'

about eigbty years, and so far we have flot

SUp to date we have consideied the wheat

Hon. M'r. LAMBERT: I sbould like 10 ask
the bonourable gentleman another question.
If lie werc convinccd that the main purpose
of the bill was to maintain for five years a
guaranteed price of $1.35 a bushel foir wheat.
would ho consider that the deelaration that
these mulîs arc "for thie genecal a(lvantage of
Canada" is justified?
i have a further question. Thie hionoîîcable

of wheat producers during certain years. Does
he say tuat tlucre is a distinction between -that
bonusing and the pavairnl of relief subventions 10 uaemployed people in those years?
Hon. Mr. BOEBUTCK: As 10 the laýst
question, does the honoucable gentleman ask
if there is an analogy?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I asmed that my
fîiend's argument wvas thaI the bonusing of
wbeat producers in certain vears w'as for the
general advanfage of Canada.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No. I say the fact
that we hiave boniîscd the growers of wbeat
out of thec national treasury is at least a
cîrcuinstance whlîi would lead 10 the conclu.sion that the trade is considcced 10 be foir
the general benefit of Canada.
Hou. Mi'. LAMBERT: If I may say so, I
do flot flîink that bears on the point.
Hon. Mr., ROEBUCK: Would my friend say
that tbe giving of relief 10 the unemployed
was a pîicelv local malter? Have we not
almost reachcd t'le conclus~ion that large
bodies of unemiploycd people are a national
responsibility?

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT:

An

international

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Even an international responsibility. If we bad before us aI
the moment a declaration Ibat unemployment
was for thue general disadvantage of Canada,
and that full employment was for the general
advaafage cf Canada, my friead and 1 would
have no besitation in accepting that declaration. I am flot îvocried about the nnalogy.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: May I ask my hionourable friend a question?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK. Do you flot think I
had better answcc the other questions" There
are Lw~o of them.
Hoa. Mr. FARRIS: I amn sorry.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: And I may be asked
10 remcmbei' too much.
Thie honotirahle gentleman from Ottawa
(Hon. M\r. Lamhrc.t) asked une whetlier my
juîdgmcat that the bill was ta the general
advanfage of Canada would be influenced
wce I fo come t0 the conclusion that its real
plil)ose, was to fix the price of wheat for the
next fiv~e years. That, as I understand it, is
the quie:sion. My answer is that I would not
be inifluenced in the slightest by that decîsion,
for Ibis reason. If I came t0 the conclusion
that tlic real purpo-c of this bill Ias 10 fix the
price of wlieat foi Che next five years, and I
wa, opposçcl ho that, I would vote against
the bill on its meîits, and my decision on that
point would have nothiag to do w~itb my
decision on the hegal aspect of the right of
parhiameat to legislate at ail. Those problems
are separate and distinct. If I-perbnps, like
thîe lioiiolrall meinher for Vancouver soutb
(Hon. Mi.. Farris)-wanfed 10 bcat the bill
on its merit-, I would argue the legal question;
and if I succcdcd on tbat I wouhd gain my
point on thec general question of the merits,
bcc-aui-e I would kill the bill. But at the
muom-ent I ain not doing that at aIl; I amn
arguîing the legal question. As I bave already
s1aid, I amnifot passing on the merit-s of this
bill; I am arguing the cigbt of this parliament
10 pass Ibis legishation, and my judgment is
tbat we have a perfect riglit to pass il if we
wisl t0 do so. If Ive are flot convinced of ils
merits we slîall not pass il; but that should
not cause lis 10 determine that we bave flot a
ciglit which, I think, we possess.
Hon. 'Mr. FARRIS: I was going te, ask, the
lm'nuurabhe senafor Ibis question, based on
bis observation ihiat wve bave bonused wheat.
We have also honused milk. Would that be

MAY 9, 1947
a ground for taking oven the dainies, with
the cows. as "works for the genenal advantage
of Canada"?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That might be carrying the thing ad abs urdurn.
lion. Mn. FARRIS: Why?
Hon. Mn. ROEBUC'.: We are not likely
to declane the ûows to be "for the generai
adv-antage of Canada".
J-on. Mr. HAIG: I think they anc.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I say that for this
neason: Wc do not wish to transfer legislative jurisdiction over cows fnom the provincial legisiatures to the dominion.
But let me ask this in return: wenc it a
fact that the very existence of Canada as a
nation dependcd upon some regulations with
regard to cows-Hon. Mn. MOLLOY: It doca.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes. but if the
necessity of regulation by the dominion govcrnment was vitally important, would wc have
any hesitation in cleclaring cows to be for
the general advantage of Canada? Oct my
next point-, if it wcre essential to the life
of Canada, to the national existence or the
national wclfare, that farn stock be declarcd
"for the general advantagc", why should we
hold our hand? It is for that reason that the
lcgislntons who passed the British North
Arnerica Act gavé- to this parliament the right
to declare any "wonk,"-it is so termied, and
a cow is not a "work" within the legal meaning of the British North America Act, although
dainies might be-to he "for the general
advantagc of Canada", and to assume control
over local works when they in their judgmcent
determine that they are for the general
advantagc of Canada.
Hon. Mn. FARRIS: My honourable fniend
askcd nie a question which 1 should likc to
nnswer. I would say that if legisiation involving cows wene necessary for the welfarc of
Canada, the proper way to deal with them
would be as something nccessarily ancillany
to the legislation. As you have deeianed cach
of these enumerated milîs individually, so you
would have to pick out evcry cow in Canada
and say that that particular cow is operating
as "a work for the general advantage of
Canada". That is the fundamental fallacy of
my honourable friend's position.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: But could you not
corne to the conclusion that aIl cows werc for
the genenal advantagc of Canada?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That is not the sta tement in this bill.

335

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: You would niot have
to state whether "Bossy" was red and "Tilýlie"
.was white before you declared ail nows to be
for -the general advantage of Canada. You
would not even have to know the owners of
the cows or where they were located.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: 1 would eall my
honjourable friend's attention to the fact that
there is no statement in this bill ab out "ail
milis" in Canada.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No; it does not say
"1ail milis"; it enumerates certain maills which
are be]ieved to be for the general advantage of
Canada. So the illustration does not illustrate,
and the, analogy is not analogous. Anyway,
the case of cows is a rather ridiculous illustration of the legal point. Cows are not analogous
at ail. Dairies are another rnatter; and the
time may corne when we in parliament will
decl'are dainies to be "for the general advantage of Canada".
Hon. Mr. BOUFFARD: You will have
serious difficulties.
Hon. Mr. ROEBIJCK: That is, if the
provinces were to negleet a duty to the people
of Canada. But -that question is not before us
today.
Hon. Mns. FALLIS: May I ask the honourable senator fnomn Tononto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) a question? Is flot the doctrine
which hie b-as enunciated-that if it be to its
advantagc, the state could take oven anytbing
without consulting individuals or provincesthe doctrine of ail dictatorship countries?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: 0f course, ail dictators pas laws and enfonce them. Perbaps the
same phîilosophy of power -applies to diotatore
as to, legisiative assemblies. But because
dictatons have power, la net to say that
demnocnatic institutions should renounce power.
It is a mere matter of the use of power on
the one hand and the abuse of power on the
othen hand. To say that wc must not do something because dictators did it is bardly a good
argument. unless it is also shown that the
doing of it constitutes an abuse.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Perhaps the honounable senator misunderstands me. My point is
that hie is stressing the centralization of power
under a national government. The foundation
of ail dictatonships is the taking away of powen
fnom individuals and local administrations and
centralizing it, in the state. And this sort of
legisintion, as the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Fanris) bas
pointed out, evidences--no matter whether it
is a precedent or whether it is the fourth or
fifth enactmnent of the kind-that there is a

,Jiu

SENATE

(iOcided tendenc 'v in this country towards
centralizalion of powecr. That, 1 think, is something wbichi somo cof us objeet t.o.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I tbink the honourable seuator should be allowed to continue
bis speech.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I bave finisbed my
speecb, Mr. Speaker, and I arn now atternpting
to, ansu-er questions. I wisb to reply to the
bonourable senator from Peterborough (Hon.
Mis. Fallis) because she bas broug.bt up a
really important point, and this is the first
time it bas been raised. I too arn opposed to
unnecessary and undue centralization of power.
The honourable senator from Peterborough
knows that. I suppose that we ail wisb to
preserve provincial .iurisdictions, to bave strong
municipalities, and nlot to bave an overburdeniug power centred in Ottawa.
If the
bonourable member tbinks that this bill tends
unduly in that direction, I wouid suggest that
she vote against tbe bill on its merits. I also
suggest that that bas notbing to do witb the
legal question witb wbich we are now
struggliug.
I also want to point out wbere, as I see it,
wc are going with this type of legisiation. The
vital distinction betu-cen demýocracies and
autocracies is tbe respect wbich democracies
pay to the individual. Autocracies glorify the
state and make it superior to, the individual,
so tbat you flnd ail kinds of cruelty applied
to tbe individuai; the subservience of the
more littie man to that giided idol cailed "the
state". It is the modern worsbip of Baal, aad
is heatbenism in its worst form. But that bas
uetbing to do witb this bill. If I felt that it
was an undue encroacbment on, provincial
jurisdiction and was tending to an autocracy
bore, I weuld vote against the bill on its monits.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: May I ask the
honourabie senator frorn Vancouver Soutb
(Hon. Mr. Farris) whether in bis opinion this
question was not settled somo thirty or forty
yeoars ago, when the Dominion Govornment
required every fleur Mill, every elevater and
evcrv fiat wareheuse in the three, prairie provinces te obtain fedoral licences before being
illowed te take in a bushel of wbeat? Was that
question net settlod when the Canada Grain
Act was passedi?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I arn glad my benourable friend frem Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr.
Paterson) asks that question because it onables
me te make a distinction which I tbink bas
been overlooked.
My boneurable friend (Hon. Mr. Roobuck)
bas been criticizing my speech, while appropriating most of it, but there is only one real

issue as far as parliament is concerned. We
are net dcaling witb tbe problem of how far
parliament, undor its geemal poxvems, may go
in legislating witb respect to provincial operatiens. That is net tbe question. The question
is a simple eue corning undet- section 92 (10) of
tbe British North Amerîca Act. Are we justified
in tbis case in declaring an enumerated group
cf floui' iihs about whicb wc know netbing, te
ho "wurks for tbe general advantage ef
Canada"? My boneurable friend said parliament coul(I pass legislation covering ail cows.

A selected group

No senater inay speak, twice te a question

I call attention te tbis rule miereiy because,

that in speaking tbe second time tbe bonourable senator frem Vancouver South (Hon.

My honourablo

so that 1 woutd flot have to kilt it on its
mierits. However, that is flot the point raised
by my honourable friend from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris). His point is one
that has always been troublesomne to me. In
the Senate we have got to guard the rights
of the provinces and protect themn from any
cncroachment by the Dominion government
upon their .iurisdictions; and in years to comte
we may be calied upon oftener to guard
provincial rights. This is an important point.
There is a mili at Mooseliorn, a miii at
Altona, a miii at Beausejour. I know of these
milis, but I do not know whether it is necessary to place themn under dominion jurisdiction.
It doca not matter whether we did this kind~ of
thing three or four times before. There is a
tacit agreement in Canada that wheat handling
and wheat trading benefit the people as a
whole and that is why we passed federat legis.
lation covering this business.
I agree with my honourable friend from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) that it is
our duty to satisfy ourselves as to wliether
jurisdiction over these milîs should be taken
away from the provinces. I have no doubt
that if we had a record of the debates of the
Fathers of Confederation we would learn the
power gîven to the dominion by section 92
(10) was given especially for war purposes.
But we are flot in a period, of wartime emergency now, and, we sliould watch our step. I
am in favour of the bill on its merits, but I
want to juin with the lionourable member
from. Vancouver Southi in sayîng that every
time we are presented with a measure like this
we should be very carefut to see whether it
does not encroach unnecessarîly upon provincial jurisdiction.

to amend the Immigration Act and to repeai
the Chinese Immigration Act.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators,
before the bilt is given second reading. may
I ask if it is in'tended that it lie referred to
committee?
Hon. Mr. COPP: I do not know that that
will be necessary.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I sbould tike to ask the
minister some questions in committee.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I was about to, ask the
honourabie senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) te explain the bitl. Perliaps he wili
give the honourable leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig) the information he requires.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
the amendments to the Immigration Act contained in the bill hefore, us are fairiy simple
in meaning and easity understood. The most
important feature of the bill is the repeal of
the Chînese Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1927.
The first section of the bill adds two new
subsections to section 33 of the Immigration
Act. This section of the Immigration Act
bas to do with the admission of people to
Canada from other countries, and it laye down
the conditions under which entry may take
place. It lias notliing ta do with the generat
immigration poticy as to who and what
number may be adniitted. The section outlines
the procedure for officers of tlie Immigration
Branch stationed, at various ports of entry.
Under the new subsection 15 of section 1 an
immigration officer a-t any port of entry may,
in respect, for instance, of persons from tlie
Orient passing through Canada ta anotlier
destination, require the raitway company to
put up a bond assuring the transportation of
these people throughout Cana-da, and prevention of tlieir escape. This provision is occasioned by the fact that at times Oriental
labour bas been brought througli the port of
entry at Vancouver, trave'Ied across Canada
to the Atlan-tic coast and on to tlie West
Indies or etsewliere. When their work was
completed tliey returned across Canada to,
Vancouver and saited for home. The Cliinese
Immigration Act covered tlie bonding cf
tabourers passing through Canada. With tlie
repeat of that Act it is neces-sary to incorporate into the Immigration. Act a provision of
this nature. Subsection 16 provides that the
Governor in Councit may preseribe the
amount cf the bond required from the transportation company.
By section 2 of the bill, section g0 of the
Inmmigration Act is repeated.
Wlien the
Chinese Immigration Act is repealed, section
80 will no longer be required.

SENATE

Section 3 of the bill bias to do with the sections off tbe Immigration Act prohibiting the
entry off immigrants into Canada because off
hiealth or other reasons. For instance, persons
suffering from epilepsy or tuberculosis cannot
enter Canada; and persons convicted of crimes
involving moral turpitude are also fforbidden
to enter. Several prohibitions in that respect
are defined. This section waives these prohibitions during the pleasure off the Governor
in Counicil for the purpose off admitting to
Canada dcpendants off soldiers who married

Britain. anci when bis wiffe makes application
to come to Canada it may be found on examination that zhe would come under the ban off
one off these prohibitions, so this section is
intendcd to waive the prohibition so far as sol(liers' dependants are concerned. Also it
provides that such pcople shahl be mediand a record off their

shall be pasSed on to the public health service

'lapprovcd medical prac titioner", "depenidant",
"Imemiber off the fforces", and so forth.
The ncxt and final section off the bill isHon. Mr. HAIG: The real section.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Well, the important
section. It is the repeal off the Chinese Immigration Act, whicb, as I stated earlier, appears
in the Revised Statutes off Canada, 1927. The
Chinese Imîmigration Act was passcd a good
many years ago. Under that statute there are
definite prohibitions off Chinese coming to
Canada. Briefly, tbe only Chinese who wvere
admiss.ible to Canada under the Chinese
Immigration Act, were, first, members off the
diplomatie corps; second, the chiîdren borai
in Canada off parents off Chinese race or
descent who were resident in Canada and
wlmo hiad lefft Canada ffor educational or other
purposes: third, merchaiLs, as defined by regulations whichi miglit be laid down by the minister; that is, merchants desiring to come to
Canada on business and admitted for the pur~poses off business, but who had to go
back,'
off course. when their business was completed.
The other admissible class was Chinese students who desired to study in Canadian univer.'ities, and whu had tu return home when
their period off study was over. Those were
the vital sections which governed admission off

Chinese to Canada under the Chinese
Immigration Act, which by this bill is
being repealed.
%Vhatevcrview one may hiold about Oriental
inmmigration to Canada-and I have se
ffairly definite views on that subject-there
cani be no gainsayiîîg the argument that the
Chinèse Immigration Act was really an exclusion act, and singîrd out one particular nation
in a w-av wbich was definitely repugnant to
them. The question involved was not one off
Chinese wanting to comp 10 Canada; the real
question w.'as that the Chinese Immigration
Act put a "bar sinister", as it were, on the
Chines" as a nation, and off course that is a
discrimination that should not be perpetuated
in our haws. There is an order in counicil
passed under the Immigration Act whichi
deala with the migration to Canada off Asiaties
off any race, but we do not put that mark off
disapproval, may I caîl it, upon Japanese.
EaSt Indians, Malayans or any other class off
Asi;atics. For this reason the Chinese lImmigration Act wvas rcgarded by the government
off China as constituting a peculiarly black
mrark against tbem, and on that account I
pcrsonaily w-elcome its repeal.
What, then, will ho the position as regards
thr admission off Chinese to Canada affter the
repeal off the Act.? It will come undei the
oî-dcr in council governing the admission off
Asiatics. Tbat order will apphv to Chinese
as it applies to other Asiatics. The Chinese
who is a citizen off Canada (-an now bi-ing to
this Country bis wiffe, and chihdren under
eighteen years off age, if they are in good
physical condition, because that is the regulalion which governs admission off Asiatics gener-

ally - By this bill we remove the obnoxious
discrimination against, the Chinese. I venture
to say that the bihl should pass this bouse
without any serions opposition.
Hon. Mi-. POEBITCK: How many Chinaamen are there in Canada w-ho are supposcd to
1w married and whose wives and children are
in China?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: And how many wives?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Well, I supposed thcy
wvouhd have onhy one wiffe; if they have two,
we would ike to know which one will be permitted entrance.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I cannot give information on the second question. 1 understand
that there are about 30,000 Chinese in Canada.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Some figures were
given at one time in the newspapers, and I
wvundtered if there was any authienticity to
them. I forget the figure which was published,
but it was a considerable number-a very con-

MAY 9, 1947
siderable part of the 30,000. I welcome this
legislation, because to me it seems such an
unnatural thing to allow Chinese men to come
to this country and deny them so long as they
are in Canada the right to a family life. It is
not a healthy condition for married men who
have wives and children in China, to be
doomed to celibacy in this country. It is not
a humanitarian condition, or one that tends
to the best social results. I welcome the
change in the law which allows these men to
bring their wives here. Just in passing, I think
it is perhaps only fair to the Chinese who in
years past have been denied this right, to say
-and this is not out of place-that they have
been a very law-abiding section of our society,
and that perhaps they have behaved themselves better than some others might have
behaved if in their place. I wish to acknowledge that and give credit to them.
The honourable senator who has just
explained the bill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) said he
had some definite views on the immigration
of Chinese. I am sorry that he did not express
them. I too have views in connection with
that subject. They were very well expressed
by the Prime Minister when he said that entry
to -Canada was a privilege and not a right;
that Canada accorded to other nations the
right and privilege of deciding who should
enter their country as permanent residents, and
reserved to herself the same right to use her
judgment as to what immigrants she would
admit. It is necessary that we enforce that
right, because this is a white man's land. I
am not basing that statement on any ground
of colour or race. It is necessary for the maintenance of our social conditions and our way
of life that we restrict the immigration of
hordes of Chinese to this country. That does
not justify us in not giving very considerate
treatment to those Chinese who are already
here. Whether we admit more Chinese, and
whether we act with decency and kindness and
consideration to those who are already hereparticularly those who have become Canadian
citizens, secured Canadian domiciles and justified their stay by the observance of our laws
as good citizens-are two different problems.
1 am glad to say that I shall vote for this
bill with pleasure.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Honourable senators,
I am sorry, to be speaking so much, but I
regard this bill as of some importance. I
intend to vote against it. I shall not say
much, and I shall not seek to influence the
vote of anybody else.
So far as the Chinese in this country are
concerned, the simple fact is that they were
not shanghaied and brought here. They came

339

of their own free will. A large portion of
them stayed in British Columbia at a time
when they must have known that the sentiment in that province was against their coming
there at all. There was nothing to compel
them to come and there was nothing to compel
them to remain. Their being allowed to come
to this country was a concession. I cannot
see how the theory comes about that one good
turn deserves another. I have great admiration for the Chinese people, and I had a
very warm and personal admiration for one
Chinaman in particular, whom for a number
of years I employed as a cook. He was a loyal
and good servant, and when he died I felt his
passing almost as much as though he had been
a member of the family. But, that is not the
point. The point is the society in our
country, and our social and political conditions in the future.
So far as my experience tells me-I am
speaking now entirely without previous preparation or thought on what I right saythere would not seem to be any reasonable
prospect whatever of assimilation of orientals
in this country. What I mean by assimilation
is the marriage with other classes and the
disappearance of a distinct race, leaving only
a Canadian people of a common race. I can
see no prospect of that. It has not happened
in- regard to the Negro in the United States.
Hon. Mr..ROEBUCK: It is happening very
fast in the United States.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I admit it has happened
to a certain extent, but it has not happened
to the extent of in any way eliminating the
Negro problem as such.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Not yet.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: There is no such
problem in regard to the European people
who corme to our country. They go to our
western country; and it is not long before
they are merged in a common citizenship and
identity. That is not the experience we have
had with Orientals. It is no reflection on the
Orientals any more than it is on us, for they
have their distinct characteristics which they
may rightly think are superior to ours. There
is no reasonable prospect of assimilation of
Chinese in the future, and I believe the introduction of the Oriental into our country,
without a reasonable prospect of this assimilation, only makes for trouble. The problem will
grow until perhaps seventy-five years from now
our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren
will look back with regret to some wellintended theories that left sections of Canada
with a racial problem. Once this has started

SENATE
to grow it will never be eradicated. I saw
figures in the newspapers, and I am mighty
skeptical about them.
Hon.
figures?

Mr.

ROEBUCK:

What

are

the

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I do not know the
figures, but I am skeptical; I doubt very much
if they aie as trifling as the newspapers suggested. A great many wives, to say nothing
of children in China, would come in under
this legislat-ion. That would create a problem
for the future. The immediate problem has
been in existence for years and, of course, it
is an unfortunate situation that men should
be in this country without their wives. However, men go to work in the logging camps
and in the woods, and under no circumstances
would an employer permit their wives to go

with them. It is a voluntary matter. It is
also a voluntary matter when these Chinese
cone to Canada, and there is nothing to stop
them from returning to their own country.
I repeat that I do not wish to influence the
vote of any honourable senator, but I intend
to vote against this bill.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: May I have the
indulgence of this house to put on the record
the figures I have been asked for, and which
my honourable friend from Medicine Hat
(Hon. Mr. Gershaw) has just supplied me
with? I quote from a statement made in
another place by the Minister of Mýines and
Natural Resources on May 5, 1947:
The Chinese male population, married, is
23,556; the Chinese male population, single, is
5,866; the Chinese female population, married,
is 1,177, and the Chinese female population,
single, is 2,569. The separated, divorced or
widowed number ý1,459. There are 6,694 persons
of the Chinese race born in Canada, who are
therefore citizens of Canada, and 2,055 persons
naturalized. This makes a total of 8,748, leavng approximately 26,000 of Chinese origin in
Canada who are not Canadian citizens.
Those are all the pertinent figures.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I read an article in the
newspaper indicating how few Chinese could
bring wives into big Canadian cities; but it
did not say how long it would take the rest
of the Chinese to become Canadian citizens.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, 'I wish only to relate a little experience
I had when I was one of the Canadian
Nations
United
the
to
representatives
conference. The most acrimonious debate I
witnessed in that assembly was waged by
India against South Africa. It appears that
some fifty or sixty years ago a few labourers
from India were admitted to Natal, on the
east coast of South Africa. They now number
about 50,000. A bitter attack was made on

the government of South Africa, and it was
charged that these Indians were not being
treated as a sovereign people. It was admitted
that they had better living conditions and
more employment and were better off than
their own people in India. The only privilege
they did not have was the right to become
candidates for the Parliament of South
Africa, and the right to vote. The wartime
regulations which amounted to conscription
in that country did not apply to them. The
Indians were limited to a certain extent as
to the ownership of property and that sort
of thing. They or their ancestors were indentured labour a long time ago. The government offered them transportation back to
their own country but they would not leave
South Africa.
The thought occurred to me at that meeting of the United Nations, and it comes back
to me now, that we should never admit
Asiatie people into this country. There was a
clear demonstration in South Africa of the
inability of the Indians to assimilate themselves into the national life.
I do not intend to vote against the bill,
but I feel that if we pass it we shall be
making a mistake. It is my opinion that the
government should look carefully into this
matter, because there is no use in just saying
that it affects only six or eight thousand
people. These Canadian Chinese have been
here for years, they are all naturalized or
will have no difficulty in getting naturalized.
They are all unmarried and will go back te
China, marry and bring their wives into
this country. In reply te a question in the
other house the minister said that any
naturalized Canadian could go and get a
wife and bring her into Canada. Of course,
there could be no such thing as telegraphie
marriages.
These Chinese will all bring
women to this country; and, as my honourable friend from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) has said,-that will create a problem.
If we want an example, let us look at South
Africa.
I repeat that the debate I witnessed in the
United Nations was a most bitter one, and
every race that was net white-with the
exception of Russia and her satellites-were
on the one side.
We who represent Canada today must not
forget that probably seventy-five years from
now someone will ask why a measure of this
kind was passed,. I have brought this illustration of South Africa to the attention of the
house not wi.th a view to opposing the bill, but
I regret that it bas been introduced.

MAY 9, 1947
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
if I might be pcrmitted, to say a word,, in
closing the debate on this billHon. Mr. HAIG: My honourable friend can
,only speak with the consent of the house.
He cannot speak for the second time on second
reading of a bill.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
explained the bill, and I think he bas
cxhaustcd fris rights.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am quite agreeable that
the bonourable gentleman speak, but he may
do so only with the consent of the bouse.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Apparently the rules
of this house differ from those of the other
bouse.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Tbey are different.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
I have very littie further to say on this matter.
I recognize the problems that have been
referred to by the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) and the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig),
but we are dealing with a rather complex
situation. China today is recagnized tbroughout the world as a great power; she, is one of
the five nations represented on the permanent
council of the United Nations organ.ization.
She is there by right of being an ally in the
war and because of ber world position. We
know that scbolastically and from a literary
standpoin't a great many Chinese have attained
high distinction.
I recail the occasion during the recent war
when Madam Chiang Kai-sbek addressed a
joint~ meeting of the bouses of parliament, and
the fine impression she made upon all who
heard here. The Chinese have rigbtly a pride
in their country and their ancestry.
If we consider this new policy only on the
ground of justice and fair play, I tbink it
becomes our duty to remove the stigma-that
is flot too strong a word-that was placed upon
the Chinese people by our Chinese Immigration Act. If we judge the repeal of this act
on a purely materialistie basis, it will be seen
to be to our advantage. I do not regard this
as the bighest ground, but it must be remembered that Canada is on the North Pacifie, as
is China. Unquestionably in this century,
when the troubles of the present day bave
passed-if they do pass-China will be a great
world market. Honourable senators, is it not
a matter of common sense and in our own
înterest to avoid anything that would create
antagonism among four hundred million
people?

I helieve that the adimission of the wives of
Chinese to Canada is a matter of ele.mentary
justice. How can we place on our statute
books laws prohibiting wives of Canadian citizens of Chinese origin coming here, when we
admit the wives of cit.izens of other origins?
That would be a discrimination which we could
not successfully maintain without damage to
our own good name.
The honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) remarked that
he woulci be glad to know my views on the
general question of Oriental immigration to
Canada. 1 have no0 hesitation in saying that
I am opposed to it, but I want my opposition
to be on a basis that will flot offend countries
like India, China, and-wben she regains ber
sovereignty-Japan. I agree with the honourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) that we have two civilizations and we
cannot look forward to, combining them; and
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
is right in saying that we have the right to say
wbom we shaîl admit to thîs country; but we
can do so in a way whicb will not be offensive
to these new and rising powers in the Far
East. We have the right to guard our own
citizenship, but the Chinese have the same
right to guard theirs; and it should not be
difficult for the government of Canada to reach
an understanding with China which will be
mutual in its operation and will not stamp
either country as being inferior to, the other.
These are the reasons why personally I am
glad to see the Chinese Immigration Act
repealed.. I have every confidence that the
government wilJ take the wîse steps which
are necessary to protect the good citizenshîp
of this country.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Would the honourable
member tell us how many Chinese are in
Canada now?
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: about 34,000.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: There will be 20,000
more coming in.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time, on division.

The Hon. the SPEAKEIR: When shail the

Hon. Mr. COPP: I do flot want to impose

we have some important matters to deal with
next week. This bill is a matter of urgency,
and if there is no objection I would suggest
that it be 110w read a third time. With leave,

TRADING WITH THE ENEMY BILL
SECOND READING

McL. ROBERTSON
Hon. WISHART
movcd the second reading of Bill 22, an Act
to continue the Revised Regulations respecting Trading with the Enemy (1943).
H1e said: Honourable senators, this bill was
given first reading a few moments ago, and at
present only about a haîf dozen copies of it
are available. I have asked the honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) to
expiain the bill. Two methods of procedure
are open to the house: we may adjourn during pheasure until copies have been distributed,
or proceed with the explanation and distribute
the copies as soon as received.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Then I wilýl ask
the honourable senator fromn Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) to expiai. the bill.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators, this biul is entit-led, "An Act to continue the Revised Regulations respecting
Trading with the Enemy (1943)." As honourable members know, the administrator of
enemy property in Canada is called the Custodian of Enemy Property. It je not a new
office. During the First World War it became
necessary to set up a custodians office to take
charge and control the disposition of enemy
property in Canada and occupied territories.
As illustrating how these things hang on, some
remnants of the administrative functions cf
that office were stili in existence when the
Second World War hegan, in 1939. At that

time, by reason. of experience gained during
the previous war, an order in council was
passed, under the War Measures Act, providing regulations by which the custodi-an wouid
deal with enemy property. Those regulations
were revised in 1943, and subsequenthy the
order was continued under the National
Emergency Transitional Powers Act. The
purpose of this bill is to continue some of
those regulations in force, in legishative form,
until such time as peace treaties with ahi
enemy countries have been conchuded.
To a great extent we are now discussing
something after the event. The regulations
provided that the custodian shail be the
Secretary of State, and he was given authority
to delegate his duties to certain other persons.
Pursuant to that authority he appointed a
deputy custodian. At the beginning the main
purpose, o! course, was to investigate, take
possession of, locate, control and administer
assets of enemies of this country which were
found in Canada. And as various countries
in Europe were overrun by our enemies it
became necessary in the interest of our coinmon war effort that the control of the assets
of nationals of these occupied countries should
come into possession of the government of
Canada, so as to, forestaîl any effort of our
enemies to get possession of these assets and
dispose of them as a means of strengthening
their financial position.
So two divisions came under the administration of the custodian's office. One pertains
to what may be called technicai enemies, the
other to what are known as belhigerents.
Technical enemies would consist of nationals
of occupied countries, such as France, Belgium, Holland, Denmark and Norway; enemy
belhigerents, of course, would he Germany
and the satellite powers, inchuding Itaiy,
Romania and, hater, Japan. One strange
circumstance is that, whereas during the First
World War a very substantial amount in
dullar values of assets of our enemies came
into possession of the custodian, during the
recent war the peak amnount of assets from
ahl sources held by the custodian was, I
understand, a little over a billion dollars.
Only about $11,000,000 of this represented
German enemy assets, and ail the belligerent
enemy assets on which the custodian was
able to lay his hands amounted to possibly
twenty or twenty-one million dollars.
The manner in which these countries which
became enemies of ours were functioning for
some period prior to the war enabled them
to utihize their foreign assets to provide themselves with what they needed to feed the
war machine which they expected soon to
set on its way. The net result was that they
had litthe if anything in the way of assets

344

SENATE

which the custodian could seize; and the
fact is that out of the billion dollars to
which I have referred the amount of German
and other enemy assets seized was very small.
With respect to the other assets, it will be
appreciated that as soon as the invaded
countries ceased to be occupied, and as soon
as satisfactory arrangements were made with
each country involved-and such arrangements
have already been concluded with several
states, including France and Belgium-there
would be returned to those countries their
state assets which were under the control and
direction of our custodian. Then, as individuals or nationals in those countries would be
able to prove to the satisfaction of the
custodian that they were entitled to those
particular assets, those assets would be
released to them. Identification and proof of
ownership, of course, would be required. As
regards the release of state funds to the
various countries, friendly nations and allies,
that were overrun by the enemy, at the end
of December, 1946, there remained in the
hands of the custodian, out of that billion
dollars, approximately $320,000,000. That does
not mean that all that money is in his physical
possession; it includes assets held by trust
and investment companies; but all these are
subject to the control and direction of the
custodian. It will be seen that, of the $320,000,000 to which I have referred, only about
$20,000,000 represent enemy assets.
That is the background of this matter. We
are talking now of something that is in the
past. Were it necessary to do so, it would
be a simple matter to justify the appointment
of a custodian. Every country found it necessary to appoint one. The manner in which our
custodian's office was set up was somewhat
different from the procedure in England. We
provided for the taking over and vesting in
the custodian of all assets that Canada could
get ber hands on and that belonged to enemy
countries or nationals, or to occupied territories
or their nationals.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Might I ask the
honourable senator a question?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Can be tell me what
charge the custedian makes for the administration of this property?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes. The custodian
could charge up to two per cent commission;
that would be two per cent of the capital
value of all assets that came into his
possession, and two per cent of any dividends

or interest on securities. Out of these revenues,
he had to defray the expenses of administering
his office.
I might point out to honourable senators
that during the period the custodian bas been
operating there has been no annual accounting
to parliament of the funds or assets taken
over, or of the commissions charged or expenditures made. However, each year an audit has
been made by an outstanding firm of chartered
accountants, Price Waterhouse and Company,
who report in great detail to the minister.
A complete report was furnished during the
progress of this bill in another place. I am
holding up a copy in my hand, and frem the
size of it honourable members can get some
indication of how thoroughly it covered the
operations of the custodian during the period
in which be was functioning.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: What became of the
surplus money, if there was any, received from
the two per cent commission?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Undoubtedly there
is surplus money. It is still in a bank account,
or several accounts, in the name of the
custodian, that is, the Secretary of State,
whose sanction must be obtained before withdrawals can be made. There has been no
transfer of that money from the custodian to
parliament or to consolidated revenue, but the
cost of administration has been charged
against the money. Undoubtedly there is a
surplus. and there must be a fairly substantial
one. If there ever is a winding-up of the
custodian's office, any funds left over will have
to be disposed of in some fashion.
There is still a big job to be done by the
custodian. If there ever was a time when the
custodian was truly a custodian, it is at the
present time, because although the duties of
locating assets and investigating them have, in
the main, been discharged, the Canadian and
other troops who went into Germany obtained
information that has enabled the custodian
to locate further assets. These are now few
and far between. The custodian's function at
this time is to hold all the assets until peace
treaties are concluded with the various enemy
countries. Those peace treaties will provide
for the handling of reparations, the manner
in which the enemy assets held by Canada
are to be applied in satisfaction of Canadian
claims eitier for damage sustained by illegal
warfare or for destruction of Canadian assets
in enemy countries.
Those matters were
dealt with in pursuance of provisions in peace
treaties after the last war. It will be recalled
that at that time reparation commissions were
set up in Canada and hearings were held to

MAY 12, 1947
deal with claims of Canadian citizens for
damages sustained through illegal warfare and
loss of Canadian assets in enemy countries.
But, unlike then, there is not now available
in Canada sufficent enemy funds to take care
of possible claims. When speaking on this
matter in another place, the minister intimated that although no advertising bas been
done inviting Canadians to file and record
their claims, already the claims that have been
sent in exceed greatly in dollar value the
enemy assets held by the custodian to satisfy
these claims, once they have been proved. The
procedure for proving claims is something that
still has to be set up, and will have to be pxovided for in the peace treaties.
The bill before us simply provides that
the revised regulations, which are successive
orders in council passed under the War
Measures Act and now in force under the
National Emergency Transitional Powers Act,
be continued in force until a day fixed by
proclamation of the Governor in Council.
That day will not be so fixed until all treaties
of peace have been concluded, and the funetions of the custodian as holder of these
assets is at an end. I should say that the
functions of the custodian will not be fully
completed until some far distant date. As I
pointed out earlier in my remarks, when war
broke out in 1939 the custodian was still
discharging some duties arising out of the
First World War.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourable
gentleman one more question? My observation may not be in order, but I noticed that
there was considerable discussion on this
subject in a committee of the other place.
Did the members of that committee consider
the financial aspect of this measure?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: May I be permitted
to defer answering that question for a
moment?
The bill is a simple one, containing only
four sections, and its purpose is to continue
in force the regulations set out in the
schedule.

In any instance where a regulation

has been found unnecessary, for convenience
the original

numbering bas been preserved

and the regulations marked "revoked". From
section 2 (2) it will be observed that all amendments to the regulations have been put right
into the bill itself. They are, for convenience,
also written into the schedule. If honourable
senators consider there should be some further

amendments, they can be put right into the
bill.
In the main the amendments are for the
purpose of permitting a person who so desires
to establish that he is not an enemy. After
giving notice, he can go to the Exchequer

345

Court; and if he satisfies the court that he is
not properly designated as an enemy, and
that he is the owner of certain assets, the
court will make an order that the custodian
deliver the assets to him. A series of such
amendments will be found in subsection 2 of
section 2.
Section 3 provides that the custodian must
make an annual report to parliament. Section
4 provides for the duration of the bill, and is
followed by the schedule of regulations. All
the features in the regulations during the war
which might have been described as "tough"
have been taken out of the bill, and are
marked "revoked." Powers to search, locate
and investigate are no longer necessary; everything that can be found has been found. The
bill is a sort of holding order, to continue
authority in the custodian to hold certain
assets until their ultimate destination is determined by peace treaties and court proceedings,
or as a result of claimants satisfying the eustodian with proofs of ownership.
Considerable discussion developed both publicly and in another place as to the financial

aspects of the bill on two points:

First, the

sale of property such as labour temples, and

so on, which had been seized during the war
under the Defence of Canada Regulations and
whose owners had been declared illegal concerns; second, the seizure and sale of evacuees' property and assets owned by the
Japanese in British Columbia.
May I make this general observation in
relation to the assets of Japanese? First of
all, the responsibility was not primarily that
of the custodian. As a matter of policy, several
orders in council were passed by the government which provided for the taking over of
these properties and assets and appointed the
custodian as the person to administer and
dispose of them. They also provided for the
appointment of what might be called appraising commissioners, who went around and
appraised assets and properties of these aliens.
At least this much can be said, that the moneys
realized by the sale of the various assets taken
over under those orders in council, and
administered and sold through the custodian's
office, exceeded the value of those properties
and assets as determined by the appraising
commissioners. In that connection I would
draw attention to the following statement

whioh was made this year in another place by
the Prime Minister:
With respect to the property of persons of
Japanese origin who were removed from the
Pacifie coast, and whose property was sold by

the custodian, the government is of the opinion

that the sales were made at a fair price. In all
cases a complete appraisal was made before
disposition. The total of the prices secured is

346

SENATE

greater in aggregate than the total appraisa!
value. To ensure, however, the fair treatment
promised in 1944, the government is prepared, in
cases where it can be shown that a sale was
made at less than a fair market value, to remedy
the injustice.
So much for the Japanese phase.
In connection with the other phase, relating
to the sale of labour temples and other propertics, honourable senators will remember that
during the period of the war there were sudden
changes in property values. In the first several
years of the war, values did not reach their
peak. It was not, I believe, until 1942 that
they started to ascend. Some of these properties were disposed of by the custodian
shortly after their acquisition; and at a later
period, when apparently some of these organizations were able in some fashion to purge
themselves of illegality and become legal
organizations in Canada, the question of
restoration of their properties came up. Of
course, those which had been sold could not
be restored, and it then became a question
of turning over the moneys realized through
the sales. The matter of the sale price came
up, and there was quite a storm.
As honourable members will recall, investigations were made at that time, and values
were determined. While it was not admitted
that the custodian had erred in selling or in
respect to the prices he received, yet property had appreciated so much over the years
since these assets were acquired that in some
instances the government, through the custodian, set upon the properties which had been
sold an additional value, as appraised, over
and above the prices which had been realized,
and the custodian paid to these organizations
the difference between the sale prices and
what was subsequently determined to be the
real value. The money to pay the difference
was taken by the custodian out of revenues
representing commissions which he received
on the handling of the various assets, belonging to enemy aliens, internees and nationals of
occupied territories which came to him as
custodian. Whether this was the proper procedure, or whether the money should have
come out of the consolidated revenues of
Canada, is a question which I suppose, we
might debate from various points of view.
But, in any event, that is the manner in which
the problem was dealt with. Like most of the
operations of the custodian's office, it is now
a thing of the past; and unless honourable
senators have some specific questions in connection with the financial aspect of it, that is
all I propose to say about that phase of the
administration of enemy property.

There are just one or two other things I
think I should mention in connection with
this bill. I want to emphasize that in the
main we are dealing with something which
is behind us. We are in possession of certain
assets. The quantity of them will decrease
rapidly as we conclude arrangements with our
allies and those occupied countries. When
they rehabilitate themselves and are able to
establish satisfactory arrangements with Canada and with the custodian, their assets will
be returned. We have a picture of the custodian holding possibly $20,000,000 or $22,000,000 worth of enemy assets against the day
when the procedure in connection with reparations is settled and we shall embark on the
business of proof of claims by Canadian citizens and others ranking against these assets
in satisfaction of those claims.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: What was the necessity for selling these properties?
Was it
necessary, for instance, to sell the labour
temples?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The explanation
which was given-and perhaps I should
express my view that it is a reasonable oneis this. The labour temples were located in
areas containing large populations, frequently
of foreign birth, and it was found that some of
the properties deteriorated very quickly, not
only as a result of their own wear and tear but
in consequence of outside contributions to the
condition of deterioration.
People went in
and wrecked the interior of buildings; and
the custodian felt that lie was faced with the
choice of providing a constant watch on and
care for these properties all across Canadaand he had a lot of other things to do besides
that-or of selling them when there was a
market for them. The course he chose was
that of selling them and realizing what he
thouight at that time was a fair price.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: Had the custodian
power to rent any of these buildings? I
know that on many occasions offers were made
to rent them. but were always declined.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: If I am asked for my
opinion, I should say that, the properties
having been vested in the custodian, I think
he had the power either to hold them or dispose of them, as in his discretion he thought
best. He exercised his discretion, and sold
them. In some instances it turned out that in
the following year or two property values
appreciated
very considerably;
and
the
government, through the custodian, lias made
compensation for that increase in price. I do

347

MAY 12, 1947
flot propose at this time to argue the question
of whether the custodian. should have rented
the properties at thut time. They would have
needed repairs, I suppose, before they were
rented; and I assume that he was flot prepared to go into the rentai business. We
can form our own opinions on the merits of
the question; but whether our attitude is one
of praise or criticism, the thing is in the past,
the government has made compensation to the
extent that it feels is in keeping with the
condition whîch developed, and there the
matter rests.
I do not know that there is anything I can
usefully add. I have flot gone into any
detailed survey of the regulations, because so
many of them relate te things which have
already happened. There will not be much
opportunity to use many of these regulations
in future. because very littie enemy property will be coming into, the custodian. The
purpose of the bill is just to "hold the fort", as
it were, unýtil we can get on with the next step,
which will be the matter of reparations.
Are there any questions? I have gone into
a rather Iengthy explanation-more than I
would have given ordinarily-because of th
fact that honourable members have not the bi 1
before them.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
rpad the second tinie.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall the
bill be read the third time?

TRADING WITH THE ENEMY BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON
moved the third reading of Bill 22, an Act to
continue the Revised Regulations respecting
Trading with the Enemy (1943).
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
WAR CHARITIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. GRAY TURGEON moved the second
reading of Bill T6, an Act to amend the Wai
Charities Act, 1939.
He said: There are just two features of this
amendment. One is the result of a purely
clerical error. Section 1 of the bill as printed
reada: "On and after the coming into force
of this Act", and then goes on to say what the
amendnient wiIl do. I believe that aIl honourable senators will wish te take out of the bill
the words "On and after the coming into
force of this Act."
The amendment is designed simply to do
away with federal jurisdiction over future
war charities. As honourable senators know,
during the war any organization raising funds
for a charitable purpose in connection with
the war was compelled te submait a statement
of its obj ectives for approval of the Minister
of National War Services, or, later, the
Minister of National Healtb and Welfare. It
was also necessary for every such organization to submait annual statements of its
financial transactions, and a final accountiug
on termination of its activities.
Up to the end of April of this year, 1,824
licenses were granted te organizations carrying on wnr charities. 0f this total, 947 were
branches of the Independent Order of the
Daughters of the Empire and 127 were Canadian Legion war memorial funds.
Under this proposed amendment, the federal
government will no longer have the right to
grant or refuse a license since, apart from the
war, the raising of funds for such charitable
purposes is a matter outside federal jurisdiction. Funds already in existence wiIl, of
course, be subject to all the provisions of the
Act, but their activities are now being rapidly
wound up.

Hon. Mr. WHITE: May I ask the hionourable senator how many of these funds are
yet in operation?
Hon. Mr. TLTRGEON: Altogethier there
were 1,824, but they are being vcry rapidly

but it is flot a great mnraer.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was rcad the second tim-e.
CONSIDERED IN OOMMITTEE

lion. Mr. TURGEON moved that the
Senate go into committee on the bill.
He said: As it seems necessary te, make oae
amendmnent, honourable senators may wish
to hiave the bill go to a standing committee;
but 1 personally would recommend that we
deal xvith it imimediately in Committee of
the Whole. However, I shahtl not press the
motion if honourable senators prefer reference
to a standing committce.
The motion wvas agrccd te, and the Senate
went into committee on the bill.
Hon. Mr. Sincl]air in the Chair.
On section 1-War Chiarities Act, 1939, to
apply only te a fund establishied prier te this
Act:
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: iloneurable senators, I move thiat the werds, "On and after
the coming inte force ef this Act" be struck
eu t.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCE: iloneurable senators,
hefere we carry this ameadmeat, I think we
eughit te have seme additieaal information.
As the section new stands, ià seems te do two
things. First, it prevents application of the
War Chiarities Act te charities that are establishied in th)e future; and secondly, it has
the effect of continuing application of that
Act to war charities already established before
the act comes into force. I feel that this bouse
shouhd know what charities we are now placing îînder dominion jurisdiction for an indefinite period. That is rather important. It is
just possible that we have net got the constitutional jurisdiction te do anything of the
kind. We certainly bad that jurisdictien at
the time the act was passed, because then a

war wvas in progress and a crisis existed. Howeveor. that crisis lias gene and we n'-w have ne
peower te legisiate with regard te the raising
of money for war charities, which is a civil
right îînder the jurisdiction of the provinces
and net a dominion matter at ail. We eught
te know what we are doing.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, in reply te my honourable friend frem
Toronto-Triaity (Hon. 1\r. Roebuck), I may
ýay that our Law Cherk has recommended the
striking eut of the words "On and after the
coming into for-ce of this Act," on the ground
that they are superfinous. If any honourable
member requires more information than is
now available, I am quite willing-as I am
sure the honourable senator fromn Cariboo
(Hon. Mr. Turgeon) is-te have the bill
rcferred te one of the standing committees,
where witncszes couhd appeau and be questioned.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Thiea I suggest,
hionotîrable senaters, that tie bill shouhd ho
reforreci te a committee. I do net think we
have ,Iîrisdiction te pass legislation applying
teo war charitios.

JUVENILE DELINQUENTS

BILL

SECOND READING

MeL. ROBERTSON
Hon. WISHART
moved the second reading of Bill Dg, an act
te amend the Juvenile Delinquents Act, 1929.
H1e said: Honourable senators, the purpese
ef this bill is to permit the parent or guardian
ot a juvenile delinquent te appeal from the
decision of a magistrate as weil as tram the
decision ot a judge of the Juvenile Court.
The amcndment will serve te correct an
ine<auity as betwcen juvenile delinquents convicted in areas whcre there is a juvenile court
and those in areas where suai cases are disposed et hy magistrates. At present there is
ne appeal in cases et juvenile delinquents
cenvicted by a magistrate. The amendment
was recommended by thc Canadian Bar
Asseciation's committee on Unitormity of
Legislation.
Hon. Mr'. MORAUD: May 1 ask the honourable gentleman twe questions? First, shal
we be given an enumeratien of the special
grounds under wbîcb an appeal tram a decision
ot the magistrate or the juvenile court may
be taken? Second, te what tribunal will such
an appeal bc taken in the province of Quebec?
It would appear that this amendment, like
others, was drafted by officers conversant with
the cemmon iaw but ignorant of the organizatien et tribunais in our province. We have
ne "Suprerne Court" in tic province et
Quebea. Where xviii the appeal be Iodgcd.
1 think the bill should stand until we
have some expianatien on these points.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I arn net in a
position te enter inte a discussion et the matter wiich my boneurable friend ias-very
proeriy-brought forward. I have cxplaincd
the ebjeet et the bill as clcarly as I can. I arn
,content that the information my henourable

Howevcr, in view ef the points te whici hie
bas rcfcrred, it migit be desirabie te send the
bill te a standing committee, which ceuid deal
with ail phases et tic questions hie has suggcsted. I amn prepared te follow wiatever
course is régarded as desirable.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do nlot know of
any reason why it should flot go te committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the bill
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications.
H1e said: The reason I suggest this coinmittee is that it is to meet tomerrew morning.
It has a large membership, including most
members of the Senate. If honourable members prefer that the bill be sent te the Coinmittee on Banking and Commerce, or to some
other cemmittee, I have no objection; 1 am in
the hands of the Senate. In the past wc have
been pretty frec when cheosing committees
to which te refer bis.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I suggest the Banking and Commerce Committee.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My oniy objeet
in propesing that the bill be referred to the
Committee on Transport and Communications
was that I thougbt it might convenience bionourabie senators not to bave two committees
meeting tomorrow merning.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: There is ne special
hurry. Why sheuld this bill net stand over
until after the expectcd recess? Then we
could give it a littie more study than wouid
be possible tomerrow meorning, wh.en the
Committee on Transport and Communications
wvii1 bave two or thrcc bis before it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I arn quite wiihing
te adopt the suggestion of my honourable
friend.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Stand.

Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Is there any speciai
urgency for passing this bill?

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: With the consent
of the Senate, I will witbdraw my motion and
move that the bill be refcrred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Bes that mean that
there will be a meeting of the Banking and
Commerce Committce tomorrow rnerning?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It is my distinct
understanding that there is no urgency se far
as this bill is conccrned; and unless an urgency
se far undisclosed sbould appear. I weuid suggcst that consideratien of the matter by the
committee stand until after the adjournment.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Net se far as I
knew.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Tien wiy sheuld it

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, this

on law practice and procedure, to which we
could refer bis such as thiýs. I amrn ot moving

COMMONS

AMENDMENTS

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senators, a message bas been received from the
House of Commons ta return BUI H1, an, Act ta,
incorporate Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway Company, and ta acquainit the
Senate that they have passed the said bill
with severa1 amendments, ta whieb they desire
the concurrence of the Senate.
When shall these amendxnents be taken into
consideration?
Hon. ELIE BEAUREGARD: With leave
of the Senate, niow.
Honourable senatars, I move concurrence in
these ameadments.
1 arn informed by the
attorney for the promaters that tbey are
willing ta accept the bill as 110W amended.
Though possibly I do not know much more
about the bill than any other senator, while
1 amn on my feet I might acquaint the bouse
with the substance of these amendments and
tbe reasons therefor.

It will be recalled that the bill empowers
the promoters ta incorporate the Quebec North
Shore and Labrador Railway Company. The
main powers are ta construct a railway, but
there are a certain number of ancillary powers
attached. It is on these ancillary powers that
the amiendments bear.
For instance, section Il provides:
Subjeet to the provisions of section 368 of the
Railway Act, the company shall have power ta
generate, acquire, use, transmit and distribute
electrie and other power or energyThen follow these words, which by amendment are deleted:
-and for the purposes of such generation, acquisition, use, transmission and distribution may
construet, acquire, operate and mnaintain ]ines
for the conveyance of Iight, heat, power and
electricity.
I arn told that the purpose of this deletion
is ta limit the powers of the company ta
those specifically enumerated in section 368
of the Railway Act.
The next amendment is ta section 14, whereunder the company was authorized. ta enter
into certain agreements with municipahities
in the' locality. But as there are no municipalities in that northern part of Quebec,
the following words bave been added:
and/or the Department of 'Municipal Affairs
of the province of Quebec.
Section 15, wbich empowers the company
to operate a mator service for eollecting and
delivering freight, bas been amended by
deleting the words:
. . . but no rate or charge shahl be demanded
or taken until it bas ýbeen approved of by the
Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada,
who may also revise sucb rates and charges.
The following words bave been substituted:
Pravided however that the exercise of the
powers conferred on the campany hy this section shaIh be subject ta ail provincial and municipal enactments and the provincial regulations
of general application ta 'highways, the regulation of highway traffic, rates and charges, and
the operation of mator vehicles thereon.
This alsa is an amendment ta comply with
the existing laws of the province of Quebec.
The last amendment deletes the' original
section 16 and substitutes a redrafted section.
I amn told that this amendment was introduced
in another place by the Minister of Transport.
The section authorizes the company ta transport ail and gas by pipe line, and as amended
it is designed ta bring these operations more
clearly within the variaus sections of the
Railway Act than the ariginal section did.
The motion was agreed ta.

APPROPRIATION BILL No. 3

PRIVATE BILL

FIRST READING

REPORT OF OOMMITTEE

A message was received from. the House of
Commons with Bill 204, an Act for granting
tu His Mai esty certain sums of money for the
public service of the financial year ending
the 31st March, 1948.
The bil was read the first time.

Hon. A. B. COPP presented the report of
the Standing Committee on Transport and
Communications on Bill T5, an Act respecting the Ottawa Electric Railway Company.
H1e said: Honourable senators, the comnmittee have, in obedience to the order of
reference of April 24, 1947, examined the said
bill, and now beg leave to report the saine
without any amendment.

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, with leave I move the second reading of
the bill.
H1e said: Honourable senators will recaIl
that some time ago parliament approved
interimi supply in the amount of two-twelfths
of the estimates. On a theoretical apportionment of the expenses, this would ordinarily
cover the first two months of the fiscal year,
April and May. However, there are two factors
which prevent that. In the first place, some
of the expenditures do flot follow the exa.ct
arithmetical division of one-.twelfth for each
month. For instance, it is obvious that in the
early pjart of the year there are heavy expenses
on the legisiative programme. Secondly, there
are special expenditures, such as subsidies, on
account of which the payments are made in
the early part of the year instead of beinýg
spread evenly over twelve months. There is
still another factor. Ordinary interim supply
might flot become exhausted for another week
or so, but as Royal Assent bas been suggested
today in connection with other measures which
it is necessary to have passed, the government bas asked that at the same time assent be
given to supply to cover an additional period
of some thirty days.
This bill votes one-twelfth of the year's
estimates, together with somne specific items
more or less urgently needed for payment on
account of subsidies, including the subsidy on
fced and grain. If the house sees fit to give
second reading to the bill. sny detailed
expenditures may be discussed fromn time to,
time, or on the debate on the final supply bill.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, I
presume that any criticism we have to, offer
may be presented in the general debate on
supply.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second tîme.

COMMITTE

TNTERNAL

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the eighth report of the Standing Committee
on Internai Economy and Contingent Accounts.
Hon. GERALD

V. WHITE: Honourable

senators, I move concurrence in this report.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, until Iast evening I did not intend to
say anything on this matter. The report reads
as follows:
That the salary of Mr. Charles Roch Lamoureux, appointed hy Order in Cnuneil P.C . 180, of
January 14, 1947, to the position of Gentleman
Usher of the Black Rod, ýbe fixed at $4,140, plus
$600 living allowance, effective April 1, 1947.
The saiary mentioned in the report is the

highest in the range provided for the position
of Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod. In
other words, the commnittee proposed, by a
substantial majority, that the new Black Rod
should start, not at the bottom rung of the
salary ladder, but at the top, and that in addition bie sbould be paid an annual living ûllowance of $600.
I have notbing but respect and admiration
for wbat 1 understand, to be the, war record of
this distinguished employee of the Senate, but
it seems to me that we, are going a long way
when we disregard entirely the classifled rates
of pay for the position to which hie has been
appointed. The classified rates of pay, with
increases from year to year until the maaximum
is reachedý, were made up for the employees
of the various branches of the service. In the
reading room of the Senate there was one man
who for seven years did not get even tbe
increases in the classifled rates of pay. Why
lie did not receive them, I do not know, but
that is a sample of what we are doing, and I
think it is a grea.t mistake.

Tbe distinguished returned man was aýppointed to the office of Gentleman Usher of the
Black Rod by the cabinet. Had that body
flxed bis rate of pay I would not be on my
feet talking about it today. Tbey appointed
bim-in other words, pull and influence,
coupled witb a distinguished service record,
got this returned man what is being given to
him. There are tens of tbousands of other
ex-soldiers in Canada who will breathe a
breatb of communism wben tbey read what is
done for one man in disregard of the rigbts
of tens of tbousands of others. Honourable
senators, if we want-and 1 know we doto remove any of that kind of thougbt in the
case of this gentleman, instýead of giving bim
approximately $6,000 a year let us place bim
on a reasonably equal basis with other men.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: May I ask my bonourable friend a question? He bas just suggested
that the new incumbent of the office will be
entitled to a salary of about $6,000. Upon
what basis?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Tbe approxim&te
amount is $6,000 a year. As we flgured out
the salary yesterday in a lengtby and earnest
discussion in the cornmittee, it is $5,540. I am
open to correction as to wbetber tbat includes
aIl the rnoney wbich would come from. the

government to tbis distinguisbed soldier.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: The amount was four
tbousand seven bundred and some dollars.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I know, but I am
talking about the amount of money wbicb
this official as a returned man will secure from
the government of Canada.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: 1 do not tbink tbat bis
milita.ry pension sbould en-ter into tbe question
at al].
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Well, the bonourable senator is entitled to tbat view. I bold
the view, which I shaîl elaborate in a moment,
that wbat is to be considered is the total
amount whicb is received by a returned man
from the federal government.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYiNE: No.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I bave in my hand
a file of papers whicb deals witb another
matter. It came to, me last evening, before
I had intended to speak on this motion. The
file ifefers to a widow in Manitoba who. gave
four sons to tbe armed forces and lost one of
tbem in 1942.
H on. Mr. MORAIYD: On a point of order:

what we are discussing is a report recommending a salary for one of our officers. I do not
sc wbat the case of a widow in Manitoba bas
to do witb it.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: 1 arn discussing the
question.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: And I arn raising a
point of order, if my bonourable friend will
resume his seat, for a minute.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock)
is discussing a, report on a matter of salary.
It is not reasonable to introduce a Manitoba
case into the discussion. I trust my honourable friend will confine his rensarks to the
subject before us.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Well, I realize, Your
Honour, that your rnost insistent and distinct
backing-up of this matter for over a yearSome Hon. SENATORS: Order!
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:-and the fact that
you took up probably more of the time of the
cornmittee than any other memberHon. Mr. VIEN: Honourable senators, I
risc to a point of ordir. A reflection on the
honour and dignity of the Speaker of this
House is a matter whicb affects every member,
because the Speaker embodies the honour and
dignity of the Senate. It is out of order, and
most undignified, for any honourable senator
to suggest that a ruling made by the Chair is
directed by an opinion whicli His Honour the
Speaker may have entertained when sitting as
a member of a comrnittee. Therefore, Mr.
Speaker, I maise a point of order, and ask that
the bonourable gentleman be requested te
witbdraw his remark.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I will do so, Mr.
Speaker. Ail I would like to do, if you will
permit me, is to draw a comparison between
the case of thle four sons of a widowSome Hon. SENATORS: Order.

Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Order. I again suggest tbat this matter bas been decided by the
Speaker on a point of order, and I do not sec
what the case of the sons of a widow in Manitoba bas to do with the report before us.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is a splendid
argument. 1 know of nothin-g wbich wil do
more than the henourable senator's statemnent
to spread communism in this Canada of ours,
tbe statement that we cannot discussThe Hoýn. the SPEAKER: Order. My honourabýle friend knows the mules. 11e bas been
a member-a distinguished member-of this
parliament for many years, and be knows that

on a motion of this kind be is flot permitted
te go afield as he bas donc. The question
relates to, the salary of an officer of this bouse,
and I ask him to confine bis remarks to that
matter.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Your Honour, I
know, from the experience of seventeen years,
that neyer before bas a question of tbis kind
been raised to prevent a senator from drawing
a reasonable comparisen. But if you and
others say tbat àt cannot be donc now, all

far from it. I bave asked bim to confine bais
i-cmarks to tbe matter before the bouý,e.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Well, if we cannot
talk about the widow and her four sons overseas, we will talk about this. I tbink that wve
are making a serious mistake. Distinguisbed
senators, some of wbom are prolific in criticîisn of attempts to bring out the facts, are
the first to express concern at the onrush of
communism among our people. What was
donc yesterday by a substantial vote of the
committee will do mucb, in my humble judgment, to encourage tbat movement. If I may
be pardoned for saying so, I believe I bave
more îigbt tban many distinguisbed ladies
and gentlemen bere assembled to speak about
the rigbts of the ordinary underpaid and
iînderprivileged Canadian, and I say that to
release tbis particular man-wbom I bonour
and admire-wholly from the wages regulations of this government and put bim on a

$6,000 in- goveroment money for the rest of

MAY 14, 1947
draw a comparison between what the comnmittee did yesterday and you are doing now,
and the treatment of tbis widow and ber.
family, who, because they were Conservatives,
were given no consideration.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable senator bas rights, but bie is flot entitled
to abuse tbem. Has bie finisbed?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes. 1 cannot say
wbat I have to say, so I arn through.
Tbe Hon. the SPEAKER left the Cbair.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN, P.C., in the Chair.
Hon. J. H. KING (Speaker): As tbis is a
matter in wbjcba an important officer of the
Senate is the subject 'of tbe remarks of the
bonourable senator wbo has just spoken,
I, as Speaker of the Senate, feel it is incurnbent upon me to endeavour to clarify tbe
situation.
Tbe office of Gentleman Usher of tbe Black
Rod is an old and distinguisbed one, establisbed at the time of Confederation. In 1923
it was decided that appointment to tbe office
sbould be made by tbe Governor in Council,
and that bas heen tbe practice ever since.
The salary at that time-twenty-four years
ago-was fixed at a certain figure. When tbis
new appointment was made, ia view of tbe
increase in tbe cost of living during the last
twenty-four years, and considering the salary
tbat tbe bolder of this office in the Senate
would require in order to maintain himself,
it seemed to me only rea.sonable tbat bie, an
officer appointed by tbe Crown, sbould bave
tbe saine consideration as bas been given to
members cf the Civil Service tbroughout
Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. KING: lJuring tbe war tbe
government from time to time granted civil
servants cost of living bonuses, whicb bave
been absorbed into tbeir salaries. And fromn
time to time since 1923 the goverament bas
increased civil service salaries. Anyone wbo
compares tbe salaries paid to civil servants in
1923 with tbose paid today will, I think, agree
tbat it was only fair that tbe committee should
bring in the report tbat is now before us. Tbe
salary recommended is not, as my bonourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Murdock) would try to
imply, some six or seven tbousand dollars.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: 1 said, six thousand
dollars. Do flot put "seven tbousand dollars"
in my moutb.
Hon. Mr. KING- Previous to the fire that
destroyed the old Parliament Buildings, tbe
Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod was fur83168--23 j

nisbed with living quarters in the building,
witb free rent, lîght and heat. Now an allowance of $600 is made to bim in lieu of that
accommodation. The salary itself is $4,140.
I ba-ve no desire to prolong the discussion.
It is witbin tbe right of the Senate to fix this
salary, and coisiderîng tbe changes tbat bave
takenl place in tbe value of mbney since 1923,
I tbink we sbould be justified in adopting
tbe committee's report.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
The Hon. the SPEAKER resumed the
Chair.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: Honouirable senators, as
Cbairman of the Interni Economy Coinmittee I feel I should say a word with regard
to this matter. The honourable gentleman
from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Mýurdock) bas suggested that the salary to be paid to this distinguishaed soldier will be criticized generally
tbroughout the country by returned men,.
Hon Mr. MURDOCK: If they know about
it.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: Having seen some service myself and baving been associated with
ex-service men for a number of years, I feel
that it will be regarded with a great deal of
pleasure by returned men throughout Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: Reference has been
made to the fact an officialinl the reading
room did not receive an aniual increase for a
period of some seven years. I thînk my lionourable friend knows that a certain member
of the staff did not wisb to become a permanent officer, andl that that is why ho was
not paid the maximum salary of hais position.
I do not think there is anything further I
need to add. Yesterday the committee by a
'large mai ority decided on the action which
has been taken.

MILK PRICES
DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate rosumed from Tuesday, May 6,
the debate on the motion of Hlon. Mr.
Murdock:
That the Senate instruct the Naturai Resources Committee to ascertain by officiai inquiry hoiv mucli milk producing farmers of
Canada secure for their niik product less than
five cents a quart, and to also inquire how much
the milk coliectors and distributors of Canada
secure for milk collectieg and distributieg at
better than ten cents a quart.
Hou. J. W. de B. FARRIS: Honourabie
senators, with the permission of the bouse I
should like to discuss briefly this resolution
and some of the arguments that have
been advanced here in connection with it. As
I arn going to give some figures and talk as if
I knew something about the milk business,
perhaps 1 mighit oxplain why it happens that
I tako more than an ordinary interest in this
resolution. It se happons that my son is in
the dairy business and is a member of the
National Dairy Council of Canada. I hope
that dees net disqualify me. Hewever, if any
honourabie sena tors wisli to, discount my
remarks for that reason, it is only fair that
they should have the opportunit v. On tho
other hand, it may indicate why I have foiiowod this debate with some particular interest,
and also why I have a background of some
knowiedge, about matters that have been
discussed.
I sbouid first ask the bouse to consider this
resolution in the light of its peculiar wording.
Honourabie members wiil notice that the
Sonate is asked to instruct the National
Resources Committee to do two very limited
things: "to ascertain by officiai inquiry how
inuch the miik producing farmers secure for
their miik product"-but it doos not stop
there-"Iess than five cents a quart, and to
aiso inquire how much the miik coilectors
and distributors of Canada securo for miik
coiiocting and distributing"-but it doos net
stop there "at better than ton cents a quart."
Se if this committee proceeded te act and
found that the farmer get a fraction of a cent
more than five cents a quart and that the
coloctor and distributor received a fraction
less than ten cents a quart, the whole inquiry
would fait fiat. I mention that fact, net to ho
technicai, tbough it often happons that when
a iawyer cails attention to something it is
refcrred te as a iegai technicality. I submit

it is fair te say that there is no0 technicality

in wbat I arn sayîng, but that there is an
ingenious technicalitY in the drawing of the
resoltîtion and it seems to ho a caicuiated on1e.
I can 500 nothing in this resoiution, except
that invoived in its wording are two insinuations. First, that the dairy farmer is getting
for his miik less than five cents a quart eut of
the fifteen cents which the consumer in this
cemmunity is at prosont paying, whiie the
distributor-the dairy-is getting more than
ton cents.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: That is flot se.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I quite agree with my
honourable friend that this is not se, and I
wish te offer some detaiis te show why it is
net se.
With respect, I say quito seriously that it
ta uinfair that a resetutien with insinuations
of that, nature shouid appear on the records
of this bouse frein day te day, and 1 hope
that when the debate is over tenight it
xvili have appeared there for the last timo.
I iistencd with interost te and read with
c.are the rather iimitod arguments advancod
in support of this resolution. May 1 assemble
the rcasons whîy I think that if shouid ho
defoatcd? I wish te place on the record seme
information for the benefit of honourabie
mnembers and, I hope, for the bonefit of the
public generally, as a report of aur proeedings
may appcar in the newspapers.
But first I tako objection te the very
rcstrîcted wording of the reselution, because
this leaves the impression that the reselution
wvas nover intonded te bc taken seriousiy.
Secondiy, I eaul attention te the statement
of the honourabie senator from South Bruce
(Hon. Mr. Dennelly), Chairman of the Standing Committee on Naturai Rosourcea.
Tise
resolution proposes te instruet him and bis
committee-and on asking I bave just learned
they were nover consuited before the proposai
was made-te hoid an officiai inquiry. This is
one0 of the standing committees of the Sonate,
and we are entit]ed te start with the assumptien that it always is wiiling te do its duty,
and that it roquiros ne instructions unless
somo spociai occasion arises. I should think
that in viow of the chairman's oxporionco in
and knowi'dge of dairy mattors it would
hardiy bo in kecping with the wvay of thinga
ie the Sonate for him te ho given instructions
eut of the blue in the wording of this
resolution.
1 tbink honourable sonaters might weii ho
impressed with the statement made by the
chairman of this cemmittoo, in view of bis
spociai qualifications-ho having been thirtyfour years in this Sonate, and engaged in the

JUNE 3, 1947
livestock business in this province of Ontario
for many years. I call to your attention some
of the reasons which he advanced to this
house. He pointed out that the Honourable
Mr. Justice Dalton C. Wells, of the Supreme
Court of Ontario, was appointed last fall by
the Government of Ontario to hold a public
inquiry in regard to the milk business in that
province. That appointment was made in
October,- and I secured a copy of Mr. Justice
Wells' commission of the first day of October
last. He is appointed a commissioner "to
inquire into and report upon (1) the producing, processing, distributing, transporting and
marketing of milk, including whole milk and
such products of milk as are supplied,
processed, distributed or sold in any form;
the costs, prices, price spreads, trade practices,
methods of financing; the management, grading policies, and other matters relating to any
of them, but not so as to restrict the generality
of the foregoing; (2) the scheme contemplated
by the provisions of the Milk Act, Revised
Statutes of Ontario, 1937, and the administration thereof by the Milk Control Board." I
have read that in detail, not to take up the
time of this house, but to ask honourable
senators to contrast the comprehensive wording
of that direction to a judge of the Supreme
Court of Ontario with the peculiar and
restricted sort of wording in the resolution
before us.
I understand that the learned judge has
been performing the duties of the inquiry since
last October, that he is now preparing his
report, and that very shortly that report will
be given to the people of Ontario and of the
Dominion of Canada. In view of those
comprehensive instructions given- to a judge
to make inquiries in Ontario, it seems to me
that for the Senate now to instruct a committee to go through the motions of making
an inquiry at this time, would be to make
ourselves ridiculous.
My honourable friend who moved this resolution (Hon. Mr. Murdock) will doubtless say,
"Oh, but the inquiry by the judge applies
'only to the province of Ontario". That is true,
but I would point out that the instances
which my honourable friend gave in his speech
to support his argument were drawn entirely
from Ontario. I point out also that, by and
large, conditions in the dairy farming business,
in the dairy business and in relation to the
distribution of milk are not very different in
that province from those in the other provinces, and we may assume that when the
present comprehensive investigation has been
completed and a full report is made, the information then given will be far more valuable

than any which could possibly be secured
by this committee in the short time at its
disposal.
The inquiry of Mr. Justice Wells, in connection with the province of Ontario alone,
has been in effect since last October. I take
the proposal to be that the Senate committee
investigate into all the provinces of Canada.
But how long is this session going to last?
Perhaps six or seven weeks, at the outside;
so honourable senators can see how futile
this kind of proposal is. Let me also point
out that the commission to Mr. Justice Wells
says that be is to report. To whom is he to
report? To the government of the Province
of Ontario. What has the government of
Ontario to do with the matter? The Ontario
government has everything to do with it, in so
far as it concerns that province itself. The
production, distribution, and pasteurization of
milk, and all the processes of dairy farming
are a matter of property and civil rights, and
as such are exclusively within provincial jurisdiction.
My honourable friend from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock) says, "I have jurisdiction to
discuss this question here because of the subsidies we have paid and because of baby
bonuses." Well, I do not dispute that techni
cally we have that kind of collateral interest
in this question. But the subsidies have been
discontinued, and no one seriously suggests-.
I do not think even my honourable friend
seriously suggests-that the baby bonuses may
be withdrawn as a resuit of any inquiry in
this house within the next six weeks. However,
the constructive power to deal with the milk
business and make changes in it, if any are
found to be necessary after Mr. Justice Wells
makes his report, is in the members of the
provincial government.
May I remind honourable senators that in
every province of Canada today there is a
Milk Board, appointed by the provincial government. In British Columbia the Milk Board
was established under the Public Utilities
Act. There, as I think in a number of the
provinces, milk is expressly decIared to be
a public utility. Today I looked up the Milk
Regulations Act, Chapter 76 of the Revised
Statutes of Ontario, and found that very wide
power is given to the Milk Board in that
province. Among its powers is that of
co-operating or collaborating with farmers
and dairymen in assenting to agreements to
fix prices of milk to retailers and distributors.
The milk business is so hedged in and surrounded by provincial and municipal control,
by regulations of milk boards in every province, by provisions in the Criminal Code
about the purity of food and all that sort of

SENATE

tbing, that it is probably subi ect to more
supervision, direction and regulation than
any other industry of a private nature in the
entire dominion.
Honourable senators, for these reasons 1
suggest that this resolution is ill-timed, and
I
should flot be given serious consideration.
want to go further than that: I say that the
resolution itself bas Ieft a rather unpleasant
insinuation, coming froma a body such as the
Senate of Canada, and appearing day after
day on the records of this bouse; and it is
only fair that some analysis sbould be made
of the actual situation and the figures placed
on record.
What are the complaints? The first comnplaint, as 1 read this resolution a'ad the discussion, is that the farmer gets too littie. If
the resolution is looked at caref'dlly it seems
to bc directed mostly at fluid milk, and
particularly at the fifteen cents which the
consumer pays for it. It is said that the
farmer gets too littie and the consumer pays
too much, while the collector distributor-as
the middleman is called-gets too mucb out
of the fifteen cents wbich the consumer pays.
Thiere is some confusion in the minds of
marîy people, which I think is partly due to
misunderstanding about the different uses
of milk, the different markets, and the various
prices that are paid in those markets. 1 wish
to make this point clear. In the first place,
there is the fluid market sometimes called the
city market. Every bouseholder knows about
that when hie sees one, two or three botties
of milk left on bis back doorstep daily by
the milkman. Another market, and, generally
speaking, one operated by an entirely different
organization or group of organizations is the
manufactured milk market. There are two
or three divisions included in that. There is
the sale of milk to the manufacturer of
evaporated milk, condensed milk, powdered
milk, and other commodities of that kind
which arc sold in grocery stores. Then, a
considerable quantity of milk is used in the
making cf cheese, and for tbis purpose, the
farmer selîs either bis milk or cream to the
cheese factory.
Other large purchasers of
milk are the creameries that make butter.
As I understand it, in this case the farmer
usually seils bis cream to the creamery and
keeps bis skimmed milk for use in one form
or another on bis farm.
So there are two distinct markets: the fluid
market, and tbe manufactured market, witb its
different branches. The important fact to bear
in mind is that there is a fundamental difference between the price on the fluid market and
that on the mantufactured market. The farmer

receives a much lower price on the manufactured market than on the fluid market. The
purcbaser pays more per pound of butter fat
for fluid mi]k than for milk tbat is to be used in
a manufactured product. The reason is that
the fluid market is a local market, in whieh the
commodity bas to be supplied at once. It is
a fresh milk market, and the milk must get
to the consumer on the very day or the next
day after it is given from the cow, whereas
in the manufactured market it does flot need
10 reach the consumer for an indefinite period.
In addition, the manufactured market is not
restricted to any particular city. Milk supplied
by farmers to an Ottawa dairy lias to be sold
in Ottawa, and the householder must have it
the day following ils production or the next
day; but inilk that is made mbt butter may
net reacli the consumer for some considerable
lime. Al:o, butter is sold over a ivider territor 'y and competition is keen; and as to cheese,
the market, is practically world-wide.
Many bonourable members know that
throughout Canada today the price on the
fluid market is fixed by milk boards set up
by the various provinces. As it applies to
Ontario there must be socne reservaltions to
the statement which I make, because I understand that the question bas been raised in the
courts as te the jurisdiction cf the Ontario
Milk Board in the fixing of milk prices. That
question is now being considered by Mr. Justice Wells, and as a result tbe Province of
Ontario will doubtless, in ils wisdom, decide
te make the powers cf the board clear. It
may restriet them. 1 know Ibat in British
Columbia the milk board fixes the price of
fluid milk both 10 the farmer and to the
distributor.
A further reason why tlie farmer is entitled
to a higher price on the fluid market than on
any other market is that he bas ta mainlain
a more or less constant supply. During seasons
of the year when the cattle are eut on the
grass, or when calves are born,, lots cf milk
is availa-ble; in utber periods if tbe fariner
does not bave the proper arrangement there
is practically no milk. This situation does not
affect tbe farmer who salIs te the creamery
or eheese factory. It is very important Ibat
the bousebolder get a uniform supply cf milk.
Milk is delivered to bis back doorstep. and
ha accapts it with tha sama degrea of cartainty as hie does 'bis morning newspaperas a matter of course. But much planning
and work are required in ordar to maintain
tbis service cf supplyîng tha bouseholder ragularly witb fresb milk Ibat is safa and sanitary.
A furtbar tbought to be borne in mind when
objection is taken to the amount tha distributor is receiving, is tha essential differenca

JUNE 3, 1947
between the milk in the can as it appears in
front of the farm, and that in the bottle on
your back doorstep ready for use. In his
motion the honourable gentleman from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) refers to the collection and distribution of milk as though that
were all that had to be done. That is not
so. The milk bas to be collected, tested and
pasteurized. Pasteurization is a scientific process, and if the dairyman is to do it economically and make anything at all out of it
he must have up-to-date and expensive machinery, horses, trucks, bottles and bottling processes, and everything that goes to make up
and facilitate the distribution of the product
and give what I say is-and I put myself
within the judgment of every member of the
house-a first-class service rendered by a
Canadian industry to the consumers of fluid
milk across Canada.
Now, what about the profits that are made
in the handling of milk? How long would it
take the committee, if it really had someone
to tell the facts, to decide that question? The
committee would in fifteen minutes ascertain
that in so far as the fluid market is concerned
the farmer gets far more than five cents a
quart and the dairyman gets far less than ten
cents. Once that was learned, the whole
inquiry would go flop. I have here figures
which I accept as being absolutely accurate
as to the price in Ontario. It does not differ
substantially in other provinces. My honourable friend from Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne)
said on a previous occasion that the price in
Ontario was $3.30 per hundred pounds.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: No. I said the
price was $3.30 per hundred pounds in the
province of Quebec, and $3.45 in the province
of Ontario.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The price is $3.35 per
hundred pounds in this part of Ontario for
3-4 butterfat. That price gives to the farmer
8-6 cents a quart-the price paid by the
consumer being 15 cents a quart at the
present time-and leaves for the dairyman
not "better than ten cents," but 6-4 cents
per quart. Those are the figures: the distributor who performs all the services I have
described gets 6-4 cents while the farmer
producer gets 8-6 cents.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: That is after the
removal of the subsidy?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That is at the present
time.
My honourable friend from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) bas raised the question of
subsidies. I had it on my notes to deal with
this later, but I will refer to it now. There

361

were two subsidies paid by the Dominion
government. A subsidy of two cents a quart
was to enable the price to the consumer to
be kept down. That was paid to the dairies,
not for their benefit, but in order that the
price to the consumer would be less by two
cents; I understand it had relation to the
whole question of inflation. Then there was a
subsidy paid to the farmers of 55 cents a
hundred pounds, which comes to 1½ cents a
quart. Both subsidies have been removed,
and the price of milk in this part of OntarioI think it is uniform all over the provincebas been increased three cents, most of which
bas gone to the farmer. A small fraction of
the three cents goes to the dairy distributor,
but not by any means enough, I am informed
by those who know and on whose advice I
rely, to offset the immediate additional
expenses in connection with the distribution
of milk. So the higher price is not for the
benefit of the distributor nor does it inure to
his benefit, but is in lieu of the subsidy which
heretofore came out of the pockets of the
people of Canada generally. Keep that in
mind, honourable senators, because the mere
fact that you are paying more for your milk,
if unexplained and coupled with the kind of
information which bas been put on the record,
might suggest the comment, "Oh, these fellows are getting something which they are not
entitled to." That is not so.
Now let us look at the matter from the
standpoint of the profits which the dairy
distributors are getting. Information on this
subject is not easy to obtain, but I have had
access to a brief which was submitted to
Mr. Justice Wells by one of the largest
operating concerns of its kind in Canada,
whose economy of operation is, I am sure, as
good as that of any of its competitors, and
whose managers and officials are experienced
in the business and can give the best service
in the way of economic operation, not only
to people of the country but to themselves.
The figures they present, mark you, were put
down in black and white and submitted to
Mr. Justice Wells; and they would not be
so foolish as to present before a commission
of inquiry figures that could not stand investigation. What do we find? On each quart
of milk supplied to a household, this particular
dairy gets a profit of fourteen-hundredths of
one cent, or practically one-seventh of a cent.
I suppose that a great many householders
have one quart of milk put on their doorstep
each day. For the service of transporting by
trucks a bottle of milk every day for seven
days, rain or shine-milk which bas been
inspected, tested, pasteurized, bottled and

83168-24

SENATE

capped-this dairy would receive a profit of
one cent. It makes one cent on seven quarts,
delivered one quart a day.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Net?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS:
Net. Let us now
consider the manufactured market, which,
thcugh it seems to have been only incidentally
drawn into this resolution, is related to it;
and properly to understand what is going on,
honourable senators and the public should
have an appreciation of the different circumstances. The manufactured product has not
been subject to the same provincial control
as the fluid market. The export market, of
course, is outside provincial jurisdiction; and
during the war both maximum and minimum
prices of cheese were fixed by the dominion
government. That regulation, I understand,
is about to be withdrawn. In respect of butter
a maximum price, or, as it is called, a ceiling,
but not a floor, was fixed by the dominion
government. In this field the farmer gets
substantially less for lis milk, on the basis
of butter fat, than he does in the fluid market.
Also the dairy distributor does not receive
the same price on the sale of butter or cheese
as he does on the sale of fluid imilk. I have
checked the figures supplied by this same
leading industry in Canada which, besides
being in the milk business, carries on a cheese
factory entirely separate from its dairy branch,
so that the figures on operations are wholly
distinct, and I find that the profit per quart
of milk used in cheese production is alnost
exactly the same as the profit per quart in
the fluid field; that is, about one-seventh
of a cent for each quart of milk handled. So
the difference in the price the farmer gets is
correspondingly reflected in the price received
by the manufacturer. In the light of these
figures I believe honourable senators will see
how futile would be an inquiry based on
the wording of the resolution, and how unfair
that wording is in its implications.
Other charges are made against the dairies,
and they are so different as to befunny. One
charge is that of uneconomie operation, that
these various dairies are running around the
same routes, in the same blocks, wasting time
and gasoline and tires and everything else,
and that this ought to be stopped. The other
-the
opposite-criticism is made that this
business is a monopoly, or, as an honourable
senator across the floor said the other day, a
cartel. Well, it is hard to figure out how it
can be both these things. Let us see if it is
either.
In the past we have had in some places too
many dairies carrying uneconomie loads. My
honourable friend from Rings (Hon. Mr.

McDonald), told me that when he took over
the portfolio of Minister of Agriculture in
Nova Scotia there was a large number of
dairies, too many altogether-I have forgotten
the figures, and perhaps my honourable friend
would state how many there were-but during
his regime conditions were so changed that
the needless going over of the same ground
was eut out. But after all, honourable senators, action of this kind should be kept within
reasonable limits. I was told today that,
generally speaking, in the cities each dairy
sends out a full load. If every truck contains
as much milk as it can carry, there is not
much economic waste in the distribution. Even
though some trips might be shortened a little
by strict concentration, all the difference it
would make would be so small as to be hardly
material. After all, we have net yet got to the
stage where we can regulate just how many
newspapers there should be, or how manyHon. Mr. LESAGE:

Radio stations.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: -or how many lawyers,
and so on. There is always a necessary margin
of competition in order to carry on this
business.
Another and I think a more serious reflection
came from an honourable gentleman who
suggested he suspected there was a cartel. I
puzzled over that. First I looked in a dictionary to find out what a cartel was. The Oxford
dictionary said it meant an exchange of
prisoners, but that did net scem to throw
much light on the subject, because I knew
that my honourable friend had a meaning a
little more direct than that. I imagine that
what he means, loosely speaking-and I do
not use that word in a wrong sense at allis that he suspected there was some form of
monopoly. But where and how could the
monopoly come in? That is what puzzles me.
As I have already said, there is a Milk Board
in every province of Canada. The last board
in British Columbia, appointed only a couple
of years ago, was put under the Public Utilities Act. When you examine this monopoly
question you find that there are about two
thousand outstanding dairies in Canada. That
is a long way from, a monopoly. In addition
there are perhaps another thousand smaller
dairies; and there are also the co-operatives.
Honourable senators will pardon me for
referring to British Columbia more than elsewhere, but I do s beceause I know more about
matters in that province. In Vancouver we
have a dairy under the control of the Vancouver Milk Producers Association.
That
association is a co-operative association of
farmers in the lower Fraser Valley, from which

JUNE 3, 1947
source cornes rnostly ail the milk used in and
around the city of Vancouver. I ar n ft
exactly sure 'how rnuch rnilk that organization
handies, but it certainly is fifty per cent of
the milk distributed in Vancouver. It is
entirely a farmers' co-operative organization.
Ail the rnilk is distribut-ed frorn the same diairy,
and the farrners are paid on a cornron
settling price on a co-operative basis. That
cou]d nlot possibly be a rnonopoly, for they
are in competition with the private dairies.
The saine thing is true elsewhere. 1 arn told
that in the city of Ottawa there are about
four main dainies, several arnaller ones, and a
number of farrner producers' dainies. Tbey
have a common pasteurizing plant, at which
ail the farmers in the co-operatives have their
niilk processed,, and then they distribute it to
their custorners throughout the city.
As, long as that is going on and as long as
you have this industry under the control of
the provincial government and the munîcipalities--the industry is subject to innumerable regulations in the municipalities--it is
impossible to say that there is existing a
cartel or a monopoly to the detrirnent of the
comrnunity. Under the direction and supervision of the governrnent there is an orderly
conducted business. As an instance of supervision of the industry in Ontario, I point to
the fact that today you cannot operate a distribu ting dairy unless you get a licence frorn
the Milk Board of the province. In order to
do this you mnust satisfy the board that the new
dairy wiil operate in the interests of the
public. You have also to satisfy it that the
new dairy's equipment, organization, and
everything else is such that if it goes into the
business it will do so as an honest public service, and that it wili flot be a menace, to the
health and welfare of the cornrunity. I say
that in these circurnstances you have in this
business an orderly regulation, resulting not
from a rnonopoly, but froma government
supervision. There is co-operation between the
producers and the distnibutors, because it is
the duty of the chairman of the board to consuIt with the producers and the distributor8
as to a fair price, and when they reach an
agreement and the price is O.Kd. by the Milk
Board it becornes binding.
In these circumstances, honourable senators,
I subinit that there is nothing of a disturbing
nature in this well-conducted business. There
is nothing that savours of injustice either to
the farmers or to the consurners. Lastly, I
suggest that there are many things within the
immediate supervision of the Dominion
Governhment-not of the provinces-that
might well occupy the attention of the Senate
83168--24J

363

rather than this side-door entrance into a
business that, is being se well conducted by
aIl the provinces of Canada.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: May I ask the
honourable senator a questionY I arn wondering if I got hîs figures correctly. He said the
distributor makes one-seventh of a cent per
bottle, or one cent per custorner per bottle
of milc for seven days. In the city of Toronto
we have a population of about 650,000 people;
and on the basis of five people to the family,
that is about 130,000 families. Therefore, if
I understand the honourable senator's figures
correctly, it would mean a net profit of $1,300.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: 1 do not think my
honourable friend got my figures rightly. What
I said was that the profit was one-seventh of
one cent a quart, and that if you delivered
to the custorner a bottle of rnilk each day for
seven days you would get a profit of one cent.
Hon. Mr. ROEBIJCK: 1 think I have that
righ't. I rnult.iplied that by 130,000 families.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: What is my honourable
friend's question?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I want to know if I
arn right in my understanding of your figures:
that 130,000 families in the city of Toronto
would give a net profit of $1,300.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I did not offer any
figures like that.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Question.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: May I asic the honourable senator a quesition. I think it bas
some bearing on the price of five cents thai
was quoted in the resolution. Taking into
consideration the two subsidies that were paid,
what did the creamery really pay the fariner
for his rnilk?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The simplest way te
get At that is te consider the present tirne,
when there are no subsidies. He got 8-6
cents per quart.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: But he raised the price.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The increase in price
only offsets what was being paid by the dominion to the fariner in subsidies.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I think rny honourable
friend wild agree that both subsidies"were paid
through the dairy and there was no rnoney
paid directly te the fariner.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Both subsidies camne
to the dairy.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: It may corne through
thein, but it was paid directly to the fariner.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Originally the subsidy
was only paid in congested areas, where the
milk was badly needed. Then the time came
when by reason of agitation the subsidy had
to be periodically extended. I do say that,
with subsidies, miýlk cost the dairy about five
cents.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: 1 gave the right figures.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN:
My honourable
friend'from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) ivili
corroborate my statement that the dainies in
Manitoba pay 511cents for milk. I have been
a seller of milk for a number of years.
Hon. Mn. KINLEY: So have 1.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That figure includes
the mantufactuned product.
Hon. Mr. HOWDEN: For contract milk
the farmer gets $2.25 a hundred, but for surplus milk over bis contract he gets much
less-a dollar a hundred.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: They will flot take
it at ail.

NATIONAL HOUSING BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. COPP moved the second reading
of Bill 176, an Act to amend the National
Housing Act, 1944.

He saidý: Honourable senators, the bonour-'
able member from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lamhert) has kindly consented to explain this
bill.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, this bill embodies eight amendments to the National Housing Act of 1944.
These are deemed necessary to enable the
administrators of the act to cope with the
changes in the building situation, which have
occurred during the past year.
The prices of houses to home owners and the
cost to bouse builders have increasedý very
materially even over the ]ast ten months, and
the changes which are registered in these proposed amendinents are due altogether to a
desire on the part of the Central Mortgage
and Housing Corporation to meet that condition.
These increased costs which have become
so noticeable during the past year have liad a
very definite influence in the decline of home
owne'rship and a proportionate increase in the
demand for rentai housing. As a matter of
fact, the amendments in this bill represent
an effort on the part of the government and
the administration of the Housing Act to
equalize the conditions of financing between
home-owner bousing and rentai housing in
such a way as at least, in so far as finance is
a factor in the matter, to tend to encourage
an incease ini.the number of bouses for rent.
Hitherto, the terms for loans on bome-owner
houses have been a little more favourahie than
for toan on rentai housing projects. By seeking to equatize the conditions applying to both
groups of undertakings and at the same tinie
make the terms even more generous than they
have heen before, the bill represents a serious
endeavour to meet an increasingly acute bousing situation in this country.
It should be empbasized here that the longtermi aim and policy of the Central Mortgage
and Housing Corporation-which fromn now on
I shahl refer to simply as "the Central Corporation"ý-is to encourage in every way an interest
in home ownership. That point of view,
despite what I have said, about the purport of
this bill, remains the permanent policy and
the avowed aim of the corporation. But as a
means3 to that end and in order to meet the
present increasing demand for rentai housing,
the emphasis at this time muet be placed upon
rentai housing construction.
As a background and to obtain a proper
perspective in approaching this subjçct it is
worth noting that the Central Corporation bas
evolved out of legisiation passed in 1935,

366

SENATE

known as the Dominion Housing Act, and
identified with the administration of the
ilunourable Charles Dunning. That act was
passed for the purpose of providing low cest
housing in urban communities. In 1938 the act
xvas repealed and replaced by the National
Housing Act, which included provision for
reconversion
operations, large-scale
rentai
housing and rural and suburban construction.
In 1944 the whole scope of the National
Housing Act was reorganized and divided into
five main parts, only two of which have as yet
been proclaimed and applied to ouir housing
situation. I understand that with the adoption of the preposed amendments a third part
of tlîat act, relating te rural housing, xvill be
proclaiîned.
ln 1945 the Central Mertgage and Housing
Corporation was set up tu adîuinister the
National Housing Act. During and immediately after the war two other separate bousîng agencies took form: the Wartime Housing
Corporation andi Hoiîsing Enterprises Limited.
T11e first of tliese wns a Crown company,
under the Department of Munitions and
Supply; the second, a private holding company, was formed wvitiî a view to giving private
enterprise an opportunity of cmbarking upon
(lie field of rentaI lîousing wilh the financial
sup)port of tlîe Central Coirporation. These two
organizations are now directly associated with
the Central Corporation, iinder the proxvisions
of. the National Housing Act, and properties
eonnected with their operations are subj ect te
transfer and sale under the juris-diction of the
Central Corporation. Clause 2 of the bill, a
purely teclînical amencîment, provîcles tlîat
titie te property inay bc aequired by legal
tiansfer rather thian by the cuinhersoine procedure of letters patent. Clause 1 also is a
tecirnical amendment to facihitate an important,
change provided for in clause 4, which deals
xvitb boans on owner-occupied liouses.
Clause 3 is an amendment to section 4 of
the act, enlarging its scope to apphy te owneroccupied duplex houses. At the present time
tlîis type of place is identified as a form. of
rentai housing. but the amendment wihl classify
such a structure under "home ownership".
This wilh enable, the builder to obtain a higher
ratio of boan to lending value than he bas
been able te de hitherto. The amendment is
applicable te conditions prevailing to a
greater extent in the province of Quebec than
anywhere elýse, owing te the existence there
cf a large so-called rentier class. The owner
lives on the greund floor cf a duplex or triplex
lieuse and rents the fleors above him; and I
behiex e that this ameodrnent is intreduced te
accemmodate dernands from this, may I say,
thrifty type of owner.

Clause 4, with which clause 1 is cennected,
amends section 4 of the act and provides fer
the financing cf an additional portion of the
down payýment on the part of a bouse ewner.
The means cf serving this end xvili be seen in
the provision for negotiation of a joint loan
fer a pîeried net in excess of thirty years from
the date cf cempletion cf the lieuse. Ninetyfive per cent cf the first $3,000 cf the lending
value cf the horise er any part thereef, eightyfive per' cent cf the amount ever $3,000 but
not in excess cf $6,000, and seventy per cent
of the aniount in excess cf $6.000, will be
guaranteed by the corporation.
Lt is aise proposed under this clause te
apply the increased ratio cf boan to lending
value onlv in cases determined by regulation
bx' the Governor in Ceuncil. To prevent an
obvionts inflationary trend as the result cf this
aînendment, the increased ratio will be applied
by regulation only to cases where control on
the sale priee te the home ewner can be exereîe;and tbis centrol is ,:ought through wbat
is ealled an integrated plan. Lt is centemplated throughi the exercise cf tlîat plan that
a huilder in agreement with the corporation
inay enter inte a contract under which he
îindertakes te sehl te a home ewner at a fixed
hirice. At the present time this fixed price is
roughlY 110 per cent cf the lending value on
tleclieuse. By way of example, on the basis
of $5,000 lending value, the sale price wouhd
he $5,500 and the down payment cf the home
owner xvould amouint te $950 rather than
$1,200, xvhicli is ccxv required.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Ilox is the lending
xaur arrivc d at?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I have a note here
on the ratios cf the lending value te, the price
oif the hem-e. xxhidi ratios the Central Coiporation bas fixeci after conferences with the
hending institutions.
I think that there is
u'ocm fotr a good de.il cf questiening and dis(ttr-sion on this point. At first. as my hioneurable friend (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) probably
knows, there was somne difflculty in persuading
lending institutions toecmbark upen longtermn bans on any form cf bouse building.
Tx' enty ycars xvas tîte longest terra that thcy
xveîe xxilling te consider. and even then in the
l)eginning it was enly on the basis cf txrc
ten--ear terins.
That basis cf financing,
lending and mertgaging bas been increased
te txventy-fix'e ye'ars xvhere zening areas have
heen
cpeah
onsidered by flic corporation.
The proposal ccxv, in order te reduce the down
pax-ment on home-exvncr housing and rentai
lîouîsing. is te extend the term te thirty years.

JUNE 4, 1947
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: That is not exactly
the point I was trying to get at. Ordinarily
the loan company will only lend up to fifty
per cent of the cost price or value of the
property. Now, what is the lending value?
It is what percentage of the cost of the building or the whole property?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The corporation is
now guaranteeing up to ninety-five per cent
of the lending value of the bouse. The
insurance companies or the mortgage companies supply the balance at a rate extending
now up to four and a half or five per cent.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: That does not
anwer my question.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: As I understand it,
the ratio of the lending value to the value
of the house is fixed by agreement between
the Central Corporation and the lending
institutions.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Then I' think it
should be defined in the act.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: It is not very clearly
defined in the act.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourable
senastor one question? If a lending institution-let us say it is the Canada Permanent
Mortgage Corporationr-incurs a loss, what
share of that loss. does the government absorb?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: It takes the loss.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The whole of it?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Yes, the whole of it.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: Oh, no, it does not.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I suggest that the
whole business problem as it relates to this bill
should be dealt with more minutely before
our Banking and Commerce Committee, and
I intend to move before I sit down that the
bill be referred to it. There we could have a
field-day of inquiry into the administration of
the National Housing Act, and with the help
of the minister and officials from the Central
Corporation we could at least get some perspective on the present situation as a whole.
In the past there has been a good deal of
scattered discussion in this chamber about
housing, rental controls and so on. I think
the bill presents us with an opportunity to go
into the subject thoroughly.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I hope my honourable
friend does not suggest that my speeches on
rental control were scattered.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I was not referring
to speeches made by the leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig). I said that there had been a good

deal of scattered discussion on the subpect.
My point is that the discussion has been spread
over a number of sessions. There have been
criticisms, which probably were well founded,
but I do not think the whole question has
been approached in a comprehensive manner.
It can be dealt with now, if my friend chooses,
but I suggest that if the bill were referred to
the Banking and Commerce Committee we
should have an opportunity of enlightening
ourselves, and others as well.
Clause 5 of the bill deals with rental bousing in the same way that clause 4 deals with
home-owner housing. This amendment affecting rental housing construction also provides
for an increased period of amortization up to
thirty' years, and has the same provision
for the prescribing of terms of limitation by
the Governor in Council as is contained in
clause 4. At the present time loans on rental
housing are limited to twenty years, except in
zoning areas where a period of twenty-five
years is permissible.
A question arises in connection with the
transferring of successful rental housing
projects into home-owner properties, as prices
and costs become favourable. At present,
those who undertook to engage in a homeowner plan find that because of the rise in
the price of houses their down payments are
inadequate, and for the time being their financial condition would favour renting instead of
purchasing. As the tenant's circumstances
improve, the prospect of becoming a house
owner becomes increasingly attractive.
Clause 6 of the bill introduces an entirely
new principle into the act, namely that of
acquiring vacant land to be used for the purpose of housing developments. In times past,
particularly in western Canada, with which
my honourable friend the leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig) is well acquainted, municipalities anxious to develop new areas would
service them with water, light and sidewalks,
and wait for builders to erect houses and sell
them to new residents. Today the municipalities will not do that, and the lending companies, supported by the Central Corporation,
are pleased to assume that kind of investment
in anticipation of mortgage loans to be placed
on residential buildings when erected. The
Central Corporation, under this amendment,
will guarantee to the lending companies 2 per
cent for five years on vacant lands acquired
for building purposes. The conditions under
which lending may be done are set forth in considerable detail in the twelve subsections of
clause 6. No lending institution may invest
an amount in excess of 5 per cent of its
Canadian assets. The present policy of the

368

SEN-'ATE

Central Corporation is to place a lirait on the
utilization of this kind of undertaking to the
years 1947 and 1948. No prospective consideration for such development in the year 1949 is
bcbng considered at the present time.
Clause 7 provides simply for ministerial
responsibility ie connection with the administration of the act and for the presentation cf
an annual report to parliament.
The final amendment, clause 8 of the bill,
appears as a k-ind of postscript expressing an
important afterthought which could be more
appropriately
have been associatcd with
clauses 4 and 5. It introduces a ncw principle
into the act, namely, that of making a direct
boan to a person on the samne terms and conditions as those upon which a joint loan May
be made. Hitherto, a 'basic provision of the
act has been the joint boan, representing as it
does a measure of co-operation between the
lending institution and the Crown. In the
present act only two exceptions to that
approved basis of lending are made: (1) in
the case of limited dividend corporations; and
(2), direct boans in mining, logging, lumbering
and fishing areas where the remoteness of the
district or the type of security makes the
lending institutions unwilling to commit themselves to long-term boans. Those acquaintcd
with the type of moveable and even portable
structures used in some cf the outlying districts will appreciate better the reason for
those exceptions to the general policy.
In clause 8 of the bill the Central Corporation is empowvered te make boans direct te
individual persons who desire te coastruct
homes or rentai housing projects. This new
provision is undoubtedly heing included in the
act because the Central Corporation desires te
have the power to undertake boans in particular cases where the lending institutions are
hesitant or decline te enter upon a joint boan
as provided for by clauses 4 and 5 cf the bill.
This introduces the wholc question of subsidized state housing. In another place some
attention was given te this phase cf the
measure by one or two promineet membersmemhers, 1 may observe, who beleng te the
group supported by my boilourable friend the
leader on the other side cf this bouse (Hon.
Mr. Haig). In reply, the minister remarked
that hie was flot sbutting the door on that
possibility.
This certainly is oee phase cf the bill which
should be discussed thoroughly and examined
closely in the standing committee of the
Senate te whicb, I trust, the bill will be
referred.

The bill as a wbole presents to the Senate
an opportunity te get a clear perspective cf the
housing probbem in Canada. As I have said,
there bas been much scattered discussion cf
this. subject. In the Committee on Banking
and Commerce a thorough examination cf this
bill, with the minister and officiais cf the
Central Corporation te belp us, should give us
aIl a better understanding andi grasp of a
difficult national problem.
I believe I have now covered, the different
matters included in the eight amendiments cf
this bill.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, 1 did ot know that this matter was
coming up tediay, but I have sent for my
papers. The bibi simply provides for larger
boans for housing. It does net sclve the basic
trouble; it is not there that the difflcuity lies.
Today ycu cao obtain ail the boans you want
on housing if the heuses are well situated and
the district is cne in which lcnding is carried
on in normal times. Ncbody who knows anytbing about the lending business will make
boans in small tcwns, at least net in Manitoba,
Saskatcbewan and, Alberta, the country witb
whicb I arn familiar; or if be does, he gees
broke. But Icans are readily made in larger
centres. 1 assume the saine condition exists
ail over Canada, and thiat companies wilb make
loans in sucb cities as Vancouver, Victoria,
Calgary, Edmonton, Saskatoon, Regina and
Winnipeg. But the problem whicli requircs our
attention is quite a different cee, and wvith
your permi-sion I shahl deal first with tbe last
phase cf it.
The other day. while in the city cf Winnipeg,
I a.cked one cf our mest prominent, bouse
builders to give me some records. He and bis
parteers have been building bouses continuously siece 1921. That is a long tise. 1 &aid:
"Do net go back te 1921. Go back te 1941,
wvhen the govereiment introduced contro] of
]oans." He produced a pliotograpb cf a bouse
which wvas buiît in 1941; and bis 9crm has been
building exactly th e sa 'me kind cf bouse ever
sin(e. including this vcar. Uc is the builder
mermber cf the firixi, and bis parer is the reai
cstte mnember. I am readv to show you the
plan anýd ilhe picture cf this type cf bouse,
whiceb. as 1 hav e saidý, lie bas been erecting
continuiously from 1941 te the presenit tise;
there bias been ne variation in the specificatiens, altheugh probably the saterial used in
1941 was a lot better than is te be had in 1947.
Uc remarked te me, "I do net want it p,.ljlicly
known, becausue~ ery body eIýe is in the sanie
pos.ition, but we arc cutting seme pretty sharp
corners te break even on the figures I arn

369

going to give you.e In 1941 they provided
recessed baths; they do nlot have thern now.
When a building is torn down they get the
bath with littie legs, and t-his kind of bath is
plastered around to give it the appearance
of a recessed bath. I asked himi to give me
a break-down of his figures. Let me stress
that I arn not talking about a mythical bouse;
under the plan be subrnitted to me twenty or
tbirty bouses are heing buiît eacb year, and no
dissatisfaction is expressed by the people who
have bougbt them, nor have any of. these
properties corne back on his hands. Tbey are

sold on very reasonable terrns, as low as onefifth cash, and so mucb a montb. The monthly
payments include taxes, insurance, intcrest and
principal, usually baseci on. repayment of
principal in about seven to ten. years.
Let me give you tbe figures, because they
bave a direct bearing- on the crucial point that,
under any existing scheme, people cannot
afford to buy bouses and, make the necessary
payments. The figures are broken down under
fourteen beadiings, and, witb the permission of
the bouse I shahl place the whole staternent on

$4,409; 1946, $4e89; 1947, 55,323. But the

builder tells me he cannot make as much
rnoney now as he used to make a few years
ago.
The crux of the difficulty in mny community
is that the people wbo can afford to buy bouses
have largely donc so. The other people, who
bave not much money and are afraid of the
cost of rnaintaining a bouse, have to rent.
Lending money wilI flot help that situation.
There is no difficulty in horrowing rnoney; the
difficulty is in getting people to pay rent coinmensurate wit-h the costs. Taxes have rîsen in
aIl cities, because of required improvements.

370

SENATE

.Hon. Mir. LAMBERT: The cost went up ten
per cent in the Iast year.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: And ten per cent the year
before, and ten per cent the year before that
agamn.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: In 1946 the lending
ratio wvas increased ten per cent and it bas flot
i)een inereased since thaf time.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is the trouble: tbcy
fixed an arbitrary increase; they are always
bebind. This year the plumber, the carpenfer
and the labourer ail got an increase in wages.
Hon. Mr. HUGEýSSEN: May 1 ask the
bonourable senafor a question, purely to
obtain information on the figures be gave for
the (0sf of bouses? If a bouse in 1947 costs
$5,300, bow much is tbe montbly payment over
a period of fifteen years?
Hon '.\r. HAIG: You cao figure tbat out
yourseif.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
know.

I jusf wanted

f0

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I did nef figure if out,
but the bligler cost xviii increase tbe rent.
Taxes arc up. but not enougb to make a
great deal of difference. I have always mainfained tbat when rentai control was estabiisbcd if stopped building, and 1 mainfain
it is stili doing su. It is ail riglif to say that
boans cao be securcd, but no buder xviii construet boeuses for rent foday. Tbe life insurance voumpanies bave refused f0 build in
Toront o. or Ottawa or any otber place,
becatisù of the increase in the cost of building.
Take, for instance, tbe experience of tbe
Great West Life Insurance Company in
Winnip)eg. 1 fbink 214 or 218 houses bave
been buif in Fort Garry, and the cost is running at about $2.000 more than the amount
bhey calcuiated, and whicb tbey suggested f0
prospective buyers. That is in line with the
figures tbat I have quoted.
The probiemi can be solved in oniy one or
fwo wavs at the most. I tbink it can be
soive(l in one w'ay. 1 believe that tbe wages
we are, payiog to people in this country are
not conimensurate xitb the cost of tbe buildings fbcy bave to iive in. We have either gof
to raise the incomes of the people in tbe
iower-wage classes, or give money to tbe
inunicipairies to buiid bouses, and pay
bonuses of so much a year on tbose bouses.
Tbere is no mniddle course; we must do one
tbing or tue otber. No scbeme of iending
money wxiil soive the probiem at ail. As I
bave said before in this bouse, I know a great
deai about the bousing business, perhaps more

than I ougbit f0. I have neyer found any
difficuity in getting boans on property. The
interest charge may at times vary one per
cent more or less, and whiie this may make a
slight difference in fine figures, it is not substanfiai. Wbat makes the difference is the cost
of $5,300 today against tbe cost of $3,000 six
y cars ago. Builders cannof face that. Rentai
control has made conditions sucb that no
speculative buiider xviii corne into the picture.
Wby sbould he? Goveroment officiais and
representatives have been going up and down
tbis country saying, "Weii, we extended the
confroi for une year, and if xvill be furtber
ext ended". Why wouid anybody go inf o tbe
busines;s wbiie that tbreat is hanging over bis
liead? Tbe problemn is not being solved for
the people xxbo really want to rent; the peuple who beriefif are tbose who can weii afford
f0 buy bouses.
Hon. Mi. CAMPBEL.L: May I ask tbe
bionourabie senator a question? On a bouse
sucb as be referrcd to, built in 1941, wbat
wouid be the ment, if amortized over a period
of seven or eight years, as against tbe rent
if amortized over a period of tbirty years?
Hon. Mr, HAIG: Tbere is reaiiy no difference. W'ben yon are bandiing boeuses like
tbese youi (Io not worry about tbe principal,
if tbc purcbaser is paying a littie off every
year.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I think my bonourable fricnd bas misundersfood tbe question.
If Yeu amortize the principal over a shorf
period tbe rent wiiI be bigber fban if you
extend the period. My bonourabie friend
lias stated tbat in 1941 the payment was
anîortized over a peiiod of seven or eigbf
years, and be says tbat by cxfending ftbe boan
period yon cannof reduce tbe rent.
Hon. Mr. HIAIG: If depends on whaf you
includo, in tbe paymenf. For instance, you
inciude taxes. In WVinnipeg, and I presumne
eisewbere, up unfil a year or two ago, they
wouid find out wbat the taxes were. Let us
s.ay tbiey were 8100, wliicb is approximateiy
$9 a month. Tbe insurance wouid be perbaps $2. making $11 per monfb. The inferest
af fi' e per cent on S3.000 wvas $150 a year, or
$12.50 a monfbi, su tbe total montbiy payment wouid be $21.50. Noiv, you say, "Make
fbe tei'm five years.' Buf tbaf is not flic way
if is dune. We ask a man bow mucbi of bis
principal be wants back per year. He may
xvant fwo per cent or une per cent or five
per cent: an(1 thaf is wbat is agreed upon.
The boan is nuL paid off at the end of five
years. but af fbat time if can easily be financed
again. Financing on a monthly basis does flot

JUNE 4, 1947
involve rnuch chance. You do flot have the
repair of the house and the generai looking
after of it that the rentai man bas. As long
as the principal is being slowly reduced the
only risk, is that the price may go down
and the equity be wiped out. There is not
mucb likelibood of that. The other day 1 got
the iast payment on a bouse that was sold in
1928. That is nineteen years ago, but why
sbould rny 'client bave been in any burry?
H1e was getting 5 per cent on bis rnoney, and
the purchaser was paying off about $100 a
year.
By providing a five-year period the mortgage companies do not really plan on getting
tbe rnoney back in that tirne. Under the
mortgage act one can pay off bis mortgage
after five years by giving tbree montbs'
notice. The pcriod of five years is provided
so that tbe companies will flot be caugbt
witb a notice of that nature.
As a matter. of interest, may 1 say that
Arnerican investors over a period of one
lhundred years have found that in the housing
market there is a cycle of eigbteen years.
That is to say, it goes up for nine years and
down for nine years. But two tbings happen:
it neyer goes down as iow as the previous
low level, and aiways goes bigher tban any
previous bigb level. Those observations by
American investors are no doubt valuable.
1 have no doubt that any rnunicipality
could build bouses up to a value of $6,000
and rent tbern, but tbe problern is that the
tenants, at tbe present wage scale, would not
be able to pay the rent required for sucb
bouses. I believe that the city of Winnipeg
would build lots of bouses for people wbo
want to rent if it knew tbat someone would
take rare of part of tbe loss that ultimateiy
would be jncurred.
I recentiy read the figures provided by the
Department of Vital Statisties in connection
witb the building trade, and 1 note that my
own figures for Winnipeg do flot differ very
mucb. My figures arc more likely to be
correct, as tbey apply to my city, whereas
those of the departrnent are taken from across
Canada and represent ail -types and qualities
of bouses. We in Winnipeg bave to buiid
warm. houses; we cannot put up slap-dash
houses to stand tbe cold weatber. In Vancouver, for instance, much cheaper houses
can be but.
My suggestion is tbat tbe goverinent do
two tbings. First, it sbould say tbat on Juiy
1, 1948, rentai controis wiii go off; sccondly,
it sbould propose to the municipalities that
if tbey build bouses at a cost of $5,000 or

$6,000 they wilI be allowed to collect income
on a cost of 83,000 and the governrnent wili
make up the difference.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR:
That -wouid be
subsidizing.
Hion. Mr. HAIG: It wouid be subsidizing,
but tbat is the only way in whicb the situation
can be met.
That is a littie
Hon. Mr. CRERAR:
expelisive.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The type of bouse 1
bave in mmnd is after ail not expensive; it is
a square plan and is most economical.
Is it of brick or
lion. Mr. DAVIES:
frame construction?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Oniy frame bouses are
bult in our part of the country; brick is
too expensive.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: What wouid bavebeen tbe rent of that bouse in 1941 as coinpared to tbe rent today?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: At 5 per cent it woold
have been about $13 a montb cheaper in
1941 than it is today.
Hion. Mr. CAMPBELL: Wbat would be
the rent per month for that type of bouse?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It ivould be about 840
in 1941 and about 853 today.
I arn not against this bill. I know it is an
attcmpt to correct tbe problem, but it does
flot get at the fundamentais of the situation.
The wbole Dominion of Canada is invoived
in tbis problem, and tbe governrnent bias a
good deai to do with the question of wages.
As long as a great many people are getting
only 8100 or $125 a montb we must face the
problem. At tbat rate of pay tbey cannot
afford to live in a bouse, at least not in rny
city; they can occupy a sIum.
In Winnipeg an area bound on tbe east
by the R~ed River, on tbe soutb by the
Assiniboine River, on the north by the
C.P.R. tracks and on tbe west by Donald
street, represents about one-qoarter of the
city, and from tbat area there cornes more
sickness and crime than frorn ail the rest of
the city. Wben one goes into tbat district
and sees the bouses lie can readily appreciate
the source of tbe problern. It is not uncommon to find a rnan with lis wife and two
cbildren occopying one room. He is making
only about $100 or $110 a montb, and when
he boys clotbing and food for bimseif and his
family bie cannot pay a big rent.
That is the nature of tbe problern facing
the country today, and I tbink it is very much
more serious tban parliament bias up to the

372

SENATE

present realized.
We talk about social
security, medical services for aIl, and many
other things. but here is a situation that faces
us riglit at home. I say witbout fear of contradiction that a great deal of the trouble
in our scbools springs from districts sucb as
I have described, in wbich tbe housing
accommodation is poor.
1 do flot like the bouses that the government built for veterans, but I admit that it
is an attempt to give home ownership te the
men and women who will live in those
houses. I believe that parliament has te conaider the difficulties of the low-salary camner
-caretakers of sehools and public buildings,
and people doing a hundred and one odd jobs
which pay about $120 or $130 a montb.
Sometbing bas to, be doue to give those
people proper housing accommodation, and
the only way te do it is by subsidivcd bousing. This can best be accomplisbed, flot hy
the government througb the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation-tbough I have
nu crîticism of that organization-but by the
municipalities themselv es.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The municipalities
today, particularly those which were in debt
before the war, do not want to embark on the
rmal estate project they had twventy-five years
ago.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: 1 am not so sure that
they would not care te do so. Twenty-five
years ago the ciLy of Winnipeg iadulged in
a housing project and made a net profit of
$120,000.
But today it would be afraid to
undertake a housing project without support
from someone. If the municipalities were
guarantecd that they could rent bouses at a
rate sufficient te pay the interest on the
money, and that someone cisc would pay the
balance, they would undertake it.
Ia Winnipcg a wholc block of houses was
built without providiag the nccssary sehool
accommodation. Today the city has to build
a aew school, instaîl scwers and water
supply, but ià cannot charge those improvements against 'lie houses. None of those
people arc going to buy those bouses. Why
should tbcy, wbcn thcy caa rent thcm? I
urge that when this matter goes te the cornmittcc wve sbould discuss that side of the
problcm. I do not know that the principle
of the bill, wbich is to facilitate the lendiag
of money, need take up the time of the committec. It is vcry likely that if a depression
comes along and prices go down, the govcrnment will loýe some moncv under this schcme.
But let us consider construction costs. flow
much represents labour? I suggest that, taking the wbole operation, ninety-five per cent,

or certainly ninety per cent, is made up of
labour. In my city up to now the cost of
land has been just two-thirds of the assessed
value, which is about one-fourth of the usual
value, so it doca not enter largely into the
subjeet. The value of the lots the goverament
buiît upon was only $400, whicb is a smaîl
amounit. I do nlot kaow bow prices can be
lowercd unless the cost of ahl types of labour
cntcring into construction is réduceld
In
Winnipeg the going wages for carpenters are
$2 an hour, and for belpers 90 cents an hour.
I remember that not many years ago carpeaters wcrc paid 75 cents and heipers 25
cents. There have been similar increases in
connection with plumbing and other businesses. As I have said, I am flot much conccrncd with aaything in the bill; it is an
attempt to provide cbeap money, and ýprobahly the goverament will bave to take some
basses, but the bill does flot solve any aspect
of the problem. The only way it will be
solved is by the government recognizing its
msponsibility for a substantiad housing programme whicb will provide accommodation
for the people who work. If that is net donc,
the lowcr-paid people must get an incease of
wages: basic prices will have to be establisbcd.
Our farmers arc demanding basic prices for
wheat, cattle and hogs, and it seema to me
that the man who workcs for wages must be
a.ssured of a basic wage sufficient to meet his
increased expenses. If the economy of the
country will net permit of this, somebody bas
got te bclp him carry the load of bis housing.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators, I bad net intended te take part in this
discussion, but the speeches of the honourable
senator fromn Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) and
the bonourable leader of the other aide (Hon.
Mr. Haig) contaiacd se much interesting
material that I thought I would offer a few
observations to the bouse. I agree fully with
my honourable friend from Ottawa that bousing is a great national problem; and I find
myscîf, I must say, in substantial agreement
witb the hionourable leader of thc other sîde.
I askcd him in the course of bis remarks a
question which I am sure be did net take in
bad part.
Hon. Mr. HIAIG:

Oh, ne.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
I a..ked him te
reduce te terms of menthly rentaI the figures
of the specimen house te which he referred
in the course of bis rcmarks.
I did that
hecause, fmom the peint of view of the
omdiaary industrial wage camner in our cities,
the question is: how much can he afford
te pay for reat, and cao ho on top of that

373

JUNE 4, 1947
rent afford to pay monthly such small instalments of the purchase price of his house as
wiil enable hîm at the end of a given period
to become the owner of it? 1 took down the
figures which my honourable friend gave
for the house in Winnipeg, and I tried to
reduce tbema to, a monthly rentai of that
kind; and with the permission of the house
I shall try to get down to that figure so as to
see what we are talking about.
In the first place, I think one might say
that under present conditions $5,500 is the
lowest cost of a house which would contain
the minimum standard of comfort that we
would expeet to have for any of our industrial
population.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Pardon me; that la a
three-bedroom house.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
1 thank my
honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Is that the cost of
the house, or the selling price of the house?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is the cost of the
house, without any land at ail.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Well, the rent would
be based on the seiling price of the house,
uniess the person who was building was going
to live in it. This is an owner proposition
we are talking about.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I understood that
the cost of $5,500 inciuded the land.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, it does not include the
land.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: The coSt of the
land, I suppose, would not be very munch.
Hlon. Mr. HAIG: 1 said $400. It might rua
up to $600.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The unit defined by
the National Housîng Corporation ineludes
the house and land.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: For this purpose
we shall include the land. Assuming that it
costs $5,,500 for the house and the land and
that the money cari be borrowed at 4j per
cent, which I understand is the rate provided
by this bill, there wouhd be an annual charge
of $247.50 for interest; and assuming that a
man bas a period of twenty-seven and- a haîf
years to pay off the principal-which. is a
very reasonable period-that would involve an
additional yearly payaient of $200. Those two
figures together total $447.50 a year, which
aimounts to a monthhy rentalHon. Mr. ASELTINE: What about the
taxes?

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I am just coming
to that, if my honourable friend wiil wait for
a moment. This amounts to a monthly rentai
of $37.30. If we add another 810 a month for
taxes and insirane-I think that is a fairly
reasonable

estimate-the

monthly

rentai

is

$47.30. Honourable senators who have any
knowledge of the conditions under which.
industrial workers hive in our greater centres of
population are well aware that a monthlY

rentai of 847.30 is beyond the capacity of a
very large number of them.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I was wondering what
factor

would

be

applied

to

reduce

that

monthly rent. As the principal payments are
made from year to, year. your interest goes
down. You are caiculating intereat on the
full amýount, whereas the principal is being
reduced by $200 a year. You would have to
strike some formula for determining the rent.
Hon. Mr. BURCHILL: May I state the
actual figures whkch were given me by the
Central Mortgage Corporation the other day.
In a typical case of a 86,000 house, on which
they would agree to pay 80 per cent, or 84,80
amortized. over twenty-five years, the monthly
rentai per thousand was 85.50 per month; or,
over thirty years, $5.03 per month. That is
exclusive of taxes.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: On a 85,500 bouse
that would represent a monithiy rentai of
about $35, then.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Pretty close to it.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: And you would
bave to add to that insurance and taxes, I
suppose.
Hon. Mr. BURCHILL: Right.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I am very gratefui to my honourable friend for the information, because it corresponds roughly to the
figures whîch 1 had. They range between $40
and $50 per month, which is a great deal more
than our industrial population cari pay. I
think social workers who have made a study
of the proportion that rent should bear to
the monthly income of the average member
of the industrial population, have reached the
conclusion that it should not be more than
twenty-flve per cent.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Twenty per cent.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Twenty per cent.
Well, if a -man is earning $100 or $125 a
moath, it is obvious that hie cannot afford to
pay $40 to $45 a month for rent. That leads
me to support the conclusion reached by my

;574

SENATE

honourable friend the leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig), that if under present conditions
we are to do anything substantial to relievec
overerowding in the 'industrial sections of ouieities, as opposed to wbat we are doing by
iegislation such as this to assist people who
can afford to, build bouses themnselves-Hon. Mr. HAIG: Right.
Hon. Mr. HUTGESSEN: -then in some way.
or other that 1 arn afraid is nlot clear to me
we shall be driven to somne form of subsidized
state biousing, repugnant as that roay be t0
some of us aod to the general notion of private
enterprise whichi prevails in this country. I
should, point out to honourable senators that
that is precisely the conclusion whicb lias been
reached and the resuit which lias been attained
in England, where they have a much more
difficuit housing problem than xwe have. Conditions here are substantially similar except
t1hat, owing t0 our climate, bouses cost a gonýd
deal more than they do in Great Britain.
The only reason wby 1 rose was to try, if youi
will allow me to say so, te dot the i's and cross
the t's of tbe observations of my honourable
friend the leader on the other side (Hon. Mr.
Haig), and, to direct the attention of this
(haniber to the fact that io ail iikelihood we
shall in the very neai, future be faced, with the
inevitability of provýiding soine sort of subsidized state rentai assistance for the classes
nf our- commuoity who ean comparatively
small v.ages ni the order of $100 to 8150 a
mornth.
Hon. CYRILLE VAILLANCOURT: Honourabie senators, I wish to say just a few
words. In our Cais-es Populaires in Quebec
we have a housing problem. and 1 agree with
the hionourabie senator who explained this
bill (Hon. Mr. Lambert) that it is ne-cessary
to takc' care of the situation. A man earniag
not more tban $1,500 or $2,000 a year cannot
buv a hiouze cnsting $6,000Hon. Mr. HAIG: No.
Hon. Mr. VAILLANCOUTRT: -because le
cannot afford to spend more than one week's
saiary per* month for rent. That hias been
our experience in Quebc, and I may say
that some ni our transactions bave turned
out rather badly. I wonder if the sitoation
will improve in the future or whether it will
become wvorse.
Tberc bias just been a discussion oi tbe Ligli

Hnn Mr. LESAGE: Yes, oniv two bundred.
Hnn. Mr. VAILLANCOURT: If we waot
to solve the bousing and other economic
probiems in this country, everybody must
do a fair day's work; every individual, fromn
labourer f0 executive, must put forth an
earnest effort.
You cannot get anywbere

Nwith the "least effort" principle-"i'a loi du

hcadway in recent years. The problemn is a

CRIMINAL CODE BILL
ECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. COPP moved the second rcading
ni Bill L9, an Act to amend the Criminal
Code. (Race meetings).
Hte said:
The honnurable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) lias kindly consented to expiain this bill.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourabie
senators, the amendments contained in this
bili are very simple. At the present time
the provisions reiating t0 the conduet ni
race meetings, particulariy the supervision nf
pari mutuel betting, are contained in subsecion 2 ni section 235 ni the Criminal Code.
A raciog association is defined in the Code as
an association incorl)orated before the critical
date, in March, 1912, or subsequentiy incorpnrated by a speciai act of the Parliament
ni Canada or of the legisiature ni any province.
Another factor that I must explain at tbis
time is that in recent years the courts have
put an interpretation on charters, particularly
those issued prier to 1912, whicb empower
associations to conduet driving parks and
trntting and pacing races. Tbe .iudges have
conciuded that there are many ways Ly wbich
a person may drive a herse; it is held that
you can drive a horse not only Ly sitting
beliind it, but also by sittîng on its Lack.
Because of this interpretation fLore bas Leen
and
10n recent years some attempt f0 revive
r-esurreet association cbarfers is-sued prier f0
1912. This las presented an administrative

JUNE 4, 1947
problem to the department, and the department feels that it should establish some cutoff date, after which any association which
desires to go into that business will have to
apply for a special act from either the Dominion Parliament or a provincial legislature.
Hence, the main amendment provided in this
bill is to establish such a cut-off date, and it
provides that any racing associations which
have not conducted at least one race meeting
with pari mutuel betting between the first day
of January, 1938, and the ninteenth day of
May, 1947--a period . of some nine yearsshall not be entitled to conduct races with
pari mutuel privileges. The only relief from
that is. found in the second part of the subsection, which covers the case of an association that may not have raced during that
period but at least has applied to the minister
and obtained authority to transfer a meet
from one track to another, and has therefore
manifested some signs of life.
The bill is to some extent restrictive, but
to some honourable members that may be a
commendable feature. It includes two simple
amendments. Heretofore provision was made
in the Criminal Code for running seven races
each day of a race meet, plus an eighth race,
which must be a steeplechase. Apparently the
only place where a steeplechase has even been
attempted was one of the race-tracks in
Toronto, where they probably have a steeplechase on three or four days out of a sevenday meet. Even during that time there would
be three, four or five horses entered; and
sometimes one would finish, but at other times
none would. The explanation is that the
horses in Canada- are not trained jumpers;
steeplechase racing is not sufficiently attractive
to train horses for that purpose. The bill
provides for an eighth race, which may be run
either as a steeplechase or a flat race.
The second amendment has to do with
trotting or pacizig races, so-called harness
races. In smaller communities the tendency
has been more and more towards harness races,
held in the early evening or extending into the
evening. They are a greater feature in rural
life than in city life. Trotting and pacing races
so operated are not subject to any provision
with relation to pari mutuel betting; and there
is no pari mutuel betting, for the simple reason
that at such meets the attendance is so small
that this would not be practicable.
In the general definition section of the
code "day" and "night" are defined, because
an offence eommitted at night is more serious
than one committed in the daytime. The
word "day" is used in regard to associations
which conduct trotting and pacing meets; and

375

to remove any suspicion or confusion as to
whether or not there is a violation of the law,
should their races run in-to 'the evening, the
department proposes that where the act refers
to a race meeting of fourteen days, it be
changed to read "fourteen days or fourteen
nights or a total of fourteen days and nights".
The limit in any year. for any association is
fourteen days racing in all.
To sum up, the amendments referred to
provide for an eighth race in the day, with
the righ-t to the association to determine
whether the eighth race shall be a steeplechase race or a flat race. Then there is claTification of the definition of "day." I referred
also to the restrictive provision for a eut-off
time so that a charter which originated prior
to 1912 would not continue ad nauseam to be
an administrative problem to the department
when it cannot anticipate what is developing
or is likely to develop. The department proposes to draw a hard and fast rule and say
that the test as to whether supervision will be
given for pari mutuel betting depends on
whether one race meet of seven days ws conducted during the period of the last nine
years with pari mutuel supervision. If the
department wishes to draw the line, it cap
say ýto an association which has not had
one race meet that it is hereafter not under
supervision, but if it wants to engage in the
business of horse Tacing it must go to the
provincial legislature or the Dominion Parliament and get a private bill passed for that
purpose.
Honourable senators, there is nothing complicated in these amendments, and no further
explanation is necessary.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I understand that
the provisions of this bill apply to pari mutuel
betting on harness racing as well as flat racing.
1on. Mr. HAYDEN: No. There never has
been any provision for pari mutuel betting
and supervision at harness races. There is
betting at trotting and pacing races, but it is
carried on by the method of operating a book.,
maintaining a pool or something of that
nature. I emphasize that there never has
been such a thing as a pari mutuel system
operated at a trotting and pacing meet. The
attendance is so small that that is not
practicable.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The reason I ask
the question is that during the depression
years and the war years there was no racing
of any kind in many western towns, but now
such little places as Virden in Manitoba and
Rosetown in Saskatchewan, as well as many
other country points, have race meets each
year. These towns and communities night
want to put on a race meet lasting several

376

SENATE

days, and possihly also have pari mutuel botting. If this bill is passed they would not
be able to do it.

The Hon. the SPEAKER:
Honourable
senators, wlien shaîl this bill be read the second
time?

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The ameadments have
nothing to do witb harness racing. A trotting
and pacing association puts on harness races
for a period of two days here, three dýays there
and four days some place else. It is flot
limited to one track and is flot concerned
with pari mutuel betting; it can establishi its
own systemn for betting, and requires no supervision by the department. This bill does flot
deal in any way with that type of racing,
except to permit it to bie oarried on during
the evening as well as in the daytime.
Ail that the bill does is to restriet pari
mutuel privileges to associations that bave
conducted at least one race with pari mutuel
betting between the first of January, 1938,
and the nincteenth of May, 1947. The bill
dues flot interfere in any way with the kind
of operation my bonourable friend speaks of.

Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, the
obtaining of answers to the list of questions
in ihis inquiry would require a minute examination of a great many documents, both here
and throughout Canada.
In these circumstances, I would ask that the notice stand for
the present time.
The notice stands.

NATIONAL PARKS BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. A. B. COPP moved the second reading
of Bill M9. an Act respecting certain National
Parks and to amend the National Parks Act.
He said: My honourable friend from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) has kindly consented to explain this bill.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
Honourable
senators, those of you w-ho bave looked at the
bill will see that it is accompanied by complete explanatory notes. In the circumstances
it is hardly necessary for me to go into the
various provisions at any length. Briefly, the
bill enlarges some parks and takes away land
from others; abolishes two parks and opens
up land Io be leased to persons who want to
build cottages; and provides opportunity for
the all-year-round residents in the parks in
Aiberta to enjoy the health and welfare
services supplied by the province.
I mentioned that there were some additions
to the National Parks, and in this connection
I wish to pay tribute to Dr. Clarence Webster,
of Shediac. This gentleman, who is Chairman
of the Historie Sites and Monuments Board
of Canada, gives a great deal of time and
money towards the preservation of historic
sites all across the country. Two additions
are being made to the Fort Beausejour Historie
Park in New Brunswick, both relating to the
battleground associated with that park, and

JUNE 5,1947
one of them consists of lands presented to
the government by Dr. Webster. I feel that
this gift deserves special recognition.
In Alberta there was a famous park known
as the Wainwright Buffalo Park, where at
one time thousands of buffalo were to be
found. That park has been abolished, and
at present a large part of the area is used
for military training grounds and experiments
in agriculture. An agreement bas been made
with the Alberta government whereby the
lands so used will be leased to the Dominion
for as long as they are required. Honourable
senators are familiar with the fact that the
buffalo from Wainwright Park were moved
principally to Wood Buffalo Park, situated,
I think, along the Mackenzie river or in the
neighbourhood of Fort Smith in the Northwest Territories. On inquiring from an official
of -the National Parks branch I learned that
at present the buffalo in that area are estimated to number between eight and ten
thousand. That is not the total number
of buffalo in western Canada. In addition
there are a thousand buffalo on the Elk Island
Park east of Edmonton. The Alberta government bas transferred a considerable area of
land from the Cooking Lake Forest Reserve
to the Elk Island Park in order to provide
more pasture for the buffalo. There are also
small buffalo herds at Banff and Riding
Mountain Park in Manitoba.
Nemiskam Antelope Park, situated in southeastern Alberta, is being abolished. It was a
small reservation established to protect the
antelope that were in the country some years
ago and prevent their extermination. I was
surprised to learn from one of the park
officials only yesterday that there are now
approximately 25,000 antelope spread over
south-eastern Alberta, and south-western Saskatchewan. This indicates that there is little
danger of the extermination of these animals,
and that it is no longer necessary to maintain
the park to protect them.
A word with regard to withdrawals may be
of interest. Considerable areas have been
withdrawn from some of the national parks,
particularly from the eastern side of the
Prince Albert Park, in Saskatchewan. This
area is not considered to be of value for park
purposes; it is costly to protect from the
standpoint of game preservation and fire, and
it will be possible to extend the areas used by
the Indians on the eastern boundary of the
park for trapping and hunting. Along the
southern boundary two small parcele have been
taken out, one of which is being transferred
to an Indian reserve to supply the bard with
more land for their needs.

379

There is a park in which I have a very considerable interest, for I live in it part of the
year. Arguments in favour of taking tracts
of land out of certain parks may be disputed
by some members of the Senate, but I strongly
approve of the reasons for removing an area
from Waterton National Park, which is located
in the southeast portion of Alberta. I know
where this area lies. Il is never used for
park purposes. People who visit the park or
spend the summer there never go near this
area. It is simply timber and grazing land,
and it will be made available to settlers nearby
for their particular purposes. The same considerations apply to withdrawals from the
Prince Albert Park. There is no question
that the provisions of the bill in this respect
are fully justified.
Another section of the bill, I think, requires
a word of explanation. In some parks,
although the residents may lease land and
erect cottages, they are allowed to live there
only during the summer. But at Banff, Jasper and Waterton Lakes there are permanent,
all-year residents. In the past they have
enjoyed none of the health and welfare
services supplied by the Province of Alberta
and available to people living outside the
parks. The bill makes provision for enabling
park residents te benefit from these services,
which include the treatment of tuberculosis,
X-ray services, the care of neglected and
indigent children, the care of delinquents, and
so on. I understand that, although there is
no reference to it in the bill, there will be a
form of taxation by the parks branch.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is provided for in the
bill.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: The returns from
that taxation will be assigned to the Province
of Alberta, under an agreement, and applied
to these services.
The only other provision which needs to be
mentioned is one permitting more land to be
subdivided for sale to people who wish to
build cottages in the parks. There is a provision for certain additional areas to be taken
over for that purpose.
I think I have referred to the principal
amendments. In any event, as I have said,
the explanatory notes accompanying the bill
are so clear and full that there is-little difficulty in understanding its purpose.
Personally, I have been interested in our
national parks for a long time. I feel they are
one of the strongest magnets we have for
drawing tourists from all over the continent
to Canada, and the more that we can do to
-improve them and to provide in them better

380

SENATE

facilities for tourists, the greater will be the
return from our tourist business. I maintain
that the expenditure that Canada makes on
these parks, no matter where they are located,
is returned, nlot tenfold but one hundredfold in the business done and money spent ini
Canada by tourists.
Whether or flot this bill should go to a
committe is for the Senate te decide . To my
mind the bill is very simple and the explanatory notes are clear. The only reason for
referring it to a committee would be te get
more information
from officiais
of the
departmcnt.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I should like to
have the bill go to a committee, because I
desire sonne information from the officiais
about the Prince Albert National Park in
Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: It is ,of course,
quite proper for the Senate to send the bili
te a comrnittee. The question is, what committee would be the proper one. As we have
a Naturai Resources Committee, the bill
couid ho referred to it.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

referred to the Standing Committce on
Natural Resources.

Honourable senators, this is the first opportunit.v we bave had to celebrate the King's

honourable members would desire to have an

Sav e the*King".
I now move, seconded by the honourable
leader opposite (Bon. Mr. Haig), thaf an

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Bonourable miembers, it gives me great pleasure to join with

intimated, the distinguishod President of our
great neighbour to the soutb arrives in our
midst, wbere hoe is sure of a warm and friendiy
greeting.

Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

And whiie we
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
loin whole-heartedly in welcoming him, there
is another matter of much importance and
significance that I should like to draw to the
attention of honourable members of this
bouse.
Today is the first opportunity that there bias
been in the Senate to congratulate the Right

Honourable William Lyon Mackenzie King
on having attained twenty vears of ,ervice as
Prime Minister of Canada. It is welI known,
of course, that hie hias been long in parliament;
beginning 39 years ago, hoe sat in the flouse
of Commons for three years from 1908; and
lie bias been a member of that flouse from
1919 until today-a further period of twentyeight years-making thirty-ono years in ail.
With the single exception of our distinguished
colleague Sir Allen AyiesworthSoine Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hiear.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: -hoe is the senior
Privy Councillor in Canada. However, the
fact of greatest significance is that ie bias
but recently attained twenty years as Prime
Minister.
His periods of service aie as
follows:

Days
December

29, 1921, to June 28, 1926....

September 25, 1926, to August 7, 1930..
October 23, 1935, to June 10, 1947 ...
Total...........................

1,643
1,413
4,249
7,305

This, as honourable senators know, constitutes a record in the Parliament of Canada;
and, should Mr. King be spared to occupy
his high office tili April, 1948, hoe will have
establishied a record among the democratic
nations of the world.
Our- system of gox erament resuits from
time to trne in sharp differences of opinion as
between parties. Bitter as debates can become,
and sharp the interchange of views, public
life in Canada lias always possessed another
üharacteristic-a marked willingness to pause
and pay trîbute to the worth of our great
public mon, irrespectivo of their political
views. It is in this spirit that I ask honour-

JUNE 10, 1947
able senators to agree to my drawing their
attention to these facts and to their heing
placed on our records.
Twenty years as Prime Minister of Canada
is a great accomplishment. It bas covered a
period in which the world has seen mnany
changes. It bas covered a period in whieh
the ordinary cares and dificulties of peacetime administration have had added to tbem
the tremendous responsibilities of war. For
my part, 1 have often marvelled how any
man could carry sucb responsibilities for sO
great a time.
May I, then, on behaif of bonourable
senators on this side of the bouse, extend to
the Prime Minister our heartiest felicitations
on bis having achieved twenty years of service
in the highest position in the gift of the
Canadian people.
We wisb to him continued bealth and bappiness, and many more years of service to
Canada in whatever capacity bis own inclinations and fate may decree.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
it is not given very often to a leader of the
opposition nor even to a leader of the government to rise and speak on a motion of
this kind. It neyer bappened before in this
country, and certainly it will be many years
before it can bappen again.
When I received, as other bonourable
members did, an invitation to be present at
the unveiling ceremony later this afternoon,
1 was thinking of the bistory of our country
during the past eigbty years. I thought I
would look up a record or two, not because I
do not think you are ail acquainted with
them, but because it is sometimes useful to
place them on record. Wbile paying trîbute
to the present Prime Minister I wisb to give
some *facts concerning two other holders of
that office. Sir John A. Macdonald, the first
Prime Minister of Canada, held office for
eighteen years, eleven months and twentysix days; and Sir Wilfrid Laurier was Prime
Minister for fifteen years, two months and
twenty-six days. Those are the officiai figures.
Our present Prime Minister bas now heid
the office for exactly twenty years. In the
history of the British Empire only one other
man bas beld the premiersbip of a country
for a longer period-namely Sir Robert Walpole, wbo beld office for 7,620 days-and if
Mr. King remains in office until April 10
next lie will bave exceeded that record. I put
those figures on Hansard because one does not
always know where to find tbem.

Under our political system we naturally
have differences of opinion, and sometimes 1
and the men and women associated with me in
our party have net seen eye to eye witb
the policies of the present Prime Minister;
but I believe that none of us can deny that,
whetber he was rigbt or wrong, be did what hie
believed in bis own heart was in the best
interests of Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That undoubtedly is the
final test of the capacity of any man or woman
in the public life of our country.
-I am happy to be a member of the Senate
on this occasion and to pay my respects to the
present Prime Minister of Canada. History
will not only show him as having heen in
office longer than any other Prime Minister,
but will give bim credit for bav'ing conducted
our country tbrougb one of the great world
wars. WTe can look back at the records of Sir
John A. Macdonald, Sir Wilfrid Laurier and
others, but in our minds we tbink of Sir
Robert Borden and the Rigbt Honourable William Lyon Mackenzie King as the two men
who have led tbis country tbrougb times of
great stress. Probably Mr. King stands out as
the greater, for we cannot forget those days in
May and June, 1940, wben we certainly were
uneasy. Yet, the resuilt bas been aIl to the
good.
On behaîf of the party whicb I represent
I wish to tbank the-Prime Minister for the
great service hie bas given to Canada tbrouigb
these twenty years.
Hon. C Y R I L L E VAILLANCOURT:
Honourable senators, it gives me great
pleasure to associate myself witb our two
leaders in extending to the Prime Minister our
heartiest good wishes, and congratulating
him upon bis magnificent achievements during
the twenty years of bis premiership, and
the service bie bas rendered Canada in the
course of bis lifetime.
As a French Canadian I am pleased to
pay my tribute and to repeat what bas just
been said by my honourable colleagues who
preceded me, that the Prime Minister, in the
gravest moments of our bistory, bas always
been the man of the hour, that bie bas given
ail bis heart, all bis sou], aIl bis mind and
ah bhis energies in the service of Canada.
Irrespective of party affiliations we are unanimous in our tribute to bis unsurpassed
achievemont in these eritical times. We hope
that hie wiIl be spared to continue to guide us
along tlie samne path and that bis successor
will follow in bis footsteps to bring to Canada
stability and happiness.

moved the second reading of Bill 177, an Act
to amend the Penitentiary Act, 1939.
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
flic hionourabie senator froîn Toronto-Trinity
(I-on. Mr. Roebut'k) to explain this bill.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUOK: Honourable senatois, since the days whien John
Hlowar'd, supported by Elizabeth Fry, conducted his marvellous compaign for prison
reform, and w-hen Charlts Dickens wrote his
wonderful novels about the prison systema of
England, the consciences of English-speaking
people have always been somewhat tender on
this subjeet. It has been easy te arouse public iineasiness w'itlh regard 10 charges of
crueltY said 10 have been committed behind
the blank walls and the barred doors of our
prison institutions. The public consciousness
has heen readily aroused ovci' suggestions that
useful lives w'ere being ivasted because of our
bniitality. our indifference, our ne-gleet or our
stupidity in tic handling of men and women,

course, to, inhumane government policy. A
campaign based on premises such as1 1 have
indicated was forwarded in very considerabie
part by my old friend Harry Anderson, one of
the writers of the city of Toronto, wbo heid a
great position in tbe public mind as a writer
and filied a large place when the Globe was
still an organ of liberal public opinion. It
was because of bis campaign based on those
premises that the Governmcnt of Canada, in
1936, appointed a commission to inquire into
the penal institutions of Canada. The personnel of that commission consisted of Mr.
Justice Joseph Arcbambauit, a judge of the
Superior Court of Quebec, Harry Anderson, a
protagonist of penal reforma, and R. W. Craig,
KCa lawyer of Winnipeg. These men wcre
given a great rcsponsibility and a splendid
opportunity. Shortly after the appointmcnt
of the commission Harry Anderson died, and
on the 17tb of December, 1936, Mr. J. C.
MeRuer, K.C.,-then a practising lawyer in
Toronto, and now Cbief Justice of tbe Trial
Division of the Supreme Court of Ontarowas appointed to take his place.
About two years afterwards tbe Archambault Commission presented a most comprehensive and able report, dated tbe fourth day
of Aprii, 1938. It was obviously tbe resuit of
a long, painstaking and careful inquiry. It bad
a large number of recommendations characterized by common sense, in the first place, and
by humanity, in tbe second place. In my
judgment the report ranks among the great
documents of Canadian bistory. It wiii long
be remembered because it broke su mucb
ground: in the matter of humanity it opcned
a new era. of tbinking in tbis country. Tbe
chief empbasis tbrougbout the report is laid
upon the rehahilitation of the prisonerpbysicaily, mentally and spiritually. It has
frequently been said that tbe Arcbambauit
report bas falica on barren ground, tbat it
was neyer impiemented. But, honourable
senators, tbat is not so; at ahl events, it is not
compieteiy so. Many of the eigbty-eigbt

detailed recominendations have been carricd
out, and a number of others are in process of
deveiopment: as witncss the bill tbat is before
us this afternoon.
One of the chief recommendations of tbe
report was under the heading of "Administration". I do not think I could do better than
to rcad from wbat it says at page 342:
In our present system the problem of penal
administration is too, large in scope and too
serious in results to be left in the hands of
83168-25

385

one man. It is noteworthy, as a matter of
record, that Canada is practically the only country where the penal system is flot administered
by some kind of commission or board.
In Great Brîtain, the Prison Commission je
composed of a chairman and two other commissiuners, one administrative and the other medical, and is re-enforced by four assistant coinmissioners, one of whom acts as secretary,
-A littie farther on the report says:
In Canada, the commission should, for the
purposes of administration, be responsible
directly to the Minister of Justice and to parliament in the samne manner as the Commissioner
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police...
The prison commission, as recommendied,
would performn the functions now performed by
the superintenclent and three inspectors.
That recommendation has neyer been carried into effect, but a major effort to impiement it in a more general and formai way
was made during the session of parliament in
1939, when an net entitled "An Act respecting
Penitentiaries," 3 Geo. VI, Chapter 6, was
passed. This act set up the commission as
Subsection (1) of section 4
recommended.
of that act provided:
4 (1) There shall be, under the direction and
control of the minister, a commission to be
known as the Penitentiary Commission consisting of three commissioners who shahl be appointed by the Governor in Council and who
shahl hold office for a period of ten years from
the date of appointment.

One commissioner was to be chairman;
another, vice-chairman, and the third was to
be just a commissioner.
Subsection (1) of section 5 read as follows:
5 (1) The commission shall under the minister, have the control and management of al
penitentiaries and ail prisoners and other persons confined 'therein and inmates thereof and
over ahl matters connected therewith.

Then follows a long act of eighty-four sections, occupying twenty-five pages of the
statutes, in wbicb a serlous attempt is made
to provide for a more efficient management
of our many penal institutions, and to correct a number of what seemed obvious abuses
and weakinesses as revealed in the Archambnult report. The act was assented to on
April 5, 1939, and, as honourable senators
will recaîl, the Second Great War commcnced
its dreadfui toit in the eariy days of September of that saine year. Solely, I think, as a
resuit of the war and its many factors, the act
was not proclaimed, and it bas not yet been
proclaimed. So we are stiil conducting our
penai institutions under Chapter 154 of the
Revised Statutes, 1927.

REVISED EDITION

SENATE

One of the great difficulties during the war
was the nomination of suitable personnel. As
a matter of fact, those in charge of prison
management had difficulty enough in carrying
on in a routine way as effectively as they did
in those years, without adding to their troubles and burdens by attempting to institute
major reforms. In 1938 the Superintendent
left the service, and his duties were performed
by the Senior Inspector. Then the Senior
Inspector went off to war, and his duties were
carried on by the Chief Penitentiary Engineer.
Since 1944, in addition to the Acting Superintendent there bas been only one inspector
for all Canadian prisons. Yet in spite of these
managerial difficulties and a weakness in
prison management, many of the recommendations of the Archambault report have actually
been carried out.
On many occasions public concern has been
expressed at what I have called the nonimplementation of this report. I have in my
files a letter writiten on November 9, 1945,
by the United Welfare Chest of the city of
Toronto to the Minister of Justice. In part,
it says:
On previous occasions, following the tabling
of the Report of the Royal Commission to investigate the penal system of Canada we hav e
made representations to thie government, urging
the implementation of the recommendations of
that

commission.

The alarm expressed by the chief constables in
Canada in their conference in Ontario last
August, over the persistent rise in the rate of
crime in Canada points yet again to the apparent
need for action in this regard.
The Canadian rate for serious crime bas
reached almost four times that of England and
Wales. It bas risen further since the situation
was described by your commission. The inereasing prevalence of crime amongst youth is
especially alarming. It is reported that three
out of four males admitted to penitentiaries in
1943-44 had been previously convicted-some
several times. It is our belief that our system
of handling offenders is aiding in the creation of
a criminal class.
It is our conviction that the implementing of
the report should bave high priority in timae and
importance at this time.
We would further urge that a permanent
prison board, as recommended, be appointed at
an early date.
That is only one expression-though a very
good one-of popular sentiment of that kind.
People were concerned over the many statements that the report had not been implemented. So in 1945 a further attempt was
made to give formal approval and effect to
the details of the report, and an art to amend

the Penitentiary Act of 1939 was passed, 9-10
Geo. VI, Chapter 28. The idea of a commission to manage the penal institutions had persisted throughout, and was again recognized,
in somewhat modified form, in the act of 1945.
Subsection (1) of section 4 of the 1939 act,
which I bave already read, was re-enacted in
tbese words:
There shall be, under the direction and control of the Minister, a commission to be known
as the Penitentiary Commission consisting of
three commissioners who shall be appointed by
the Governor in Council and who shall hold office
during pleasure.
The ten-year limitation was discarded-for
good reasons I bave nô doubt.
That act bad a new provision which bas
special application to the present bill. Section
4A provided:
The Governor in Council may appoint one or
more commissioners mentioned in the last preceding section of this act with authority, pending the coming into force of this act.
(a) to consider the several recommendations
contained in a certain report of a Royal Commission to investigate the penal system of Canada made on the fourth day of April, nineteen
hundred and thirty-eight other than those relating to the suibject-matters referred to in subsection two of section five of this Act;
(b) to make inquiry, subject to the direction
of the minister, into matters relative to the
aforesaid recommendations;
(c) to report the results of such consideration and inquiry and to recommend to the minister what is advisable or expedient to be done
to implement the aforesaid recommendations;
(d) to perform such other duties as may be
assigned by the minister.

fairly cicar. On page 17 of' General Gibson's
report I find the following:
The Royal Commission emphasized that the
reconstruction of the penal system of Canada
inust be carried out in a grýaduaI, well planned
programme and that precipitate action without
proper preparation would invite failure.
That appeals to my judgmcnt and, I hope,
to the judgment of honourahie senators. I
rcad un:
The re rigciziation of tlie headquarters administration, the establishment ef adequate procedure for the selection and training of staffs,
the deî elopinent ef more scientifie methods of

the various classes of prisoners are essential
preliminaries in the adoption of a hroad policy
that will place greater emplasis on the correcti%-e and rehiahilitative aspects of institutional
treatinent.
Su much for the reports. I uowv turn to the
bill, whiclî the leader uf the government
(Hou. Mr. Robertson) honoured me by asking me( to explain. It is easilv explaincd,
hecause it is a vcry short bill. It implements
the recommnendafion uf the Arclîamhault
report for the appointmcent of a conimission,
but it does su in somewhat different foiin
from that suggcstcd cither in the report, the
bill of 1939. or the bill uf 1945. Section 4,
subsection (1), prox ides:
The Governor iii Council may appoint a Comnmnissioner of Penitentiaries.
Not a commîission, but a commissioner-one
man. Subsection (2) is as follows:
The Governor in Council miay appoint two
depiîty conîmissioners.
It vili bce ohserved fIat the ten-výear-period
provision is stili "in the ash can"; the comimnissioner antI the deptt commnissioners hold

One will also note in tIe bill that the Civil
Service Acet applies to the commissioner, the
deputv comnu-.îuucrs. and others. Under

the new section 29, the commissioner, the
deputy
commissioners
and the
assistant
commissioners are to be Justices of the Peace
for the purposes of criminal law proceduire
only, and not for civil lcw. 1 have no doubt
that a question has arisen in the minds of
those who have read this act by reason of the
fact that bonds are no longer requiredý of
ward-ens, deputy wardens, accountants, storekeepers, stewards and other officers, by virtue
of a section whichi is now repealed. The
explanation, as I understand it, is that, bcck
in 1930 a fund was set up in the Civil Service
of Canada to provide thîs very type of insurance to our civil servants, in responsihle, and
particularly in financially responsible, positions; but now these officers will be bonded,
not hy this ct or the Penitentiary Act, but
by the general aet which bonds aIl our civil
servants. Thev are not to ho without bonds;
tliat system îvill continue as before.

Honourable senators, I happen to have
before me the annual report of the Superintendent of Penitentiaries for the ycar ended
March 31, 1945. The 1946 report lias heen
îssued and the figures are almost the same.
However, I have fIe 1945 report in my hantl,
and I notice on page 8 a fabulation hecded
"Previous Convictions". Just listen to tîmese
figures. In our penda institutions at Kingston,

JUNE 10, 1947
St. Vincent de Paul, Dorchester, Manitoba,
British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Col1in'.ý,
Bay there were 3,129 prisoners, and of thesc
on ly 634 were first offenders. In other words
78-4 per cent were repeatPrs. The table lists
the inmates under number of previous convictions, and the number runs frorn one to a
fantastie figure.
I need say no more with regard to the
necessity for reform, and the désirahility of
thouglit and attention to this ma tter of
rehabilitating those who enter our penal institutions. As corrective institutions, they have
signally failed. 1 do flot know that it is their
fault. I arn not hlaming anybody, and certainly I arn not blaming the management of
the prisons. The fault rests upon the legislative bodies. and upon the thoughtful men and
women of our country who have not given
enough attention to this matter. Therefore
I hope this bill will pass, not bccause I arn
particularly interested in any detail as to
appointments and that sort of thing. It may
be that the detail is wise. I think it is. I
hope the bill will pass because the Minister
of Justice thînks that it will hclp hima to
bring about the resuits that you and I sO
earnestly désire in this hurnan problem, and
nîso hecause I have a good deal of confidence
in thic commissioner whom it is intcnded to
appoint, a man of mature years, one who, as
the report itself shows, lias an intelligent and
comprehensive interest in this problem. He
will bring to it the experience of a good many
years in military organization. 1 arn not sure
if that is the proper terni, but 1 arn sure that
lie does know something about organization,
and I believe hie lias the attitude whicli may
bring about succcss. For -these reasons, I
recommend this bill to the favourable consideration of my colleagues.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourahie sPnators, I desire to say only a few words. I read
the Archambault report, and for somne years
I knew very well R. W. Craig, K.C., one of
the commissioners. When reading the report
I feit that it deait primarily with the appointment of commissioners. There is a wide field
for them. We have a penitentiary in Manitoba, and it gives us trouble ail the time.
Those of us wlio in the past have been practîsing lawyers know the number of repeaters
who came to our attention. We are aware
that Great Britain has worked out a system
that is doing some good. Up to date our
penitentiaries, operating with the best of
intentions, have becorne graduating schools

389

for persons who go ont to commit further
crime. I arn not criticizing any of the
wardens, for tliey cannot do proper work under
prevailing conditions. If the bill helps to
carry out the report of the commission, saine
progress will be made in this country.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: In what way will this
bill help to improve conditions? Is there anything in it at ail that seeks to alleviate somne
of those conditions about which we read sO
mucli ail the time?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I think the intention is
that the appointmcnt of the new commissioner
will establiali a board that will make reonmendations to the government as to what
ought to be done. One could indulge in a
long speech criticizing Ministers af Justice who
have held office ever since that report was
madie. I listcned to the debate in another
place, and of course it was said that while the
war was on it was difficult to get men to do
the required job. This is only a part mieasure,
a first step. I amn personally inclined to support it, to give it a try-out.
Hon. ANTOINE J. LEGER: Honourable
senators, I arn not rising to oppose the bill. I
should like to say, however, that before the
Archambauît Commission was appointed we
did have a superintendent and two inspectors.
In 1938 we had a bill baEed on the Archambauît report. We were told that unless we
passed the bill the Minister of Justice would
be unable to admýinîster penitentiaries properly.
In spite of that, the Senate rejected the bill.
In 1939, virtually the same bill was reintroduced and passed. And now we are told that
that bill lias not yet heen proclaimed. It provided for a commission of three, as recommcnded in the Archambauht report, whereas
the present blli pu-ts us back under the syBtem
that we had previous to that report. The
only différence is in the tities of officiais. Then
we had a superintendent and two inspectors,
and now we are to have a commissioner and
two deputy commissioners. Off-hand, it seems
to me that the bill is a step backwards. If in
1938 and 1939 the system was bad and we
could not effectively administer the penitentiaries, this proposed legislation will not
improve it, for, as I say, it only changes the
tities of officiais.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Wiil the honourable gentleman tell me why the legislation
was rejected by the Senate in 1937 and 1938?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I do not thînk rny

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourabla senators, in seconding this motion I desire to say
just a word. Those of us who were present
yasterday were delighted witb the wbole ceremony; I tbink we are agreed that, neyer have
we seen a happier occasion or proeeedings
better organized and carried out. The caremony was a gem. If I may say ona thing
more, it is that our Spaaker, like the rest
of us, is very human, and we like him for it.
As to the proceedings of this morning, may
I say th-is: I tbink I have heard every distinguished guest wbo in the last tan or twelve
years bas spoken in the bouse of Commons;
and in my humble opinion, no speech will be
read with greater interest than the one
delivared there this morning by tbe President
of tbe United States.
Hon. SENATORS: bear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: And no speech will have
as far-reaching consequences. It was a quiet,
bomely, common-sense speech. The ordinary
people of the world will understand it. Tbey
will realize that the President, at laast, of
that country believas, not in imperialism and
a lot of other isma, but ini the rights of the
ordinary man and woman tbroughout the

Canada bas bad the opportunity of offering

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAIL WAYS
REFUNDING BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN (for Hon. Mr.
Robertson) moved the second reading of Bill
265, an Act respecting the Canadian National
Railways and to provide for the refunding of
matured, maturing and callable financial
obligations.
H1e said: Honourable senators, the express
purpose of this bill is to authorize the refunding from time to time, as and when it becomes
necessary or desirable, of certain bonds and
other similar obligations of the Canadian
National Railways which mature or whicb by
their ternis are callable bafore maturity, up to
a lirit of two hundSed million dollars. The
legislation sets out the manner in which the
securities are to be refinanced. Under section
3 the C.anadian National Railways may issue
and saîl new seotarities, guaranteed by the
dominion, to replace old securities that are
matured or called.
Section 7 provides an alternative temporary
method under wbich the Canadian National
Railways may borrow temporarily from the
dominion government, on promissory note,
the money necessary to pay off those obligations as they mature. In tima, when market
conditions are good, the temporary horrowings
are to be replaced by new s-ecurities of the
Ca-nadian National R'ailways, to ha sold te the
publie and guaranteed by the dominion
governmeflt.
The real object of the bill, honourabla senators, is to permit the government and the
Canadian National Railways to arrange the
refinancing to a total of something over 220
million dollars of Canadian National Railways
bonds wbich faîl due or are ýcallable over a
period of the next six or seven years. With
the permission of the bouse I shaîl place on
Hansord a list of the bonds of the Canadian
National Railways maturing or callable in the
years 1947 to 1954. They total slightly over
221 million dollars, and it may interest honourable sanators to note that 86 million dollars
are payable in Canada only, two million dollars
are payable in Lond.on only, and eight million
dollars are payable in New York only; wbereas
123 million dollars are payable optionally in
Canada, London or New York.

I should say, hionourable members, that tbis

,vas pasrsed by parliament, in 1944. for the
purpose of deaiing with the niaturing obligations of the Canadian National Railways durîng the ensuing three or' four ycars. Jo tlîat

fact that during the paýt. year we in tlîis

the aifairs of the Canadian
National Railways. 1 arn sure we hiave somfe
rcsponsibility, thoîîgh I do flot kîîow to wvhat

XVe have a responsibility to the
Canadian National Railways, if flot to ourselves, to make some examination.
It mav flot be necessary to scnd this bill
to committee, but perhaps il would be Wel
to do so if by tlîat means we colild bave an
opportunity to examine officiais on the set-up
of the whole business. Il bas beeýn indlicated
in another place that the company may have

the subject of discussion, and wc sbould have
fundamental information on it.
I arn one of those who are very friendly
towards the Canadian National Railways syst,em, and I want to kecp myself informcd.
Thjerefore I would suggest that, if the mover
and seconder are willing, the bill should be
referred to tlîe Standing Commiî.tee on Bankîng and Commerce.

Right Hon. W. L. MACKENZIE KING
(Prime Minister) : Mr. President, rncmbers cf
the Parliament of Canada: We are indeed
grcatly honoured in having as our country's
gîtest today the President cf the linited. States
cf America. Your visit. Mr. President. is a
ivelcome expression of friendehip and good
w-ili, bcoih personal and national. On behiaif
of the members of Canadlos Parliamnt here
asSemblcd, anid cf ail whom we represent,
I extend to you the warmest cf we1comes.
In paying this neighibour-ly visit te our
capital, îve are delighted that you are aceompanied by Mrs. Trumnan and Miss Truman.
We aie pleased thiat.you bave found it poszsible
te make your stay of sufficient length te enable
yoii te sec sornething cf Ottawa and its surrotindings, and te give members of parliarnent
anil others the privilege of meeting you and
Mrs. Truman, and your talenteil daughiter.
WVe know how greatly His Exeellency the
Governor General and Lady Alexander eni eved
their reccnt visit te Washington, and lîew very
much they bave been looking forward te
having Mrs. Truman. Miss Truman and yourself as their guests at Rideau Hall. Nothing
eould be more symibolic of the happy relations
between 0cr two peoiples than family visits
between the White Bouse in Washington and
Government House in Ottawa.
1 should like te add, Mr. President, how
great a pleas-ire it iýs te me personally to be
renewing today. in my own ceuntry, the deeply
valued friendship formed mith yourself on my
visitsa te the United States from time te time.
1 shall always recall y otr wish, s0 generously
expressed, almost immediately upon your
assumption of office, that the relations, between
ocr two countries miglit continue te be as

friendly as they have been at ail] times under
l'iîe-ident Roosevelt, and tlîat vou and 1 miight
corne, te sbare a personal friendship cerrespondingiv clese. Yeti know hew warnîly both
these %visheswere amd are recipros-ated.
We arc e-ýpecially indcbted te you, Mr.

Ringdoni. the United States and else-%vcre.
Xcur vi-it. Mir. President, vivid] ' reealls the
visit te Ottawa, in Augîîst 1943. cf N'ecr illustrieus preclecessor. It was tPe first visit te
Canada's capital cf a Prrsident cf tPe UTnited

JUNE 11, 1947
to have the opportunity, wbich your presence
here today affords, to tell you, Mr. Truman,
how greatiy the Canadian people have adinired
the manner in which, under ail these circumstances, you assumed and are now bearing the
tremendous responsibilities of the office of
President of the United States.
May I say how greatiy we ail admire the
qualities of -humour, sincerity and courage
and the capacity for friendship which you
possess in such large measure, and whicb, if
I may say so, have been particuiarly evident
since the last congressional elections. Far be
it from me to introduce any note of party
politics into words of official welcome, mucb
less to say anything that, even to appearances,
might be considered interference in the
domestie affairs of another country. At the
same time, I think that ail of us in public
life would agree that to be faced with a
legisiature of which the maj ority may be
disinclined to accept the government's policies
is not the most comfortable position in which
to find oneself as head of an administration.
Because of a considerable experience in such
matters, 1 may perhaps be a¶lowed, in an
aside to the President, to express a personal
word of sympathy and understanding. Many
who arc assembied in this chamber can tell
you, Mr. President, that, as leader of a
political party and as head of the government, there have been occasions when I too
have had to face situations not wholiy dissimilar. It may serve as a note of encouragement to you when I say I have yet to find
that such embarrassments are necessarily a
bar to many years of office.
May I conclude this word of welcorne on
a more serious note. You, Mr. President,
have said: "If wars in the future aire to be
prevented, the peace-loving nations must be
united in their determination to keep the
peace under law. Ile breaking of the peace
anywhere i~s the concern of peace-loving naThis statement of
tions everywbere".
American policy migbt equally be a statement of Canadian policy. In the solution of
ail world problems, effective co-operation
between nations is a first essential. In effective
co-operation, no finer example could be given
to the world than that wbich bas been developed between the United States and Canada
over the years, and whicb was especially
evident during the years of war.
The Ogdensburg Agreement and the Hyde
Park Declaration are the two great landmarks of our wartime co-operation. During
the war these agreements were the basis of
joint action in defence, in production, and in
finance. Over and over again we have heard
83168-264

it said that co-operation, which. was so effective
as one of the instruments of victory in war,
should be continued as one of the means of
achieving and maintaining security and prosperity in a time of peace. By continuing
co-operation along similar lines, Canada and
the United States will not oniy 'be furthering
their mutual interests, they wiil be strengthening the foundation of a new world order, an
order based on international understanding,
on mutual aid, on friendship and goodwiil.
Mr. IIARRY S. TRUMAN (President of
the United States): Mr. Prime Minister,
honourabie members of the Senate and members of the Huse of Commons of Canada:
This is my first visit te Canada as President
of the United States, and I am happy that it
affords me the opportunity to address this
meeting of the members of both bouses of
the Canadian Parliament. Here is a body
wbich exemplifies the self-government and
freedom of the nations of the great British
Commonwealth. The history of the Commonwealth proves that it is possible for many
nations to work and live in harmony for the
common good.
1 wish to acknowledge the many courtesies
extended to me on this visit by the Governor
General, Viscount Alexander, wbo paid me
the honour of a visit in Washi*ngton a few
nionths ago. bis career as a soidier and as
a statesman erninently qualifies him to foilow
his iilustrious predecessors.
For the courtesy of appearing hefore you,
as for other courtesies, I am sure I am iargely
indebted to my good friend, Prime Minister
Mackenzie King. I ivas particuiarly happy to
he present yeý4erday when he was honoured
in the rotunda of this Parliament Building.
It was a wonderfui. ceremony, and a tribute
which I think he richly deserved. I also
aj>preec:ate the political advice he gave me
this morning. I have come to value and
cherisb bis friendship and st&tesmanbhip. As
our two nations have worked together in soivimg the difficuit pr.oblems of the post-war
period, I have deveioped greater and greater
respect for bis wisdom.
Americans who come to know Canada
informally, such as our tourists, as weli as
those whose approacb is more academie, learn
that Canada is a broad land-broad in mind

and in spirit as well as in physical expanse.
They find that the composition of your population and the evolution of your political
institutions hold a lesson for the other nations
of tbe earth. Canada bas achieved internai
unity and material strengtb, and bas grown in
stature in the worid community, by soiving
probiems that migbt have hopelessiy divided
and weakened a Iess gifted people.

the heritage of France as well as of Britain,
and Quebec has imparted the vitality ani

"1your foreign relations wil ic Ue ited States".
But the word "foreign" seems strangely ont of

reached the point where we no longer tlîink of
cadi other as "foreign' counitries. We tlîink
of each other as fricnds. as peaceful and
,co-operative neighbours on a spacious and
froitful continent.

The people of the United States fully appreciate the magnificent contribution in mca and
reseur-ces that Canada made te the allied war
effort.
United States soldiers, sailors, and

JUNE 11, 1947
airmen in the heat of battle knew their Canadian comrades as valiant and daring warriors.
We look back with pride on our association as
staunch allies in two wars.
Today our two nations are called upon to
make great contributions to world rehabilitation. This task requires broad vision and
constant effort.
I am confident that we can overcome the
difficulties involved, as we overcame the
greater difficulties of the war. The national
genius of our peoples finds its most satisfying
expression in the creation of new values in
peace.
The record proves that in peaceful commerce the combined efforts of our countries
can produce outstanding results. Our trade
with each other is far greater than that of
any other two nations on earth.
Last year the flow of trade in both directions across the border reached the record
peacetime. total of two and a quarter billion
dollars. We imported from Canada more
than twice the value of goods we received
from the United Kingdom, France, China and
Russia combined. United States purchases
from Canada were about six times our purchases from Great Britain, nearly ten times
those from China, and eleven times those
from France. We sold to Canada nearly as much
as we sold to Britain and France together.
Gratifying as the volume of our trade now
is, it is capable of even further expansion to
our mutual benefit. Some of our greatest
assets are still to be developed to the maximum. I am thinking of one particularly that
holds tremendous possibilities, the magnificent
St. Lawrence-Great Lakes System, which we
share and which we must develop together.
The St. Lawrence project stirs the imagination of men long accustomed to majestic distances and epic undertakings. The proposal
for taking electric power from the river and
bringing ocean shipping 2,400 miles inland, to
tap the fertile heart of our continent, is economically sound and strategically important.
When this programme is carried out, the
waterway that is part of our boundary will
more than ever unite our two countries. It
will stimulate our economies to new growth
and will speed the flow of trade.
There have been times when shortsighted
tariff policies on both sides threatened to
raise almost insurmountable barriers. But the
need to exchange goods was so imperative
that trade flourished despite artificial, obstacles. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements of
1936 and 1939 made possible a sensible reduction of tariff rates, and paved the way for
our present phenomenal trade.
Something more than commercial agreements, however, is required to explain why

Canada and the United States 'exchange more
than two billion dollars worth of goods. a
year. Ambassador Atherton has aptly given
the reason as not "free trade," but "the trade
of free men." That record flow of goods and
the high standard of living it indicates, on
both sides of the border, provide a practical
demonstration of the benefits of the democratic way of life and a free economy.
The benefits of our democratic governments and free economies operating side by
side have spread beyond our countries to the
advantage of the whole world. Both nations
expanded their productivity enormously during the war and both escaped the physical
damage that afflicted other countries. As a
result, Canada and the United States emerged
from the war as the only major sources of the
industrial products and the food upon which
much of the world depends for survival.
Canada has responded as nobly to the challenge of peace as she did to that of the war.
Your wheat has fed millions who otherwise
would have starved. Your loan has strengthened Britain in her valiant battle for recovery.
The United States is particularly gratified
to find Canada at our side in the effort to
develop the International Trade Organization. We attach great importance to this
undertaking, because we believe it will provide the key to the welfare and prosperity of
the world in the years immediately ahead.
In sponsoring the International Trade
Organization, the United States, with the
co-operation of Canada and other countries, is
making a determined effort to see that the
inevitable adjustments in world trade as a
result of the war will result in an expanding
volume of business for all nations.
Our goal is a vast expansion of agriculture
and industry throughout the world, with freer
access to raw materials and markets for all
nations, and a wider distribution of the
products of the earth's fields and factories
among all peoples. Our hope is to multiply
the fruitfulness of the earth and to diffuse its
benefits among all mankind.
At this critical point in history, we of the
United States are deeply conscious of our
responsibilities to the world. We know that
in this trying period, between a war that is
over and a peace that is not yet secure, the
destitute and the oppressed of the earth look
chiefly to us for sustenance and support until
they can again face life with self-confidence
and self-reliance.
We are keenly aware that much depends
upon the internal strength, the economic
stability and the moral stamina of the United
States. We face this challenge with determination and confidence.

THE LATE RIGHIT HON. SIR ROBERT LAIRD BORDEN
AND

THE RIGHT HION. W. L. MACKENZIE KING
June 10, 1947
In the presence of:

His Excellency the Governor General of Canada, Field Marshal the Right Honourable
the Viscount Alexander of Tunis;
The President of the United States of America, Harry S. Truman.
Senator the Honourable J. H. King, Speaker of the Senate, and the Honourabie

The Right Honourable W. L. Mackenzie King, Prime Minister of Canada; Right

Social Credit party; Frank O. Salisbury; Kenneth Forbes; and other members of the
Senate and cf the House of Commons.
At 5.30 p.m. Ris Excellency the Governor General cf Canada and the President cf the
United States of America arrived in the Chambers cf the Speaker cf the bouse cf
Commons and proceeded te the main lobby.
God Save the King
The Star-Spangled Banner
Honi. GASPARD FAUTEUX (Speaker cf
the House cf Comxnons): Mr. President, Your
Exoeilency, Guests of Honour, and Honourable Members cf the Senate and cf the Huse
cf Commons: We are gathered here this afterr-oon ta witness the unveiling cf the portraits

of two cf Canada's most distinguished sons.
In the heurs cf stress, when the worIl was in
the throes of terrible wars, we were fortunate
in having as Prime Ministers two men
endowed with strong patriotism, vision and
strength of character. They were, during the

400

SENATE

war of 1914-1918, the Right Honourable Sir
Robert Laird Borden, and, during the recent
war of 1939-1945, the Right Honourable W.
L. Mackenzie King.
Before I proceed further may I say, in the
name of all present, how much indebted we are
and how grateful we all feel to His Excellency
the Governor -General, Field Marshal Lord
Alexander, for honouring this occasion by his
presence, and for having graciously consented
to unveil the two portraits.
We are also deeply grateful to His Excellency for bringing with him his distinguished
guest, the President of the United States of
America, who arrived in Ottawa this afternoon
on a brief visit to Canada. We are indeed
delighted that Mr. Truman should. on such
short notice, have been prepared to join His
Excellency.
Mr. President, Your Excellency, you may
both be assured that your presence in our
walis of Parliament on this occasion is an
honour which will long be remembered by the
members of both houses, and indeed by all
Canadians.
For a long time it has been felt that Sir
Robert Borden's portrait should adorn the
walls of these Houses of Parliament. When I
had the honour to become Speaker of the
House of Commons, I soon discovered that
the consensus of opinion of members of both
houses was that the practice of placing our
Prime Ministers' portraits in the Parliament
Buildings should be resumed.
Instructions
were accordingly given for the painting of a
portrait of the late Sir Robert Borden. Mr.
Kenneth Forbes, the well-known artist of
Toronto, was commissioned for the purpose.
How- splendidly Mr. Forbes executed his commission you wiil see when the portrait of
Sir Robert Borden is unveiled.
While arranging for this commission, I
learned of the portrait of the present Prime
Minister, which was paintei by Mr. Frank O.
Salisbury, and which had been exhibited in
the Royal Academy in London. The portrait
was temporarily on exhibition at our own National Gallery. Members who saw it were high
in their praise of the great artist who was responsible for this splendid work of art. A general desire was expressed that the portrait
should be placed in our Parliament Buildings.
On the 8th of December last I took it upon
mvself to write the Prime Minister in the
matter.
Several letters were exohanged
between Mr. King and myself before I was able
to convince him that my request should be
granted. Perhaps I may be permitted to use
a privilege given to members of both houses,

with unanimous consent, and given sometimes
by the Speakers, to table for the Press the
correspondence exchanged.
May I say, in a word that, being assured that
it was the wish of the Speakers, and of
the leaders of all parties in both bouses, that
the portrait by Mr. Salisbury should be hung
on the walls of these buildings at the same
time as the portrait of Sir Robert Borden, Mr.
King not only gave his consent to the transfer
of the portrait for that purpose, but said be
would be pleased to have it accepted as a gift
from himself to Parliament.
I quite understand Mr. King's hesitation in
allowing us to have bis portrait for these walls
while he is still a member of Parliament, but
I may assure him that after twenty years in
the office of Prime Minister he should experiene no embarrassment on that account.
Your final agreement to this step, Mr. Prime
Minister, bas warmed our hearts and increased
your popularity in parliamentary cireles, I
wi-h to extend to you, Sir, the sincere thanks
of all the members of the Senate and of the
House of Commons for the very gencrous
tuanner in which you have acceded to our
request.
'he Speaker of the Senate, the Honourable
J. H. King, then invited His Excellency the
Governor General to unieil the portrait of Sir
Robert Laird Borden. The Speaker said:
Mr. Presideut, Your Excellency, Members
of the Senate and of the Hou-e of Commons: On belialf of the members of the
Senate and of the House of Commons of
Canada, I have the honour to invite Your
Excellency to unveil the portrait of the
Right Honourable Sir Robert Laird Borden,
who was, from 1911 to 1920, a period which
included the years of the first great war,
1914-18, was Prime Minister of Canada.
(Hlis Excellency unveilcd the portrait of Sir
Robert Borden.)

Hon. J. H. KING (Speaker of the Senate):
Mr. President, Your Excellency:
I have
pleasure in presenting to you the artist, Mr.
Kenneth Forbes, of Toronto, to whose talent
we are indebted for the splendid portrait of
Sir Robert Laird Borden.
(Mr. Forbes came jorwcard and acknowlcdged
applause by a bote to the a.ssembled comîpany.)
Hon. Senator KING: Mr. Henry Borden
has telegraphed his regret at his inability to be
present at this ceremony. We are very sorry
that cireumstances have prevented him from
witnessing the unveiling of this portrait of bis
illustrious uncle.

JUNE 11, 1947
The Speaker of the Hause oj Commons,
Hon. Gaspard Fauteux, then invited His
Excellency to unveil the portrait oj the present
Prime Minister. The Speaker said:
Mr. President, Your Excellency, Members
of the Senate and of the House of Coinmons: On behalf of the Members of the
Senate and of the House of Commons of
Canada, I have the honour to invite Your
Excellency ta unveil the portrait of the
Right Honourabla William Lyon Mackenzie
King, who today completes twenty years
in the office of the Prime Minister of
Canada, including the years of the second
Great War, 1939-45.
(His Ezcellency unveiled the portrait of the

for -the splendid portrait of aur Prime Minister.
(Mr. Salisbury, camne forward and acknowledged applause by a bow ta the assembled

HIS EXCELLENCY, FIELD MARSHAL
THE RIGHT HON. THE VISCOITNT
ALEXANDER 0F TUNIS (Governor General of Canada): Mr. President, Mr. Prime
Minister, I feel that it is an h-onour,' besides
being a pleasure, ta be here on this historie
occasion and ta have the privilege of unveiling
these two fine portraits of two fine men.
It is particularly fitting that today has been
chosen for this ceremony, since it marks our
own Prime Minister's twentieth year of loyal
and devoted service to King and country.
Further lustre ta the occasion is added by
the presance here today of the President of
that great -country which not anly is our friend
and neighbour, but wals aur ally in two world
wars.
0f the twa men we honour today, the
one led us ta victory in the first world war,
and the other ini the second. Now these noble
pictures of two great Canadians, from the
brush of distinguished portrait painters of
warld-wide reputation, find a happy and fitting home in the very heart and centre of the
Canada they have bath served so loyally and
have loved so well.
Hon. Senatar KING: Mr. President, Your
Excellency, and honourable members: We
have with us this afternoon ana of Sir
Robert Borden'soldest and cdosest friands, the
Hanourable Senator Charles C. Ballantyne.
Senator Ballantyne was a membar of Sir

401

Robert Borden's Cabinet from 1917 ta 1920,
and lie is one of the senior mambars of the
Privy Council af Canada. He was sumýmoned
ta the Senate while a Conservativa administration was in office, and until recentl-y was Leader
of the Opposition. in the Upper House. I
should like tacaîl upon Senator Ballantyne for
a few wards.
Haon. Senator C. C. BALLANTYNE:
Mr. President, Your Excellency, Mr. Prime
Minister, Hanourabla Membars of the Sanate,
and Members of the House of Cammons: I
considar it a high hanour and privilege ta be
invited ta make a brief reference ta my former
Prime Minister, the Right Honaurable Sir
Robert Laird Borden, P.C., G.C.M.G., K.C.,
LL.D.
In the long lina of illustriaus Prime Ministers
Canada has beau fortunate ta -have had presiding over hier destiny, no one stands out more
prominently for distinguished devotian and
service ta Canad-a, the Commonwealth of
Nations and the Empire, -than does my former
Prime Ministar.
The Right ilonaurable Sir Robert Borden
was Prime Minister from 1011 ta 1920,
including the periad of the First Great War.
I was privileged ta serve under Sir Robert
as anc of his ministers during the First Great
War years of 1917-1918 and until his retiramient in 1920. 1 shail always cherish the
memory of having been associated with my
former Prime Minister during ýthose years.
The 'Right Honourable Sir Robert Borden
was held ln hîigl este not only by his calleagues in Parliament but by Canadians generally and was as well a recagnizad world figure.
Aftar Sir Robart's retirement from -the
premiership aur close personal friandship continued throughout the years and it will always
remain with -me as a revered and pleasant
memory.
May I be permitted on this historie occasion
ta refar ta my old friend of long standing, the
present Prime Minister, the Right Honaurable
W. L. Mackenzie King, C.M.G., who bas
occupied the higli office of Prime Minister for
a longer period 'than any lof bis Canadian predecassors, and who, in a few months will have
occupied it langer thlan any ana elsa in the
history of the British Empire. It ils ramarkala that my former Prime Minister and the
present. Prime Minister bath guideà aur

It is fitting, tharefore, that these twa illustriaus Prime Ministers should have their

and future generations, and to the thousands
of visitors passing through our portals, of the

Hon. Mr. FATJTEUX: Mr. President, Your

Honour, Honourable Members of the Senate
and of the Housc of Cominons: The time hias
flot yet arrived to appraise Mr. Mackenzie

As hias already been said, this ceremony

403

JUNE 11, 1947
which Sir Robert experienced throughout the
years of war. No one knows better than
Senator Ballanty-ne how cordial at ail times
were the personal relations between Sir Robert
and myself. 1 arn glad it has been given to
so intimate and devoted a friend of Sir
Robert, one who was a member of bis cabinet.
and who is the senior Privy Councillor on the
opposition benches in Parliament, to speak,
today of the portrait of his late leader. The
Senator, I hope, will allow me to express to
him my very warm thanks for bis aIl too
kind personal referenees to myself. They
corne, I know, frorn the beart of an old and
truc friend.
I arn sure ail of us wbo knew Sir Robert
Borden wilI agree that the portrait by Mr.
Kenncth Forbes, wbich we now see before us,
is a worthy and striking likeness, and that it
reflects great credit upon the artist. I should
lilce, in the name of the Governrnent, to thank
Mr. Forbes for the portrait he bas painted of
Sir Robert Borden, and to congratulate him
upon it.
Your Exceilency, 1 corne to a very difficuit
part of what I have to say. How arn I to
express to my feilow rnembers of Parliament
my appreciation of the honour tbey have done
me in wishing to have the portrait of myseif,
by my friend, Frank Salisbury, given a place
on the walls of Parliarnent? How arn I to
thank thern for wishing to bave it given an
association with the portrait of Sir Robert
Borden. in events whicb are outstanding in
history? How arn I to thank tbern for baving
rýeiectcd today-the day on wbicb I bave coinpleted twenty years of office-as the day for
the unveiiing of the two portraits? And how
arn I to thank His Honour the Speaker of the
Commons for wbat he bas just said?
In one tbing I arn fortunate indeed. It is
that the artist, Mr. Salisbury, bas found it
possible to be witb us today. Mr. Salisbury
will be able to assure you that it was to bis
persuiasion ratber than to any expressed desire
on my part that the portrait owes its existence.
Perbaps nothing could better illustrate Mr.
Salisbury's skill as.an artist than wbat be bas
been able to make of me! I arn indeed gratefui to bim for including me among the number
of those to wborn bis brush bas of itseif helped
to bring distinction.
Aft.er tbe many years I have been in Parli'ament and in office, I cannot tel] you what it
means to me to find myseif surrounded, as I
arn at this moment, by those with whom I
bave been most closely assocîated in the
public life of Canada. It is an expression of
friendship and good wili on the part of politi-

cal friends and, opponents alike, much too
moving to be acknowledged in words. I canflot begin to express what this occasion means
to me today, or what it wiii mean to me for
the rereainder of my days. I can only thank
you, one and aIl, and tbis I do witb ail my
beart.
Ail too soon associations of the present meIt
into memories of the past. I arn happy to
think that tbose who bave sbared today's
associations rnay not find the memory of them
iacking in warmth or colour with thc passing
of the years. I even venture to hope that, to
those wbo seek a noble caliing, the memory of
this occasion wiil serve to lend a glow to publie
life and to reveai the rieliness of tbe rewards
of public service.

National Railways financing bill before us this
session. If it is se desired, that bill could be

SECOND READING

The Senate resurned fromn yesterday the
adjourncd debate on the motion ef Hon. Mr.
Lambert for the second reading of Bihl 253,
an Act te make provision with respect te
Forces ef the United States ef Arnerica when
visiting Canada and with respect te the exercisc of discipline and te the internai administration of such Forces.
lion. JOHN T. HAIG: Heneurable meribers, I take ne exception te the terms ef this
bill. As we ahl know, there wvas a full discussion in another place, and some opposition
wvas raised. However, when the bill was fully
cxplained I think it was realized that the
authority granted uinder it is lirnited, having
te do largely with discipline within a unit
wvhile it is on operatiens in Canada, supreme
command
being always Linder
CanLadian
officers.

Whien 1 re:îd the bill I cannot lielp rcalizing
(lîat in a few short veais-sav, since 1910he wholc world bias changed. If twenty-five
or thirty years ago anybody lhad proposed
a bill et this character it certainly never would
lun e passed in another place, and I doubt
if it weuld have passcd here. For whaqt w.e are
(confironted with is a measure te permit-in a
\eiy limitcd way. it is truc-an ariny ot
zinother nation te operate as a unit in our
cunlrY. I want te draw a few conclusions
frein that fact. We cannot but. be mindful
that ju,4: yesterday we heard within the walhs
et these Parliaýment Buildings, a -%ery able
address by the President et the United States.
1 think everyene wvas struck. as I \vas, with
the moderation et the words he uttered; but
it was clear, crystal clear, that he feared-not
in the scný_e of being afraid-that the peace of
lie w-orh(
might bc upset unless certain
nations rcahized: first, that the democratic
nations did net want war or aggrandizement
of any kind; and second, that if we mnake the
sanie mistake now that we made in the period
frein 1935 te 1939 we probably shahl bo faced
with the sarne kind et situation, under a differcnt namne.
W'e in Canada have ne desire for war; we
have neyer wanted aggressien et any kind.
It dees net matter whether we cerne from the
banks et the St. Lawrence or the shores et the
Pacfie ocean or any place in between, our
attitude in this respect is the samne. But we
have had bitter experiences in the hast, thirtythree years, a period within tlîe memory of
miost members et this bouse.
Honotirrable

JUNE 12, 1947
s-enators will recaîl reading in their bistory
books at school of the Napoleonic wars. We
tbought they were something the like of wbicb
could neyer bappen again, yet in aur own
lifetime we bave witnessed two struggles that
made the Napoleonic wars appear as mere
manoeuvring exercises.
I beliei-e that each nation sbould manage its
cwn internai affairs, provided it follows demacratie principles wbereby its citizens bave tbe
right and freedom to express tbrough the
ballot their views as ta bow tbey should be
governed. We in Canada would not interfere
with that right and freedom in any country.
The present European problem is mucb the
samne as the anc that existed in 1938. Our
system of gavernment is different frorn that
of European caunýtries, and the recent coup
in Hungary is a clear indication of the difference between the two systems. Wbat did
Hitler do in 1939? Hie marched into Poland.
And naw the Russians marcb into Hungary,
not with an army, but by fifth columnists,
and tbroughi them they have gained contraI.
1 say that fia Canadian citizen bas any business to ally himself or herself with any fifthcolumn systemn wbich challenges demacratic
principles. One cen be sure that the d-emocratic system is being challenged, because
wben a Russian official makes a stat-ement
about what bis country is doing lie says it'
stands for demacratic principles; and it is
said that under thase prineiples Russia took
control of Hungary. But according to press;
reports, which I have no doubt are reliable,
in the recent elections in that country an-ly
seventeen ta eighteen per cent of tbe electors votcd for the preserit system of gaverument.
The war of 1914 ta 1918 is a horrible
mcmory ta the people of this country. I for
anc thaught-and there were a great many
more as unsuspecting as I wa.--that the warld
had learned its lessan and that there would
neyer be another war. Yet by 1928 threats
of a future conflict were visible on the horizon. Whcat producers in the West saw signa
of wbat was caming wben Germany and Italy
star ted ta put tariffs on aur grain; and by
1930 the tariffs were sa higb that it cauld not
get into those cauntries. The only passible
purpose was ta make the people of Gerrnany
and Italy grow grain, so that wben a war
broke out tbey would not be, as tbey were
from 1914 to 1918, dependent on tbe production of other cauntries.
Now we are starting again. One cauld not
go ta the United Nations and stay there for
manths witbaut realizîng that Russia and ber
satellites seem determined that fia progress

405

should be made. I amrn ot here ta defend the
United Sta tes: I ar nfot pro-American; 1 arn
flot pro-anything, except pro-Canadian. But
I say you could flot sit there afld listen day
after day, week after week, without beiflg
confronted with the question: Why ail this
delay? Let me give you one illustration. We
on the legal comrnittee were asked ta define
the word "meeting". We know what in our
language a meeting means; today's assernbly
of the Senate is a meeting. But in the United
Nations charter "meeting" is used in another
sense; it not only means the coming together
of people for a purpose, but it covers the
number of days or times that they corne
togethier in order ta accomplish that purpose.
After a discussion of two bours and twenty
minutes in tbe legal cammittee we unanimously agreed upon a definition. Next day
the clerk, or "rapporteur", as he is called,
carne in and read bis report ta us, just as
minutes are formally read before being concurred in, but up jurnped a Russian delegate
wbo was not present tbe day before-and ta
that I bave no objection, because, as you
know, a delegate can unavoidably be absentand for two bours be kept us tbere on bis
argument tbat tbe definition was not a proper
ane. It was a case of pure, unadulterated
delay. Sir llartley Sbawcross, the United Kingdam representative. moved that tbree or four
words in tbe original definition be cbanged,
and the motion was seconded by the Ulnited
States delegate. Tbe change improved the
grammar a little, but the meaning was the
samne. After two hours and ten minutes we
got ta a vote, which was strongly in favour of
.Sbawcvross' motion; but my advisers recornmended me ta vote against it and in favour of
tbe original motion. I did so, and I may say
,tbat the Byclorussian delegate said ta me,
"My Goodness, you votcd against the United
Kingdoml" I said, "Yes; we Canadians always
vote as we think Canada should vote on any
question."
I bave mentioned this as being an incident
for whicb I (an see no reason except a desire
for delay. And 110W the people responsible
for these tactics are saying that tbey hope
tbere will be a depression and that the democratic nations will be in trouble, s0 that the
communists may be able to spread their
theories. For the communista bave the old
idea which Hitler bad, that if hard times
corne, bringing unemployment and bunger,
the people can be told, "Put us in power,
and your hunger and misery will disappear."
I think that we as Canadians are in favour
of this bill, if for fia otber reason than ta
show the rest of the world that we believe
tbe United States support the cause of free-

406

SENATE

dom as strongly as we do, and that, along
with the nations of the British Commonwealth
and many other countries which are in favour
of freedom, they are prepared to say to
Russia and ber satellites: "You cannot go
on doing what you are doing. We shall not
allow you to get into the position which
Hitler was allowed to get into a few years
ago."
Take the case of France. When did the
French governiment put communist members
out of the cabinet? Not until it felt assured
that the United States, the United Kingdom,
Canada and all the other Commonwealth
nations would be behind it in any struggle
it might have with the communists. These
are things which I think should be said in
this country.
I cannot forget-this is personal, and perhaps I should not mention it-I cannot forget a letter I received in New York from a
boy who is pretty close to me. He said, "Dad
we will be glad to sec you when you come
home, but don't come home until you make
it so that I will never have to go back to
Europe." That is the cry of the entire democratic world today. But we are going back
to Europe, rather than have communismn
dominate this world; and the sooner we tell
this to the communists, the better for this

He said: Honourable senators, this is a
simple bill. It is introduced to implement
that part of the budget resolutions which dealt
with the Excess Profits Tax Act, and the meat
of it is to be found in section 4, which states
in part:
No tax shall be assessed, levied or collected
under the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 on
profits earned on and after the first day of
January, nineteen hundred and forty-eight.
In other words, the Excess Profits Tax Act
vanishes after the end of this year.
The remaining sections of the bill are more
or less in the nature of machinery designed
Io give the act a proper and effectual burial.
i do not know that I need go into any detail
in that connection, but if there are questions
about any section I shall do my best to reply.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

THE LATE SENATOR MICHENER
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, I regret very muci that
it is my duty to inform this house that since
we last met we have lost one of our, most
esteemed and distinguished colleagues. The
Honourable Senator Edward Michener died
in Ottawa on Monday, June 16, after a short
illness.
Senator Michener was born on August 18,
1867, at Tintern, Lincoln County, Ontario.
He was educated at St. Catharines Collegiate
Institute. Victoria University at Toronto, and
Wesley College, Winnipeg. In 1897 he married Mary E. Roland, who survives him, as
does his famiily of three sons and four
daughters
One son, the Honourable D.

JUNE 17, 1947
Roland Michener, is a distinguished member
of the present government of Ontario, holding the portfolio of Provincial Secretary.
Senator Michener eni oyed a wide association with business interests in the province of
Alberta, and was keenly interested in military
matters, holding the rank of Honorary
Colonel.
Our late colleague distinguished himself in
the political life of the country at ail three
levels of government. H1e was Mayor of
Red Deer three times, and president of the
Alberta Union of Municipalities. H1e represented Red Deer in the Alberta legislature
from 1909 to 1918, and for the last eight years
of that pcriod hc led the Opposition. In 1918,
almost thirty years ago, he was appointed to
the Senate, and ever since he had continued
to be keenly interested in public affairs.
Senator Michener was already advanced in
years when I was appointed te the Senate,
but I cannot say how mueh I appreciated his
kindly and happy disposition, and how deepl3ý
1 was impressed witli his wide knowledge and
experience. Despite his advanced years he
was a most faithful attendant of the sittings
of the Senate and various committees, of
which he ýwas a very valuable member. H1e
will long be missed from the halls of jparliament, in which he was such a familiar figure.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, for some littie time I have felt that our
late colleague would soon be called to another
sphere of activity. H1e was one of the pioneer
men of our western provinces. Coming from
one of the older provinces, well educated and
well trained, he devoted his life to the welfare of his adopted province of Alberta. Men
of bis character and ability give life and direction to the people. H1e was a family man,
with a large family of boys and girls thoroughly trained and well able to take their
part in the life of this country. To us in the
western provinces he was known as one of the
pillars of righteousness and good living. Those
of us who knew of bim prier to coming to
Ottawa recognized in him an outstanding
leader of public opinion in Alberta, and naturally we were ahl delighted when the Union
government appointed him to this chamber.
Older members of the Senate know, of course,
much better than I do the fine service be gave
here to the cause of public life ini Canada. H1e
added to the strengtb and standing of the
chamber by the singleness of purpose with
which he carried on ail his activities while
here. H1e early forgot bis political training,
and followed as a guiding star what was in
the best interests of Canada as a whole. 1
have been here for only twelve years--a rela-

tively short time, though longer than I like
to admit-but in that time I came to trust
bis judgment. I felt I could always go to
him and get information, based on wbat was
in the best interests of not only bis nwn province of Alberta, but of Canada as a wbole.
The Parliamentary Guide mentions bis
business relations. H1e always believed that
a large oul deposit existed under the whole
province of Alberta. H1e was a constant
advocate of the policy of development, and
was one of tbe men who helped to forward the
work of discovering oul in that province.
I can only add on behaif of those on this
side of the bouse that we are glad be gave
such great service to bis country and to ail of
us,' and we deeply regret bis passing. He
brought credit te the Senate, to Canada, and
to the public life of this country.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourahie members of tbe Sefiate, as the late Senator
Michener was one of the senior members of
the Senate, it was my privilege ta bave been
more or less ciosely associated witb him for
almost tbirty years. I realize that the members
wbo have been appointed here during the last
fifteen years have not had, an opportunity to
appreciate bim at bis worth. His youtb and
early manhood were spent in Eastern Canada;
and what you might eall bis active years were
spent in the West. H1e was a member of the
Legisiature of Alberta for nine years, anid
during most of that time was leader of bis
party. With that background he came to the
Senate well qualified to take an active part in
the deliberations of this chamber. H1e did take
an active and influential part in the proceedings for many years, but unfortunately about
fifteen years ago he was afflicted with what
laymen eall a stroke. I know that gentlemen
of the medical profession would tell me that
that is not the proper terme, but they may use
another if they wisb to do so. Although the
stroke lef t him mentally strong he was more
or less physically weak, and from that time on
he was unable to participiate in the work of
the Senate as he bad previously done; but ho
stili took a keen interest- in the work, and
when he spoke, as he occasionally did, be was
always listened ta witb close attention.
As tbe leader on this side of the bouse (Hon.
Mr. Haig) bas said, we were ail glad to go to
Senator Michener to get advice. During the
present session be was a desk-mate of mine,
and I had looked forward witb hope te baving him as sucb for many years; but that was
not ta be.

SENATE
The late senator has left to mourn his loss
Mrs. Michener, four daughters and three sons.
One of his sons is, as the honourable leader
of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) bas
pointed out, Provincial Secretary of Ontario.
I shall always remember Senator Michener
as a cultured gentleman. I think it would
be no mistake to refer to him as a gentleman
of the old school. I join with other members
of the Senate in extending to Mrs. Michener
and the members of ber family our deepest
sympathy.

If I nay assume to speak on behalf of bis
associates from the province of Alberta, I
offer to the family and to his fellow-members
in the Senate our sympathy and an expression
of our regard and respect for him as one of
our great colleagues.

Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
Honourable
senators, I should like to say something about
the late Senator Michener, because my
acquaintance with him ran over the whole
period of his parliamentary career.
We
entered the Legislature of Alberta at the same
time, and I knew him in the few years I was
there; and of course we became intimately
acquainted as fellow-members of the Senate.
As a citizen of Alberta he was all that bas been
said about him. He began his career in public life as mayor of Red Deer, one of the
most progressive communities in the province,
and I think it can be said that be was largely
responsible for the type of government that
town has had over a number of years. He
was leader of the Conservative opposition in
the Legislature of Alberta for two terms. The
party achieved more encouraging results in the
two provincial campaigns while he was leader
than any time in the history of the province,
from 1.05 to the present day. That too may
give sone evidence of the standing he held
amongst bis own people in Alberta. He was
looked upon as an honourable and straightforward leader, and be was well acquainted
with all the problems that had faced the
province from almost the time it came into
existence. I had a very high personal regard
for him when lie came into the legislature as
an Independent Conservative, and I saw evidence of his independence through the years,
even bere in the Senate when sometimes he
took a stand that was not wholly in accord
with that of some of his colleagues and of some
of us on this side. He stood by his convictions.
Before concluding my remarks may I pay
tribute to the devotion of Mrs. Michener to
the late Senator during his years of illness. She
was most attentive to him and came with him
to his room in the Senate almost every day.
Sie was a wonderfully loyal companion to him.
The m embers of the family, some of whom I
know, were given the advantage of a good
education, by a father who believed in education. All are a credit to the late Senator and
to Mrs. Michener.

The passing of this honourable gentleman,
as that of many others from this chamber since
I became a member, in 1935, reminds me, as it
must remind us all, that as the years go by our
friends and colleagues of yesterday are rapidly
disappearing. It is always with deep regret
that we learn of their death; and we must
admit that, with each passing, life becomes less
cheerful.
May I evoke the recollection of those who
have gone during the past twelve years by
referring to them by name, to remind ourselves
of their great valour, te cherish again their
memoiy and pay them another tribute of
respect.

EXCISE TAX BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN (for fion.
Mr. Robertson) moved the second reading of
Bill 271, an Act to amend the Special War
Revenue Act and to change its title to the
Excise Tax Act.
fie said: Honourable senators, some amendments to tbe Special War Revenue Act are
before us. and I tbink I sbould particularly
direct your attention to bbc fact that it is
proposed to change the name of the act from
the Special War Revenue Act to tbe Excise
Tax Act. The Special War Revenue Act was
originally passed in 1915. At tbat time it was
stated to be a temfporary measure for the purpose of enlarging tbe revenues of the Canadian government in time of war. I caîl attention to tbis in a kindly spirit of warning tbat,
wbile taxes easily grow upon us, it is difficult
to get rid of them. We bave persisted witb
the Special War Revenue Act*from 1915 untîl
1947, and as it bas now been decided that it is
no longer to be of a temporary nature, it is
proposed that its naine be cbanged from one
associated with a time of war. In the meantime tbe act bas been carried througb a period
of two wars, and now altbougb we are asked
to approve a change in namne, the taxes will
still go on.
In the bill itself tbere is notbing very contentions. The Special War Revenue Act grew
up by the addition of items as the search for

414

SENATE

more revenues went on, and a lot of compartmonts were created in the act which resulted
in a great deal of duplication in connection
with returns and penalties; and now an effort
is being made to consolidate snme related
parts and te repeal obsolete sections.
The second phase of the bill seeks to impiement budget resolutions. May I deal with
thema first? The first budget resohîition which
the bill implements has te do with transportation taxes. It removes the transportation
tax tram foreign travel. se that when this bill
bc cornes law there will bo no excise tax on
trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific travel. This
will mean thiat when travelling by direct route
trom a point in Canada to the United Kingdom there wvill ho no tax. The tas, of course,
would stili apply on transportation from Canada to any place in the United States, just as
it applies to travel in the reverse direction.
The purpose of that amendment is to put our
air transportation in the trans-Atlantie and
trans-Pacifie fields in a competitive position
%vith that of the United States.
Sev eral other changes have been madle in
this counection. For instance, the tax has been)
removcd on air travel leadýing to logging. lumbering and mining centres, from the end of
r'ail 01r steamboat transportation te the point
where the passenger desires to be settled. The
Governor in Couincil is giv en the power, as
and when hoe may deemn it necessary, te reduice
or abolish the transportation tax.
The second budget resolution which the bill
implements deals with one phase of the secalled suigar tex. In the last few years the
excise ta.x on sugýar and verieuis components
was reduced to one cent a pound, but the
excise tax of two cents a pound was left on
table syrups, including corn syrup. This bill
seeks te amend the second schedule of the act
by making the rate of tax on table syrups,
încluding corn syrup, one cent a pound instead
of twu cents a pound.
The next budget resolution deals with the
gasoline tax. As announced, this particular
tax was repealed as et April 1 et this year,
se it is now a fait accompli. The government,
in removing that tas, gave up a possible source
of revenue et about forty million dollars a
year.
Ameng other resolutions that are being
implemented is one for the collection et sales
tas on taxable goods that are sold on instalment payments. Apparently the department
lied some untortunate experiences in tbeir
interpretat ion as te the application of sales
tas on instalment purchases, particularly
where delivery was net made and where title

assurance doubly sure, it is proposed te emend

instance, goods brought in for resale or te ho

I should draw the attention et henourable
members te the fact that the bill gives the
force ef law te an order in counicil passed

MUNICIPAL IMPROVEMENTS
ASSISTANCE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. CYRILLE VAILLANCOURT (for
Hon. Mr. Robertson) moved the second reading of Bill 256, an act to amnend the Municipal
Improvements Assistance Act, 1938.
He said: Honourable members, the purpose
of this bull is to permit a municipal corporation which bas undergone a reorganization to,
take over a loan made under the act to a
former corporation.
The act was passed in 1938 -to authonize
loans to, municipalities to finance seif-liquidating projects, sucli as extensions to water or
electric-light systems. Between 1938 and 1941
a total of almost seven million dollars was
advanced to various municipalities for this
purpose. After 1941 the boans were suspended
because of the wartime shortage of materials
and labour and the improved financial standing of most municipalities. In certain cases

415

the original municipal corporations bave been
reorganized; for instance, a local improvement
district may become a village. This measure
autborizes the transfer of the boan from the
former municipal corporation to tbe new
corporation.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: May I ask tbe
honourable senator a question? Can be tell
me wbat municipalities will be covered by
tbis bill? Does it apply only to those wbich
bave already received assistance, or also to
those wbich will be assisted in future? To
how many municipalities does it apply?
Hon. Mr. VAILLANCOURT: A total of
109: Prince Edward Island 1, Nova Seotia 7,
New Brunswick 7, Quebec 17, Manitoba 5,
Saskatcbewan 28, Alberta 23, British Columbia
21. Tbe total amounts are more tban seven
million dollars; and tbis law was operative
especially between 1938 and 1941.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Tbe bill does not
affect any new municipalities?
Hon. Mr. VAILLANCOURT: No, not any
new municipalities.
Tbe motion was agreed to, and tbe bill was

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. VAILLANCOURT (for Hon. Mr.
Robertson) moved the second reading of Bill
257, an Act to, amend the Farm Improvemnent
Loans Act, 1944.
He said: Honourable senators, Bill 257 is
very sbort and is self-explana tory. Section 2
of the act is amended by adding thereto tbe
following subsection:
(2) For the 'purposes of this act, and in
respect of any farm improvement boan, for'the
purposes of the Bank Act, "livestock"' includes
poultry.
Tbis means that a person who raises poultry
may take advantage of tbe Farm Improvement
Loans Act.
A short history of this legislation since it
came into force on March 1, 194, might be
interesting at tbis stage.
Its purpose is to, provide for certain loans to
farmers wbo wish to improve their standard of
living, tbrough the purchase of farming impiements or cattle, through repaira, or extensions
to, farm buildings, or electrical installationsin sbort, tbrough tbe purcbase or repair or
extention of anything needed to improve tbe
farmer's lot and to render life on tbe farm
more attractive and working conditions easier.
People complain tbat rural areas are being
deserted. It is no use trying to keep farmers
and their sons on tbe ]and if we do not make

416

life easier for them. Some may dlaim that
it is heaithier to live outdoors. That is true.
But the man who works eight hours a day can
rest at nigbt, whereas the farmer, particularly
during the summer months, often bas to work
from dawn to dusk; so 1 say that if we care
to have food to eat tomorrow we must ta -e
the necessary steps to keep the farmer on the
land.
The total amount that can be loaned
throughout Canada under this Act is $250,'000,000. Loins are to be made through the
banks, under a government undertaking to
mîke up losses up to 10 per cent. The loins
are granted for a period not excceding ten

years and the rate of interest is 5 per cent.
The maximum amount for a single loan to an
individual is $3,000.
Between Mar-eh 1, 1945, and December 31,
1946, the total amount loaned was $13,262,307.65. Off this total, $5,181,161.94 bas been
reimhursed, wbich is slightly more than 39 per
cent off the total amount loaned.
Up to December 31, 1946, no dlaim hîd been
rcccived by the governiment from lenders for
lo.s-cs incurred.

INCOME WAR TAX BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN (for Hon.
Mr. Robertson) moved the second reading of
Bill 269, an Act to amend the Income War
Tax Act.
Honourable senators, the bill
He said:
which we have before us provides a number
of amendments to the Income War Tax Act.
Since the general tone of the bill provides for
a reduction in rates, one must accept reductions in taxation kindly and sincerely.
Nevertheless, I must point out the other things
that the bill does, because I have always
found that in the beginning legislation of
this kind proceeds along a certain plan or
principle, and then the old method of trial
and error starts to work out and it is claimed
that doors are found to be opening up which
it was thought never might open, and blocks
are put in the law which may possibly change
its principle. That is what has happened as
to some of the amendments that are proposed
in this bill. Some of them are ameliorative;
that is to say, they are to the .advantage of
the taxpayer. For instance, during the war
years exemptions allowed for dependents were
limited. Under the act a man supporting
dependents-a wife, or children, or other
dependents-was not entitled to an exemption
unless the dependents were qualified on a
residence basis. For example, they qualified
if they resided in Canada, or in another British dominion, or in a country contiguous to
Canada, or in some country allied with Canada in the conduct of the war in which this
country was engaged. However, the legislation is being broadened by the amendment,
and so long as a man can establish that he is
that
wherever
dependent,
supporting a
dependent may live, he is qualified to apply
for exemption.
In another direction the government is reaching out. It expects to get four million dollars
in additional revenue this year from Canadian
subsidiary companies with parent companies
abroad, such as in the United States. Heretofore there was a provision in our Income Tax
Act that dividends passing from Canadian
subsidiary companies to foreign parent companies under these circumstances were not taxable. This exemption is now being repealed,
and provision is made for a specific tax, at the
rate of five per cent, on non-resident companies
upon their receipt of the dividends. In the
next breath provision is made for what is
called foreign tax credits, by recognizing that
companies should not be subject to tax upon
the same revenues in two different countries
and that there should be setting-off privileges.
83168-27

That represents largely the policy of the
government as contained in the act today. At
present the law allows a Canadian company
a set-off against its Canadian tax in respect of
the tax paid to a foreign country, in connection
with the dividends received from a company in
that foreign country, if the Canadian company
owns the other company one hundred per cent.
That is now modified so as to provide that
anything over fifty per cent ownership will
establish entitlement to foreign tax credit.
Honourable senators know that during the
war years in Canada taxes on salaries and
wages were deducted at the source, and the
employer was obligated to remit the taxes to
the government. A man might work at the
rate of $50 a week for three weeks and his
employer, in deducting the tax, would compute it on the basis that the man earned $50 a
week throughout the year. Therefore, in the
earlier war years considerable excess taxes
were paid in to the government by employers
on behalf of employees, and then there arose
the problem of getting refunds. Some taxpayers were slow in applying for their refunds
and many of them lost their rights to do so
because application had to be made in
writing within twelve months of the close
of the calendar year in which the payment
was made. That time is now extended,
and any claim arising prior to December 31,
1945, may be asserted up to December 31,
1948. In addition to that it is also provided
that without any obligation and of his own
volition the minister may, at or prior to the
time of the issue of the notice of assessment,
make a refund. If he does not do that, the
taxpayer himself, after receiving the notice
of assessment, may apply in writing for a
refund, within two years from the end of
the calendar year in which payment was made,
or within twelve months of the date at which
notice of assessment was issued: whichever is
the later. I think the government is attempting to give the person who may have accumulated refunds every possible leeway in getting
his money back.
Hon. Mr. EULER: My honourable friend
stated that the government may return that
money without an application being filed.
Hon. Mr. IAYDEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Will it be the practice
of the government to give it back, if it is
known that a taxpayer is entitled to it?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I am simply stating
the various provisions in the bill. I would
not expect that every taxing officer in every

SENATE

jurisdiction would be equally alert. Some of
them would see to it that a refund was made
wherever the taxpayer had paid ton much.

made where the assessment has been determined and it is shown that the taxpayer has
overpaid his tax liability.

Hon. Mr. EULER: There should be consistency in the practice.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The department
usually writes me to the effect that it will
apply the overpayment on the next year's
taxes.

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I agree, but I think
it is the part of wisdom for the government
to provide the taxpayer with as many means
as possible for getting his money back. Either
the government may refund it without application, or the taxpayer himsel-f may ask for
a refund.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Will it actually be a
refund or simply a credit?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: A refund.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: May I ask the honourable senator a question? If a resident of
Canada now underpays his tax he is sent a
notice and given so long to pay the balance,
and if he does not do so be is subject to a
fine. When he overpays, will the government refund the overpayment within any
reasonable time? At present it usually takes
a year or more to get a refund from the
department.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The difficulty, as I see
it, is that the government cannot determine
whether the taxes have been overpaid or not
until the amounts returned have been investigated and assessments made. As my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Davies) must know, in
the last year assessments have been brought
pretty well up to date. I believe the assessments on personal income tax must now be
determined up to the end of 1945. I know
that they are in the Toronto area, and I
expect that they are in other areas as well.
However, until a notice of assessment is made
and the tax determined, the government cannot say whether or not a man has overpaid
his taxes, and consequently it cannot make a
refund. I have found that if companies report
that they have overpaid their taxes for the
preceding year, the department looks into the
figures furnished but will not give a refund in
those circumstances. If it finds there has been
overpayment it will transfer the excess as a
credit for the following year. In that way the
government keeps the money, but it goes forward to the taxpayer's credit next year.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: In my experience
that is the general practice with everyone, not
only with companies.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: It may be the general
practice, but I speak from a fairly broad
knowledge of the actual physical refund being

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: May I refer to another
door that is being closed? Honourable senators will recall that by the Income War Tax
Act a dividend passing from one corporation to another, within certain limitations, is
not taxable in the hands of the recipient corporation. Shares may be redeemed at a premium of 2, 3 or 4 per cent above the issue price.
For instance, preferred shares issued at $100
may be redeemable at $1021 or $103. The'
difference between what the company receives
for the shares and what it pays to buy them
back on redemption is called premium. Under
the act as it stands the premium is called a
dividend. When shares belonging to an individual are redeemed the dividends received
are considered to be taxable income in his
hands; but when a company receives dividends from another company they are not
taxable. A fair practice, I believe, has developed, whereby the individual, in order to get
himself on a par with the corporation, can
sell his security, after it has been called for
redemption and before redemption date, to a
corporation, and avoid income tax to the
amount of the dividend. That door is being
closed by this bill, and provision is made that
where a corporation redeems its shares at a
premium the amount of premium received on
and after May 31, 1947, must be included in
the computation of income tax for that year.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD (King's): What
section does the honourable gentleman refer
to?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Clause 8 of the bill,
repealing Section 17 of the act.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: When is the provision
to become effective?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: It is effective in
respect of any such premium on redemption
of shares on and after May 31, 1947.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Dividends paid by one
corporation to another are not now taxable.
Is there any change in that respect?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No, except that the
premium is no longer considered a dividend
for purposes of income tax.

regular dividends of a company.

HAYDEN:

JUNE 17, 1947
A change is made where security is received
in lieu of interest or dividends. For instance,
there may be arrears of interest on bonds
which have been in default for a number of
years; or shares may be cumulative in the
sense that dividends on them have not been
paid but have been allowed to accumulate for
a number of years. If a reorganization takes
place in those circumstances new bonds rnight
be issued consolidating the principal and
accumulated arrears of interest, or a new type
of share security might be issued consolidating
the arrears of dividends and the capital value
of the previous shares. The departrnent by
this bill proposes to establish the principle
that the tax liability in respect of that something whicb is received in relation f0 the
accumulated arrears of interest or dividends,
shall faîl in the year in which. the funding
security is receîved by the bondholdérs. That
applies on and after January 1, 1947.
In- order to arrive at the taxable income
from this source it is necessary to determine
the value of the security, or the portion of ifs
total value applicable to that element of
interest or dividends which is required to be
included in the income tax return of the
person receiving that security in the year in
which lie receives it.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is also the case,
is it not, on accumulated bond interest?
Hon. Mr. JIAYDEN: Yes, on bonds and
shares.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That has been the case
in the past?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No; the tax liability
has not applied to the year in which tlhe
security was received.
Hon. Mr. EULER: May I interrupt rny
honourable friend further? I know of an
individual case in connection with Province
of Alberta bonds which were in arrears. For
some years only 50 per cent of the interest
was paid. At a later date I believe the
province recognized the liability and paid the
full 100 per cent. Sorne bondholders did not
cash the coupons on the basis of 50 per cent,
because in doing so they would lose ail chance
of getting the other 50 per cent. If they
accepted the accurnulated interest for a period
of seven, eight or ten years they were made
hiable for incoine tax on that arnount in the
year in wbich they received it, instead of
apportîoning it to the years in whîch fhe
interest was earned.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: My friend is introdueing sometbing new. In conneetion with
the Alberta bonds lie is referring to payments on the balance of interest, whereas I arn
83168-274

talking about a provision by way of amendment. But let us suppose that the province
of Alberta, instead of paying the unpaid
accumulated arrears of 50 per cent, had issued
debentures for the full amount of ifs obligation
and handed thern to the bondholders. In
those circumsfances the bondholders would
be receiving security for money, but could
flot receive the money. If one receives qua
interest it represents incorne in the year in
which it is received, the same as salaries,
profits from business operations or anything
else. But heretofore if one received security
ns a consolidation and as an evidence of the
accumulation o.f un-paid interest, it represented
a different measuring stick and different timing for the determination of income. The,
department by this amendrnent says that if
one recelves a security, the fax liability is
determined and falîs in the year in which lie
receives the security.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: That is a change in
the regulations?
Hon. Mr. THAYDEN: That is a change.
Hon. Mr. EULER. Ha.s that not always
been the situation where one received a stock
diividend in lieu of a cash dividend?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No, a stock dividend
is sornething else. There is specific provision
in the Income War Tax Act.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The principle is exactly
the same.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I ar n ot quarrelling
with it. I arn rnerely pointing out that the
departrnent is now proposing by arnendment
to the Income War Tax Act .to make for the
first time tax liability on arrears of interest
and dividends, when funded, applicable to
the year in which the security is received.
Whether that principle is new or old, it is a
new application of if.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I think that is a very
important feature. For instance, if preferred
stock bearing interest at 5 per cent is in
arrears for five years and a reorganization
takes place, and the holder of sucli stock is
given a new security for $25 on each share,
is the new security treated ýas a profit for the
year in which it is received?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: It is treated as
incorne.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: That seerna to me to,
be a rather drastic measure.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Honourable senators
will recaîl that hast year the Income War Tax
Act was extended in ifs scope to deal with
certain phases of co-operative enteTprises.

420

SENATE

This same principle bas now been extended
to allocations in proportion to patronage, and
in the determination of income for tax liability
they shall apply in the year in which the
allocations are received and not to the time
the payment is made.
There are several other points, which, if I
may, I will hurry through. There is the question of deferred maintenance and repairs. A
peculiar situation existed in this connection to
which I should call your attention. Under certain circumstances, a taxpayer carrying on a
business or doing underground work in connection with the operation of a mine was given
the privilege of charging against his operations
in a year a percentage of what was called
deferred maintenance and repairs. During a
certain period of the war it was desired not to
handicap the war effort by having labour
expended on such things, but the taxpayer
was to be enabled to proceed at a period which
would be proclaimed by the Governor-inCouncil. This year, I believe, an order in
council was passed, P.C. 1502, providing for
the period. Then, I understand. difficulties
developed in connection with the housing programme, and it was suggested that to enable
the mines to get the benefit of doing deferred
maintenance in competition with the development of housing projects was wrong, so it has
now been provided by amendment of this
section of the Income War Tax Act that they
will get the benefit of this delferred maintenance and repairs in a twelve months period to
be fixed by the Governor-in-Council, ending
not later than December 31, 1950.
Then, to overcome the effect of having
passed the order in council, the amending
section goes on to provide that Order in
Council 1502, already made, dictating or providing for such a period shall be deemed not
to have come into force.
Then in connection with mining and logging
companies that are subject to provincial income tax, the government under the act provides certain deductions from the federal tax
otherwise payable, but the tax deductible must
be taxes imposed on the same income or part
of it. In other words, it is not on a tax paid
basis, which might be a year abead or a year
behind; the provincial and, federal taxes made
up must be in relation to the same income;
and in these circumstances you can deduct
your provincial income taxes on logging and
mining operations from the amount of federal
income tax otherwise payable. That applies
to 1947 and succeeding years.
Then there is a section in the bill providing
for returns of information. It struck me as
being a little bit ambitious in its scope, because
one would suggest that under the Income War

Tax Act at the present time there is almost
every bit of power and machinery possible for
gathering every bit of information the department may want. But provision is made in
clause 1 of the bill giving the Governor-inCouncil power to make regulations, first of all
prescribing the evidence required to establish
facts relevant to assessments under the act,
and secondly, requiring any class of persons to
give any class of information required under the
Act. That strikes me as being important and
certainly a little unusual. I wonder how far
it.s effect would go if the asessment were
questioned and the matter got into the courts,
for the Governor-in-Council by regulation may
prescribe the evidencc required to establish
facts relevant to assessments under the act.
How that may or may not interfere with the
determination of facts, if you got before the
court, as to whether you were properly assessable or not, I am not prepared to say. But it
does seem to have elements which might be
some cause of danger.
Another 1ohase dealt with, another door
which is closed. is in connection with private
companies.
Under part 18 of the Income
War Tax Act, enacted two years ago, the idea
behind dealing with private companies was
this. There are a number of companies where
a man. by his own individual initiative, may
over the period of a lifetime have dcveloped
a business enterprise by himself, or with himself and family. Instead of taking the money
out he bas plowed it back into betterment of
buildings and cquipment and built up a very
substantial surplus. He did tbat, say, between
1917 and 1939, when over a very considerable
period the rate of tax was quite low. Then
these people, growing older, with substantial
surpluses, high income tax rates, and high
succession dutv rates, were faced with an
almost impossible situation if their families
attemptcd to liquidate that sort of business.
As a matter of fact in many instances it was
demonstrated before
the commission of
inquiry that, after you paid out all the surplus
in dividends in order to provide money to
pay succession duty on the value of the
shares. the income tax on the dividends mig1ht
be such that you would be minus enough
money to pay the succession duty. The government, recognizing that inequity, enacted
a special part of the Income War Tax Act
providing a basis and rate of tax over all on
which surpluses of undistributed income
accumulating to the end of 1939 could be taken
out. It was a new section, with new provisions, new methods and new formulae; and
as a result, doors were opened which they did
not expect; and a part of this enactment as
to do, of course. with the closing of these

JUNE 17, 1947
doors. For instance, getting back to the same
question of dividends passing from one corporation to another as not taxable, or, until
the end of 1942, the recipients of dividends
from family corporations being in the position that the dividends were not taxable in
their hands: some of these companies were
family corporations, and some of the shareholders of private companies were private
companies again; and one situation that
developed was that if a private company
sought to take advantage of this relief provided in the Income War Tax Act, and to
make its election and pay this tax at the end
of December, 1944, which was the critical
period, at that time you might find that one
of the shareholders of that private company
was another company, so that the amount of
income that would go to it might not be
taxable in any event, and there might be no
distribution until 1945 or 1946. In the meantime some individuals might come along who
were alert enough to purchase the shares from
the corporation that was the shareholder. So
when the dividend was paid they were in
receipt of non-taxable ýincome in that form
amounting to substantial sums in these cases.
So the department in this bill works out special provisions dealing with that sort of situation, and imposing a tax at the end of the
road. In those circumstances one does not,
through that-shall we say-evolution, escape
the burden of taxation which such transactions were intended to carry.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It
active, I suppose?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:

will not be retroYes.

Hon. Mr. EULER: How far back?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I am sorry that I
cannot give you the date. You will find it
on page 11; clause 14, dealing with new
section 97 of the Act. You may look at the
explanatory note.
I think at this stage I should make this
comment, that, in all the years during which
I have had to consider legislation and read
bills which were being introduced, I have never
found any taxing act whose explanatory notes
were so complete and so understandable as we
find in the Income War Tax bill this year.
I intended before I finished to make some
comment on that, because the work is really
very well done.
Now then, on this matter we were talking
about, namely private companies, you will find
this statement in the explanatory note:
To give effect to paragraph -13 of the resolution which provided "that a tax be imposed on
an individual who holds shares of a private

company that paid tax on undistributed income
in accordance with section 96 of the Act, which
shares were held on December 31, 1944, by a
corporation or other shareholder who would not
have been liable to tax in respect of dividends
on the shares so that the private company was
not required to pay tax on the respective portion of undistributed incorne, such tax to be
payable in respect of dividends paid to the
individual out of the said respective portion of
undistributed income, at the following rates:
(a) where the shares were acquired by the
individual in the years 1945 and ý1946-at a
rate of 15 per cent; and
(b) where the shares were acquired by the
individual on or after January 1, 1947-at the
rate that the private cornpany would have paid
tax on the respective portion of the undistributed incorne if an individual had held the
shares on December 31, '1944."
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Why
between the two dates?
Hon.
It may

fifteen
because
no idea

the

difference

Mr. HAYDEN: I cannot answer that.
be to recognize the fact that if transwere completed in 1945 and 1946 a
per cent rate is enough to charge,
the person who was making them had
he was going to pay any tax.

Hon. Mr. EULER: They were within the
law at the time?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: May I ask the honourable senator a question? Supposing that an
individual had a large share in a company and
owing to high income tax, when dividends were
paid, instead of taking his shares for himself,
he formed another company and handed the
shares over to this second compahy, so that
the dividends would be going from the parent
company to the subsidiary company, what
would happen to that individual when be tried
to get the money from the second company?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: That'depends. First,
I should say that the definition of a private
company is enlarged in the present amendments so as to include up' to seventy-five
sharebolders other than those who are officers
or employees. Heretofore, it was fifty shareholders. It is difficult to conceive that the
kind of company that the honourable senator
from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies) speaks
about would have more than seventy-five
shareholders, so it would be classified as a
private company. In those circumstances, of
course, you have got to go back to see what
the rates are on undistributed income. The
government has even enlarged this now on a
basis set out in the amendments for private
companies incorporated after that zero date,
December 31, 1939. Conditions are provided
on which they may distribute all undistributed
income subject to tax.

SENATE
SENATE
Mr. DAVIES: Can the undistributed
be taken out of the second company
rate prevailing today rather than the
rate?

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No. Let me put it
this way. To deal with that sort of situation,
where the surplus is accumulated over a great
many years, the rates are substantially lower
than the prevailing rates, so that it is intended
to be a benefit. It does not go the whole way,
and I feel it could go much farther because it
is certainly putting a penalty on industry and
enterprise, since out of some of those accumulations over a period of a long time great
businesses bave developed and substantial
employment and wealth for Canada have been
built up. Yet, because people did not take
their money out as they went along, because
they were more concerned about building up a
permanent industry and enterprise in Canada,
they ran into the penalty of very high taxation,
almost confiscatory taxation. This is intended
to relieve that.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: That only applies
to profits built up in that way prior to 1939,
does it not?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes, but what I am
pointing out now is that in the amendments
provision is made to carry the thing through
in relation to a private company incorporated
after 1939.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Let me give you an
example. Say that a private company was
incorporated in 1930 and it made no profits
until after 1939. The company has made considerable profits since that time, and they are
all in the business. What is it going to cost
to take them out? Will it cost the regular
taxation rate or a rate under this measure?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: That is one of the
questions I have marked down to ask the
representatives Who appear before the committee. The department has covered a certain
situation up to that date, but whether it was
intended to deal with accumulations after 1939
I am not at all sure.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: We have many of
these companies in Saskatchewan which did
not make any money during the depression,
but since 1939 certain surpluses have been
accumulated and they have not been able to
draw the money out except at the current rate
of taxation.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: There are also two
provisions dealing with the new tax rates of
individuals. You have a composite rate for
1947, and then you have a new rate for 1948.
The composite rate for 1947 is set out in a

schedule to the bill. Generally speaking, what
is done is to add together the rate existing before this bill was introduced and the rate
existing afterwards and split them. That
composite rate is the rate that applies. For
instance, the prevailing rate on the first $500
is twenty-two per cent. The new rate is ten
per cent. Adding the two rates we get
thirty-two per cent, and we find that the
starting rate for 1947 is sixteen per cent. For
1948 it is substantially lower. Honourable
senators can look at the scbedule themselves
as set out in the act.
There is another provision dealing with
deductions to a taxpayer exploring and drilling for natural gas and oil, and for minerals,
and also in the case of companies engaged in
the refining and marketing of petroleum and
in exploratory work-deep drilling, oil drilling
and geophysical work and so on. Heretofore,
a percentage of the expenses was permitted
to be deducted from taxes.
There is a
departure in this amendment which permits
one to deduct the entire expenses from
income, but the result is the sane as if permission were given to deduct say 20 or 22
per cent of the expenses from the tax. While
it puts one on the same basis, it seems to be
a more sensible approach to the matter.
I am frank to say that from reading the
pertinent sections of the bill I have not been
able to relate to the whole set-up some particular clauses dealing with taie allowing of
deductions to taxpayers engaged in various
occupations. Someone may have slippcd up
in the drafting of the bill. I know that it was
subject to amendment in another place and
was printed hurriedly. There may be some
connecting link that is not quite correct, but
I arm sure we can clear that up. The principle
is clear, that the expenses may be deducted
from income.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD (King's): Will the
honourable senator please tell me what section
relates to appeals?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The appeals are in the
original act, and are not dealt with here.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Will the honourable
senator tell me when the new Income Tax
Act is to be brought down?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I am sorry, I am not
in a position to say.
Hon. Mr. MeLEAN: I would like to ask
the honourable senator a question. He spoke
about the 5 per cent tax on subsidiary companies operating in Canada. Does that pro-

423

JUNE 17, 1947
vision apply only to companies from the
United States or does it also apply to United
Kingdomn companies?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The provisions of the
reciprocal tax agreement between Canada and
the United Kingdomn are sueh that this tax
would not apply on diviâends as between the
two countries. There is no such reciprocal provision in our agreements between Canada and
the United States. S-o in theise circumastances
a Canadian subsidiary of a foreign company,
beiog a United States company, in declaring
dividends payable to a non-resident parent
company would have to deduet 5 per cent.
There is one provision which I think may
in its full application create some 65omplications. But it is no part of my duty to point
out possible legal complications; I arn simply
explaining the intentions of the bill.
Hon. Mr. MeLEAN: I think the agreement
with the United Kingdom expires at the end
of this year. Is it automaticahly renewed after
1947?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Has Canada a reeiprocal agreement with the United States on the
question of taxes?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: We have on many
phases of our income tax, but this situation
relates to Canadian subsidiaries.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: It is a new provision?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: There is no parallel.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: It is a new tax and it
may be the subjeet of a reciprocîty.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: It could be the subjeet of a supphementary agreement, but in
the meantime it is effective taxation.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS moved the adjournment
of the debate.
The motion was agreed to.

INCOME WAR TAX BILL
MOTION

FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Hayden for the second reading of Bill
an Act to amend the Income War Tax

the
Mr.
269,
Act.

Hon. IVA C. FALLIS: Honourable senators, as all members of this bouse are aware
by this time, the chief criticism which lias
been levelled at the budget recently brought
down in another place has been from that
group of wage earners whose yearly earnings
are not sufficient to bring them within the
Income War Tax Act. They are subject to
the sales tax and all the other direct and
indirect taxes which are in existence, and the
budget brought themn no relief. There has
been a protest froin that very large group in
this country, because they feel that there is
discrimination; that when benefits were being
hîanded out it should have been by removal
of the sales tax, or in some way that would
have benefited all groups in the community.
and not simply those who were paying income
tax. But I have no doubt that the government will reserve that action until what it
considers a more propitious occasion.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Meaning-?
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: There is another very
large group of people in this country to which
I wish to refer particularly this afternoon, a
group who also feel that they are being discriminated against in
the income tax law.
I brouglt this matter to the attention of the
house on a previous occasion and, while I must
admit that my efforts to date have not produced any tangible results, still, because the
matter is of vital concern to thousands of
women across Canada and is having a very
harmful effect upon community life in m.any
respects, and because women's
national
organizations have gone on record as being
opposed to the legislation and many women
have aked me to speak further on their
behalf, I beg the indulgence of the house for
a short time this afternoon while I again
discuss the matter.
I refer to the legislation that was enacted
at the last session whereby the amount of
tax-free money which a married woman may
earn outside of lier home was reduced from
8660 to $250 a year. After ber earnings pass
the $250 stage lier husband's exemption is
affected in proportion to the amount of ber
income. I think honourable senators will
agree with me that at the present time the
demand for women workers in practically

JUNE 18, 1947
every line of activity througbout Canada far
exceeds the supply. This is especially true in
those occupations where the work is done
almost exclusively by women; that is, occupations in whjch men either cannot or wil1 fot
replace women. In ail seasonal and parttime industry the work is of course done
almost exciusively by women, for the obvious
reason that men cannot take jobs that last for
only part of a year. Teaching in the public
sehools is done largely by women, because
of the small remuneration. At the beginning
of last year 4,200 sehool units in Canada were
closed, on account of the shortage of teachers;and I arn told by people who are in close
touch with the situation that more married
womnen, teachers will resign in future if the
reduced exemption is continued, in wbich
event the shortage will becomne much worse
and more schooiroom's wîll be closed.
But the one, field of service in which the iii
effects of this legisiation are felt more than in
any other, flot only on the part of the individual but more particularly on the part of the
community, is n'ursing. I do flot need to tell
honourable members what they already know
so' well, that during the past year many
hospitals have hact to curtail their activities
drastically because, of lack of help, and that
the only thing enabling many others to carry
on bas been the assistance of married women
ex-nurses.
We read about that situation in the press
every day, but I was interested in reading
about it from another angle the other day in
the report of proceedings of the Standing
Committee on, Immigration and Labour, of
wbich My good friend the honourable senator
from Parkdale! (Hon. Mr. Murdock) is chairman. On pages 275 and 276 of that report
honourable senators wiil find a discussion of
the proposai Vo hei-p make up the sbortage by
bringing to Canada a number of nurses from
among displaced persons. The Mayor of
London was the witness, and hie was being
questioned, by members of the committeý as
to bis opinions on the subjeet, and as Vo conditions in bis home cityý At page 276 tbe
bonourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) asked this question:
You mentioned the need for nurses, did you
not?
The reply was:
Yes, our hospitals are looking for them ail
the time.
The statemen-t was then made that there
were 3,891 female nurses available from displaced persons camps. The honourable senator from. Toronto-Trinity added, " ... .and
our
hospitals are crying out for nurses." To which
83168-28

425

the mayor remarked, "Yes, we are adding Vo,
our hospitals and making more bedrooms and
there are, not enough nurses." At page 275 the
Chairman asked:
How are your hospitals and your children's
homes for women's help?
The mayor answeredi:
We bave flot enough. We are short of nurses.
Every day hospitais are begging people Vo work
part-time. Women leave their own homes and
their own eidren Vo work in hospitals a few
days in order Vo help out, and they do it from a
patriotic standpoint. Naturally they earn some
mnoney for that work, but we certainly nieed help
in the hospitais.
Honourable senators, that being the situation ail across Canada, is it flot only common
sense that the government should give saime
encouragement Vo these woneýn who, as the
Mayor of London said, for patriotic reasons
leave their homes and work in hospitals? They
are making a special sacrifice Vo do this work,
and instead of being given encouragement they
are by this legisiation deprived, of the very
incentive Vo work.
I bave taikecb Vo m'any nurses and a large
number of women in various occupations who
are affected by this legisiation. Their resentment is noV based only on financial reasons,
but there is a psyehoiogie-al reaction as weJl.
They feel that, tbey are being discriminated
against. They say that at the very time wben
the wages of workers in industry are higher
than Vbey have ever been in this country, and
when the ineome tax on every group o~f Vaxpayers othier than married women bas been
reduced, tbey are discriminated against in that
the amount which tbey may earn free of taxation bas been lowered from $660 Vo $250.
Because of criticism of this legisiation -from
coast Vo coast in Canada the Department of
Finance recentiy issued a statement, of whicb
I believe ail honourable senators bave received
a copy. It shows how the present tax affects
joint income in homes. I do not intend to
bore the bouse witb a detaiied analysis of this
statement: Every senator can do that for
himself; and, anyway, I neyer was very good
at jigsaw puzzles.
I was interested Vo examine the figures in
oonnection with the low income groups, because they comprise the greater number of
women wbo go outside of the home Vo work,
and the women who feel the hardsbip of the
decreased exempt-ion. I sbould like Vo eail to
your attention a group in wbich the husband's
earnings range from $1,200 Vo $1,800 a yearhonourable senators will adm-it that tbat is a
pretty lean income Vo run a home on these
days-and the wife's earnings range from
$250 Vo $1,000. The extra taxes which a family
in that income bracket pays run froma $50 Vo
$250 a year.

REVISED
EDITION

SENATE
In this same statement which the Department of Finance has sent out, this paragraph
occurs:
It is assumed by some married couples that
the tax increase is such that there is little or
no advantage for the wife to continue or take
up employment; but this impression is quite
erroneous and is not borne out by the facts.
Well, honourable senators, I am prepared to
admit that, to men who are accustomed to
thinking and talking in terms of tens of
thousands and hundreds of thousands and
millions of dollars, two or three hundred dollars a year may bo so trivial as not to mean
anything. But to young couples who are
attempting to start a home today, in the face
of increased prices for every commodity; to
middle-aged couples who, through varions misfortunes, have not been able to accumulate
any of this world's goods; and to families
whose breadwinner earns from $1,200 to $1,800
a year, two or three hundred dollars a year
means a very great deal. I have not the
figures-I do not suppose they are availablebut I am under the impression that the total
extra amount which the govement is receiving from this source is negligible compared
with the revenue of the country as a whole.
Yet the tax is working extreme hardship in
individual cases.
During the past few weeks, in order to get
some background for the remarks which I
wanted to make today, I talked personally
to a number of men and women affected by
this situation; and I was told over and over
again, especially by nurses-and I know from
speaking with some members of this bouse
that they have been told the same thing"Well, we are just going to work until we
make the $250, and then we will stop."
part-time
Employers in whose industry
employees are engaged have had the same
experience. This legislation affects adversely
not only the individual but the prosperity and
well-being of the community as a whole, and
on that ground, just as much as because of
cases of individual bardship, I am protesting
against it.
In closing, may I say that I make no apology
for saying today what I have said before in
speaking to this house. I am old-fashioned
enough to belong to that group of people who
believe that the best policy which any country
can pursue is one that encourages individuals
to develop their skills and their talents to the
fullest possible extent and to use them in the
service of the community. If a policy gives
incentive to people to make their own way, to
carve out an existence for theraselves instead
of eternally looking to the government for
assistance, that policy is for the good of the

individual and ,certainly for the good of this
country as a whole. It is legislation of that
kind which I should like to see brought in.

of the debate.
The motion was agreed te.
CANADIAN NATIONAL-CANADIAN
PACIFIC BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. GRAY TURGEON (for Hon. Mr.
Robertson) moved the second reading of Bill
254, an Act to amend the Canadian NationalCanadian Pacifie Act, 1933.
He said: Honourable senators, the object
of this bill is to amend the Canadian NationalCanadian Pacific Act of 1933 in order to give
the federal authority jurisdiction over rates of
pay, hours of work, and certain working conditions of the cieployees of the Canadian
National and Canadian Pacifie railways. It
wais decided, I understand, to bring down
ihis proposed legislation because of some confusion whieh resulted from conflicting labour
legislation in the various provinces and interfered with the proper carrying on of work of
the two railway companies and subsidiary
companies. Speaking in another place, the
Minister of Transport stated that both railway'v companies and, in general, the railway
employees and brotherhoods, were all in
favour of this legislation.
I do net intend to make any lengthy statement asking that the Senate give the
measure favourable consideration, as I know
it will do se.
The Minister of Tran-sport stated definitely
that the dominion government, having jurisdiction over the two great railway companies,
intended to apply that juris-diction so far as
labour conditions are concerned, in order to
avoid confusion and to meet the request of
the railway companies and employees.
The new section 27A(l) states that rates of
pay, lieurs of work and other terms and conditions of employnent shall be such as are
Set out in employer-employee agreements, "if
uch agreements are filed in the office of the
Minister of Transport."
A brotherhood or a railway company may
file any agreement which has been entered
into between the two bodies, and once it is
filed it will be binding during the period
stated therein. This section will net apply to
any agreement that is net filed.
I do not know whether honourable senators
wish the bill to go to a standing committee.
I presume there would be no objection to

JUNE 18, 1947
that. but personally I arn inclined to think
it could be discussed in detail better in
Committee of the Whole.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, 1 do not intend tu diseuss this bill in the
usual way. 1 hope that the day will corne
when the Parliament of Canada wjll have
complete jurisdiction over labour legisiation.
Then the federal regulations will apply al
over Canada.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That would be aIl right
if the British Columbia regulations were
adopted.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I suppose Manitoba-in
fact, cvery province-would say the same
about its own regulations. But, ultimately,
if our labour legislation is to be a sucess if
will have ta apply throughout the country.
I arn not anticipating legisiation, but I
believe that a bill concerning labour organizations was introduced in another place yesterday, and of course it wilI refer only to those
organizations which under the British North
America Act, parliament bas power to deal
with. Throughout my thirty years la parliamentary life I have fe]t that the labour
problem requires a national solution. 1 arn
not speaking for my party; 1 arn voicing my
own sentiment and rny own individual opinion, and I have not consulted anybody on the
matter. 1 think it would be better for aIl the
people la Canada if our labour laws bad a
national scope. I feel that a fight between
labour and capital in one province stirs up
people la Canada if our labour laws had
provinces. On this question I speak as a
friend of bof b labour and capital, as a man
who believes la free enterprise la this country.
Labour bas an absolute rigbt to a fair retura
for ifs work. The subversive elements wbicb
have slipped into labour organizations la the
past fwo years indicate the trouble that is in
store for us as weîî as labour itself. It is bad
business, I tbink the problern oaa be dealt
with only on a national. scale.
I use this bill as a vebicle today to say
that if is la the interests of the country to
adopt a national labour policy. 1 arn not
criticizing the federal goverament. I appeal
to the provincial governrnents to act la this
matter. We in the Western provinces are
disturbed about the coal strike la the Maritime provinces. While I have no knowledge
of its merits and no desire to interfere with
the affairs of another province, I do say that
a strike in the Maritime provinces that bas
remained unsettled for more than tbree months
bas greatly disturbed at least the Prairie
83168-28 j

provinces. A situation such as that is not
in the intorests of capital and labour and is
detrirnen:tal to the country generally.
The mai ority of the Canadian people do
not belong ta labour unions or to the capitalistic class; they are part of that great middle
cîsass, which in the struggles between these
groups, gots the axe.
I ernphasize my belief that Canada needs
a national labour code, that this would be.in
the interests of the country as a whole.

ItAILWAY BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. GRAY TURGEON (for Hon. Mr.
Robertson) moved the second readiag of Bill
255, an Acf to amead the Railway Act.
He said: Honourable senafors, this bill
proposes certain changes to the Railway Act,
the mosf important of wbich is an inecse
la the salaries of the membors of the Board
of Transport Commissioners. The bll sets
out the preseat salaries, and asks that they
ho autborized at tbe following amounts:
the Chief Commissioner, $13,500 per year;
the Assistant Chief Commissioner, $12,000;
and eacb of the other commissioners, 310,000.
Ia another place a question was raised as
fo wbether the increased jurisdicfion of tbe
Board of Transport Commissioners during the
pasf few years resulted in more work beiag
done by the board today fban previously.
The bill baving been pased by tbe other
bouse, I assume if was concluded that the
increased jurisdicfion and added responsibility
of ftho board justified the iacreased salaries.
If is proposed that section 2 of the Railway
Act be arnded by the addition of this
paragraph:
(35a) "whistle" includes a bora of any type
approved by the Board.
Section 6 of the bll deals with bigbway
crossings by rail'ways. It is recognized that,
the time bas corne ta take up the work tibat
was lef t la aboyance because of wartime conditions. May I take the liberty of placing on
Hansard a recommendation made 'by the Cornmitfee of Reconstruction and Re-Establiehment in another place, on January 26, 1944?

428

SENATE

. We recommend tliat the fedcral government
in co-operation withi the varions Provincial gov ernmnents and with the railivay companies slîould
take positiv e steps to eliiniate lex ci crossings
at the eariest possible moment. Further delay
in the carr3 ing out of this work sbould flot be
tolr'rated.
Immecliate action is neccssarv in
this regard for the conservation o f bnmail life
and property. and for the protection of enginemen and trainrnen froni the iierve-%%rlecking responsibility of hiandling trains un(ler constant
hazard of an unnecessary nature.
Honourable senators will agree that the
work necessary to eliminate accidents at railway crossinýgs shauld be proceeded with, in the
hope that it will exceed that contemplated by
this bill.
Section 8 of the bill bas to do with excessive seed over highway cros6ings where an
accident has happened. Paî'agraph (c) of subsection 1 of section 421 of the act is repcaled,
and the following substituted therefor:
421. The company shall incur a penalty of one
hundred dollars if...
(e) any train of the company passes over aniy
higliway crassing at rail level at a speed greater
than twenty-five miles an honr, if at sncb crossing, subsequent to the first day of January, one
thonsand imiie bundred and five, a persan or
vebicle using sncb crassing, or an, animal being
ridden or driven aver the samne, bas been struck
by a mioving train, and bodily injnrv or death
thereby cansed to such persan or to any otlier
Pei-son using snch crassing, unless the board
lias directed tîsat tlîe speed limitation of twentyfive miles an hour imposed by subsection twvo of
section three hundred and nine of this act shaîl
not be in effect at sncb erossiag or unless sucb
crassing is protected to the satisfaction of the
board.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Is that imen&nent based
on the principle of locking the stable d-oor
after the horse is stolen?
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: The proposed amendment provides for an increase of speed at such
points from ten to twenty-five miles an hour.
Hon. Mr. EULER: A railway cro ssing may
be very dangeraus, but so long as no accidents
take place there this provision does not apply.
Do I undlerstand thrat thiere bas ta be an accident, in which someone is killed, before this
takes effect?
Han. Mr. TURGEON: That is the existing
legislation.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It is ridiculous.
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: There is no question
but that that is tbe existing legislation, and
that is anc reasan why I took the liberty of
placing upnn the record that recammendation
whicb was made in another place by the Comnmittee on Reconstruction, about a couple of
years ago.

I do not know whetber anyone wishes this
bill ta go ta a standing committee, but personally I think the required discussion could
be had if we were ta resolve ourselves into
Committee of the Wbohe. However, that
matter is purely in the bands of the honourable senators.
Hlon. Mr. MORAUD: What is the purpose
of that definition of "whistle"? As my honourable friend knows, there is quite a jurisprudence about it. Is there any special reasan
for the modification?
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: I have here an
explanatory note, that the ptîrpose of the
nmendment is to permit tbe use af a horn
instead of a whistle if the born is of a type
that bias been approved by tbe board.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: That does nat explain
much.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I sbould like ta ask
the bonourable senator a question with regard
ta section 3. Tbis section stntes that the suma
of two bundred thousand dollars a year is ta
be provided for the next ten years with which
ta aid construction work for tbe protection,
safety and convenience of the public in respect
of higbiway crossings of railways at rail level.
On wvhat kind of work is this money going
ta be spent? Is it proposed ta build subways? If the intention is ta build subways,
two bundred thousand dollars would buihd
only a couple of tbem.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It wauld not build anc
of tbem in Kitchener.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:
detailed explanation of
going ta be spent, and
build subways, it wihl be
the abjects mentioned in

I sbould like a more
how this money is

used in carrying out
section 3.

Hon. Mr. TURGEON: 1 understand, froim
the discussion in the other placeHon. Mr. EULER: Wbv flot caîl it "the
IIouse of Cammonis" and be danc with it?
Hon. Mr. TUII(EON: I would like ta. I
uodcrstand that the Board of Tran-port Coinrnîsioners are now making a survey of conditions at railway crossings; and of course
their report will be given prompt consideratin by the governiment. I understand thiat
(ais-ideratin
iih be given to it particularly
by the Department of Reconstruction. If the
repart is acuepted, the wliale irnatter of cuimination af dangers at railway crossings will
reccix e special and designed attention. Personally, I amn extrexncly hiopeful that the
board's repart will soon be received, and that
it will obtain fax ourable cansideration and

JUNE 18, 1947
resuit in speedy action by the dominion governrnent. But this bill relates only to payment of the surn set out in the section quoted
by the honourable senator fromn Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine), though I arn hopeful
that much more work wiIl be done than is
contemplated in the bill.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I ar n ot very well
I wonder
satisfied with the explanation.
whether we could flot, get a better explanation if the bill were referred to a committee.
Also I arn not entirely content with the
explanation given to the honourable senator
froni LaSalle (Hon. Mr. Moraud) with regard
to the use of the horn. I arn interested in
that matter because, in my own town, when
trains back in, they sometimes use a whistle,
as they are supposed to do, but I believe
they also use a horn; and I do not know the
reason why.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The item in section
3 merely represents the amount of rnoney
which the federal government is ready to
grant to railways towards the elimination of
public crossings which are a menace to public
safety. As regards the Canadian National,
to alI intents and. purposes the federal government will be assurning the whole cost of this
work. So far as the Canadian Pacifie Railway is concerned, that railroad will pay the
cost of elirninating any of its highway crossings, and the federal government will make
a donation, by way of assistance, frorn the
$200,OOm.
Han. Mr. ASELTINE: That

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No; but upon
instructions of the transport board the railway
would be under obligation to do the work withont any assistance, wherea.9 this does offer
some assistance.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If my recollection
serves me right, contributions to the amounts
expended by the railways are made, not only
froni this suni, but in some cases by the
provinces and the municîpalities, t.he respective
proportions being subject to agreement. The
extent of the work is not limited ta the amount
provided under this bill.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:

Oh, no, 1 do not

word or two about this bill. In, the first place,
I would cornmend the provision to increase the

exceedingly responsible dutie:s, which will

probably increaFe as tirne goes on, and, tbere
should be the sanie recognuition of the importance of the work they are doing, and the
sanme standard of campetence in the men
selected for the position of commissioners, as
there is with respect to the work and campetence of persons who occupy judicial positions.
The matter mentioned by my honourable
friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) is one
ta which we rnight give a little more consideration in committee. With aIl the organizatione
that we have in this country for the promotion
of safety, it does not seern very logical that the

real test of whether a, crossing is dangerous
is that somebody bas been killed there.
In view of the extremely important matters
we are considerîng in connectian with this bill,
there is oue point ta which I should like to
caîl attention. The point may seern rather
frivolous, but I do think that the Parliament of Canada ought to have some regard
to the phraseology of legisîntion. 1 caîl attention of honourable senators ta the fact that
in four sentences-not paragraphs--the word
"sucb" occurs twenty-six times. Let me read
one short sentence, in section 6:
(2) No train shahl pass at a speed greater
than twenty-five miles an hour over any highway crassing at rail level if at such crossing
subsequent ta the first day of January, one
thousand aine hundred and five, a persan or
vehicle using such crossing, or an animal being
ridden or driven over the sanie, has been struck
by a moving train, and bodily injury or death
thereby cansecl to sncb person, or ta any other
person using such crossing, unless the board
directs -that such speed limitation of twentyfive miles an hour shaîl nat be in effect at sucb
crossing or unless sncb crossing is protected ta

the satisfaction of the board.
There are tbree other sentences just as bad.
Considering that the word "sncb" is used
twenty-six tumes in four sentences, may I
respectfnlly submit that in sucli an act such
abundance of "suches" is toa extravagant a use
of such "suches".

Sanie Hon. SENATORS:

Oh. oh.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: If this bill is sent ta

try and redraf t it in ordinary good English.

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
FINANCING AND GUARANTEE
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. GRAY TURGEON (for Hon. Mr.
Robertson) moved the second reading of Bill
258, an Act to authorize the provision of
moneys to meet certain capital expenditures
made and capital indebtedness incurred by
the Canadian National Railways system
during the calendar year 1947, and to authorize
the guarantee by His Majesty of certain
securities to be issued by the Canadian
National Railway Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
similar to bills presented annually for betterments and improvements to the Canadian
National Railways. It provides authority for
financing capital expenditures of the system
and retiring certain maturing obligations
either by way of loan from the dominion or by
the issue to the public of securities of the
company guaranteed by the dominion. The
total amount to be provided for this purpose
is limited to $46,723,000.
Eighteen million
dollars are for additions and betterments,
forty-one and a half millions for new equipment, about two and a half millions for construction of the Barraute branch line, and
about one million for the acquisition and
retirement of securities. This makes a total

of $63,241,000, from wbich is deducted the
amount available for depreciation and debt discount amortization, $16,518,000, leaving a total
of $46,723,000.
As I said a moment ago, this is a bill that
is presented to parliament each year to
authorize the dominion government to provide for the necessary expenditures of the
Canadian National Railways.
Hon. Mr. EULER: May I ask the honourable senator a question? The title states that
this is "an act to authorize the provision of
moneys to meet certain capital expenditures
made and capital indebtedness incurred".
Does it also provide moneys for further
expenditures, or merely moneys to meet
expenditures already made and obligations
undertaken?
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: It covers 1947, and
therefore it applies to some months in the
future. The limit is $46,723,000.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: I hope that this bill
will be referred to a committee; otherwise I
should like to ask for some information from
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Turgeon),
because we are again considering an expenditure of fifty or sixty million dollars for the
Canadian National Railways.

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:

Or we are doing

what is worse: approving expenditures
the work bas been done.

after

Hon. Mr. MORAUD: I know that a great
deal of this work has not been donc. Last
year we provided two million dollars for the
Barraute branch line extension, and I understand tbat this money has not yet been spent.
Therefore, I think it is quite proper that the
Senate should investigate beforehand and not,
as we did a few years ago, investigate
afterwards.
Hon. Mr. TURGEON: I may say that the
honourable leader of the government (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) informed me that some time
ago he proinised the ionourable leader on this
side (Hon. Mr. Haig) that after this bill had
been given second reading it would bo sent
to thte Standing Committee on Finance.
Thertfore, if the motion for second reading
is adopted I shall movie thînt the bill be sent
to that committee.

NATIONAL PARKS BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. J. J. DONNELLY presented the
report of the Standing Committee on Natural
Resources on Bill M9, an Act respecting certain National Parks and to amend the National
Parks Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the committee
have, in obedience to the order of reference
of June 5, f947, examined this bill, and now
beg leave to report the same with two amendments. These amendments are not contentious.
They were both either suggested or approved
by the Law Clerk of the Senate or representatives of the department. The first amendment deletes paragraph (p) of clause 9. That
paragraph purports to grant certain powers to
tax; but the power ta tax must originate in
the House of Commons. It is therefore proposed that the paragraph should be deleted,
in the expectation that it will be inserted
by the other house and returned for our consideration. The second amendment deletes
schedule "C", and substitutes a redrafted
schedule. The reason for this is that the
original draft failed to include the description
of certain roadways located in the tract of land
defined in this schedule.

The amendments wuere read by the Clerk,

CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS
MOTION

Hon. JOHN A. McDONALD
(King's)
moved:
That, in view of the recent discoveries of
high.-grade phosphate rock in the Sagnenay
area in the province of Quehec, and of goed
quality petaslh in the province~ of Saskatchewan,
the dominion and provincial governinents confer
witlî a view te taking prompt action te have
mines delevopeci iii order to, make av dilable te
miîr farmers. at fair prices, these highi-grade
chiemicals, which are necessary je buiilding up
soils. andl iii the prodiiction of maximimi crops,

se that Canada may be seif-sufficient se far
as reqiiirements of cheinical fertilizers are
concerned.
Ho said: Honourable senators, with your
kind permission I should like te introduce a
subject which is of first importance to, our
farmers dhroughout Canada. namely, soul conservation. I hope to be able to show that
over a long termi of years our souls have been
depleted of nuch of their natural plant food
and that, although farmers have increased the
use of fertilizers from 300,000 tons in 1939 to
650.000 tons last year, they are putting hack
into the soui only a small percentage of tise
plant fonds which are heing taken out hy the
ei.ops.

The cause of this depletion of natural plant
foods is to a large extent the high cost of
imported chernicals. I hope te ho able te
show also that we are expending $10,000,000
annually for imiported fertilizers which can
now ho secured from our own natural
resources.
It has reccntly been discovered
thiat wvehave in. Canada two chemicals which
%ve are importing. My theuglht is that if tise
attention of the federal and provincial gevernments is hrouglit te this suhjcct they might
ho induced te do sometbing about pîîtting the
mines into operation at an early date. Fertilizers of oui' own manufacture could ho
produced more chcaply and farmers could ho
enc'oîraged te huy more of them.
In the Maritime Provinces, unfortunatelv,
tIhe hcst land that wve have is water-logged.
As you know. wve have e en endeavouiing te,
work eut with tIhe, governments conccrrd a
policy for pu tting these niarsh lands in prime
condition and enahhing us te grow at least a
portion of tIse grains which are now being
îîssported from the West.
During the war
ycars wo were told that we shouhd wait until
the post-wvar period te carry on this work of
opening up the main vents and repairing and
building dykes and ahoitcaux, se that these
rich hands would preduce more ahundantly ini
tIhe future. I hehieve that a common poljcy
woiîhd suffice foir tIse provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, hecause tîseir rerjuiremonts are similar.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Tise mash lands join?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD (King's): In soe
cases they do.
Ibis. Mr. QUINN: They are on the border

mie?

Hlon. Mr. McDONALD (King's): Yes; for
instance, the Tantramar marshes.
As we are now well advanced in the period
of rehahihitation, I sincerely hope that a pohicy
may ho reached hetween the federal and

JUNE 19, 1947
provincial governments that will make it
possible to do this much needed work and to
prevent further loss of property. This policy
should be finally worked out and agreed to
within the next few days, before the supplementary estimates are brought down, so that
the work may begin very soon.
I should like to mention that although the
farmers in the West have very valuable lands,
they are depleting their soils of the needed
chemical plant food, as the farmers in the
East have been doing for a hundred years or
more. If western farmers are to keep their
farms in condition to grow large crops they
must not continue to take plant foods from
the land without returning larger quantities
of nitrogen, phosphorus and potash than they
have been doing. There are also rich farm
lands in Western Canada which could be
greatly improved through irrigation. I believe
that our governments must in the near future
give more serious thought to and expend
larger amounts of money on this type of
improvement in the West, and also must put
the valuable marsh lands in the East in
condition for maximum production. I hope
that a policy may be worked out. I know that
it is under consideration so far as the Maritimes are concerned. If one is formulated
within a few days an amount can be included
in the supplementary estimates this year and
work can be begun on the basis of a three to
five-year policy. I trust that other honourable
senators, better qualified than I to speak on
this important subject, will be willing to give
us the benefit of their information; and I
hope that we shall do everything we can to
encourage our government to help the farmers
to get cheaper plant food and to carry on a
better system of crop rotation, so as to build
up the soil before any further depreciation
occurs.
I would also like to have an expression of
opinion from honourable senators as to
whether or not they think it would be worth
while for this motion to be referred for further
study to the appropriate committee, where
officers from the Department of Mines and
Resources and of Agriculture could attend
and give much more information than we
have at this time. I feel confident that one or
more of the standing committees of the Senate
could render very valuable service by inquiring
into this and any other related subjects, such
as extension of markets for the products of
our farms, forests and seas. I feel confident
that inquiries of that kind would help make
this important branch of parliament even
more useful.
There are three basic plant food elements in
the soil: nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.
All three are essential for proper plant growth.

433

Many diseases of plants, animals and men
have been traced directly to deficiencies of one
or al] three of these basic elements. Where
ample use is made of these elements in farm
practices, crops grow more abundantly and
are more nutritious; better animals are produced more cheaply, and humans are more
healthy, vigorous and intelligent.
In other words, these chemical elements
are essential to a happy and prosperous
civilization. The phosphorus and calcium
in the soil build our skeletons and nerve
systems. Everything that our bodies need,
except air and nitrogen, comes from the earth.
It is, therefore, truthfully said that the soil
is the mother of us all-plants, animals and
men. Deficiencies of calcium, phosphorus,
magnesium, manganese and cobalt may be
the cause of many of our diseases, including
cancer. Our medical friends will tell us that
this is not a new question with them; that
investigation has been made, but their workers in cancer research have not yet been able
to determine that these deficiencies are not the
cause of cancer. I believe, honourable senators,
that in the not distant future consumers are
going to demand knowledge that their foods
such as milk, butter and meats, contain these
minerals.
It does not take much imagination to realize
the necessity for these minerals, especially
among growing families. I think it is correct
to say that Canadians, particularly in the
larger centres are prone to be too complacent
about farm conditions. We should not forget
that Canada's great wartime production record
was made on a very large number of farms
at the expense of the soil. In many parts of
Canada, particularly in the earlier settled
provinces, our soils were depleted of necessary
elements such as phosphorus, calcium and
magnesium, long before the last great war;
and heavy and continuous crops throughout
the war and improper rotation of crops have
caused increased deficiencies.
Due to the war and the foresight and leadership of the Department of Munitions and
Supply, Canada has now become the second
largest exporter of nitrogen in the world. But
we must remember that nitrogen is the only
basic element of which we have a supply
in our own country. and the other basic
elements are imported. Immediately following
the outbreak of hostilities, the Department
of Munitions and Supply constructed three
large plants for the manufacture of nitrogen,
primarily for military purposes. During the
war upwards of 100,000 tons of the new product
"ammonium nitrate" were used by Canadian
farmers to increase our agricultural produc-

tion. and even larger quantities were exported
to the United States for similar purposes. In
pre-war years large quantities of nitrogenous
products were imported into Canada; we
secured nitrates from Chuie, and synthetie
nitrates from the United States and Norway,
in the form of nitrate of soda.
In addition, thousands of tons of ammonium suiphates were imported from the United
States and Europe to supply the Canadian
demand, usually at prices which made them
uneconomie to use. Ncvertheiess, the need
purchase
for sncb produets made their
imperative, even at extremely high cost.
Unfortunately, Canada is not in sncb an
enviable position with respect to phosphate
supplies. Phosphorus, or superphosphate, as

per year. Six carloads of fatted cattle, or
fourteen carloads of hogs, remove from the
farm the phosphorus equivalent contained in
the surface six inches of an acre of good land;
and the milk from one hundred and thirty
average cows will carry off the same quantity
in a year.
Practically every section of the farm lands
of Canada requires additional phosphates; and
that is more particularly true of the five Eastern provinces, which have been under cultivation for over a century longer than the others.
In these provinces we are paying back each
ycar only a fraction of what we are taking
away, especially from our grass lands. The
Western provinces are already beginning to
show the need for additional phosphorus, and
the need will become more evident as time
goes on. Tens of thousands of tons of phosphorus are being removed yearly from the
western soils, and only very small quantities
are being returned.
If Canada is to retain its place as a leading
agricultural country it must become more
phosphorus conscious. It must study its soil
problems more intimately. I was startled to
learn that during the pre-war years our sister
dominion of New Zealand, with less than
one-tenth the cultivated and grass lands that
We have, used twice as large a quantity of
phosphates as Canada used of all fertilizers,
and practically four times as much phosphates
alone.
The consumption of phosphates in Canada
has approximately doubled since pre-war days
and now amounts to about 325,000 tons per
year, most of it being used in mixed fertilizers.
All of that tonnage is being imported from the
United States, either in the form of phosphate
rock and acidulated into 20 per cent superphosphate, or as ammonium phosphates. A
verv much larger amount would be used by
our farmers if this product could be obtained
at lower cost.
The Department of Mines and Resources
reports that recent explorations have resulted
in the discovery of extensive deposits of phosphate rock in the Saguenay district of Quebec;
and it has been known for some years that
immense quantities of phosphates exist in the
Buckingham area in the form of apatite, a
mineral from which great quantities of phosphates are derived in some of the European
Phosphate
countries, particularly Russia.
rock deposits have also been discovered
recently in Albert county, New Brunswick. It
is stated that the phosphates from these
sources are of very fine quality.
Competent authorities say that less than
one half of the money spent annually during
the war years through import freight subsidies

435

would have been sufficient to develop any one
of these sources for domestic consumption. It
is estimated that phosphate rock could be
produced from the deposit in the Saguenay
area for a cost of approximately $5 a ton, as
compared with $14 a ton for the Florida imports. The sulphuric acid necessary for the
acidulating of. such rock could be produced
from the native calcium sulphate of New
Brunswick.
Such a development would
require the active co-operation of the dominion government Departments of Mines and
Resources and of Agriculture with the Quebec
and New Brunswick governments.
These
provincial governments are already conscious
of the importance of this development as a
source of cheaper phosphates for the benefit
of the farmers of their provinces.
The recent discovery of potash in Saskatchewan by officials of the Department of Mines
and Resources indicates that huge quantities
of that indispensable. soil requirement are
ready for development on a very large scale.
Since Canada is an importer of potash salts,
largely in the form of muriate of potash, to
the extent of approximately 100,000 tons per
year, no time should be lost in having the
benefit of such deposits made available at
the lowest possible cost to the farm people
of this country. It is estimated that in an
area north-west of Saskatoon five million tons
per square mile may be available. I noted in
this week's Standard that the head of the
chermical division of the University of Saskatchewan says there may be eight million
tons of potash mined to the square mile
instead of five million tons, which, I think,
was the estimate of officials of the Department
of Mines and Resources.
Until relatively recent years there was no
known potash deposit on this continent; and
during World War 1, due to the German blockade, very little potash was available for North
American farmers. Until the late twenties al]
the potash used in Canada and the United
States was imported from France and Germany, with a small tonnage coming from
Spain. The development of the huge potash
deposits in New Mexico and California was
sufficient to make the United States and
Canada self-sufficient in their potash requirements during the war years, notwithstanding
the fact that the consumption of the product
practically doubled in that period. At times
the demand for potash was so great that, when
the facilities for its production had not reached
their peak, it was found necessary to import
several thousand tons from Russia. Those
imports were used largely in the Maritime
provinces.

436

SENATE

Potash could well be called one of the "big
three" of plant food. It is indispensable for
the production of practically ail crops. It is
most important in producing maximum crops
of grains. grass and potatoes. Our ten million
acres of hay land get very little potash. Our
fourteen million acres of oats, our twentythree million acres of wheat, and our seven
million acres of barley receive even less. The
potato erop, however, fares mueh better. This,
of course, is because it is absolutely essential
te, use potash in order to get good crops of
potatoes. Our 500,000 acres of potatoes receive
approximately 35,000 tons of potash, by far
the largest quantity per acre being used on
the great potato fields in the Maritime provinces. However, the average quantity used by
farmers aeross Canada for the growing of
potatues is less than one-haîf of what should
be used in order to produce maximum quality
crops. As 1 have intimated before, judging
from what officiais have said I believe that
if we could process our own natural resources
the cost could be about halved; and I am
sure that that would encourage farmers to use
these materials in mueh larger quantities.
The amount of potash removed annually by
crops alone from the souls of Canada is
exceedingly great. Based on our average producetion, it amounts to approximately 600,000
tons in muriate of potash for hay, barley,
oats and wbeat. Very littie of this is heing
replaeed. The statistics in this connection 1

supplies. Tbe samne is true of the souls in the
castera provinces.
I am sorry ta say that, although we have
in Canada many good farmers, we bave some
w-ho are not so good. I am speaking now from
the standpoint of maintaining their soils in
prime condition. The percentage of those who
are keeping their souls built up is, I regret ta
say, small in relation ta the number allowving
their soils to be depleted. From that standpoint, I think honourable senators will agree
that a "good farmer" may be described as one
who, wlien hie is through farming, leaves bis
soil in better condition than hie found it.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Wbat is the reason why
more fertilizer is flot used? Is it that there is
a shartage, or that the cost is bigh?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD (King's): The cause,
Senator. is the higb east of fertilizers. Also,
during the war years it wvas difficult ta obtain

as mueh as we needed. *Early this spring it
\xas estimated that 100.000 tons would be
needed and would be purchased, even at the

Hon. Mr. EULER: Would part of the
difficulty arise, poesibly, from the fact that
some of those whoma the senator lias described
as poor farmers are not sufficiently educated
in the necessity of these chemicals?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD (King's): I would
say that today lack of education is no excuse.
Hon. Mr. EULER: No, but is that a fact?

Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Is there any fixing of
prices of fertilizers? I understand that in this
country there are only two large corporations
supplying fertlizers: Canadian Industries Limited and International Fertilizer. Is there any
prire control?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD (King's) : The prices
were controlled during the war years.

Hon. Mr. McDONALD (King's):- It should
flot be so, in view of the assistance whicb
is given themn by officiaIs of the federal
Department of Agriculture.
Hon. Mr. EULER: But is it?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD (King's): I would
flot say that it is, in the province of Nova
Scotia. I amrnfot so, familiar with what is
being donc in anýy of, the other provinces. If
I may be allowed a personal allusion; in 1933,
when I took office in the Nova Scotia, Department of Agriculture, I found, that altbough the
goverTnment was subsidizing the use of lime
stone to sucb an extent that lime was costing
the farmer only $3 per ton at bis railroad
station, that alone did not seem sufficient to
encourage bim to use mucli of it. Eventually
we eut the price in haîf, charging the farmer
$1.50 at bis nearest railroad station. The
department paid the difference between $1.50
per ton and the cost of manufactuTe, as welI
as the freiglit. to encourage tbe farmer to use
lime.
Hon. Mr. EULER: My thouglit was, if tbese
chemicals were readily available would the
farmer avail himself of tbem?

Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Are prices stili being
controlled?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD (King's): I believe
tbey are.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: May I ask the bonourable senator a question? When the price of
lime was reduced tbrough the efforts of the
goverament in Nova Scotia, was there a
greater use of the produet?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD (King's): The use
of lime in Nova Scotia bas increased. from
about 8,000 tons a year, which wa-s the consumption when we reduced the price, to fortynine or fifty thousand tons.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Is that only in Nova
Scotia?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD (ing's) - There are
government assistance policies in other
provinces, but I arn not familiar witb them.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Do many farmers
use kelp as a fertilizer?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD (King's): Many
farmers near the coast use kelp.
We also have a limited supply of phosphorus

have been experimenting with that. I tbink
that if the sl-ag is taken hot from the oven
and quencbed by being placed in cold water,
this bas the effeet of breaking it into smaller
particles, wbich are easily ground, and which
contain lime as well as phosphorus. If that
phosphorus can be made available on the
same basis as lime, it will be of great advantage to farmers.
Farmns that are known as "poor farms" are
ones from which the supplies of nitrogen,
phosphorus and potash have been overdrawn.
Unfortunately we have tbousands of sucli
farms in Eastern Canada.
The great potasb deposits recently discovereýd in Saskatchewan, if prudently
developed, would mean v'ery mucli to Canada.
Development should be undertaken from a
long-termn point of view, and not for the
benefit of the few, but witb the objeet of
producing more and better crops at lower
cost, and preserving our souls for centuries to
corne.

Hon. Mr. McDONALD (Kings): I believe
that would depen'd largely on the cost; but,
in my opinion, if tbe cost could, le balved and
tbe farmers continued to get a fair price for
their prodfucts, tbey would use mucb larger
amounts of these chemicals.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Would the honourable senator inform the bouse, if be bas tbe
information, as to tbe effeet on tbe present
situation of the operations of the well-known
world-wjde cartels whicb control fertilizers and
ebemical products? lias tbe supply been
increased or the product cheapened, or wbat?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD (King's): I bardly
think I arn in a position to answer that
question. I helieve that the price level during
tbe war years was considerably higlier, altbough
the government did a lot to keep it down.
DuTing the last two years the price bas been
going up, but Canada bas received its fair
share of the available potasb and phosphorus.

From informnation at hand withi respect to
flie quantities available, it is quite possible
t'hat a huge expert business could be developed
as Weil.
If our pasture and hay lands, our grain and
other ci-op lands were tu receive suuîewhere
near their annual depletement, a ready market
for upwards of 800,000 tons muriate of potash
exists here in Canada.
The United States government spent hundreds of thousands of dollais in proving up a
domestie source of potash, as they realized
its vital importance as a fertilizer to the
whýole country.
I bring this matter to the attention of
honourable senators in the hope that we might
be willing to give to the government of Canad-a ail the support needed to encourage an
early developrncnt of these rich natural
resources.
If fresh drilling is necessary to determine
hest sites for deveiopmcnt, I trust that this

JUNE 19, 1947
Hon. Mr. HAIG: My speech will not be a
very good one, but, for what it may be worth,
I want the leader of the government to hear
it.
I am sorry that the honou-rable gentleman
fromt Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) is not in
the house at the moment, because I want to
offer him my congratulations. Apparently hie
is referred to as "the honourable senator from
Toronto", but following the practice with
respect to members from other large cities
bie should perhaps be styled "the bonourable
senior senator from Toronto". Also 1 take
tbis opportunity of offering my congratulations to the honourable lady senator fromn
Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis), upon hier
contribution to this debate. 1 was delighted
to hear bier speak, because 1 think she truly
expresses the views of the women of this
country. Further, may I offer an expression
of appreciation to the honourable the Minister
of Finance for the reductions hie bas made
in taxes.
I do flot propose to deal with what mîght
be called departmental amendments, which
arise in the ordinary course of events from
year to year. The Minister of Finance made
substantial reductions in income taxes available especially to those in the $3,000 to $10,000
Reductions are not so
a year bracket.
favourable to the other classes. May I say
that wbile I do not think that the government
made a political mistake. I certainly believe
it made a business mistake in failing to
provide more substantial reductions in the
lower income brackets. In tbe other bouse the
member for Eglinton-an able -member who
was first elected at the last election-stated
the position very cleailly in one sentence. He
said tbe government had reduced the income
tax by approximately 160 million dollars a
year, commencing in 1948, and had taken off
subsidies of 208 millions dollars, with tbe
result that the income-tax-paying group
receiving salaries of $3,000 and less were most
adversely affected.
A day or two after the budget came down
I reeeived from a lady acquaintance in Winni-peg a letter in wbich she said that she
presumed my income tax had been reduced.
She added that what I had saved in income
tax she had lost, because butter had gone up
ten cents a pound. That expresses the position the low income people have been placed
in by the removal of 208 million dollars in
subsidies. It is well known that a man with
a family of five cbildren who earns $2,000 a
year, pays as mudh for the nece.ssities of life
asq a man witb the saine family who earns.
$10,000 a year. The increase in the cost of

439

living brought about by the taking off of subsidies has had a disastrous effeot on the taxpayers in the lower income groupe.
Let me warn the people that the suibsidies
are flot ai off yet. For instance, when the
subsidy on wheat is removed millers in Canada will have to charge more for flour, and
that will mean an increase in the cost of bread.
I do not think there will be a general
reduction in income tax until the government
has a change of mind with respect to the
expenses of administration. I am one who
believes that the government of this country
cannot carry on at the present rate of expense.
We are living in a world which except for
the United States and prohably South America,
is in abject poverty, very close to starvation, a
world that cannot buy goods from us. During
the past year we have maintained our exports
by lending money to the people buying from
us. That system. can go on only so long. We have
reaohed the stage where our American exehange
is gradually djwindling. 0f course, we can
make somne deal witb the United States whereby it will buy goods from us for Europe and
give us American exehange to boîster up our
financial position in relation to, that country.
But until we can change sterling or European
money into United States money we havie to
keep on lend'ing to Europe, and the value of
our currency will go down. It is said that its
value was not depreciated as much last year
as was estimated. The reason is that we got
from Europe, certain gold and money, whicb
we shall not get again.
I want to plead for general reduction in
the overaîl expenses of the government of
this country. 1 do not suggest that we are
facing a depression, but certainly we shall have
a recession. Remember, three out of ten
of our people depend on our goods being
sold to the world. At present the United
States is extremely prosperous and is buying
our pulpwood, timber, lumber and other comnmodities on a basis that is very profitable
to us. But I give warning that the day will
come when that country will face an inevitable
change of conditions. The United States has
to cut down its tariff and let the world trade
witb it, or there will be no world trade. It is
no secret that recently it put the tariff up
on wool. How is Australia goîng to seli bier
wool to the world and pay bier debts if there
is a tariff on wool going to the United States?
The psycbology of the United States seems
to favour tariffs. True, some of its abler
men are trying to break down that psychology;
but if tbey are to succeed, honourable senators, the standard of living in that country

440

SENATE

must corne down. In Canada aiso the standard
of living bas to corne down, but there will be
trernendous resistance hefore it does.
The government is going on bolstering up
things by giving money to the people; but,
make no mistake about it, we shall get to, the
end of the road. The sarne factors that
apply to individuals apply also to nations.
I argue most strongly for a realization on the
part of the people of Canada that we have
reached the lirnit in expenditure. We have
got to eut down expenses if we are to do
our part when the world around us is starving
to death. Do not forget that men and wornen
in other countries are getting by on flfteen
hundred calories a day, while we bave about
four thousand-and we do nlot regard ourselves as being over-fed.
Hon. Mr. LACAiSSE: In somo places the
people get only fine hundred calories a day.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I arn talking about the
average in sorm- parts of the world today.
Our- countrv depends more on world trade
than does any other country in the worid.
The United States lias been vory nearly able
to live within hoersoîf, and for sornotirne she
may do se, but she is londing money in an
attempt to keep the world frern going down
into despair and communisrn.
Honourable
senators. communism cannt live in this world
if a reasonable standard of living is provided
for aIl. It mav by force fasten its tentacles on
pcoplcs; but, given a fair deal, those European
coucntries whichi have tasted democracy and
frecdom will neyer adropt communisrn.
Consider oui, position as Canadians.
In
Western Canada practically aIl our prirnary
produets-grain, cattle and hogs, but mainly
whoat-rnust ho seld elsewhere. Our standard
of living is doterminod by the price obtainable for our- wheat on the wvorld's rnarkets,
althoughi also, of course, it is affected when
by the action of our gevernment that price is
roduord. But if the wvorld lias not the money
or cannet exohange the goods with which to
buy our whoat, we cannot seli it, and thorefore
our standard of living, both in the West and
down hore. wvill be rodurced. Perhaps 1 should
haveo resorx cd these remarks uintil the debate
on the budget, but the budget cornes down se
late in the session that it is very difflcult thon
to deai intolligontly with the matters raised
by it. Somo people have heen misied because,
as they point eut, iii the last yoar and a haîf
we have bren able to seli to the world everything wc couid produce. But we are seliing
abroad because wveare ionding the money witb
which te pay for our goods. \Ve loanýed Groat
Britain about S1.250,000,00Ol: I undorstand that
more than hal, cf that money lias aiready been

expended. We have lent aise te France, Hol]and, Belgium and other countries. Indeed,
I would rather say that wo gave them the
monoy, and 1 arn quite content that we should
have clone se. Those countries withstood the
crash of the world; and I arn quite wiliing te
pay my share of the taxes necossary te relieve
their situation. But do net lot us dceceive ourselves. WVesoîl to these couintries because we
lent thern the money to pay for oui' goods;
and that is a condition which cannet go on
very long. That is the situation whichi we
in Canada face todav.
To deai more specifically with the subject cf
incarne tax: thanka te the Civil Service Commission, I have in rny band, a brochure, copies
cf which I assume ail cf you have recoived,
deaiing with the position cf saiaried workers.
I do net intend te induige in a long reading,
but I refer te page 37, whiere it appoars that,
taking ail the elements which enter jute the
cest of living, the cost for fifty-two weeks,
wvhich in 1938 was $1,475. had rison hy the ist
of April of this year te $2,170, or an increase
of 52 per cent. It is higher now. That amount
bias not been affocted by incarne tax exernptiens. aitbougb in my opinien thoso exemptions te people in this bracket should ho proportionate te the increasqed costs. But I weuid
point eut that the increase of 52 per cent is
net a fair reflection cf the position, for the
roason that an increase cf oniy 26 per cent
in rent is inciuded, whereas the oniy reason
that rents have not increased more is t'hat
ownors cf property have ha.d to bear the
difference between 26 per cent and the
amount, nameiy 80 per cent, by whicb
the cost of building bias increased. In ether
w'ords, the additionai 54 per cent bas been
borne by the owners ef praperty, and but for
that condition the additional cost w'ould have
been, not 52 per cent but about 62 per cent
over pre-war figures.
Sameone may say, "But. Senatar, how are
wvegoing te raise the monoy?" The main consideraticu is that peuple moust have enough
monov te live on. Wo are going te have
strikes. and a movoment, if net as far ieft
nas comninsm, at any rate te sociaiism, if the
trend continues ta a point where people in the
lower-income brackets cannot live. That is
the situation. What cost some people $1,475
or $1.500 in 1938. costs the samne people $2,170
todav; and, as I bave pointed eut, it would
cost more but for this heavy discrimination
against people who own real ostate.
I have read the speeches in another place;
I have listonod te some of them; and, in
offeot. the argument is that money must be
raiscd and overybody should pay part cf the
taxation.
Certainiy everybody shouid pay

JUNE 19, 1947
taxes, but when you do not get enough to live
on, what about the taxes? I am as bitterly
opposed as anybody te communism, but I
do not think it can be effectively fought by
speeches or in any other way than by enabling
people to live on their incomes. There is no
sense in asserting that they should, when they
are unable to do so. I candidly admit that I
am not in the lower-income brackets, but I
certainly came from a lower-income bracket,
and I know by experience what it means. I
know the trouble which my parents, along
with hundreds of others, went through on our
prairies. I can recall when they sold eggs for
ten cents a dozen, and butter for ten cents a
pound. I know what it is to go to the village
with two pounds of butter and bring home as
much tea as it would buy; and tea was about
all that was bought at the stores in those
days. And there were not a few, but hundreds,
even thousands of people in that position. I
understand that sort of problem, and therefore
I feel keenly about that class of people. I am
not advocating that people should congregate
in cities, or that they should work in the steel
plants and receive exorbitant salaries, or put in
forty hours and call it a week's work; for I
know that, for every farmer who works under
eighty hours, there are many who work more.
At the same time, what I am seriously concerned about is the position of people in the
low-income brackets, for I know that they
are the ones who are suffering, and I do not
believe they should be required to pay this
tax.
Let me deal briefly with the point raised
by my honourable friend from Peterborough
(Hon. Mrs. Fallis). I cannot understand why
the exemption of $660 should not have been
continued to the women of this country, the
more so as we cannot get nurses. I have a
case in mind. A comparatively young woman,
about forty-five years of age, came to my
office the other day and asked, "Will there
be any change in the law regarding the $250
that I can earn?" I asked her, "What are the
facts?" She said: "I am a married woman. I
was married early in life; my youngest child
is about twenty-five, and all the children are
out doing for themselves. My husband bas
a job in the Canadian National Railways, not
very remunerative, but he earns enough to
pay our way. I am a trained nurse, a graduate of the Winnipeg General Hospital"-I
think she is a medallist of the hospital-"and
people come to me begging me to take their
cases. But now, Mr. Haig, when I get $250,
what do I do?" I said, "You quit." She said,
"That is exactly what I am going to do."
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Why?

441

Hon. Mr. HAIG: She said: "Why should I
work when my earnings decrease my husband's exemption and no tax reduction is
given to me? Why should a woman be compelled to go back to housework if she does not
want or need to do so?" I do not deny that
a woman's place is in the home, but surely she
has the right to choose whether she will
remain at home or net, if her husband is satisfied with the arrangement and the children are
grown up. Or, take the position in our province with regard to teachers. We have a large
number of girls, who, having attained grade
XI or XII, and some without any Normal
training at all, have been given certificates to
teach, and have taken up the work.
With regard to girls working in a factory,
a woman asked me the other day if the law
had been changed as to the $660 that a
woman could earn free of income tax. I
replied that the law had been changed and
the amount was now $250. I told her that the
new budget had been brought down and this
was still the amount of her exemption. She
said, "Well, I will get my scrub woman to
come." I asked what she meant, and she
explained that a woman who had been a
factory worker during the war years would
now, because of this lowered exemption, have
to quit and return to her old job of working
from day to day. Of course, no record is
kept of that sort of thing. This situation also
applies to women teachers, hairdressers and
many others. I think that a woman can find
her greatest delight in her own home. However, many a woman with special qualifications, after having raised a family and reached
the age of forty-five, wishes to work at some job
for which she has a preference. Many women
like nursing, yet although our hospitals all
over the country are crying out for nurses,
these women cannot take the jobs. Because
of the new legislation in Saskatchewan I do
not think there will be any nurses at all available in that province. There are several
reasons for the general shortage of nurses.
First, the pay has not been sufficient. Second,
during the six years of war very. few girls
entered the nursing profession. Third, girls
who have been nurses have been induced to
enter other forms of employment that
pay far better salaries. Fourth, as my bonourable friend from St-Albert (Hon. Mr. Blais)
will agree, many nurses marry after they enter
hospital service, and then retire. Most of
them marry doctors. Those are some of the
reasons why hospitals throughout Canada are
so much in need of nurses. There are other
reasons. At one time nurses used to work
from dawn to dawn, but now they work eight
hours and that is all. My friends in the
medical profession tell me that hospitals now

SENATE
require three nurses ta do the work that one
nurse used ta do in the aid days. In former
times a nurse wauld sleep an a chair beside
the bed and when bier patient woke up she
wouid attend t, lier dîtties as hest she couid.
And despite the presenit shortage af nurses in
hospitals the government refuses ta ailow
those who are married a tax exemption of
more than $250.
What about farmers' wives? Why should
they not have an exemption af $660? I say
that the farmers in this country wbo have no
wives would ho tickied ta death ta get their
homes kept for them for that amount.
The present taxation is causing unrest in
the rural parts ai Canada. I speak for Manitoha. where the farmers, in proportion ta the
wvhole population. pay more incame tax than
do the farmers ai any aiber province. The
farmiers in Saskatchewan pay a bigher total,
but they are mare numeraus than the farmers
of Manitoha. The government knows ail that,
yct it will net give a roasonable exemption
ta the women who form part ai the team that
makes the thing go.
Honourable senatars, I have spoken longer
than I intended, hut I feel that as members
of this Sonate we owe a duty ta the people
of Canada ta express aur thaughts on what
should ho donc in the interests ai the eonomjc lufe af this country. It is for that
reasoii and no other that I have made the
statemcnts I have this aiternoon.
Free enterprise caa he put out ai existence
hy the tax route. Thero is no more effective
way ta stifle industry in any country than by
excessive taxation. That is what is happening in Canada now. 1 bave given the Minister
cf Finance great crcdit-I repeat it-great
credit, for the stops ho bas already taken.
However, I say that ho must go muchi furtber
before industry, enterprise and individual
liberty caa prasper in Canada.
One more word. I arn pleased. ta hear hy
the rurnour route-Il have flot heen told
officially that the governiment is draiting a
consolidated incarne tax bill. 1 hope that it
wili take cognizance of the report made last
sc:,sion hv the comrnittee cf whicb, my
honotirabie iriend front Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) was the distinguislied chairman, and
in whieh ho did a first-class job. That report
did mare ta put the Sonate on the map of
Canada than anything olse since I carne into
tis house twelve years aga. 1 say that, not
becauze I was a member ai the committee,
for I did net have much ta do with it, but
hecause the report gav-e the people of this
country cause ta hope that we may have a
reasonaible and workahle incarne tax iaw.
1 hiope the gov errent wili read the report

very carefuliv. 1 know tiîat people ivili say ta
me, "Mr. Haig, what abotut this expenditure
and that expenditure?".
I can oniy reply
that if the Sonate cannot sit down an expenditures, God lielp this country.
I arn in faveur ai having the bill go te a
committee, wbere it can ho discussed in detail.
Hon. WISHART MoL. ROBERTSON":
ilonourahie senators, I should like ta take
titis opportunity of jaining witb the leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) in complimenting
tue mover ai the motion for second reading
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) upon bis clear and lucid
explanation ai the details ai this bill. I wisb
ta comment in a gencral way upon the
remarks oi my honourable friend opposite, but
I shail net attempt te usurp the rigbt cf the
mover ta reply. I shotxld also like ta refer
particularly ta the camments made hy the
honourahie senatar fromn Peterborough (Hon.
Mrs. Fallis).
1 do not tbink anyone can take mucb exception ta the genoral remarks made by the
leader apposite. We ail agree with what hoe
soi eloquently said as te the importance af
external trade ta, this country. That is a matter whicb perliaps in the past bas been appreciated an this side of the bouse more than on
the other. The desirability cf removing tariffs
and increasing the volume ai business, with not
only the rest af the world but in particular
with the great country ta the sautb, is saýrnething wbich honourable members an this side
of the bouse can appiauýd, because aur record
in that respect is a good deal better than
that of honourable members opposite, as they
will know if tbey rernember the traditional
elections whicb bad ta do witb car trade relations with the United States.
On the general question of governmental
expenditure and taxation, I do nat think any:)e waald deny that it is desirable for us ta
have the lowest taxes passible. Nor do I think
anyone
wauld deny the general
thesis
that, consistent witb goad service ta the country, it is well that governmental expenditare
should be reduced ta the lowest possible level.
Sa I ar n ot inclined ta be tac critical ai the
remarks of my bonoarable friend in the latter
part ai bis excellent speech, where ho reierred
ta the tendency of appositions ta cail at one
time for increased expenditures and at anather
time for reduced taxation. I believe that in
a great many different eircumstances that is
characteristic of appositions. In the present
session, for instance, I know of practically no
major issue that bias corne before this country
an which the leader of the party cf wbich my
honourable friend is sucb a distînguisbed mcmber bas not criticized the government for nat
spending enough money. A certain leeway is

JUNE 19, 1947
given ta the opposition, as we ahI appreciate
and realize, but it will of course be for the
government whicb, ai ter ail, bas the responsibility, to cboose between bwo conflicting points
of vîew.
I believe that this bouse and the general
public will support the broad tbesis of tbe
leader opposite. But I wisb to give a little
background to tbe subj ect, and perhaps
bring it down from tbe dramatic and cloquent
level on wbicb be and the bonourable senator
from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis) have
discussed it, in their attempt to make it appear
tbat an injustice had been done ta tbe people
of Canada.
Tbe bonourable senator from Peterborougb
speaks so fluently and graccfully, and ber
remarks carry sucb conviction, tbat until I
began to loose myscîf fromn tbe spell of ber
magnetie eloquence I find myself almost
convinced that ber viewpoint is the right
one. After listening to tbe bonourable lady
I set about to study the subject and sec
what the situation was, according to tbe bard
facts. Honcurable senators, we must consider
tbese mnatters today in the ligbt of tic fact
tbat we bave just corme tbrougb a war whicb
bas caused a great deal of dislocation in this
country and resulted in tremendous expense
which. we and the future generations bave
to bear. In considering the matter witb tbat
background we must be careful about letting
our minds drop back to the days whcn we
bad nu such financial responsibilities. Let
us look at our situation realistically, as it
is today, and compare it witb that of otber
countries under dernocratic government.
My honourable friends dircctcd tbeir remarks more particularly to tbe matter af
the exemption of $250 to rnarricd women.
It was clairned that tbat level of tax free
incarne bas bad a detrirnental cifeet upon the
willingness of wamen ta engage in industry.
The hanourable lady from Peterborougb gave
as an illustration a young couple starting
out in the incarne bracket of 81,200 to $1,800
a year. I intend ta give a spccific illustration
alang tbasc lines, and leave it ta tbe judgmcnt
ai tbe bouse wbctber or nat, taking everytbing into consideration, the action af the
govcrnment is une tbat cauld rigbtly be
criticized as causing a grave injustice ta the
peuple ai this country.
Let us nat farget that in 1939 tbe exemption
for incarne tax purpases stoad at 81,000 for
single and $2,000 for marricd statue. Wben
tbe wife's incarne exceeded $1,000 botb sbe
and ber bushand became taxable as single
persans. In 1940, tbe exemptions were reduced
ta $750 and $1,500 respectivcly. Tbe wife
cauld reccive an incarne up ta $750 witbaut

443

paying any tax or affecting her busband's
tax, but when her incarne exceeded that
amaunt by as mucb as one dollar her busband
lost bie married status, and both paid as
single persons. In 1942 the exemptions were
again changed ta what in effect was $660 for
single persons and $1»20 for married status.
Due to a state of emergency which tben
existed a fuitber change was introduced, providing that the husband could dlaim the full
married exemption of $1,200 regardless of how
large bis wife's earned income might be, and
she could pay as a single persan. The exemption was again changed in 1947, to $750 and
$1,500; and su as to place the taxation of a
husband and wife on a more equitable basis,
and to, bring aur law inta dloser conformity
with that of other countries, it was provided
that a husband's exemption would be reduced
by the amaunt by wbicb bis wife's income
excecded 8250 and did nat exceed 8750. When
the wif e received more than $750, botb she and
ber husband were taxed as single persons.
In respect of the last change, designed to
place tbe taxation on a more equitable basis,
general factors were taken inta consideration,
including the one wbich my honourable friend
pointed out in connection witb farmers wbere
the wife assiste in increasing ber busband's
incarne but cannot take advantage of the
existing exemption for her share, as she could
if she worked at same outside activity from
which she received 8X. Of course when the
exemption is only $250 some discrimination
exists. but it is not as great as it would be
if the exemption for the wife were bigber. No
special provision is made for tbe farmer's
wife, and how practical or how feasible it
would be to devise sucb an arrangement, I
do not know. However, that problcmn is not
specifically before us at the moment.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS:- May I suggest to my
honourable friend tbat the fact tbat tbe farmer's wife is not being treated justly is no
reason why other women sbould not be. Two
wrongs do not make a right.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I admit that
there may be anotber way of handling the
taxation of farmers' wives and ather wives
who are employed, but tbe whole question of
practical difficulties would be encountered,
and we would come back in varying degrees ta
tbe samne problem. Farrner's wives and storekeepers' wives wh.o contribute to their busband's incarne would raise objection to the
deductions allowed.
In the United States a husband wba wishes
ta dlaim rnarried status, which carnies 81,000
exemption, must include bis wife's income
with his own and pay a tax on the total; or,

444

SENATE

444

SENATE

if the biusband and wife so elect. they rnay
eachi file separate returns and pay as single
persons, with $500 exemptions. In the United
Kingdom a husband and wife living together
must file a joint return of incorne; that is to
say, the liusband must include ail his wife's
income with bis own. The husband is allowed
the married exemption of £180, or $720, and
an additional exemption ie respec t of bis wife's
earned income up to £110 or $440. My honourable friend rnigit point out tbat in the
case of a wife's eareed income tbe exemption in tbe United Kingdoma is higber than
$250, but it must be remembered that wbcn
the two earnings combined are taken into
consideration the amount is brougbt up te
$1,160.
Hua. Mrs. FALLIS:
The
bonourable
senator bas referred te the United States tax.
May 1 ask, bim whether they pay as large an
inconle tax in the United States?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I arn glad my
honourable friend brought up that point. I
tbink it is a pertinent one and I arn prepared
te deal with it. ln actual figures here is the
situation.
The comparative exemptions as
betwccn Canada, United States aod Great
Britain, in the case of a married couple whiere
the w'ife bas no mecome, are these. In the
United IÇingdom tbe exemption is $720, in tbe
United States it is $1,000, ta Canada it is
$1,500.
But if the wvife is carning, the coinbined exemptions are these; in the United
Kingdotn, $1,160; ie tbe Ueited States, $1,000
-for there is ne exemption applicable in this
ease-and in Canada, $1,750. Mucb as we may
desire te reinove taxes from everybody, as
long as they must be imposed we must deal
with themn relatively, hearing in mmnd that alI
of us arc te a greater or lesser degree beneficiaties of tbe expenditures, and must bear
tbe financial responsibility whicbi our respective cotîntries bave assumed. The cemparison
1 ar n aking relates te tbe three ceuntries te
wbicb these conditions are most similar.
Exemptions for mac and wife range from
$720 te $1,500.
In Canada the amount is
$1,500.
For those families wbere the wif e
earns an inceme, tbe exemption totals $1.160
in tbe case of United Kiegdom, the amount
rcmaining at $1,000 in tbe United States, and
rîsing te $1,750 in Canada. On that, basis. I
tbink, the people of Canada are net badix' off,
ancl 1 do net know that any great injustice is
being done, hcaring in mmnd that we are in
a world which bolds tbat a fair share of the
national income sbould be raised in accordance with the prineiple of ability te pay. I
admit that this form of taxation is net the

onlv source of inceme. But we believe that
the basis which bas been established is on the
whole a fair one.
1 corne now te tbe point referred te by tbe
bonourabie senater from Peterborough (Hon.
Mixs. Fallis). Converted te dollars and cents,
bow dees the matter stand? I intend te take
an average case: I arn net prcpared te disceuss
ail possible permutations aîîd combinations,
as tbe oid phrase ges. My itonourabie friend
talked about the range frein $1,200 te $1,800.
I arn geing te take the case of a married mac
who earns $1,500, on whieb be is net subjeet
te taxation, owing te bis married status. A
situation dcx cieps in whieh, partly as the
result of a desire te supplement tbc faîniiy
revenues, antI partly in re-ponse te the rail
te participate in nurîsing or sehool teai'hing
or fact-ory xvork, bis wife, ba-xing tbe time at
ber disposal, undertakes te work. Tbe implied
suggestion of mv heonourable fricnd is that
site gees eut and works te tbe tune of $250,
and tieu, hecause, abeve tliat, sum, a tax is
inveivcd, lier inclination is net te do anx'
more work.
Hon. Mr. MaLNA:On
counsel!

the adviee of

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON-': On the ielvire of
Hon. Mts. FALLIS: I ar n ierely repeatîng
what these worren hav e tolu] me.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Let Lis ,eu lîew
mtith it amounts te. I arn net saying that
seme do net do that. But I have seme doubt
if tbe busband bimsclf, baving $1,520, wouid
say. "If miv salary is in-creased te $1,700 or
$2.000 I slhall have te pay inceme tax, se
whcn the boss calîs me in and says, 'l arn
geîng te increase youi saiary te $2,000' 1
,hall say, 'Keep yeur monev; I weuld bave
te pay a tax on it, se I don't want it'."
Hen. Mis. FALLIS: That is neot a case tn
ponint.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The financial
resuit is cxactly the saine, and human nature
ts much tlic saine, In undertakieg outside
werk, women are actuated by high motives
and aise by a pcrfectly logical desire te
supplemeet the family income. Hnving earned
$250. and realizing tbat if sbe earns more than
tiat amount the joint exehiequer wvill be
subjeet te taxation, she will decide whether
she will quit work or continue. Supposieg
shie gees on werkieg and gets extra rney,
liow mucb is it going te cost lier? Tbat is
quite a pertinent point.
To tell you tbe
trutb, I did net knoxv. and I tbought I would
like te fied eut wbat it wouid cost a womari

JUNE 19, 1947
to get that extra money, not only in Cadada,
but in the United States and Great Britain.
I say that this is a pertinent point. My
honourable friend shakes her head.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: I think we are concerned with what is happening in Canada.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I know, but the
point is that the honourable lady argues that
the government of which I am a member is
working a great injustice on the people of
Canada, and to these particular people. I am
suggesting that in the light of all the circumstances the injustice is not quite so great
as her eloquence would seem to indicate.
If the wife earns $500, obviously their combined income is $2,000, of which $250 is taxable.
I thought I would cite two instances: one,
where $250 is earned, which of course is not
a case in point, because no tax is imposed; the
other, where the wife is earning $500, of which
$250 would be taxable. On this sum the
family would pay a tax of $42 in 1947 under
our present tax rates, which are half the
1947 rate and half the 1948 rate, but in 1948
the tax would drop to $29. That is the
amount she would have to pay if she earned
$500 and her husband's income remained
stationary at $1.500. In other words, $42
would be payable on the 1947 basis and $29
on the rates which come into effect on July 1.
In the United States, however, a married
couple in the same income tax bracket pays
$154, and in the United Kingdom, $156, against
our $42 on the present 1947 basis and $29
on the whole year on the 1948 basis. I do
not undertake to say that it would not be
much better, as my honourable friend remarks,
if they did not have to pay the $29 at all.
I am not scorning $29 by any manner of
means, but I am pointing out that a person
in this position is substantially better off in
Canada than in the United States or the
United Kingdom.
Let us take another case. Let us suppose
that the man earns $1,500 and the wife $750.
The combined income is $2,250, of which $500
is taxable. In Canada under the present rates
in effect for 1947, they would pay a tax of
$94, while under the rates to be in effect for
1948 they would pay $70. That is, she would
have to pay $70 ,ncome tax on the $750 extra
that goes into the household as a result of her
efforts. A married couple earning exactly the
samne amount in the United States, however,
would pay $197 at the present tax rates; and
in the United Kingdom, $250.
Honourable senators may recall that the
proposed reduction in the tax rates in the
United States, a reduction passed by Congress,

445

was vetoed by President Truman. This question might arise: "Are you dealing with the
rates which would have prevailed had the
proposed measure gone through?" I reply
that I am dealing with the rates which now
exist, as a result of the veto. But I am
informed that even had the new rates gone
through in the United States, our rates would
still be more favourable than theirs until the
$2,700 income class is reached, in which
bracket the new rates in the United States
would have been more favourable than ours.
Honourable senators will perhaps remember
that when this bill was before us last year
considerable suggestions were made in our
Senate committee. I believe that at one time
the Senate considered proposing that the
amount of the exemption be raised from $250
to $400. There appeared to be general agreement that, while a higher figure would have
been more desirable, $400 would have been
satisfactory. I just want to give an illustration as to what would have happened had the
exemption been raised to $400. Suppose a
husband earns $1,500, and his wife $750. At
1948 rates-the latest rates-the couple would
pay a tax of $44, as compared with $70 on
the present basis. That is, if the exemption
were $400 instead of $250, there would be a
total difference of $26 in their income tax.
My honourable friend from Peterborough
(Hon. Mrs. Fallis) made graphie reference to
people who are so used to talking about
hundreds of thousands of dollars, that they
cannot appreciate the value of small sums. I
want to say that I am not belittling the
importance of $26 to people paying income
tax. It is an important item to anyone.
I think that I am even more cognizant of
these facts than my honourable friend is.
She lives in one of the most fortunate parts
of this country, a district which from the
beginning of Confederation has had the
benefit of many advantages that people in
other parts of Canada have not had. I admit
that it is a great hardship for a couple in
Canada earning $2,250-$1,500 to ,the man and
$750 to- the woman-to pay $70 in income
tax. However, I can tell my honourable
friend that in the part of the country from
which I come there are literally hundreds and
thousands of families to whom $2,000 a year
would seem like an almost unobtainable
objective. Does my honourable friend realize
that in the years before the war thousands
of families were earning somewhere in the
vicinity of only $300 or $400 annually?
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: We are speaking of
present day conditions.

446

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: A family earning
in the United States has to pay $197 in
income tax, and a family earning $2,250 in the
United Kingdon has to pay $250. Therefore
I do not understand how my honourable friend
can say that the Canadian family is subjected
to a grave injustice. Moreover, I do not think
the tax is anything like the deterrent that
the honourable lady portrayed it to be. I
will admit that an argument may be made in
individual cases. There is the argument that
when a person earns more money he has to
pay more income tax, so lie may decide to
work less, earn less money and in that way
avoid some taxation. That may sound
reasonable enough, but I am of the opinion
that only a minute percentage of people in
Canada would cease work on that account.
I have a small business and I remember that
whenever it was time to pay income tax
the manager of my company would come to
me and proceed to berate the government for
the amount that had to be paid. He would
say that next year he did not intend to do
so much business; and everybody else in the
company, whatever work lie was doing, would
say the same. However, I could not see any
particular tendency on the part of my
company or of any other company in Canada
to curtail business. If that practice were
followed out every businessman in Canada
would lie down when he got to a certain
place and say, "I will do no more business."
And the members of the Senate might say,
"Since we are taxed over the $1,500 exemption
for marriage status, we will not attend any
more sessions." I give my honourable friend
credit and say that the individuals with whom
she has discussed the matter have been sincere
in what they said, but I doubt if their viewpoints affect the economy of this country
very much. I say to her that if it were in my
power to offer an income of $2,250 to thousands of families in the province of Nova
Scotia, on conditions thait they pay $70 a year
in taxes, they would take it so quickly, it
would make her head whirl.
.

$2,250

Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: May I ask the honourable senator a question in respect to his
figures? Apparently I have not been reading
correctly the table that was issued by the
Department of Finance. When I spoke yesterday I said that I was not very good at jigsaw
puzzles. This table states that where the wife's
earnings are $780--a trifle over the $750 mentioned by my honourable friend-and the husband earns $1,500 the tax is $124. The figure
my honourable friend gave was $70. What is
the reason for the discrepancy?

Hdn. Mr. ROBERTSON: I forgot to mention in the course of my remarks how
impressed I was with my honourable friend's
remarks about the figures. A copy of that
table was sent to me too, and I said to the
fellow who brought it over that Senator Fallis
had seen it and had said she could not make
it out. I could not make it out either, so I
thought that it would help to explain the
problem better if I presented illustrations of
specific cases. I would not like to be crossexamined by anybody as able as my honourable friend from Peterborough, but if there
are any discrepancies between the figures she
has and those supplied by the Department of
Finance, I think it would be an excellent idea
for lier to cross-examine the officials who
come before the committee.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. N. MeLEAN: Honourable senators,
I am going to say something with reference to
Newfoundland today, but before doing so, I
should like to associate myself with constructive criticism of the honourable senator from
Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis) as to the
increased taxes on married women. Last session
legislation was passed increasing the tax on
married women who work outside the home.
I spoke very strongly in committee against
its enactment, for these reasons: first, it
seemed to me to be discriminating against
citizens in a certain class by raising their
taxes when other income taxpayers were
getting a reduction; secondly, I had a great
fear that the tax would kill incentive and
that many sincere hard-working women would
quit their jobs at a time when their services
were needed fully as much as at any time in
history.
Honourable senators will remember that
representatives from the Bank of Canada came
before us in committee last year and stated
that every available worker should remain in
productive work. One has only to travel about
the country, as I have, or read the press, to
realize that the fears some of us had last
year materialized to an even greater extent
than we foresaw. Thousands of working married
women in every part of Canada either quit
their jobs or reduced their services to part
time. During the past year hospitals all over
the country have been desperate for nurses,
and have had to eut down on their services,
yet there is no greater or more necessary
service rendered in Canada.
Married women school teachers, who render
a great and necessary service in the education
of our youth, also have resigned their positions,
and country schools are finding it almost
impossible to carry on.

JUNE 19, 1947
During the war tens of thousancts of
married women did a great and patriotic job
for this country by working long hours outside the home wherever they were needed. The
war was sarcely over when their taxes were
substantially raised-a rnighty poor kind of
thanks for the contribution they made.
Seasonal industries are especially adversely
affected by the present tax. In certain packing seasons every hand available is sorely
.needed. Many married women are expert
packers. In the canning and chocolate factories they do an excellent work that cannot
be doue by men. Many married wornen excel
in the packing of foods. They are absolutely
essential in carrying the peak load wben, the
season is on, and are capable of earning $25
a week or more. To earn this amount, tbey
often hire fernale help to corne into their
homes a fcw hours; a day to do the cleaning
weork and pay them $7 of $8 a week out of
their own pockets. The least that can be
done is to allow these working women to
deduct from their taxable income the amount
tbey pay to such hel.p. In many cases if tbey
did not hire this help they would not be
able to stay on the job and earn what they
do. 1 cannot see that in the long run the
Government would be out rnucb, if anything,
if this exemption were allowed, and many
more of these expert women would be kept
on the job steadily in productive work in
seasons of the year when crops have to be
gathered and food preserved, thus increasing
the production which is so necessary at these
times.
I should like to refer to a circular wbicb
was sent out by the Department of Finance
a few days ago. 1 presume ail honourable
senators received a copy. It states that the
tax reductions cornmencing JuIy 1 reduce to
very moderate proportions the increase in the
h.usband's tax that cornes about because his
wife is working, and that the assumption by
some rnarried couples that the tax increase
is such that there is little or no advantage for
the wifc to continue to take up employment
is quite erroneous.
I have exarnined the
figures, and I do not agree witb this statement. According to the table attached to the
circular, a married schooil teacher, for instance,
who takes a country school at the small salary
of $780 per year, and whose husband is in the
$1,500 class, pays $124 tax out of her meagre
salary. Now a school teacher has to dress
fairly well and has to maintain a certain
station in our society. How is she going to
save anything while paying such high taxes?
1 do flot see how she is going to break even.
If she were paid around $1,000, the tax would

be $200. Many would really like to take the
work for the community's sake, but this tax
is too big a hurdie for them to get over. One
can readily apprcîate how the tax kilîs
incentive.
Let us take the case of thc rnarried nur-se.
If she receives the usual salary for nurses
around $30 per week, ber tax will be ovex
$300. Now, nurses also have to dress well,
and have dlean uniforms every day; and they
often work long hours, especially on private
cases, and return home tired. The mai ority
of them have to pay belp to corne to their
homes, perhaps as much as $10 a weck. After
paying over $300 taxes and say another $500
for help, with no exemption allowed for that
item, how mucb is left? Not enough to give
one much incentive.
I scarcely know why anyone would tbink
the taxes are going to show any worth while
decrease after July 1. 1 have before me a
table which I believe is quite correct.
It
shows that in 1947 anyone earning $1,000 will
have bis take-home pay increased by about
one and one-third per cent by reason of the
reduction in income tax; and in 1948, by two
and three-quarters per cent. That is hardly
worth calling attention to, because it is the
take-home psy that counts with those who
labour in industry and services. Some will
say that married women paid taxes before
the war. That is true, but the exemptions
were s0 high that they were not affected then
as they are now, and there was not so great
a dernand for married women workers as
there is today.
Had exemptions been increased in the
budget to $1,000 on single persons and $2,000
on married persons, the problem would be
pretty well on the way to a solution, but since
the war we raised the lower brackets on single
persons from $660 to only $750-a mere $90
-and from $1,200 to $1,500 on married persons, and then placed this beavy tax on marî'ied women. During the war not many girls
trained for nursing, scbool teacbing or special
trades, but went into the war services instead.
It was easily seen there would be a scarcity
in these other services during the first few
years after the war.
In these circumstances it seems absolutely
illogical to aggravate the situation by putting
on a tax that kilîs incentive and drives
thousands of married women in the classes
I have mentioned out of productive services.
The sure cure for inflation. which we hear so
much about, is more production. Any tax
or regulation that slows down production
stimulates inflation. I know from. experience
that our taxing methods have slowed down the

SENATE
production of real wealth to such an extent
that in many cases the loss bas amounted to
several times the tax collected.
The circulai makes reference to taxes in
United States and Great. Britain.
It is
hardiy fair to compare oui' income tax system
xvith that of the United States or Great
Britain. In the United States there are many
exemptions that we do flot bav e, and there is
no sales tax, whichi bears heaviiy on the
ordinarv man bore. Great Britain ericourages
foreign iestment and doca nlot colleet taxes
on dividends as we do; in fact, the dividend
taxes in that country are very light, except
in cases where the taxpayer has a very large
income.
1I(Io hope anme way cao bo found to taise
s-ubsdantiaily the exemption in the lower
income brackets and eliminate this heavy
increase in taxes. on married women who did
sc
a good job during the war period and
are prepared to do just as a good a job in
peace lime, if given a fair deail.
Those wbio have the taxing powers .should
realize that it i'. impossible to impose an
increase in taxes, on a qxiall minority, and
gix'c ex erynne else a reduction ivithout causing
xide'.pread (ik'.atisfaction.

Honotîrable senators, before the end of the
present month, a delegation of prominent
citizens froin Newfoundland wili visit Ottawa,
seeking- information as to what terms Canada
would be willing to grant if Newfoundland
decided to Join in partnership with our
dominion and become a province of our confederation.
These gentlemen from Newfoundlanid tire duly elected delegates to a
national convention xvhich xvas convened to
inveacigate what form of goveriment Newfoundland shouid have in future. As you
know, at the presenit tinie, 'this fine island is
governed by a Commission consisting of three
appointed Newfoundland citizens, three civil
serviotas from England and a Governor appointed by the Crown. There are forty-five
delegates making up the convention wbich
were elected last summer. As stated, they
are gatbering information as to what form
of goverrnmcnt would be hess for Newfoundland in future-whetber she should continue
the prescrit C7ommission government, or set
up a responsible goverrnent of her nwn, or
conferate with Canada.
I believe the

information gathercd by these delegates will
be placed before the people in the real
democratic way, and a plebiscite will be held,
and the people will vote for the kind of
goveroment they desire.
Newfoundland is the oldest colony of the
empire. This great island is populated by a
people like ourselves-gond British citizens.
It, bas been my gond fortune to have travelled about the island very considerably and
1 know many people there, including quite
a number of the delegates. In fact, I have
hiad the bonour of being asked te, appear
before anme of the eommittees of their convention who xvero seeking information regarding the world fisbery situatinn.
Ox or there. thcv are a stalwart hiard-xx'rking
people, and in my opinion would inake a great
addition to Canada. In faet, there would be
substantial benefits on both sides, if Newfcunidlaod saw fit t0 docide to enter into
parînership with us. The per capita debt
of the iaind is low, considerably less than
ours,amnuonting Io around $230 per hiead. The

J UNE 19, 1947
As I have stated, the people of Newfoundland-there are 320,000 of thern-are good
British citizens. Their fathers also were
British citizens. There are no cornmunists
over thei'e. So if we desire to add to our
population in this great country, why flot
offer Newfoundland a generous deal and
endeavour ùo bring her into partnership?
Her people should have a preference over
many others we are talking about.
Take the position of this great island from
a geograpbic standpoint. I do not need to
tell honourable senators, who have the interest of our commonwealth at heart, what a
strategîcal position the island of Newfoundland
and the territory of Labrador hoid, whether it
be commercial, air power, or defence air power.
We have only to look at the map to become
convinced. These territories are the reai
outposts of the nortihern Atlantic coast, quite
similar 10 Alaska and the islands off the Pacifie
coast. A consolidation of our Atlantic seaboard is most desirable, indeed, from every
standpoint. Can we, as -a great nation, afford
to drift -aiong and in any way ignore the possibilities of the wonderfui opportunity now
presented 10 us for a partnership with these
fine hard-working people and their great territory? It may prove 10 be a step toward a
greater unity. It is flot beyond a possibility, by
any means, that some day, in the not too
distant future, we may have one large maritime
province consisting of the three present
Maritime Provinces and Newfoundiand. I
believe we shouid bend backward in extendîng
generous terms of ail-out partnership, if
Newfoundiand desires to corne in with us.
When Alaska joined the United States,
strong criticisma came frorn some of the older
conservative states. It was said Alaska was
an ice box and would be a continuai liability
to tbe great American republic. Well, we ail
know that Seward's vision was more than
fuily reaiized. Alaska is rich in resources and
has contributed many bundreds of millions
worth of raw materials to the partnership;
and today Alaska is sometimes rightiy caiied
a Gibraltar of the air.
I am sure if we have the rigbt vision and
do our utmost to mccl Newfoundland more
than haif way when ber delegates corne to us
seeking terrms of confederation, and if the
people there decide to corne in witb Canada,
future years wiil prove that on both sides
there was great. foresigbt; and those who
corne after us, whetber tbey may live in Newfoundiand or other provinces of this great
confederation, wiii have evcry reason to be
grateful 10 those who laid the foundation of
the partnership.

I personally arn acquaiiited with several of
the delegates who are coming. The whole
delegation are outstandingly fine citizens of a
great country, and I do hope every honourable senator wili meet ail the members. I
feel sure this branch of parliament will give
careful consideration to, any proposais that
rnay lead to a confederation of this great
British isiand and our country. If Newfoundland becornes a province it can contribute a
very great deai to our other provinces, and
they can do many things for Newfoundland.
The great benefits would be mutual. If she
came in with us we wouIrd ail be equal partners. That is the spirit that should prevail
in a worid that is tomn in many places by
dissension.
We, in North America, are fortunate, indeed
to be surrounded by friendly peoples who have
our own ideals, people who are ali-out in
their support of tolerance, demnocracy and
British institutions. In these tirnes of trouble
and stress the dloser we, and the friends who
are near us, work together, the greater will
be our accomplishments for peace and good
Mill.
Honouraýble senators, the opportunity is
presented to us now to receive the delegates
of a great people like ourselves, a people who
stand on guard for the very things we love
and respect. We are living, as we aIl know, in
very trouhlecI times. One of the greatest
things that ecould be accornplished now is the
maximum of unity and pafership throughout
our half of the North American continent.
H-on. M. LACASSE: May I be permitted
to ask soine questions of my honourable
friend? First, I wish to thank him for his
enlighteninýg statement on New'foundiand; and,
in order to render it more valuable at this
particular stage of the debate, I would
candidly ask him to add to the picture of
Newfoundland a description of the taxation
picture over there as compared with that of
Canada, so that we may know whether our
comparative Position is such that it is likely
to induce them to join us or to scare them
away frorn us.
Hon. Mr. MeLEAN: Honourarbie senators,
I do not think I should go int the details of
Newfoundiand's taxation system today. The
main part of the revenue there comes from
tariffs. Newfoundland uses tariffs for revenue,
as she bas very little industry to, protect.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCIC: I wonder if the
honourable senator will confirm the report that
I have with regard to, Newfoundland. It is
to the effect that the bulk of the revenue is
raised from tariffs. I understand th-at there

INCOME WAR TAX BILL
SECOND

READING

The Senate resumed from Thursday, June,
19, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Hayden for the second reading of
Bill 269, an Act to amend the Income War
Tax Act.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators, the debate on this bill was adjourned
at my request, and unless some honourable
s'enators wish to continue the debate, I have
one or two observations to make, which will
formalhy close the discussion on second
reading.
The debate that foliowed the explanation
of the bill dealt wîth the provisions of our
income tax law generally, and did not raise
an issue requiring any answers as to particular points covered by the proposed amendments to the act. Therefore, there is nothing
that I propose to add at this time. I intend,
after second reading is given, to move that
the bill be sent to the Committee on Finance.
Without further comment, I am formally
closing the debate.
Hon. GAIRINE R. WILSON: Honourable
senators, niay I crave your indulgence for a
moment? As a good deal lias been said on the
question of the reduced exemption for married
women, particularly as it affects nurses, 1
should like to place on Hansard an officiai
communication from thec Secretary of the
Canadian Nurses' Association. It refers to a
discussion by -the executive o! the association.
In reference to income tax exemption for married nurses the discussion reveahed conflicting
opinions. At one stage of the meeting it was
feit t-hat it wouhd be unwise for the Canadianx
Nurses' Association to ask any special consideration for nurses. It was recognized that the financial effect wihl be small but that the psychohogical effect is a f actor which must be considered. The feeling was expressed that a
r uest for exemption for married nurses wouhd
refleet adversehy on the profession if it were
pointed out that mercenary considerations prevented nurses f romn giving their services when
the need is so great.
The whole matter was referred to the Resohutions Committee for careful study, with the
resuit that the following resohution was presented and adopted:
"Whereas new lias Ïbeen widespread discussion of the there tax regulations for married
women -

SENATE
And whereas it is anticipated that a certain
number of married nurses xvill give up nursing
when the regulations corne into effect, in p art
due to the resentmnent expressed by their husbands, whose incomne tax wili be altered:
Be it resolved: That the Executive Committee of tlic Canadian Nurses' Association coinmunicate by te]egram with the Minister of Finance urging that the application of the new
regulation bc deferred for one 3 ear bccause of
the serious shortage of nursing service at the
present time."

So apparentiy the nurses themselves do flot
take this vory seriousiy. As a woman 1 protest that wc cannot be both dependents and
wage-earners at the samne time. Wben a
woman is fu]filiing ber obligations at home,
perhaps she shouid ha entitled to some consideration; but I tbink, it woul reflect very
mucb on the members of our sex if we were
willing to work outside the home only when we
were not caiied upon to make any contribution in thse way of taxes. I tbink tbat if we
dlaim tbe right to earn income wc sbould not
seek exemption fremn taxes.
.Women wbo stay at borne bave received
substantial concessions in cbildren's allowanccs
and motbers' aliowances. Perhaps we sbouid
receive a littie more consideration wben we are
fulfiiing what is considered to lie our primary
duty, in bringing up usefu1 citizens for our
country. But if I am a wage-carncr I do not

The motion xvas agreed te, and tlic bill was

PRAIRIE FARM
SECOND

ASSISTANCE

BILL

READING

Hon. A. B. COPP meved tbe second reading
of Bill 261, an Act te amend tbe Prairie Farm
Assistance Act, 19,39.
He said: Tbe beneurable senater from
Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Jobnston)
bas kindly censented te explain tbis bill.
Hon. J. FREDERICK JOHNSTON: Honourable senators, this bill proposes two main
amendments te tbe Prairie Farm Assistance
Act, along w'ith certain miner administrative
changes.
As bonourable senaters know, the act as
iwas set up in 1939 provided for payments
urider twe different sections. Under one, tbe
Governor in Council migbt declare any year
an emergency year; or, under tbe other, ha
migbit deciare a province a crop failure area

if the yiel-d in a certain number of townships

fell below a specified minimum. Tbe administrative unit fer purposes of payment was the
townsbip. If the average yield for the township as a wbiole fell witbin a certain range,
eacb farrner in tlie district was paid a certain
sum on balf bis cultivated acreage, according
to a graduated scale. Up te the 1945-46 crop
year, total payments tînder the act were about
62 million dollarsHon. Mr. DUFF: Is that ail?
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON:
-of wbicb the
farmers tbeînzelves contributedi about 22
million dollars by virtue of a one per cent
levy on ail grain marketed in the prairie
provinces.
Sections 3 and 4 of the presenit act are
repealed. Section 3 is tbe one wbicb provides
for payment of certain amounts on an acreage
oasis in a vear wbich tbe Governor in Council
declares te be an emergency year; and section
4 is the one under wvbicb tbe Governor in
Council could deciare a certain number of
townships te be a cr-op failure area. The
preposed ameadments xvill enable the Gevernor in Couneil te inake payments in any
yr itlîout deularing it an ernergcncv ycar,
and wvill do away wvith the requirement that
therc bc a crop failure in a number of townships, and net mcrelv in one, in order te bave
a declaration of a cr-op failure aiea.
The provision for two different ranges et
payments is cntirely donc away witb. and the
îneasure will eperate autematically. If in one
township or more tbere is a y ield of eigbt
busbcls pcr acre or icss, payînents wvill bc
made on the basis provîded in the bill. Section 3 of the act previded fer l)ayment wbere
flic yield wvas four buAbeis or less, and section
4 provided for payment wbere the yield was
five bushels or iess, but under tbe new provisiens payment will be made automatically in
every township in wbicb there are four
busbcis or less. That is tbe principal cbange
made by the bill.
The bill aise repeais the provision in the
act wbcrcby paymient, was denied te any
farmer having over 3,000 busheis of wbeat; se
thant ne matter wbat bushelage a farmer lias,
he may be entitled te payment.
Tbe etber amendments set eut in tbe bill
are of muiner importance. The definitions of
"1cultivated land" and "farmer" are given witb
precisien for administrative purpeses. The
problem of deciding the area of cuitivated
land owned by a member of a ce-operative
farm association is to, be bandled by ministerial regulations rather than by provisions in
tbe act itself.

453

JUNE 24, 1947
The changes in the act put the administration of prairie farm assistance, in cases of
widespread crop, failure, on a simpler and more
logical basis. I might point out that the
government has always considered that the
federal authority should nlot be expccted te
carry th~e entire responsibility for farm relief.
Under the provisions of this bill, where whole
areas of township size or larger are hit by
drought the dominion will carry the respensibility. In isolated cases, however, where a
small number of farms have poor creps, it is
feit that the local and provincial governments
ought te take the responsibility. Much of the
criticism of the Prairie Farm Assistance Act
administration arises from the fact that a few
farmers with poor crops receive ne benefits
under the act, either because the rest of the
farmers in the township had good crops or
because the farms concerned did nlot faîl inte
the smallest unit for administration purpeses
under the act-a quarter of a township,
bordered on at least one side by a township
receiving assistance. The answer to the criticismn is that the act was designed to deal with
crop failure over wide ameas rather than in
spccific and isolated cases, and that in order
to do this a line must be drawn somnewhere.
As long as the act remains in its present form
there will likely be individual farmers Who
feel that they are being treatcd unfairly. The
solution is for the local and provincial authorities to look after such cases. Where a few
isolated farms have poor creps, or crop failores, year after year, the land is probahly net
fit for farming. Over the past few ycars much
of this land has heen taken complctely eut of
cultivation. If aid were given te every
individual case, it would be even more difficult
to take such land eut of cultivation.
As te the amounts to be paid, subsection (2)
(a) of new section 3 of the act reads as follows:
If the average yield of wheat in the township
is fourni by the board to be more than eight
an(l net more than twelve bushels per acre, the
award shail he ten cents per acre of the cultivated land of the f armer for each cent, or
fraction thereof, not exceeding ten, by whichi
the average price is less than eighty cents per
hushel.

In other words should the price go down
te 70 cents a bushel the farmer would receive
10 cents per acre for each cent the price is
helow 80 cents. If the price feIl te 70 cents
hie weuld receive $1 per acre. The hill sets

New section 3(2) (b) says:.

In

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: No matter what

As this assistance can be earned in respect of
net more than one-haîf ef the cultivated
acreage, a man with 400 acres who qualified on
the maximum of 200 acres would receive $500.
With regard te sub-marginal land, it might
be interesting te note that, since the advent
of the Prairie Farmn Assistance Act, the
government have been attempting to put al

government lias net been able te make a

seven years their growth has been rapid. All
the suh-marginal lands which have been taken

which I shall give. Last year, that is in 1946-47,
154,000 acres in Manitoba and 1,257,000 acres
in Saskatchewan were taken inte community
pa.stures. Se a real effort is bcing made te
see that these lands, which should neyer have

in this retumn: it would net be a large proportion of this total of 1,411,000 acres.

SENATE

This bill, honourable senators, was discussed at length in another place, and referred
to its Committee on Agriculture, where every
section was given a thorough airing. I eaunot see that any good purpose would be served
by sending it to one of the committees of the
Senate, although if it is desired to do so I
would have no objection.
Hon. F. W. GERSHAW: Honourable senators, having been interested for a long time
in this legislation and the organization set up
under it, I desire to say a few words. Before
1939, if there was a crop failure people had
to seek relief. It was a most humiliating
condition, and often relief was difficult to
obtain. As a consequence of this act some
$62,000,000
has
been distributed
among
farmers, at a cost, for administration, of
$2,000,000. The legislation has been a great
blessing to many people who lived on these
sub-marginal lands. The government has collected about $22,000,000 by a tax on all grain.
The act is one which it is difficult to administer with any degree of fairness. It has
caused rivalry and bitterness. To be paid,
a man must be in an eligible township, an
area six miles square. Aiso payment may be
made if a rectangular area containing only
nine sections adjoins an eligible township, and
suffers a crop failure. But only these large
square areas become eligible for payment,
and it sometimes happens that a man within
such an area who markets a fair crop is paid
$400 or $500, whereas one living just across
the road allowance who sustains a complete
crop failure is net entitled to compensation,
because as measured by departmental officers
there was not a crop failure in his township.
So there are many reasons why this act
should be on an individual basis, but it would
be difficult to administer it in that way.
Another difficulty that we have encountered
many times is that along about July or
August a man will sec that his crop has gone
and he will want to go somewhere to work
and earn a little money, but the act provides
that he must be on the farm from May 1 to
November 1. If he goes away to work, as
many have donc, he loses his dry bonuses.
Honourable senators, this act has been in
operation for eight years, and for seven of
those years payments have been made in the
manner as explainéd by the honourable senator
from Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Johnston). Eighty-two townships have qualified
for payment in every one of the seven years;
396 have qualified in six years, and 849 in
five years. Thus it can be seen that there
are many people living on land where crop
failures occur frequently. In fact, during the
last seven years 1,160 farmers have received

an average of $1,760 each. Surely it would be
the part of wisdorn to try some other means
of increasing production in those areas.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Had we better move the
farmers off the land?
Hon. Mr. GERSHAW: You would have a
difficult time doing that. That has been tried
and it has proved heart-breaking. In some
areas those who have made a good living are
very attached to their homes and cling tenaciously to them. Some of the land has been
put into community pastures, but not in the
province of Alberta. It is an extremely difficult
undertaking. It might be suggested that land
be left to ranchers; but there too is a problem, because there is no more free openrange land. In years gone by the dominion
government invited thousands of land-hungry
settlers to go into these areas. People went
there and built roads, churches, fences, schools,
homes, towns and villages. The government
divided the land into townships, sections and
quarter-sections and gave homesteads and preemptions to hopeful farmers.
Now some
method will have to be devised by which they
can make a living there. The probler can
be solved by irrigation systems.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Can the land not be
improved?
Hon. Mr. GERSHAW: That is really
impossible, as it is too large an area. The
minister has tried to do something, and the
community pastures have helped. Also, there
is before parliament at the present time a bill
for advancing some $6,000,000 to the province
of Alberta to help it reforest the eastern slope

water runs away instead of continuing in a
steady flow. If those mountain sides were
protected from fire there would be a great
increase in the size of the mountain streams
and in the different surrounding bodies of
water.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: What is the yearly
average contribution by the government?
Hon. Mr. GERSHAW: Over a five year
period it is $6,000,000.

JUNE 24, 1947
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators,
I should like to associate myself with my
honourable friend from Kingston (Hon. Mr.
Davies), with a view to having the bill referred
to committee for further study. The honourable gentleman from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) said that he did not wish to strike a
discordant note, but I believe he sounded a
salutory note. For this house to pass a bill
of this kind, with the weaknesses that have
been admitted by its advocates, would show
a lack of enterprise and earnestness in the
public interest on our part, It has been shown
that we are to carry unprofitable land for all
time, or until this legislation is finally disposed of in some way in the far future. People
not making a living are asking those who are
successful to carry them, not for a period of
emergency, but possibly for all time. In some
of the speeches it bas been shown that some
people are paid, whereas others, equally deserving are not paid. Above all, the cirçumstance
that some provinces have this benefit from
the public purse and others have not, appears
to me to be very strange. I should not like
to see a bill of this kind, pass with little or
no consideration by men who are seriously
seeking the public interest, as we are in this
house. I support the suggestion that the bill
be sent to a committee for further study, and,
perhaps, for some amendments, or at least
some suggestions.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD (Kings): May I say,
by way of explanation and comment on what
the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) has said regarding assistance to
fruit growers, that this assistance was given
to them to save the industry for the future.
Upon the outbreak of the late war we lost our
market in England, where in normal times
eighty-five per cent of our fruit, principally
Nova Scotia apples, was marketed. I think
the government is entitled to credit for trying to save what is a very valuable national
industry, and one which, but for this assistance, would have been lost.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That argument would
apply to other industries in the same degree.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN (St. Jean Baptiste): It would apply to manufacturing
industries.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: What about men
who lose their jobs?
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. DAVIES: If no one else is going

The motion was agreed to.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

-

Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL moved the second
reading of Bill 112, an Act respecting The
Canada Permanent Trust Company.
He said: Honourable senators, I do not
think that this bill requires much explanation.
It merely provides for an increase in the capital of the Canada Permanent Trust Company
from one million dollars to five million dollars, and in the share capital from ten
thousand to fifty thousand shares. This company was incorporated by Act of Parliament
in 1913, and has done a trust company business throughout Canada. Its business has
increased substantially, and it was thought
desirable that there should be an increase in
capital to support the present volume of
business. The bill is self-explanatory, and I
do not think it requires any study in committee. It simply states in the enacting provision that "the capital stock of the company
shall be five million dollars, divided into fifty
thousand shares of one hundred dollars each."
As I have said, I do not think it is necessary
to send the bill to committee, but if honourable senators think otherwise, it could go to
the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: Will the shares be
offered to the publie?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: At the present time
the shares of the company are distributed and
held by the public; and I assume that, when
the shares which are authorized by the
increase are distributed, they will be offered
also to the shareholders and the piblic generally. I do not know that any decision has
been made as to the actual offering of the
new capital.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. LEGER: While there may be no
objection to this bill, it has been the practice
of the Senate to send every private bill ta a
committee. For my part I think we should
follow that practice, which in my opinion is a
salutary one.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I move that the
bill be referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.

REVISED EDITION

458

SENATE

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. W. deB. FARRIS (for Hon. Mr.
Bouffard) moved the second reading of Bill
J12, an Act to incorporate The Limitholders
Mutual Insurance Company.
Hie said: Honourable senators, 1 offer a
brief explanation of tbis bill. This too is an
insurance bill, but its principle is very different. It embodies the principle that the Lord
helps those who help themselvcs, and it
involves no insurance contribution fromn the
state. The purpose of the bill is to enahie
a group of owners acting under a mutual
arrangement to carry a certain amount of
insurance against fire loss on their standing
timher. Honourable sonators know, I
1helieve,
that this formn of insurance cannot bo securod
fromn the ordinary insurance company. So a
group of large timber holdors in the eastern
part of Canada-the provinces of Quebec and
New Brunswick, and possihly othor provinces
-are proposing through the medium of this
corporation, if sanction is given hy parliament,
to carry a mutual forma of insurance.
To obtain assurance on the matter it first,
hand I called up Mr. Finlayson today, and
I have his statement that ho bas thoroughly
investigated this proposition, that he has
assisted the promoters in the by-laws which
will ho adopted if the company is incorporated, and that hoe is entirely behind the bill.
For the information of the senator who is
looking at me, I may say that no shares will
ho offered to the puhlic. There is a limitation
that shares can ho held only hy those who
take out insurance on their limits under the
seheme; and if any shareholder allows his
insurance policy to lapse the shares may ho
transferred to another shareholder, in accordance with a hook valuation to ho worked out
under the provisions of the bill.
The capital stock of the company is one
million dollars.
Before the company can
appoint directors and organize, the amount
suhscriýbed must ho $100,000, and before it
starts business the amounit subscrihed must ho
a haif million dollars, with $200,000 of that suma
paid in cash. 0f course, with the type of mon
and companies; who are behind this, the romaining $300,000 is just as good as cash. The
premium rate is high. It is, I undorstand,
fifty cenfs on one hundred dollars, up to the
total valuation of the amount tho company
expects to carry in insurance. It works out
so that there will ho about $125,O0O in premiums the first year. Added to tho suhscribed
capital this will make S625,OOO available in the
first year to take care of losses. I do flot wisb

to tire the bouse witb figures, and I am not
sure that I understand tbem very well myself.
However, an estimate has 'heen made of the
lires that have taken place and the losses
incurred in any one area.
I have Mr.
Finlayson's word for it that, taking the rate,
either the average or the maximunm for any
one year, it is considered that this $625,000 is
fully ample for even any calamitous lire that
might take place. The sebeme is dýesigned, of
course, so that if there are no lires the reserve
will ho built up and the rates will go down.
In any event, those who pay the piper in the
event of a big loss will ho those wbo own the
company. It is entirely self-contained and is
a mutual sebeme to provide for tbemselves a
type of insurance that could flot ho secured
in1 any other manner.
Hon. Mr. NICOL; Is it insurance on stand,
ing timber?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yos, fire insurance on
standing timber.*
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Honourable senators, I
movo that this bill ho referred to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills.
The motion was agreed to.
SUSPENSION

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: loýnourable sena tors, I
wisb to present the following resolution, wbicb
bas been prepared for me by Mr. Hinds, Chief
Clerk of Sonate Committees:
That rule 119 bo suspended in so far as it
relates to Bill J12, intituled: "An Act to ilcorporato The Limnitholders' Mutuel Insurance
Company."
If this motion is passed it will not ho
necessary to give seven days' notice before a
meeting of the committee can ho called, to
consider the bill.
The motion was egreed to.
NATIONAL PAR(S, BILL
CONCURRENCE IN AMENDMENTS

The Sonate proceeded to considieration of
the amendments mede hy the Standing Coinmittee on Naturel Resources to Bill 9, an
Act respecting certain National Parks and to,
amend the National Parks Act.
Hon. Mr. COPP moved concurrence in the
amnendments.

JUNE 24, 1947
Han. W. M. ABELTINE: Honourable senators, I wish ta make a few general remarks
with respect ta this bill. I believe I was ane
of those responsibie for having the bili1 sent
for cansideration ta the Cornmittee on Natural
Resources. My real purpose in doing that
was to get information frorn officiais of the
Department of Mines and Resources, the
Indian Departinent and any other departmnents
having anything ta do with the handiing of
this legisîntion. I arn chiefly concernied about
Prince Albert National Park, in the province
of Saskatchewan. I say ta honourable senators that I arn and always have been unalterably opposed ta the boundaries of that park
being changed one iota. Section 3 of the
bill reads:
Those parcels or tracts of land described in
.Schedule D ta, this Act are withdrawn from
Prince Albert National Park and declared te
be no langer required for park purpases.
An explanation given in cornmittee was ta
the effect that there were sorne 4 00 Indians in
the Montreal Lake area, and that it was advisable that they should be given the right ta
trap in the area of sorne 350 square miles
which it is now praposed ta withdraw frorn the
park. That is a very large territory. Also
saine objection was raised ta t4e cost of
patrolling the area in order ta prevent fires.
I was unable ta find out exacthy how rnany
families the 400 Indians represented, but in
answer ta a question of mine as ta whether or
not they would be the onhy ones alhowed ta
trap in the area in question I learned that
half-breeds and white settiers were aIso given
permission. It is my opinion that under
those circumstances the poor Indians would
flot have much chance. 1 discovered, moreover, that in the area there are 100 snail
lakes and three or four large lakes.
If honourable senators will pardon a personal reference, I might say that I have
hunted big garne in the area aiong the eastern
boundary of that park. 1 hold in my hand
a nxap which outlines the large area that it is
proposed ta take away fromn the park. It was
added ta the park originally for the purpose
of preserving wild life, including rnuskrats,
mink and ail kinds of fur-bearing animais,
particularhy the beaver, and big gaine, such
as elk, moose, and deer. It is known for a
certainty that the animais we were hunting on
the eastern boundary of the park were bred
in that park and had spread throughout the
surrounding country. This is particularhy true
of Candis Lake, the home of the hast surviving
band of elk running at large in Western
Canada. That territory is their home ground,
and if it is taken out of the park and thrown
83168-So0T1!

open ta the public it will only be a year or
two before ail those animais are shot and
kiiied.
Hon. Mr. BUCOHANAN: Wouid those,
animais not be under the regulations of the
wiid life gaine lame of the province of
Saskatchewan?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Persans have been
aliowed ta shoot bull elk, and there is no
prohibition against shooting deer or moose.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: That is during the
closed season.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Yes, but the
open season iasts from November 15 to
December 15.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: Hlunters would not
be allowed ta go in and slaughter the elk, but
would be limited ta a certain number during
the season.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The honourable
senator bas no idea how many hunters there
are since the end of the war. During the
war years all the young men were away but
now they are back and are taking out hunting licences. They are allowed ta go into
this area. Even if the lirait were one deer
or one bull moose, it would oniy be a year
or two before ail these animais would be shot
off.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Did the officiais not
say that thîs land was not needed for a park,
and that it would revert ta the jurisdiction of
the province of Saskatchewan?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: That is correct. That
is why I arn obj ecting.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Is it not a fundamentai
principhe that the land in the country should
behong ta the province rather. than ta the
dominion?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: 1 do not see the
force of that argument at ahi.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Furthermore, if the
land cornes under the jurisdiction of the province of Saskatchewan, then provincial game
iaws wiil extend ta that area.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: But they do not
apply ta the park area.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: They wiil when that
area, is out of the park.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: In 1941 a bill sirnilar
ta this was introduced in the House of Cornmons by the then Minister of Mines and
Resources, and s0 rnuch objection was raised
ta rernoving this saine area frorn the park
that the bill was dropped. Now, six years

460

SENATE

inter, we bave the measure coming up again.
Aithougli I have littie objection to the other
parts of this bill, I strongiy protest against
any substantial area being taken out of
Prince Albert National Park. This land was
set aside, not only as a park but as a place
in wbich to preserve for posterity the wild
life of that part of Saskatchewan. 1 do flot
need to tell bonourabla senators that Saskatchewan is a great prairie province. It is
about 350 miles wvide along the forty-ninth
parallai of latitudc, and it runs north for six.
seven or aigbt bundred miles up to tbe sixtieth
parailel of latitude. Bcginning at the soutbern
boundary, the forty-ninth paraliel, you can
travel north for hundreds of miles without
seeing a trea or a shrub. You sce very fc'w
lakes and oniy the main rivers until you get
up to about the nortbern part of Prince
Albert in tbe park area.
The objeat in establishing this park in the
beginning wvas to give the farmers and other
people of Saskatchewan a playground where
tbey could economicaily spcnd their liolidays.
Lt is entireiy different from Banff or Jasper,
which are vcry expansive places; the people
of the. Praiir, provinces have not the monev
to spond at such rcsorts. But tbcy can go to
Prince Albert National Park and stay thaere
for two or thrce weeks or longer at vcry littie
cost. I baliave that every acre in the park
shouid be proerved on that account. Also it
should be presarvcd for the conservation of
wiid lifa. One cao drive through tbe park,
and sec eik, moosc, deer, beaver and many
other animais. Many of the animais are brcd
in this area naw proposed to be taken fromn
the park.
For tlicse rcasons I am much opposed to
the bill being passcd as it is. 1 arn not, bowever, opposed ta providing for the building of
cottages and making lots av-ailablc for building sites and other suchl purposes. My opposition is ta the park being cnt down in area.
I amn p( rfectiy satisfied that if the land proposed ta be taken out is given ta the province
it wiil nev er again go back ta the park. The
timber wiil ha eut dýown and the fire hazard
wili be jncreased because of the tree tops and
branches baing laft ta burn; and the animais
wiii ba dacimatad.
Furthermorc, I do flot
think the area prop'osad to be takcn away is
good for anything but park purposes. If the
governmcnt is saaking ta save some money
by this change, I think it is penny-wise and
pound-foolish.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: ilonourabie scoators,
I arn not familiar with thc Western lands, but
I sat in e-ommittee when this bill was diseuissed and beard an officiai whio was sup-

posed ta be inforrncd say that there were 400
Indians living near Montreai Lake, the district
under review. He stated that these Indians
were not aiiowed ta hunt in the park area,
and that if tbis section was taken out of the
park it would provide a source of livelihood
for tbem. We hear a lot these days about tbe
Indrians, and what. Canada took from them,
and I tbink if they wiil liva up in the north
country, under sucb conditions as must prevail there, tbey sbouid bave tbe rigbts to
any available hunting. We couid very well
turn the land over ta the Indians.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Give it back
Indians.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:
ta tbe Indians.

Give

ta

the

it ail back

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: A lot of the land that
we bave been hearing about as requiriag
assistance under the Prairie Farma Assistance
Act might be given back ta the Indians.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Has the honourable
sanator ever made a tour of the Western
provinces?
Hon. Mi. KJNLEY:

Yes.

Hon. Mv. ASELTINE: Doas hae know their
magnitude?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Yes.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: That tbey migbt
bave a crop anc year and none the foliowing
year?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY:

Yas.

Hon. Mi. ASELTINE: Wbat would hie do
with ail that land?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I do not suggest anything. I was mereiy answcring an extravagant statement my friend made a few minutes
aga. I said that if any land was availabie to
the Indians wc ought ta ]et them bave it.
What w-as said beyond that was as a result of
what my friand said.
I did not understand, that the land under
discuss.ion was easiiy accessible ta hunters
generaily.
It was said that this land was
siuiîable as a feeding graîînd for animais and
nothing cisc. Surciy the province of Saskatchcwan-even though its govern.ment is contîary ta whýat I think a govcrnmcnt sbouid
be-is able ta look after its wild life. Lt is too
small a tbing for us ta propose a means that
might prevent thema from carrying out their
obligations.
Hon. Mi. ASELTINE: An aiea of 350 square
miles is involvcd.

JUNE 24, 1947
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
the matter covered. by this bill is one that
I happen to know something about. As my
honourable friend from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) stated, a bill in almost the same
terms was introduced in the House of Commons several years ago.
Hon. Mr. EULER: By whom?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: By myself.
I do not wish at the moment to go into the
reason why that bill was not proceeded with,
but I do propose to deal with this measure on
its merits and, in as kindly a way as I can, to
correct some of the misconceptions of my
honourable friend from Rosetown.
This park has an area of between 1,700 and
1,800 square miles, and the bill proposes to
take out of it approximately 350 square miles
lying to the eastern side of the park. This
particular portion is not suitable for park
purposes.
My honourable friend stated that there were
a hundred lakes, large and small, in this
particulr area. As a matter of fact, the
greater part of the area is muskeg. A small
quantity of timber might be salvaged by
small operations, but the area is not suitable
for park purposes. The people from the
prairies who visit the park would certainly not
go into this particular area in the summer
time, else they would be eaten by mosquitoes,
black flies and other pests of that kind.
Maintenance of this particular area places
an additional financial burden on the parks
administration. I cannot at the moment
recall the saving that would be effected by
removing this useless piece of land from the
park, but it would amount to several thousand
dollars a year. My honourable friend's argument that it was necessary as a breeding
ground for elk is, to my mind, rather thin.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN (St. Jean Baptiste):
It is a misconception.

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: He referred to it as
the only place where any large herd of elk
is found in Western Canada. There again
my honourable friend is misinformed, because
the largest herd of elk today is in Riding
Mountain Park, in Manitoba, where their
number is estimated to be in excess of 6,000.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I was not referring
to the elk in captivity. I had in mmd those
in this park and spread out around the
surrounding country.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The elk in Riding
Mountain Park are no more in captivity than
those in the Prince Albert National Park.

The statement that the muskeg country is
necessary for breeding purposes is, I think,
quite incorrect. The whole northern part
of Saskatchewan is suitable for the propagation of these large game animals. There are
other parts of the park where elk are found
as well.
In his shooting expeditions my honourable
friend was, of course, not permitted to shoot
within the park boundaries, but skirted, as
hunters quite legitimately do, the boundaries
of the park, over which animals sometimes
stray and where they may be legally shot.
But to argue that this provision will cause
the disappearance of the elk in this particular
park is, in my opinion, very wide of the
mark.
There is a real and positive reason why the
proposed change should be made. I do not
wish to take up the time of the house tonight
in discussing the fur conservation projects
which were started about ten years ago by the
Department of Mines and Resources; but,
in brief, projects were undertaken in Quebec,
Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and
British Columbia, to aid the Indians in the
northern parts of those provinces who have
no other means of livelihood. Now arrangements have been made in each case with the
provincial authorities under which development programmes tre being carried forward,
and it is the intention, we were informed in
committee, if these 350 square miles are
released from the park area, to develop them
as a fur conservation measure. The Indians
will not have the sole right of trapping, but
they will be assured of their fair share, and
thereby a substantial means of livelihood will
be provided for the band of Indians at Montreal lake. I may add that, to the extent to
which their livelihood is provided for in this
fashion, the amount of money to be paid
from the federal treasury for their maintenance
will be correspondingly decreased.
The measure is a sound one and should
receive the approval of this house. In fact,
this particular area should never have been
included in the park. Let me repeat that
there will remain more than 1,400 square miles
of excellent park area.
I agree with everything that my honourable friend from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) said about the benefits which a park
provides to those who live on the treeless
plains to the south. I recall being in the park
in 1937, at the height of the drought in Saskatchewan, when everything was parched. I
saw a farmer, his wife and three children
drive in to the park in an old model T Ford
car with some provisions. They found a suitable place and pitched a tent to sleep in at

462

SENATE

night; and I thought what a wonderful thing
it was that these people from the parched
prairie country could corne in and see evergreen trees and water and animais; and that,
even if the park confcrred no other benefits,
what a boon it ivas to the children. This
vacation feature is one of the great advantages of our park systcms ail across Canada.
There is nothing of which I arn more
proud than the littie part which I had the
.opportunity of playing in the devoloprnont of
national parks in this country. They are one
of our greatest assets,. I will only add that
my honourablo friend need net be tee despondent ever this change. I arn satisfiod that
it will werk out to the public good, and that
it will not detract at ail frem the bcauty and
effectivoness of Prince Albcrt National Park.
The motion was agrced to, and the bill was
rcad thec second time.

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
FINANCING AND GUARANTEE

BILL
REPORT

Hon.

OF

COMMITTEE

A. K. HUGESSEN

presented the

report of the Standing Committee on Finance
on Bill 258, an Act to authorize the provision
of moncys te meet certain capital expenditures
made and capital indebtedness incurred by the
Canadian National Railways systema during
the calendar year 1947, and to authorize the
guarantee by bis Majesty of certain securities
te o
bcisued by the Canadian National Railway Company.

H1e said:

Honourable senators, the cern-

mittee hav e in obedience to the ordcr of
reference of June 18, 1947, eNamined the said
bill and now bcg leave to report the same
without any arncndment.
Hon. JOHN T. HAI.G: Honourable members, I have been puzzled for some ycars as to
certain practices carried on in the Sonate, and
I arn told hv members who have been here
longer than i that these practices have been
carricd on for rnany years. After the principle
of a bill is approved of in the house the bill
is usually refcrrcd te a committce, where the
whole subjeet is discusscd fully. For instance,
tlic bill new before us ivas dealt with in that
way. I rcqiicstod the house to refer it to a
committeo, and a reference was made toý the
Committee on Finance. In that committee
this morning wo had a fine discussion; representatives from tbe Canadian National Railways gave good evidence and were fair in
their answers to ail the questions asked them.
But unfortunately there is no record at ail
of t.hat proceeding.
I sugg-est, that starting next session we
appoint a special committee of this house te
see what can ho donc about having a verbatima
report made of the questions asked and the
answers givon in standing committees. The
report in each case couid bo published as an
appendix te our Hansard, and thus we wouhd
have a permanent record of what went on.
In this particular case the information is very
vahiuable. Fer exampie, we asked what was
included ini the $18,000,000 for betterments
and improvements. Downtown in the city of
Winnipeg there was a Canadian National Railways o~ffice building which, was tomn down
about seven years ago and replaced by a new
building. How did that transaction appear on
the books?
To me it was of no great
importance wbetber the value of the oId
building appeared on the books as of that
date and the outlay for the year was charged
to current expenses, while the construction
item was put in under capital expenditure.

JUNE 25, 1947
I ar n ot now diiscussing the pros and cons of
the accounting system; and as governmentowned property is involved Il do flot think
it makes much, difference whether you show
depreciation on a yearly basis. That is flot
what I want to discuss. The point I arn
trying to make is that there should be a
verbatirn record of those proceedings.
Men and women ail over the country have
spoken to, me privately and written letters to
the effect: "I see that you have passed a bill.
You sent it to committee, but we do flot
know what bappened there. It came back;
there was no discussion. Did you do anything
in committee: and if so, what?" 1 think we
owe it to ourselves and to the public that
some systema should be worked out to provide
a verbatim record of proceedings in coinmittce, which could be reported to this house
and included in our Hansard as an appendix.
I was flot a member of the Senate in 1917,
but I remember very well that in the session
of that year Sir Thomas White, the then
Minister of Finance, submitted himself in
committee to a cross-examination on the
details of a matter which was then before
parliament; and the proceedings were reported
and published in the form of a brochure for
the information of the public, and proved
extremely va1uaâb1e. I recalled that incident
this morning; and I decided that at the opening of the session next year I would ask that
the question of having a verbatirn report of
proceedings before our standing committees
be considered by the house.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, I doubt whether under the rules of the
Senate the question which has been raised is
in order at this juncture; by unanimous consent, however, one may be permitted to say
one word or two about it, as the Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) bas opened
the door ta such a discussion. I hesitate to
support the suggestion of the honourable
gentleman that we should at aIl times have a
verbatirn report of the proccedings of our
standing committees. Firstly, it would entail
a considerable expense; secondly, if there
were a verbatim report our discussions might
be considerably prolonged, as is the case in
another place.
My reaction to the remarks which have
been made by the honourable gentleman is
twofold: I agree with him that there should
be a printed, or at least a typewritten, report
of our proceedings when important matters
are being dealt with by our standing committees. This can be arranged at any time,
under our present rules of practice. If a
standing committee deems it. advisable that

463

its proceedings should be reported, it can
recommend accordingly to this house and
its recommendations would generally be
approved. That is the practice followed in
another place, and in the Senate.
Secondly, I believe many bis should be
referred, not to standing committees, but to
our Committee of the Wbole.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: 0f course, when witnesses
mu.st be heard, it is necessary to refer the bill
to one of our standing committees, then, if the
inatter is of sufficient importance, the committee may ask leave to have its proceedings
reported.
Again, when such a bill is reported, it can be
sent to the Committee of the Wbolc for examination, clause by clause, and the discussion
thereon would ne.cessarily appear in our
Hansard. That would give the public a fairer
impression of the amount of work which is
being donc by the Senate in its standing committees. Under our present practice, most of
our work on important bis, like the one now
before us, remains unknown to the public.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It seems to me that
while the suggestion of the leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig) is a good one, it would flot
be pracýtical if the Senate had only the reporting staff that is available now.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No; there would have to
'be a larger staff .
Hon. Mr. EULER: The printed report of
the committee's proceedings would probably
not be received until long after the bill came
up for thirà reading. As a matter of fact,
some of our committees are reported now, but
usually we have to wait five or six days before
printed copies of the reports are available. I
rather favour the suggestion that we discuss
some buis in Committee of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Honourable senators,
I arn inclined to concur in the suggestion
made by our leader on this side (Hon. Mr.
Haig). At least, I think we should have a
report of any committee dealing with the
Canadian National Railways. About every
ten years the Senate seems to wake up to the
existence of -our national railways, and then
there is an investigation that lasts for weeks
and weeks. Often the officers of the Canadian
National Railways are not plaeed in the proper
liglit. They have been given the responsibility
of operating a railway that waa a burden to a
lot of people and a number of corporations,
and have been asked to make it a paying
proposition. That is an impossibility. In

464

SENATE

many cases the officiais have done a good job.
I feel that instead of waiting ten years, until
deficits pile up, an investigation should be
made annually by the Senate-that is the
proper body for making the investigationinto capital expenses and so on, anîd tlîat the
proceedings should bo recorded. 1 believe that
if this werc donie we would&
attain the desired
end and the Sonate would truly render a
service to the railwcy and to the public.
THIRD

RýEADING

Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, if
1 max' have unanimous consent I will move
the third reading now. My honourable friend
from Welliagton (Hon. Mr. Howard) is prepared to spcak on the bill.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Agreed.
Hon. C. B. HOWAjRD: Honourable senators, for some reasons I hesitate to make the
remarks xvhich I intend to make! this afternoon, bccause in criticizîng the railways of
Canada 1 realize that most of the executives
of the railways are personal friends of mine.
On the othier hand, 1 deem it my duty to
draw to the attention of the outstanding
business mon who compose the membersbip
of the Senate of Canada some factors relating
to railways.
Some years ago while I was a. member of
the House of Commons there was a publicity
campaiga to the effect that if the deficits of
the Canadian National Railways were allowed
to continue they would bankrupt Canada.
Everyone remembers that publicity. I bave
given some study to the matter, honourable
senators, and I waat to leave a few thouglits
witb you for your consideration.
I consider that the Canadian National Railways and the Canadfian Pacifie Railway are
operating to render service to the taxpayers
of Ibis country. My conclusion is that wbether
the Canadian National operates witb a deficit
or withi a surplus is only a matter of distribution of the deficit or surplus among the
Canadian taxpayers. In other words, wben
the railway operates witb a surplus it means
that the people wbo use it are paying the cost
and building up a surplus; whcn there is a
deficit in operations, it means the people
using the railway are not paying in eaough
money to cover the deficit. And whethier the
Canadian taxpayer uses the railway or not,
and irrespective of where ho lives, be contributes toward the deficit on its operations.
For some years we bave beard wvhat a:
wonderful job the railways did during the
war. No one would say that they did not do
a wonderful job. But surpiuses were created,
not out of the raiiways themselves or out of
the air, but by reason of the traffic carried

during the war years, whien those who used
the roads paid for the services. To put it
another way, the taxpayers of Canada paid the
buis for carrying our soldiers across this country and bcck many times. So I say that,
provided the~ managemient is efficienît and the
lîandling of the finances is conservative and
economical, il makes no difference w.hether we
have a surplus or a deficit.
If ihis proposition is correct. .and it is
rcogi7ed that the rcilways operate 10 render
a service te the Canadian people, thon rnay I
say a few words about the service in the section of the country froin whicli I (onw ? I
app-retýiatc tha.-t it is not ilways propcr to
argue for one's own constituency. but my
hionouichie fricnd the leadler opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig) refeis so frequcntl 'v Io the citv of
Winnipeg that I feel it is cclv fair that. I
should speak about the retten railway service
we get in the Eastern Townships of Quebec.

In this connertion
mc v I informa tbe Sonate tha t he second
lrgest income-tax-paying province in Canada
is Quebcc; and in that province t1e hargest
income-tax-paying district. out-.ide of the
cities. is the Eastern Townships. Yet here is
tho situation.
When the population of the
cîtv of Sherbrooke was less than 25.000 we
hîad a real train service. We bcd a train
rinning fromn New York te Sherbrooke, and
fromn Sherbrooke lu Quiebee, and rettîrning
from Quebcc to Sherbrooke te New York,
evoerv single day of t1e vear. Some vears
afterwcrds that train xvas discontinued. Then
we, bcd a siceper running fromn New York te
Sherbrooke and frein Sherbrooke te Queob(c
aise a seceper from Boston to Sherbrooke and
froin Shnrbrooke te Quebec. A uitIle later il
xxas dccided te take off one of the 'sleepers.
so the company discontinued tbe New York
sloeper beîween Quebec and Sherbrooke, but
stili ran lthe tivo sleepers fromn Boston and
Ncxxw York into the city of Sberbrooke. A
lit tle later still, thex' decided te take off the
Bo.ýten siceper between Quebec and Sherbrooke and replace it h3y a chair car, wbich

JUNE 25, 1947
was good accommodation.
There remained
the two sicepers from Boston to Sherbrooke
and from New York to Sherbrooke. 'Not long
ai terwards they took off the New York sleeper,
and. somewhat later, the Boston sleper also.
Ail these changes in the service were made
while the population of the city was increasing continually.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON:
the sleepers.

'ou were not using

Hon. Mr. HOWARD: We still use them
when wve can get them. We used ta have a
Ca.nadian
National Railways
train fromn
Montreal to Portland *which ran through
Sherbrooke every night. It Ici t Montreal
late in the evening, and a passenger could
alight at Sherbrooke around one or two
o'clock in the marning; a citizen of Sherbrooke could visit the great metropolis oi
Canada for a game ai baseball or hockey and
get home late at night. That service has been
cntircly discontinued; there is naw no night
train running betwecn Mantreal and Portland through Sherbrooke.
Hon. Mr. EULER:
motor cars?

Why

don't you

use

Hon. Mr. HOWARD: I will reply ta that
in a minute. To relieve the people oi Sherbrooke of the neccssity ai gctting up at three
o'clock in the morning in order to go to
Montreal-ior though, I admit, same western
farmers stili risc at these hours, we in the
Eastern Townships do nat like to do sa-a
Canadian National Railways sleeper was stationed at Sherbraoke, .sa that one could go
ta bcd an the sleeper reasonably carly and
wake up in the city ai Mantreal; then, aiter
spending the wholc day in Montreal, one
cauld return ta, Sherbrooke -the same n'ight.
The Canadian Pacific Railway supplied a similar service, sa that if yau preierrcd ta travel
by that railraad yau could arrive in Mantreal
in the carly marning, transact your work in
the metropolis ai Canada, and get home the
same night.
But the Canadian National
Railways discontinued their sleepers, and
aiterwards the Canadian Pacifie Railway, having no apposition, dccided that there was no
paint in providing a sleeper service hctween
Sherbrooke and Montreal. In a word, while
the population oi the Eastern Townships has
increased very considerably, and ini the heart
ai the Townships has mare than daubled, the
railway service is warse than it has ever been.
Hon. fir. ASELTINE: It
been a paying proposition.

cauld nat have

465

Hon. Mr. HOWARD: 1 want ta go a step
inrther. Do nat forget that a passenger who
leaves Winnipeg or Calgary or Edmonton or
Vancouver ta go ta the Eastern Townships
shauild not he compelled ta spend s day in
the city oi Montreal.
Wc have nothing
against the metropolis oi Canada, but is there
any reason why bath railways should bring
passengers inta the city of Montreal in the
early marning and nat provide a service ta
enable themn ta get aut oi there until thrcc or
four o'clock in the aiternoon? Is there any
sense ta that? It is worsc coming irra the
other direction. Leaving Sherbrooke at 8.15
arn., as my hanourable iriend irom Bedford
(Hon. Mr. Nicol) did with me anly yesterday,
you get inta Mantreal at 11.30. Then there
is a delay until 4.10 in the aiternoan, and yau
finally get inta Ottawa at night. That is nat
so had if vau have business in Mantreal. But
when vou leave on the aiternoon train iromn
Sherbroake yau get into Mantreal at 5.45 and
vou do nat leave there until 8 a'clock which
means that there is a delay ai twa hours and
fifteen minutes, during which time you can
do nothing but sit an a bench in the railway
station. 1 say ta honourable senatars that if
the taxpayers are paying the bis for the
aperatian ai cither aur own railway or for
privately owned railways, they have the right
ta get a lot more service than they arc now
getting.

My honoura-ble fricnd iram Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) has been taunting me about the
change in the roads. It is truc. Railway
traffie has dropped off because ai automobile
traffie and gaod highways. I am nat going ta
say much about the demand for încreased
ircight rates, because that matter is naw
under investigation by the Board oi Transport
Commissioners and is sub judice. Hawever, 1
can tell honaurable senators that as railroad
ireight rates go higher more freight will be
hauled on aur highways, ta be paid for by
the taxpayers ai this country. This morning
a representative ai the Canadian National
Railways toldt us in cammittee that 18-8
per cent ai the total cast ai running the
railways is ior maintenance ai the right
ai way, and that cvery single time ireight
goes off the railways it means double taxation.
The methad ai transportation is changing
rapidly between Sherbrooke and Montreal,
and when ircight gaes by raad the taxpayers
are paying double taxation. There is no way
ai getting araund that.
They are paying
through their provincial taxes ta build the
highways on which the trucks travel, and at
the same time they are paying the deficits on
the raiiways which shauld be handling the
business.

466

SENATE

I want ta place these facts on the record
because I feel very keenly that the Easte.rn
Townships are being terribly discriminated
against. It ivas flot -until last year, alter
a great deal of pressure had been brought
ta bear, that the tima of the two western
trains into Montreal wvas shiortened by two
hours. Someone in the other bouse suggested
that a whole day, or at least ten bours, could
have been taken off these runs. One train
arriveos tw-enty minutes after the train leaves
for Sherbrooke in the mornin.g, and the other
arriveos fertv-fix ýe minutes after the train hias
lcft for Sherbrooke. The result is that
passengers have ta spend the day in Montreal.
I sav that if the taxpayors of thi3 country are
geing ta pay t.he bis for tho railways they
should have the riglbt ta sit in when time
tables are being made and ,:ce ta it that they
get somie kind of decent service.
1 bave probably travelled more by air in
the laýt two y'cars than anv other pcrson in
thi-. bouse, vet 1 ama stili con\ inced that the
ayv: could keep their business if they
rail1wa
wantcd ta do so. But tbey cannot do this
by taking three heurs and twenty minutes ta
travel nifletv-six miles. That sort of thing,
en
is out of dlate; it is long past, tlir time wh1

Mr. Young, the mari who awns the
Alleghany Corporation and the Chesapeake
and Ohio Railway, and who the other day
forced hiniseîf ino the directorate of the
New York Central Raibroad, is an expert in
railwav affairs. Even in these times wben
many persans are of the opinion that railiways
hav e pa-.sed out of the picture of modern
transportation, he is inking up a group of
railways sa that be wibl have a direct transcontinental service hetween New York and
This expert said
Las Angeles, California.
that railways are judged flot by the amount
of their freight per ton miles, but by the
passenger serv ice t.hey give. I agree with
thiat opinion 100 per cent.
The Eastern Townships associated boards o~f
trade, which represent the whole of that
district, recently beld a joint meeting in Sherbrooke, at wbich a resolution of complaint was
passed. I do not propose to read, it, but I
can sce no reason for the discrimination that
we in that section suifer in relation to, railway
service. One must consider-I arn now speaking particularly ta some honourable senators
opposite-that you can leave Park, Aveniue
station in Montreal andi go ta, the eity of
Queber, a distance af 168 miles, in three
hours and t.birty minutes; whereas it takes
three heurs andi twenty minutes ta go from

Sherbrooke ta Montreal, a distance of 96 miles.

Truc. the Canadian National Railways have
this year put on a goadi train, making the trip
in two hours and fifty-five minutes, but beaving
Montreal before the train from the West
arrives. It should be recalled that when. the
city of Sherbrooke hati a population of only
25,000, when the railways operated on an
ordinary ballast undertrack and the steel rails
weighied only sixty, ta seventy poundâ--today
thcy are 120 pounids, andi over half the way
there is rock ballast-we had a train service
ta Mentreal of two heurs and thirty minutes,
as against aur p)rescrit service of two heurs
and fifty-five minutes.
I intend ta speak against this discrimtnatien until we get decent, railway service in the
Eastern Townships of Queber. Soea may say
that it. is strange the railways do not reabize
this inequity. But sometimes one cani he so
close te his job that ha dees net sea what is
geing on, and it takes someone outside ta tell
hina what is wrong. That is why I bave
speken on the motion for third reading of
ibis bill.
Hon. J. J. KINLEY: Hlonourable sanaters,
like my heoneurable friand frona Wellington
(Hon. Mr. Howard) I xwas for some ycars a
miember of the Railway Committ-e in the
House of Conamons. At that time there were
twe commiit tees on railways: ana, a general
cuainittee. and tîje other a special committee
te examine tha accounits andi affairs of the
Canadian National Railways and the Canadian National S'teamships. That committee
now also inquires into the affairs of tha
Canadian air service.
I recaîl that soine years ago a special committee of the Senate conducteci an illuminating investigation into. railways. That committea did a splendid service, but the diffloulty
was tbat it did its work alter the event.
The money had been lest and the railways
were in a muddle. We now learn (bat this
year the Canadian National Railways have a
deficit of more than eight million dollars. It
seems ta me that the tima ta get ativice and
assistance is now, when we are starting on the
If for no, other reason, bet us
down-gratie.
keep oursebves informed hy appointing a
special committee on railways. The mambers
of the Semante, out of their long experience and
service ta the country, coubti off er mugch in
the way of ativice and experience.
I cannat entireby agree with the philosophy
of my frienti fromn Wellington (Hon. Mr.
Hloward), that hecause the people pay the
bills wve should encourage the raibways ta be
extravagant.

Hon. Mr. HOWARD: I diti not say that.

JTUNE 25, 1947
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I put more emphasie
on management and efficiency. It must be
remembered that my friend's town is only
about ninety miles from Montreal. Down ini
my country few travel that distance hy railway in the summer; they ail go by motor car.
People corne to the Board of Trade and
inquire why the railway does nlot put on a
certain train service; yet they have flot
travellcd on a train for years. They expect
the railway to provide a service that they
will not use.
It is rny impression that on short hauls the
railways are outmoded; they must make some
radical improvements if they want to get the
short-haul trade. 0f course Canada must have
railways, because of the great distances to be
travclled and for service in the wintertime;
they are very important and must be maintained.
In Canada there are two railway systcms;
the Canadian National Railways, which is
publicly owned, and the Canadian Paciflo Railway, which is privately owned.* It might be
that a special committce of the Senate could
define private and public ownership, and point
out the difference betwcen the two systems.
This would have a salutary effect on those
people wbo think, the government should run
aIl the businesses in the country. These are
things that should be attended to by the
Senate of Canada. We in this chamber are
flot tee busy, for we do not bave as much
discussion as the other house does; we handie
the legisiation, but we do a lot of our work
in committees. It seerns to me that for next
session we should plan a special committee of
this house to go into the affairs of the railways, and that the committee should hold
meetings from the start of the session to the
end. Our efforts would at least have an effect
on the activîties of the officiais who rua the
railways, and that would be a good thing.
Whenever such a business is looked into by
people with experience, services improve and
the railways do better.
Honourable senators may flot know that
this year a deficit of one million dollars is
shown on the dining car services alone; that is
for the feeding of the patrons only, exclusive
of the hauling and equipping of the cars. At
the samne time meals are being served in railway restaurants all across Canada; and no
profit is made. We could also, compare the
services of the two railways in Canada. It
seems to me that a committee should be
appointed, and the-intelligence of this chamber
should be focused on the operations of the
railways in this changing period.

of Bill 336, an Act to establish the Canadian
Maritime Commission.
- He said: The honourable senator from
Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson) bas kindly
consented to explain the bill.
Hon. NORMAN McL. PATERSON: Honourable senators, before going into details of
Bill 336, an Act to establish the Canadian
Maritime Commission, it is pertinent to, note,
in view of the war losses, that there are some
five million tons of shipping afloat in excess
of the 1939 total; but. had no war taken
place, this excess would bave been considerably greater, wbilst otber factors nullify
further comparison.
0f the 70 million tons afloat today, 41 million, or 54 per cent, is owned by the United
States of America, wbicb in pre-war days
possessed some 12 million tons or 18 per cent.
Germany, whicb then boasted about 4ý million
tons, is apparently to be left witb 200,000 tons
of mainly coasting craft, whilst Japan, wbicb
bad worked up bier marine to kj million tons,
may be expected to be dealt with somewhat
similarly. Italy, with 3ý million tons in 1939,
will apparently get away with less drastie
treatment. Whilst these are the main changes
there are minor ones worth probing and wbicb
should not be ignored. It is not possible at
this time to do more than refer to changes
in type and effect wbicb are of import; but
in passing, reference must be made to tankers,
in view of their increasing nationalistic importance. An estimate of tbe equivalent tanker
tonnage afloat today is some 49 per cent
beyond t.hat of 1939, and of this tonnage tihe
United Kingdom owns 43 per cent less than
in that year and Norway 53 per cent less,
wbilst the United States of America bas an
increase of 215 per cent, and Sweden 94 per
cent.

SENATE

The hunge figure of American floating tonnage should flot be cause for undue pessimism
for, of the 41 million tons, big blocks are
war emergency products and unsuitable for
competitive trading under normal service conditions. Indeed, authoritative statements in
the United States indicate a final American
marine of 16 million tons, with the sale and
tying up or scrapping of the balance. Even
with this tonnage, high first cost, high wages
and subsistence, the absence of popularity
of shipping subsidies and, despite wartime
propaganda, the lack of national sea-mindcdness in normal times, history will probably
repeat itsclf and the United States eventually
wiIl resume its prcvious relative position.
I would like to, caîl honourable senators'
attention to the position which Canada occupies in the merchant shipping of the world.
We are, aceording to an estimate bascd on a
survey made in 1946 by the United Maritime
Consultative Council, in fourth position, only
exceeded in occan tonnage by the United
States with 41 million tons; the United Kingdom withi 13ý million tons, and Norway, withi
21 million tons; Canada heing in fourth position, with 406 ships aggrcgating
4~ million
tons. Therefore, whiethcr we like it or not,
we are in the merchant shipping buisiness in a
big way. Not only that. but we have sex'enteen large shipyards rapidly building more tonnage for both Canadian and foreign interests
and for this reason it is necessar 'v to co-ordinate the supervision and regulation of these
interesfs under one authority.
At the commencement of the second world
war in 1939, Canada had thirty-five regular
ocean-going sbips of ovci 1.600 tons on its
registcr, totalling in all 241.880 gross tons. 0f
these, twenty-two were owned by either the
Canadian National Sfeamsbips or by the
Imperial Oil Company. By the faîl of 1940
the building of merchant ships had become a
matter of highest priority for the allied cause
and the Ujnited Kingdom called upon Canada
to build ships. As a resulf, Wartime Merchant Shipping, a Crown eompany, was
esfablishcd in April of 1941. The first bateh
of ships programmcd by this company consisted. of ninety vessels of the North Sands
type, of 10.000 tons deadweight. It was later
arranged that these should be sold at cost
price to the Ut nited States, which would in
turn 'lcase-lend" them to Britain.
As a
resulf of -this, the British govemnment bought
onlv two complefed ships of the twenty-six
which they had ordered hefore the "leaselend" arrangement was made.
In 1942, as soon as construction was wcll
under way, the government decidcd that a
proportion of the ships being built in Canada

should be retaincd for Canadian operations.
Accordingly, Park Steamship Company was
formed in Mareh, 1942, to take over the ships
allocated for Canadian operation on the governmnent's behaîf. It was decided that the
ships should not be operated directly by the
government agency, but should be allocated
to varions private shipping organizatiens in
the counfry who would manage and operate
them on a fee basis. By thîs means prix ate
operaf ors wcrc given additional experience in
the management of ships, whilst the profits
earncd ýby the vessels wcre turned back
through the Park company t0 the treasury to
offset the cost of their building. In aIl. Park
Steamship Company lias bcen directly responsible for 176 ships.
Bv thie time the ninety ships for "leaselend" hiac been delivered to the United States,
arrangements had been completed for the proportion of slips not required by Park Steamships to be "mutual aided" to Britain direct
by Canada on a nominal charter bite basis.
In addition f0 the 90 ships bouglit bY the
United States, a total of 98 "Fort" ships were
turned ox er to Britain under mutual aid from
Canjada.
These were placcd on the British
registry but Canada retaincd title to tlîcm.
In Octobt'r, 1943, the government appointed
a special commitfee to investigate anti advise
upon future Canadian merchant s7hipping
policy. '1wo important recommendafions of
this committee were that merchant ships
should bic operafed in peace time by prix ate
enterprise; and that all government maehinery
dealing with merchant shipping should le, coordinateil. The first of these recommendations
lias alread 'v been fully implemented.
This
bill secks to prox ide for the second.
If voit will turn fci page 3 of the bill. you
will find in section 6, which 'is the pitb of
the whole bill, thatThe commission shaîl consider and rccommend
to the minister from time to fime such policies
and measures as it considers necessýary for the
operation, maintenance, manning and development of a merchant marine and a shipbuilding
and ship repairing industry commensurate wifh
Canadiani maritime nieeds.
Immediately the war was over, the government set about the dýisposal to private interests
of ifs Park fleet together with the diesel
ships and China coasters under construction.
If was provided fIat as far as possible these
ships should býe sold to Canadian companies
for operation under the Canadian flag. There
were, however, a certain number of ships
whieh. for varions reasons, were flot considered likely t o cf use to Canada in peace
time, and these were offered for sale in the
open market. The remaining governmentowned merchant ships were offered
to

JUNE 25, 1947
Canadian companies on the basis of a special
sales formula. Particulars of this formula are
given in the House of Commons Hansard of
November 20, 1945, and of June 16, 1947.
The response of private enterprise to the
sales formula offer was most satisfactory, so
that with the exception of three 4,700-ton ships
which are on long term charter and seven
10,000-ton ships under sales agreement to be
delivered to their prospective purchasers upon
the termination of their present charters, the
Canadian-operated government-owned fleet has
now been disposed of. This means that six
small tankers, one hundred and four 10,000ton vessels and nineteen 4,700-ton vessels are
now in the hands of private operators comcompanies
different
prising thirty-three
registered in Canada.
Eighty 10,000-ton ships presently under bare
boat charter to the United Kingdom remain
to be eventually disposed of. A total of 98
of these ships were "mutual aided" to Britain
and, since "mutual aid" ceased, have been
operated by the Ministry of Transport. In
the meantime the British have bought ten of
the ships outright, and seven of the original
98 became casualties. One damaged ship
among these 98 was sold by Park Steamships
as agents for War Assets to foreign interests.
The remaining 80 will be returned to Canada
for disposal as their charters expire. All are
to be returned before the end of 1950.
During the war, Wartime Shipbuilding
Limited built a total of 446 ships, comprising
forty-two naval auxiliaries, forty-three 4,700ton dry cargo ships, three hundred and four
10,000-ton dry cargo ships, thirteen 10,000-ton
tankers, six lake tankers, thirty-five China
coasters and three diesel-driven 7,500-ton dry
cargo ships.
Tabular accounts of expenditures on purely
merchant shipbuilding during the war, together with the amounts accruing from the
operation and sale of the ships, are listed in
the House of Commons Hansard of June 16,
1947. The Minister of Reconstruction and
Supply bas pointed out that of the Park fleet
74 per cent of the original cost of its construction should be recovered. Of the non-Park
ships, 61 per cent should be recovered. In
this case, account must be taken of the fact
that, up till the first of September, 1945, these
vessels were on mutual aid to Britain and
earned no revenue or hire. Moreover, this
group includes the three diesel-driven ships
and the thirty-five China coasters, which were
disposed of for other than war purposes as
soon as they were completed at prices which
were, of necessity, considerably below their

471

construction costs. In all, a total of 626-9
million dollars was spent on the construction
of these fleets for war purposes. We should
finally recover approximately 418-9 million
dollars, or 67 per cent of our expenditures,
leaving an estimated net loss of 208 million
dollars. Of this loss, 7-3 million dollars or
3-5 per cent is due to casualties.
Time at my disposal does not permit me to
make more than a passing reference to shipping on the Great Lakes, but to give honourable senators some idea of the vast amount
of tonnage carried on the lakes I would like
to place on record the following statistics,
which were prepared by the Department of
Trade and Commerce.
During the season of 1946, traffic through
both the Canadian and American canals at
Sault Ste. Marie amounted to 91,586,895 tons,
of which 11,765,234 tons were carried by Canadian ships and 79,821,661 tons were carried by
United States ships. The•amount of Canadian
freight through both canals in 1946 was 9,270,454 tons, and, United States freight totalled
82,316,441 tons: that is, 82 million tons through
the American Sault and 9 million tons through
the Canadian Sault.
In 1938 the tonnage through the St. Lawrence
river waterway was 9,236,318, but owing to the
canal-sized ships having been withdrawn for
war purposes and not replaced, the tonnage
for 1946 is down to 5,750,478-pretty nearly
one-half. This is no reflection on the requirements of the canal, but the railways have taken
up the slack by handling the grain from
Georgian Bay to Montreal.
According to figures prepared by the Department of Transport, Canadian merchant ships
over 500 gross tons as of June 24, 1947, consisted of 174 ocean going vessels of 1,026,978
gross tons, 83 home-trade ships of 134,376
gross tons, 232 Great Lakes and St. Lawrence
River ships of 609,926 gross tons, a total of
489 ships of 1,771,280 tons.
The bill seeks to set up an authoritative
body to advise the government on shipping
and shipbuilding matters and to administer
certain matters relating to those industries. All
matters covered by the bill are functions being
performed by government agencies at the
present time. The purpose of the bill is to
correlate those agencies and gradually to bring
them under a single directing force.
The proposed commission is to consist of
three full-time officials who, as a body corporate, will be responsible to and subject to
the direction of the Minister of Transport. The
commission will be staffed by the Civil Service
Commission in the usual manner. There is

472

SENATE

prov ision that with the approvai of the
Governor in Counicil the commission may
employ professional and technical advisers and
assistants for temporary and for specific work.
Obviously, occasion may arise when it will be
neccssary to empioy people with special knowledge to perform special duties for temporary
period;s.
The function of the commission in -its
advisory capacity is to consider and recommend ýto the minister such policies and
measures as it considers necessary for the
opera-tion, maintenance, manning and devoiopment, of a merchant marine and a shipbuiiding
and ship repairing industry, commensurate
with our maritime needs. In order to fulfil
this function, the commission wiii have t-o
ascertain and record a number of matters concerning our own industries and those of other
nations.
On its administrative side, àt -is
intended that it shall act on bebalf of the
minister in denling wvith certain respon.sibiiities
which are vested in him bv the Canada Sbipping Act, 1934. It wiii also absorb -the duties
now performed by the steamsbip subsidies
section of the Department of Trade and Comnmerce. It wiil be available to absorb other
suitable administrative duties which may bo
aiiotted to it from time to time.
The expenses of the commission xviii be paid
from appropria.ions duiy authorized iwy parliament. a.nd the commission wili render an
anntial report of its activities to parliamoent
tbrough the Minister of Transport.
Ail the policies of the commission wiil
rectit re to ho apl)roved by parliament. because
the oniv funds which. xiii ho avaiial)le to thie
romiiion to carry out its policies xvili ho
those ftînds voted ho parlianient from time
to time.
In dr-afting the bill, it las been endeavoured
to prox ide in the commission a ready and
accessible point of contact hetween the government and ail sections of the shipping and
.shipbiiilding industries. Speciai rfeerence îs
ma(l, to the setting up of adxisory committees 1 v the commission, xvbicb xviii enable it to
obtain ail the points of viexv of the parties
,concerned iii any particular matter. It is the
viexv tbar a standing advisory commnittee consistinig of roprescotatives of ship operators,
shiphuiilders. and seafaring personnel should
ho set up as soon as possible. xvbich wili
prox fi a forum for discussion on a number of
matters concerning the efficiency and deveiopment of the industry. There is also need
toda 'v for a weii-informod government agency
to represent the nation's view in various
international shipping matters whicb from
time to time are called int discussion bv the
United 'Na-tions and reiated organizations. In

short, the government is of the opinion that
the setting up nf an organization directiy concerned with the Canadian shipping and shipbuild-ing problems is now desirabie. One of
its functions wili ho to assume responsibiiity
for any continuing governmon-t-owned merchant ships noxv being operated through the
agency of Park Steamship Company, Limited.
The bill does not represent any change in
the policy which xvns previousiy adopted, but
provides only what the government believes
and bopes wiil be a more up-to-date medium
for carrying out that policy.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD:
May I ask the
W/bat are
honourable senator a question?
the governmont agencies that are going to
ho emerged into that commission?
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: I have not got
the complote particulars here, but I hope
that the bill wili go to a commîttee wbere
my bonourable friend (lIon. Mr. Moraud)
There are sevoral
may ask tbat question.
matters on which I want to got information,
and probabiy this is one of tbcm.
Hon. J. J. KINLEY: Honourable senators,
lot me first of ail congratuhate the honourable
senator frumn Thîunder Bay
(Hon. Mr.
Paterson) upon the valtiable information he
lias given te the bouse. Being a captain of
industry and a man wbo bas used bis talents
for t lec promotion of trade and commerce,
mostiy on the Great Lakes of this country,
lie is acqîiainted with the conditions surroiînding the merchant service and is woll
qualificd to speak on the sublect.
W/e are reminded boxv great a maritime
country Canada is wlîen xvc consîder the
traffloc on the Great Lakes and the ot.her parts
of Canada tbat are accessible to the son.
Thîis bill is an nct to estabiish a Canadian
Maritime Commission. At a casual glance
it migbit ho thoiîgbt that it is for the purpose
of doing somet.bing for the maritime people
of Canada. Howvecr, that is not the case.
It is a Canadian maritime bill, supposed to
ho for national ser~vie and for the benefit
cf ail the people of the country.
This bill bias a countorpart in a biii whicb
was introduced and passed -in the United
States in 1936 and xvhich inrgeiy serves the
same purpose.
lowever, our biii bias no
preamble it is just a statoînent cf law that
is to ho enacted-whereas tbe American bill
had a proambie sotting out the reasons and
the need for such legisiation in the Umnited
States of Amorîca.
May I ho permitted to rend from the proamble of the American bill:
It is necessary for the national defence and
development cf les foreign and domestie commerce that the United -States shall have a mer-

JUNE 25, 1947
chant marine (a) sufficient to carry its domestie
water-borne commerce and a substantial portion
of the water-borne export and import fori g n
commerce of the United States and to provi de
shipping service on all routes essential for maintaining the flow of such domestie and foreign
water borne commerce. at all times, (b) capable
of serving as a naval and military auxiliary in
time of war or national emergency, (c) owned
and operated under the United States flag by
citizens of the United States in so far as may
be practicable, and (d) composed of the best
equipped, safest, and most suitable types of
vessels, constructed in the United States and
manned with a trained and efficient citizen personnel. It is hereby declared ta be the policy
of the United States to foster the development
and encourage the maintenance of such a merchant marine.
Our bill is more general. It creates a technical board! which will advise the government
on matters of merchant service. As my bonourable friend from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr.
Paterson) has said, the substance of the bill
is to be found in paragraphs 6 and 7:
6. The commission shall consider and recommend to the minister from time ta time such
policies and measures as it considers necessary
for the operation, maintenance, manning and
development of a merchant marine and a shipbuilding and shiprepairing industry commensurate with Canadian maritime needs.
7. The commission may examine into, ascertain and keep records of,
(a) the shipping services between Canadian
ports and from ports in Canada to ports outside
Canada that are required for the proper maintenance and furtherance of the domestie and
external trade of Canada:
(b) the type, size. speed and other requirements of the vessels that are and in the opinion
of the commission should be employed in such
services;
(c) the facilities in Canada for the construction, repair and reconditioning of vessels;
(d) the cost of the construction, repair and reconditioning of vessels in Canada and in other
countries;
(e) the cost of marine insurance. maintenance,
repairs, wages and subsistence of officers and
crews and all other items of expense in the
operation of vessels under Canadian registry
and the comparison thereof with similar vessels
operated under other registry;
The concluding paragraph, which seems to
be all embracing, is as follows:
(f) such other matters as the minister may
request or as the commission may deem necessary for carrying out any of the provisions or
purposes of this act.
That is a very general direction ta give ta
a commission. There is very little direction,
by comparison with the American legislation.
Maybe it was thought advisable ta frame the
bill in this general way so that the commission, as it goes along, can feel its way, as it
were, and perform the services which it considers are most vital

473

I feel that this bill is one that is greatly
needed in Canada, and that it at least shows
a continuance of a necessity that had a revival
during the war. The need caused by the war
provided the great test. It brought out the
truth; it showed that Canada requires a merchant marine, and that we should sustain and
expand our merchant marine se as ta look
after the services of the country adequately.
In other years Canada was not marineconscious. The fact that that is not se today
is evidenced by this bill. I think honourable
senators have evidence of that fact every day
when they look at the tower of this building
and see the red ensign, the flag of the British
merchant marine, with the Canadian coat of
arms, which makes it the flag of the Canadian
merchant marine also. Every day that parliament is in session it flies from the flag staff
on the Peace Tower and continually rerpinds
us that our interests extend beyond our
shores-to our men and ships upon the sea.
Nay, more: one will sec on the entrance ta
this building the -inscription: "The wholeseme sea is at ber gates-her gates both East
and West". There is a challenge te the people
of Canada ta take every advantage of the
opportunities for export trade and do business
on the great waters.
Canada's foreign trade, in comparison with
ber small population, is very extensive, and
the general prosperity of the country is dependent upon it. Because of our surpluses and
our foreign trade, the prices of commodities
in this country are largely fixed by prices on
the world markets. One of the greatest factors in foreign trading is the services required
te carry the goods ta other nations across the
sea. For a thriving foreign trade we need an
efficient merchant marine.
Honourable senators will pardon me if I
refer te the province from which I come,
because the subject of this bill is a matter of
great interest to the people who live by the
sea. I should like te recall a little history of
Nova Scotia. Many of you have read the
Sirois report's appraisement of what was known
as "the Golden Age of Nova Scotia", and in
fact of all of the Maritimes. It was referred
te as the age of wind, wood and water, because
our sailing ships, which were made of wood,
sailed the high seas carrying goods te many
lands. This was a perfect economy, as we
had the wood and tradesmen in Nova Scotia ta
build the ships and the sailors ta man them.
These ships sailed ta other lands, taking our
products there and returning with cargoes
which brought great riches ta the province.
We had banks, accounting houses and all the
other secondary services that go with the
marine trade. It was then the golden age of

474

SENATE

Nova Scotia, which had a perfect economy
because of the activities of our people down
by the sea.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Wooden ships and iron
men.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Yes, those were the
days of wooden ships and iron men.
May I say a few words as to wby Nova
Scotia did flot retain that perfectly balanced
economy? At that time the Maritime provinces were prosperous because the Nova Scotia
sailing ships wcre the fastest transport upon
the ocean. We bujît the ships, and no one
except perbaps the New England states could
compete witb us in fast sailing craft. This
accomplishment made us one of the biggest
sbipping countries in the world before Confederation.
Then came the iron sbips, a
prodict of England's industrial era which
started with Qucen Elizabeth and was built
up by mechanization and the use of iron, steel
Great Britain and some of the
and ceai.
Furopean powers went out in the forefront,
and the shipping facilities of Nova Scotia could
not follow. We loat our predominance on the
seas. tSome pcople in my province even blame
oui decline on Confederation; they say it
ruined Nova Scotia. Honourable senators, I
thinlc Nova Seotia was in the doldrums before
Confederation. and lier people were looking for
sometbing botter when they aceepted the terms
of Confederation. May I remind my honourable friends that Nova Scotia's great statesman Joseph Howe at first violently opposed
Confederation. but in the final analysis came
to Ottawva and wvas a strong exponient of the
entrv of bis province into Confederation
under liciter terms. I ain glad to hear that
the pi-esont premier of Nova Scotia, like lus
illudsrious predecessors, bas been succcssful in
conîing te ferma on matters
involving
dominion-provincial relations. That will, I
believe, bc good foir the province.
The change that I m'entioned was the first
reason w' Nova Scotia lost bier pre-eminence.
We bave been trying since that time to do
soînething about ou, ictivities on the sea,
because if flie Maritimes arc going to bold
tbeir own witb the people of Canada tbey
mus dIo it hi' thieir marine activities. In
Ontario you bave bigger farms and more
extensive factories, but we are at tide water,
living, h' the sea. and ocr hope for the future
is again upen the seat.
I believe tbat the institution of tbe Canadian National steamsbip lines w-as a stop forw'ard in the merebant marine activities in
Nova Scotia. Truc, the iron shipa came into
confiet with the passing sailing vesse] and
for a time it was the cause of some difficulty;

but, tbrough the vision of Sir Henry Thornton
we secured steamships whicb were the nucleus
of our mercantile marine. May I digress at
this point te say that the vision of Sir Hcnry
Tbornton is apparent in this country? The
large hotels from Halifax f0 Vancouver, which
when built were thought to be extravagant
and providing accommodation lieyond our
needs, were found to be vcry useful in the
crowded days of the war; and tbey are serving us well today.
The Canadian steamships are managed by
the Canadian National Railways tbrough an
interlocking directorate. I do not agrce with
tbat method of supervision. The railway officials are net marine-minded men; tbey are
raîlway men, and in this big country thcy are
conccrned mostly with carrying on the business of the railroads. This is true te such an
extent that in tbe 30's, wben Canada was
paasing through a depression and the Canadian National Railway was in a bad way,
they began to scîl the steamsbips at a low
price. Sister ships of steamsbips sold at tbat
f ime are still opcrating. Upon recent mnquîry
I learned that we could get today in excess
of five times the amount that the sbips were
then sold for. And do net forget that tbose
-lîips were sold aftcr thicy had donc the missîonary woîk. after fhey bad developed trade
wvith Australia and other ceunfries of tbe
world and were comîng out et the red.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Tbev were already eut
of the red.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: 1 attribufe the poor
advice te the directors cf the Canadian
National Railw'ay. It seems te me tbat the
proposed Canadian Maritime Commission
coiîld very well take over tbe management of
flie Canadian National Steainsbips, and let the
Canadian National Railway officiaIs look
afteî' the railways.
Honeurable senafors. I emphasize that
while the Canadian National Railwa v biad a
deficit cf S8,960,000 last year, the Canadian
National Steamships. in spife of the number
of ships that w'ere f aken for w-ar purposes.
many of wbicb were evcntually sunk by
enemy action. showed a profit of $1.802,000.
1 fbink that is a splendid showing.
There is a second reason wby Nova Scetia,
and indccc Canada, lest pre-erninence in the
sbipping w'orld. It was world-wide cempetition,
Firstly, there was the
unfair cempetition.
Canada Shipping Act. That act was designed
te make a, standard, in Canad'a and the empire,
equal te. that of I3ritain in respect of efficiency
in running sbips and the selection of officers.
In my part cf the country we had men who

JUNE 25, 1947
went ini ships ail their lives, who got their)

experience in the f o'c'sles; and yau caxi learu
many
things about seamanxship
in the
fa'c'sles, but when it cornes ta, the science of

navigation yau have ta get out of the fo'c'sle
into, the cabin; and there is not much connectian between the cabini and the fo'c'sle in a
sailing ship. As a resuit our men were men of

experience who had little school training; and
whexi the Canada Shipping Act was put into

force these men faund themselves on the
beach, and in ard-er to put the boats ta sea
we had ta bring in meni from other places
with certificates.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Anid they were seasick
when they gat there.
Han. Mr. KINLEY: Conditions becamne s0
bad, hanaurable senatars, that at ane time I
had ta appeal ta the department here, and
special ixispectars were sent d-own, who passed
a number af aur experienced meni who underwent certain essexitial. tests. English certificates were preferredi even in Canada ta the
certificates of Canadian seamen. It seems ta
me that, when aur couxitry uxidertook ta make
a change in the law which nlecessitated, mare
educatian, it shauld have provided institutions
where aur peaple cauld get the necessary
educatian.
The farmers have agriculturai
calleges in evcry province ini Canada. What
have the seamen to educate them. and fit
them ta take cammand of ships ini the Merchant Marine? We had anc schaal during the
war'which did good wark, but it was closed up;
and alang my share ini Nova Scatia there is no
place where a seamaxi can go to be educated,
under the supervision af the state. for the
purpase of heing an afficer in the Merchant
Marine.
I wish now ta turn ta samething which is, I
think. a littie more important: it is what is
known as the Merchant Shipping Agreemexit.
Far many years Canadiaxi ministers of marine
made jaurilcys ta Britaixi with a view Ia getting better contrai af the coastal merchaxit
shippixig af Canada; and whexi the Statute
of Westminster was passed, coneurrently the
Merchant Shipping Agreement was adopted.
The Statute af Westminster was aur constitutional emancipatioxi, but mother is a gaod
trader, and the day before that statute was
passed the Merchant Shipping Agreement was

signed and put into effect; and that is the
law which goverxis the coastal trade of aur
country at the presexit time.
Part IV of the agreemenit deals with "Equal
Treatment". Let me read it to yau:
Each part af the British commonwealth agrees
ta grant access ta its parts ta, aIl ships registered
in the British commonwealth on equal terms and

undertakes that no Iaws or regulations relating

475

to seagoing ships at any time in force in that
part shall apply moire favourably to ships registered in that part, or to the ships of any foreign
country, th-an they apply to any ship registered
in any other part of the commonwealth.
While each of the British commonwealth may
regulate its own coasting -trade, it is agreed
that any laws or regulations f rom time to time
in force for that purpose shall treat ail ahips
registered in the British commonwealth in exactly the same manner as ships registered in
that part, and neot less favourably.in any respect
than ships of any foreign country.
That ineant, hanourable senators, that
British ships had the same privileges as
Canadian ships in the Canada coasting trade.
We were a young country, trying to build up
a coastal trade; Britain was the foremost
mercantile marine country of the world.
1 wîhl go a littie further in this cannection,
and read to you, under Part X-the General
part-article 27:
This agreement ghall apply to ail territories
administered under the -authority of the government of any part of the commonwealth and ta
ships registered there, or in any foreign port of
registry, and fulfilling the requirements as to
ownership set out in article 2 (1).
This means that in effeet the coastal trade
of Canada was practically open to the world.
We faund that European bottoms were carrying on the coastal trade of Canada; they were
carrying coal from Sydney up ta Mantreal,
In
and our own meni were standing by.
contrast to that condition, the Unîited States
protect their own natianals. United States
law requires that the great percentage of the
crews and the officers shall be American
citizens; and they will not allow aur ships
ta caast in the United States. For instance,

a Canadian ship cannot carry cargo from.
Boston to New York. lI the days when
Cuba belonged ta Spaini, our people made a
great deal of money by taking fish ta the
West Indies and bringing back sugar ta the
United States. But immediately Cuba came
under the dominance of the United States
we were prevented, because of the American
coastal laws, from, brixiging cargaes froma
Cuba to the United States. It scems to me
that Canada has had fia appartunity to
become a great country with regard to merchant service whexi she was against such
campetîtion as th-at af Norway, Great Britain,
and ather couxitries with lower standards of
living.
But, honourable members, it is useless ta
talk very much about this.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I want ta make a suggestion. On January. 18, 1932, we signed, a
treaty with the United States with respect ta
the St. Lawrence waterways; and. Canada wilI

476

SENATE

be in close association with the United States
in thte trade from the Great Lakes overseas.
A great deai of this trade is ceasting trade, and
it seeîns to me that, in the co-ordinating of
that agreement, we should. have a degree of
reciprocity in the coastal trade with the United
States-the oniy country with bigher standards
than our own-on coastal shipping-. It soems
10 me that an agreement of this kind, with the
United States wouid go very weli with the St.
Lawrence waterxvays treaty; because bew can
we deai together along the St. Lawrence river
and the Great Laites if we do flot have reciprocity in coastai trade? Then do:wn in Nova
Scotia, hiaif-way between the American Gulf
ports and Fort William, whiere our country
sticks out in the Atlantic, and especiaily on
the route whichi slips take for the coastal service of this country, it weuid be the greatest
boon ro Nova Scotians that, one can imagine
if wc could have a reciprocal agreemcnt on the
eo'tsting trade withi the United States. Canadian men, Nova Scotia men, eould share with
Americans, and Canadian bottoms could share
xii United States bottoms in the coastal trade
of the continent.

INCOME WAR TAX BILL
REPORT 0F COMMITTEE
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN presented the

Tax Act.

now heg leave to report the saine with tbree
minor amendments:

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shaîl the
amendments be taken into conside-ration?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: With the consent of
the Senate, I move that these amendments
be now concurred in.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I wish to prote.st against one clause, on the
ground that saine consideration should be given
ta waiver. Assume that a company is in
financial difficulties. It has issues of, bonds,
preferred stock and common stock. The holders
of the bonds and of the prefe.rred stock waive
their rights to interest, and an adjustment is
made. I have in mind the case of a company
in Manitoba about which I knew a good deal
eigbt years ago. The bondholders devaluated
their bonds ta eighty per cent and cut the rate
of interest from 5.J to 3J or 3 per cent, and
agreed not to take proceedings to foreclose
the property. Holders of the preferred stock
threw off so mucli of their stock; the
common stockholders followed the saine course,
and they made somne further stock concessions
to the bondholders. Under the terms of the
measure now before us, the bondholders will
be taxed on the value of any common stock
which they receive from the stockholders.
The honourable senator from Toronto-I do
not know whether I should caîl him the senior
or the junior senator, because it has not been
decided just who is the senior and who is the
junior senator from Toronto; so to avoid misunderstanding I shaîl have to caîl him by
name-Senator Campbell tried to get an
amendment to make it clear beyond doubt
that the section lîmited taxation to consideration paid by the company iteîf. I can under-

stand that, when a company itself issues something to pay arrears of interest, the value of
the thing it issues should be taxed. That is
fair. But I do flot for the life of me see why
a tax shouid be put on a bondholder who gets
a consideration from one of the common stockholders. The tax might flot amount to much,
but there is the dificulty of determining the
value of the consideration. I say candidly
that I have great confidence in the new
Deputy Minister of Taxation. I have known
him for many years, and I do not believe
there would be any unfairness in the administration of this measure. However, I do flot
think we should pass legisiation which makes
it possible to tax people on something that
the company has no interest in at ail. I arn
not going to go any further but I wish to
protest against that provision.
Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL: Honourable
senators, I should like to support what the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
has said. We have ail experienced the difficulty of reorganizing corporations which have
been forced to default on their securities during bad times. It seems to me that it is somnetimes in the interest of security holders and
the community generally to have the senior
sedurity holder permit his security to remain
in default and the interest to accumulate, so
that when times return ta *normal the coinpany can reorganize and an adjustment can
be made between the various security holders
whereby the heavy accumulated arrears of
interest on the senior security are wiped out
in consideration of the junior security holders
turning over somne of their stock or securities,
which may or may not be of value. I submit
that under the proposed legislation it would
be practically impossible for senior security
holders to grant these concessions, because
although they might be perfectly willing to
release accumulated dividends and accept stock
which might not have any value for saime years
to corne, if they accepted that stock they
would be taxed-they would have to pay taxes,
in cash, upon a security which they got from
junior security holders, not from the company
itself. If this measure is passed we shaîl
probably learn from experience that it imposes
great hardship on junior security hoiders.
There is another matter wbich I think
should be mentîoned. The hoider of a bond
of $1,000, on which there is possibly M50
arrears of interest, may be willing to accept
a new security for $1,000. In other words, hie
may be willing to release his interest and
accept a security for the principal only, thus
giving the company a chance to rehabilitate
itself. Under this legisîntion hie would be
taxed on one-third of the amount of the

478

SE~ qATE

socurity that hoe received. In otber werds, he
w'euld bave te pay taxes in casb on a propor-

tien ef interest tbat was ewing at tbe timo
hoe accepted bis now security. I submit that
that also would bring about hardship, because

it would be much botter for people te hold
their securities and te realize what they can
frens fereclosure proceedings.

In cemmittoe I suggested that wbat wvas
really intended by this legislation wvas that a
person receiving somnetbing from a company

by way ef an obligation or a promise te pay,
sbould bo taxed on tbe value of wbat ho

roceived; but that when ho received soetbing from a compremise with tbe others who

were interested in the company, andi net from
the company itself, it sbould net be taxed.
The honourable the
wa spuken to about

the matter, and lie

apparently felt tfiat .the bill sbould stand as
proposod, bis view being that the person whe
received a security or promise te psy, ne
matter from whom, for any arrears ewing,
shoulti he taxed on the value of the sedurity
or promise at the time hie received it.
I feel tbat the measure is tee drastie and

flot in the best interests of the complicated
oconrnic structure of corporatiens in tbis
ceuntry; andi I tbink that if it is passed it
will require te ho amended in future.

Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN:

Honourable

senators, I amn net prepareti te go as far
as tbe twe proviens speakers in claiming
that the amentiment proposed is drastie andi
would werk mucb hardsbip, thougli I arn
net te ho taken as being ontiroly in agreement with it. The doors througb wbicb one
miay pa.ss inte some sligbt measure of tax
freedem er exemption in corperate financing
are rapidly being reduced in number. Tbis
bas te do with a door tbat permitted some
scope in the reorganization of companios,
largo anti small, which tbrough. peor eperatiens
had defaulted en the paymont of interest on
bonds and of divitientis on shares.

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT:

Wbat about over-

are going to increase in value hie would be
better off if their value were fixed at the
time hie receiv cd them and hie paid tax on
the value instead of on the appreciated value
of a later date.
It lias been said that the amendment will
interefere with reorganizations. It will interfere enly with a reorganization where bondbolders-senier security holders-feel that the
only way of dealing with the whele enterprise
is to put it tbrough the wringer and take out
a lot of the water that ivas put into the
original financing. If a bondhelder feels the
enterprise bas a chance te operate, and forgees
bis interest and gets seme cempensatien frem
the cemmen sharehelders rather than frem
the cempany, thon te the extent that the
cempensatien is in cemmen shares be must
pay income tax on the value of it at the
mement ho receives it.
i,
that
Hon.
Mr.
CRERAR:
Hew
determined?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: In the first instance
it will be a matter of establisbing te the
satisfaction of the income tax department
wbat the value is. If the cemmen sbarcs
are listed tbe value can easily be ascertaiued,
because publie trading will set a value; if
they are net listod the value will have te be
settled by argument pro and con. If a taxpayer is net sati-.-fied witb the valuation made
by the department hoe can appcal te the court.
The objection I had to the section was an
overaîl objection, that it was closing a door
which possibly provided an encouragement te
company reorganization. But from tbe point
of view of taxing and, the principle behind it,
it is difflenît te justify tbe receipt of sometbing of value for giving up a rigbt te interest,
andi net regarding that sornet.hing of value as
being of the nature of inceme. Therefore
there is some element to bo taxed, although the
quantum is a problem to ho determined.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: What if yen surrendered part of your capital?

of it at the timo receiveti. The bendbolder

Hon. Mr. IIAYDEN: Well, 1 assume that
you would do it only because you considered
tbat the circumstances justified it. But this
section deoes net deal with capital at aIl.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: But yen get semetbing in place of the capital you surrender.
.Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: You do net pay any
tax on it. It is only if you have a right te
interest, or if you have a right te a divîdend
in the senso that a d.ividend, bas been declared
and àt bas tbereby become a debt. The principle must ho that it is a debt. Having a debt
payable, you, tbe creditor, give up the right

retura for forgoing bis interost. If the shares

te receive it in return for a consideration, and

capitalization in the first place?

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: 0f ceurse, part of
the tiifficulty bas arisen because of original
issues of securities being based on tee
optimistic a valuation of assets. Be tbat
as it may, tbe section is realistic, in tbat it
imposes a tax upon what is received in the
way of security for a rigbt te interest; anti
the fax is net on the value of the security in

JUNE 26, 1947
under this section that consideration is
regarded as ýbeing income, the amount of which
would have to be determined, and. then you
woul pay a tax based on that amount.
Hon. Mr. (CAMPBELLL: May I ask the
honourable senator a question? Assuming that
you had a securi'ty of the value of $1,000, witb
arrears of interest in the amount of $250, and
you accepted a new security of the value of
$750, would you flot be taxed on the -proportion of that which represented your intýerest,
which would in effect tax part of the capital?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I d'o flot think Sa.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I believe the 'bill so
reads.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I do flot think it does.
1 think that, if I have a bond having a
principal value of $1,000, and there are arrears
of interest of =50, and I take a new security
of $750 in place of the $1,000 bond, and it
bears an interest rate of one per ceni or 'half
of one per cent less, then I have given up my
bond and received a bond of lower value in
place of it, but, I -have reeeived nothing in
respect of the interest I gave up, and in that
case there is no value applicable ta the interest.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Consider the position of
holers of senior securities. Under the proposition advanced by the honourable senator
who has just spaken, they would nearly always
have to give up ail the inte&est, and frequently
tbey have to surrender some of the capital, in
order to get reorganized. Yesterday afternoon,
when we were examining a gentleman representing the Departmnent of Finance, hie was as
doubtful as the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Carnpbell) if the boindhiolders were gîving up ahl their interest; but
I arn persuaded that the department would
try to tax that part of that $750 which was
held to have been received in lieu of inlterest,
and you would have an awful struggle ta show
the departrnent that interest was not part of
the consideration.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN : I do not want to suggest ta rny honourable friend that in these
circumstances I might ho ready even to vialate the ordinary rule which applies ta lawyers
in accepting retaîners, and I do not want ta
appear to be boasting; but I feel so firmly
on the question, that* if I had a security of
$1,000 and interest arrears of $250, and gave
that up and received a security of $750 bearing a rate of interest less than or equal ta the
interest on the old bond, I could dlaim that
I had given up my interest, completely; and
the bcst proof is that I have not got back
ail my principal, and I have a security which
i5 of lawcr value. In these circumstances my

479

view and my firrn conviction wouid be that
no part of that new security would be referable ta any of the interest arrears an the aid
security.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Section 2 of the
bill reads, in part, as follaws:
"Whcre a persan bas, on or after the first day
of J-anunry, nineteen hundred and forty-seven,
received a security or other right wholly or partially as or in lieu of paymrent of or atherwise
in satisfaction of an interest, dividend or other
debt

. *."

"ýPartia1iy" is interpreted ta include the
interest that wouid bc accumulated.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: That cavers the situation where a cornpany miglit issue ta me a
new bond and alsa some common shares. In
thase cireurnistances I wouid have received
samething for the principal of the aid bond
that I have turned in and also samethiog for
the shares. You knaw that in rearganizatians
this propositian is often put: "In retura for
your deiivering up the securities you have,
wc shall issue you a new security in preferred
shares and issue yau some debenture stock ta
make up the arrears of dividends thaýt have
not been paid". In those circumstances you
have received securities that wauld be referable ta and be made referabie ta the security,
interest, or dividend that you gave up. However, in the case cited, where a new bond is
obtained for a reduced principal, it is my
opinion that no part af that is referable ta
interest at ail.
Let us again read part of section 2:
"Where a persan h.as, on or after the first day
hundred aod forty-seven,
af Jaouary, nineteen other right wholly or parreceived a secuity or
tially as or in lieu of payrnent of or otherwise
in satisfaction of an interest, dividend ar ather
debt the arnaunt of which wauld be included in
cornputing bis incarne if paid...
When I get a $750 bond in return for a
$1,000 bond and arrears of interest, what part
of that $750, if paid, wouid be incarne in my
hands? My submission is that no part of it
wvauld be. It is ail principal.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: It might be, if the deal
was made that way.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes, but in the case
cited there was no such deai.
Han. Mr. LEGER:

But yau would

not

receive the saine amount if no interest or
d'ividend had accumuiated. Therefore, a certain portion must be consideration for what
bas accrued.
Han. Mr. HAYDEN: If my honaurable
friend ('Hon. Mr. Leger) wishes ta irnport that
consideratian into the transaction, thon I

480

SENATE

would say yes; but in the transaction as cited
that consideration was nlot suggested. If you
take $750 for $1,000Hon. Mr. LEGER: Yes, but you do nlot
take it for $1,000, but for the $1.000 principal plus the dividend or profits which have
accrued.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: If I take it on the
basis of some part being interest, then, first
of al. 1 have deliberately walked into the
situation; secondly, I have donc so very
foolishly; and, thirdly, 1 did not need to do
it at ail.

was agreed upon. There was ne dispute about
that point in committee.

against the cornpany could have taken place,
and the common sharehiolders could have been
wiped eut; but they got together and said to
the bondbolders: "No; abandon your interest, and accept a certain consideration rather
than foreciose?" I think that the bondhoiders
should neot be taxed on the value of any cernmon stock se given and received.

quite obvioiis that tbe discussion whiclh ha-.
taken place is eut of order.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, ne.

JUNE 26, 1947
Hon. Mr. VIEN: We are discussing a matter
as though we were in Cornrittee of the
Whole, but the report of the standing cornmittee has flot been referred to the Cornmittec of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members, I
rise on a point of order. We certainly have
a right to discuss this cornrittee report and
to deal with this section of the bill. True,
I cannot speak a second tirne, nor can the
bonourable member frorn Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden), but my earlier remarks were strictly
in order.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I. amrn ot suggesting
otherwise. Nor arn I suggesting that the
report of the committee that is now hefore
the house cannot be discussed. I arn stressing
the point wbicb the bonourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) raised yesterday,
namely, tbat in many cases we should refer
these matters to Committee of the whole,
instead of carrying on discussion across the
chamber in a manner which is irregular or
'whjch our rules forbid.
Furthermore, tbe report of the Standing
Committee on Finance was presented at this
sitting. It has hecome customary for the
Senate to consider reports of our standing
committees the very day they are brought in;
but our rules provide that they should stand
on the Order Paper for at least one day
before being considered.
.Hon. Mr. HAIG: On a point of order: the
honourable gentleman was not in his place at
the time, so may I inform him that the senator who moved the motion (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) asked permission of the house to do so,
and the bouse gave hirn permission by
unanimous consent.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I understand that, but
my point is that the discussion whicb has
taken place merely establishes tbat members
of the Senate desire to consider reports of
committees witb a littie more freedom . tban
ordinarily w<>uld be permissible wben the
bouse is in session.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: 1 think we had a
very fine discussion.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I suggest that the report
be allowed to stand until next week. Tbere
is no particular rush; no darnage would resuît
from the delay; and we could ponder tbesee
amendments a littie more than we bave yet
bad the opportunity of doing.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The motion
before tbe Chair is tbat the amendments
suhmitted by the Standing Committee on
Finance be now concurred in. A debate bas
taken place, wbich, it is true has been some83168--31

481

what irregular. I believe that tbe honourable
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
addressed the bouse first, then tbe honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell), and later the otber honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden). There
bave been questions back and forth; but I
think that each speaker has refrained frorn
speaking more than once, except when he was
responding to questions. There is a motion
hefore tbe house, and as a matter of form,
as was observed by tbe bonourable senator
from De Lorimer (Hon. Mr. Vien), it might
have been better if we badl gone into Coinmittee of the Wbole. for tben we migbt have
had a more free and easy discussion. I amn
prepared 110W to put the motion, unless there
is an amendment, and if tbere are no other
speakers.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is moved by
Senator Hugeasen, seconded by Senator
Howard, that tbe proposed amendments to
Bill 269, an Act to amend tbe Income War
Tax Act, bie now concurred in. Is-'it your
pleasure to concur in tbe amendments?
Hon. 'Mr. VIEN: 1 move tbat the debate
be adjourned.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: There is no debate to
adjourn.
Hon. Mr. VIEN Y The motion before the
Chair is that the amendments be concurred
in. A debate bas developed on that motion,
and I respect fully subrnit that I am in order
in moving the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. 'HUGESSEN: To settle this matter, 1 will move that the third reading be
taken tomorrow; so that if tbe bonourable
senator wishes to make any observations hie
will then have an opportunity to do so.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: If the acting leader of
the government (Hon. Mr. Copp) urges
that the matter be dealt witb today I will not
insist on my motion for adjournment; but 1
do not see that mucb damage will be donc if
we allow this matter to stand a little longer.
Hon . Mr. COPP: I bave no great desire to
rush the matter, but wc. are.to bave Royal
Assent tomorrow; there are a number of bills
ta be dealt witb, and I tbought that we migbt
get this one througb. If tbe amendments were
now concurred in, we could adjourn the tbird
reading until tomorrow, when my bonourable
friend could make bis ilemarks.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: But we shail have Royal
Assent next week.
Hon. Mr. COPP: No, tomorrow.

REVISED EDITIOZi

482

SENATE

Hon. Mr. VIEN: But next week there will
be another Royal Assent.
Hon. Mr. COPP: It may not be next week.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Or the week after. If
there were any urgency about passing this bill
I would not consider delaying it, but I do
not see that much damage will be done if the
Senate takes a little longer to ponder this
very important bill.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN (St. Jean Baptiste):
I do not think the motion of the honourable
senator from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) is
in order. When a motion that the report of
a committee be concurred in is before the
house, the only motion that can be moved is
that the report be not concurred in but that
it be referred back to the committee with
certain instructions.

THIRD READIýNG

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. COPP: With leave, I move the
third reading now.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Next sitting.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is moved by
Senator Copp, seconded by Senator Euler,
that with leave of the Senate the bill be now
read the third time.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I did not second that
motion.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is moved by
Senator Copp, seconded by Senator Howard,
that with leave of the Senate the bill be now
read the third time. Carried.
The bill was read the third time.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Mr. Speaker, may I say
just a word? The question was asked: "When
shall this bill be read the third time?" and I
distinctly heard one senator say "Next
sitting". I think that that senator bas the
right to insist that the bill be not read the
third time before the next sitting.
Hon. Mr. COPP: It bas been read.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It was not I who made
that remark. I am willing to have the bill
read a third time now. I did not say a word.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I did,. I said it myself.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I put the question: "When shall this bill be read the third
time?" and there was na dissent to the motion
for third, readiing.
Hon. Mr. EULER: On a matter of privilege,
I still contend that third reading cannot be
given to a bill on the same day as reported
from a committee if any senator asks that
it stand for further consideration. I distinctly
registpred my dissent.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
senator is quite right in saying that if an
objection is taken, the bill stands over to a
later date. But I distinctly said "With leave
of the Senate", and no objection was registered.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I made my objection.

Hon. J. J. DONNELLY presented the report
of the Standing Committee on Natural
Resources on Bill 261, an Act to amend the
Prairie Farm Assistance Act, 1939.
He said: Honourable senators, the committee have, in obedience to the order of
reference of June 24, 1947, examined the said
bill, and now beg leave to report the same
without any amendment.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
senator objected after the third reading had
been given. I do not want to be misunderstood. The honourable senator rose and
objected after the third reading had been
given.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I must decidedly object
to that statement, because it is not in accordance with what I did.

Hon. Mr. VIEN: On the point of order,
honourable senators: I submit that when there
is a motion before the house for concurrence
in amendments made by a committee, and
debate ensues, it is always in order to move
the adjournment of the debate. That is what
I am doing now.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN (St. Jean Baptiste):
I question that.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Much as I dislike admitting it, I believe the honourable gentleman
who bas just taken his seat (Hon. Mr. Vien)
is absolutely in order. I rise, however, as
leader of the Opposition to join with the acting leader of the Government in requesting
the honourable gentleman to permit the bill
to go to third reading tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: All right, I will do that.
I withdraw the motion.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Then, the motion
is to concur in the amendments to the bill.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. COPP: The third reading of the
bill will be moved tomorrow.
PRAIRIE FARM ASSISTANCE BILL

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When didi the
honourable senator object?
Hon. Mr. EULER: Before.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I saw no motion
by the honourable senator.
Hon. Mr. COPP: The honourable senator
did not risc.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Mr. Speaker, with al
respect, I wish to state that when you called
for.the third reading of the bil the honourable senator from. Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
said, "Next sitting".
The Hon. the SPEAKER: We cannot go
by signs. The honourable senator had the
rigbt to objec, to the third reading, and if he
desired to object he should have risen in his
place and said 80.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I distincthy did that.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I did not sec the
honourable gentleman risc, nor did I hear him
say th&t he objected.
Hon. Mr. EULER: AIl right; go ahead.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, this bill has been read the third time
and is now ready to pass. Is it your pleasure
to pass this bill?
The bill was passed.

BEAM TRAWLERS IN NORTH

ATLANTIC
NOTICE 0F INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called I
should like to address a question f0 the
goverîrnient through its leader in this chamber.
1 gave the lionourable leader notice by sending himi a copy of the inquiry. It reads as
follows:
Reliabie information lias corne f0 me froin
differenrt sources iii the Mar~itimne provinces
stating that Un'ited States fishing vessels, comnmoniy callel and kîîown as beam trawlers, and
which -are operating on thle Grand Banks of
Newfoundland and other banks in tlie North
Atlantic, are fislîing their trawls and hauling if
from the bottom to the ship some fwenty times
per day, and dumping tlie fish from these trawls
on

their

decks,

and

culling

out

from

split salfed each, are on tlie banks fishing -and
are throwing into the water dead haddock,
either full of spawn or male fish?
Is the goveroment also aware that crews of
Canadian beam trawlers are raking the Banks
with their trawls, and with-in the last fortnight
one of these hoats, according to the stnry of the
captain, hauled during that voyage some seven
hundred thousand ýpounds of fish and threw back
into the water some four hundred thousand
pounds in a dazed or dead condition, bringing
to the mnarket only three hundred thousand
pounds?
Is the government also aware that these beam
frawlers operated from different countries, but
vessels whose Canadian owners were encouraged
f0 huild them by an oufright gif t of the federai
treasury of $165 per ton, and/or from the provincial treasury of Nova Scotia by a loan
amounfing to seventy thîousand each, operated
on the fishing grounds of the North Atlantic
and hauled in their trawls thousands of mcsther
fish full of spawn; and as these fish are thin
and unîmarketahle in the f resh market, are
thrown back info the sea, dead, and tons of fish
spawn are shovelled through the scuppers?

these

catches thec haddock whichi are in the nets and
throwing back into the Atlantic ail the codfish
which are taken fromn the-se catches. The result
îs that hundreds of tons of edible large and
medium codflsh, in addition to small codýfish
whrich are inedible oni account of size, are thrown
back into the waters dead, wvith the result that
the grounds where these flsh are taken fromn
become putrid and the flh leave the grounds
and go elscwhere.
Is the government also aware that certain
foreign trawlers from France, Spain, etc., whichi
are capable of carrving three million pound.- of

stated abo;'e, and what action are they taking
to remedy tlîe situation? If something drastic
is not clone immediately tlie great North Atlantic fisheries will be a tlîing of the past.

INS1RANCE

COMPANIES BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. COPP nioved fthe second reading
of Bill 337, an acf to amend the Canadian
and British Insurance Companies Act, 1932,
andl the Forcign Insurance Companies Act,
1932.
Hc said: The hionourable senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) has k'indly consented to explain flic bill,
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senatos, tbis bill comprises three identical clauses amending the Canadian and
British Insurance Companies Act and the
Foreign Insurance Companies Acf by providing
for an added class of investment on behaîf
of t hose coimpanies of Canadian, Brifish and
foreign origin resident in Canada.
At flic present f ime four classes of investment are autlîorized by these acfs. By amendment te Section 1 of Sehedule I of the Foreign
Insurance Companies Acf the bill authorizes
for companies resident in Canada fhe following class of investment:
The bonds, debentures and other securities
issued or guaranteed by the International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development established
by the agreement for an International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development approved by
subsection one of section two of The Bretton
Woods Agreements Acf, 1945.
In the bill there is nothing of a compulsory
nature obligafing any company resident in
Canada f0 invest in this formn of securities.

JUNE 26, 194748
As a matter of fact, this field of investment
will be confined almost exclusively to coinpanies having financial balances in the United
States. It is entirely up té those companies
to decide upon a policy governing the extent
to, which they wish to invest in the proposed
securities of the International Bank. Therefore, I think our responsibility is comparatively liglit in sa far as this bill is concerned.
0f course, indirectly and from a moral point
of view, we are obligated to record our attitude as to the soundness or lack of soundness

of the securities that wjll be offered

fTomn time

to time by the International Bank.
I wish to point out that the Bretton Woods
Agreement of 1945 was approved and passed by
both houses of parliament and is now an
aocomplished fact, so, far as Canada is concerned. Under that act two new institutions
were set up: the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, and what is
known as the International Monetary Fund.
This legislation does not deal in any way with
the Fund but lias to do entirely with the new
bank, whose headquarters are established in
Washington, and on the board of which -the
Governior of the Bank of Canada, Mr. Graham
Towers, sits 'as the Canadian director. An
alternate direcior to him Mr. J. T. Parkinson,
Financial Counsellor in the Canýadian Embassy
at Washington.
The International Bank lias aecomplished
its set-up from a financial standpoint, and I
do not wish to, take the time of the bouse in
discussing i t. If members of the Senate wisb
to go into the present activity of th*le International Bank I believe it would be advisable to
have this bllI referred to committee. PersonalJy, I do flot think that is neceesary. 'It is
quite evident from a casual reference to the
bank's activities at present that the securities
it proposes to issue, and in which our insurance
companies woul, under this legîsiation, be
qualified to invest, are a perfectly sound and
safe -investment.
The Iternational Bank bas an authorized
capital of ten billion dollars. At the present
time same eight> billion dollars have -been euhscribed, and twenty per cent of that amount
is paid up- Included in the list of shareholders
are some forty-four countries, distributed- over
aIl parts of the world. The largest shareholder,
of course, is the United States, whioh, bas subscribed $3,175,000,000 of tbe eight billions of
paid-up capital. Tbe Uni.ted, Kingdom lias
subscribed $1,3W0,000,000, and Canada 832Z'
millions. The twenty per cent of these
amounts now paid up represents the operating
capital o>f the bank. It should be explained,
however, that this pai&-up capital was not
intended to be part of the bank's loanable

funds. It was intendcd rather that the
bank should barrow from private sources
the major portion of the moiley it neede for
lending operations. As occasion requires, therefore, the bank will seil debentures, first to the
United States and later ta some of the éther
member countries. The sale of these debentures will provide a principal source of boanable funds for the baink.
The operations of the bank to date are limited to a loan to France of 250 million dollars.
That boan was financed ont of the paid-up
capital; and the first debenture issue that 'will
be fioated by the International Bank will be
for the purpose of financing that boan. I think
it is quite evident. from the figures which I
have quoted in relation ta the subscribed and
paid-up capital that the bank intends-ta protect ta the very limit, and certain-ly sufficiently ta give assurance ta investors, the interests of the shareholders who.have contributed
ta the capital structure of that institution. The
twenty per cent that bas been paid up leaves
eighty per cen-t which will assume the form of
a trust ta proteet the lending operations of
the bank. Sa, in the case of any debenture or
security which is floated today by the International Bank, there will le virtually a guarantee of the gavernments which are committed, ta the extent af eighty per cent further
in the capital of the bank, ta protect the
operations of the bank. In other worde, a
debenture issue of 250 million dollars would
be protected by the eighty per cent af eight
billion dollars as a commitment by governmexits like the United States,,Canada and the
UYnited Kingdom. Sa that indirectly at any
rate, . 0 far as a governmen t-guaranteed
security is concerned, the International Bank
of Reconstruetion and Development affords a
field af safe investment.
That, I think, is about alI I need, ta say in
regard ta the present situation as it applies. ta
the International Bank. As I stated in 'the
beginning, ail we are asked ta do is ta
enable the insurance companies resident in
Canada ta have the privilege, if they ao,
desire, af buying these securities.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: The honourable senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) said that
the transaction would be a virtual guarantee
by the different gavernments.
Will that
guarantee le a de facto guarantee or justHon. Mr. LAMBERT: I should not
describe it as a de facto guarantee, but as an
indirect virtual guarantee.
Hon. *Mr. LEGER: It is a matter of the
bonour af the gavernments involved: that is
aIl- it will amount ta.

486

SENATE

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Possibiy I did not
make this clear; the capitalization of the
bank is 10,000 million dollars~
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Oh, yes, 1 understand
that very weii. But after the International
Bank bias gone on loaning by the hundreds
of millions, its total capitalization may soon
be exhausted. 1 arn not opposing the bill;
I arn seeking information. The money of
the public wiii be invcsted in this organization, and they will be looking for some assurance. I do not recaîl whether this International
Bank is subject to inspection, and I arn not
sure whetber there is any provision in the bill
before us that makes it subjeet to inspection.
Then, supposing these debentures were issued
and there was a failure to repay, what remedy
wouid we have? It seems to me that the bill
as it stands is incompiete.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I expiain to
my honourabie friend that the bank is subject
to the supervision of every government which
lias subscribed to it. Our' own Governor of
the Bank of Canada is a director of the International Bank, and annual reports are required.
Conceivably the operations of the bank
through its boans migbt eat up the amount of
its paid-up capital, but I arn quite certain
that these interested shareholders of the baiik
are flot going to permit boans of the ciass
which the International Bank is sîipposed to
make, as distinguîsbed from the monetary
fund, which is a current trading account, to
mount to the point where they will absorb
and offset the entire amount of the paid-up
capital.
That again raises the question of the
economic poiicy in relation to Europe that
the United Nations may be suecessful in
perfecting. I believe that it must be, in the
mincis of most people that General Marsbail's
proposais for the economic recovery of
Europe realiy represent the crux of this entire
financial problem. If the proposais can be
adopted and an ail round measure of co-operation to achieve recovery in Europe is established, then the operation of these financial
institutions wiil be certain to, meet witb the
grea test, of success. However, under the
Bretton Woods Agreement, the institutions
have been approved and this is now a matter
of detail.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourabie senators, I do
not intend to discuss either the menit or
dhe-merits of this bill. I merely wish to, register
a sliit protest. As a rule I arn not in favour of
permitting our insurance companies to make
inv'estmentq in any institution that may not be
a success, and certainiy not when the experiment
is iargeiy a governinentai one. The honour-

able senator from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Léger)
bias just touched upon a point about which I
wanted information. Supposing that you do
flot get your money or interest or principal,
what do you do? Do you simpiy diepend upon
the bonour of the nations putting up the
money? There couldý be quite a coliapse in
that. Canada is not a wealthy country. We
have uniimitcd natural resources and it
requires an immense capital investment to
deveiop these resources. I feel that in dealing
with our insurance companies we should be
very careful wbether we shlow them to make
investments outside our own country, unless
in another very stabilized country. I am.n fot
going to objeet to this bill, but I arn of the
opinion that it shouid go to a committee so
that we mnay have a clear undierstanding of
what we are doing.
1 remember quite well the discussion that
took place on the International, Bank. We
accepted rembersbip and the governrnent has
paid over 60 millions. If I rememnber correctly,
we voted the money in this chamber some
time ago. That is ail right. Speaking for
myself, and not for the party of which I have
the honour to be the leader, I do not like this
type of învestment for a life insurance coinpany. I say quite candidly that I do flot
deem, it advisable in a country wbicb, as I
have said before, bas so much use for its
own moncy. I shouid probably vote witbout
hiesitation that the government of this country
]end the International Bank a certain amount
of money, because in that case the people as
a whole would stand the risk. However, in
this case, the only peopie taking a risk would
be the sharebolders of the companies, if they
are share companies, and the policyholders.
The policyholders would take the buik of the
risk.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I interrupt my
honourable friend? He sbould remember that
these possible investments relate oniy to
balances in the United States.
Hon. Mr. HAIO: Yes; there are two or
three companies which have very large interests in the Unitedi States and who get a lot of
American money.
In my judgment it is flot in our interest to
encourage companies to make investments of
this kind. I bave no objection if the parliament of Canada, in either its wisdom or its
fooiishness, decides to make advances or loans
for the rehabilitation of Europe or any other
place, if we do it with our eyes open, because
the Canadian people as a whoie make the boan
and take the entire risk. I amrn ot voting
<ither for or against the bill; I arn just laying
down a principle which I think should guide
us.

JUNE 26, 1947
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: Would nlot the
responsibility rest upon the investmnent departments of the insurance companies? They
would decide whether or flot a certain investment would be a good risk.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes; but do flot forget the
human element. If the dominion government
said that it was ail right te make tliis type
of investment, every man wbo site around a
directors' table would have that fact in the
back of bis mind. The government haB an
obligation to see that insurance companies are
flot authorized to make any investments
which may affect the savings of an important
part of our population. I say this because
Canada, as well as the rest of the world, is
given just now to thinking too littie about
savings and more about old age pensions and
having somebody else pay the shot.
Ron. Mr. BUCHANAN: Despite What the
honourable senator bas said, I feel that an
intelligent director of an insurance company
would not endanger the investments of bis
company's policyholders just because parliament had given permission to make investments in the International Bank.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I answer the honourable senator? I arn not suggesting for a
moment that the International Bank would
disonestly take the investments. I have no
fear of that. However, any organization that
la allowed to do a certain thing may .regard
that as a suggested course of action to follow.
In these times we should be careful to keep
our insurance companies' investmnents on an
absolutely sound basis. I thinc it can be said
that- not a single policyholder in Canada bas
lest any money by reason of an insurance
coxnpany becoming 'hankrupt. That statement
can be made now only because througb the
years the larger companies have been determined that the policyholder should nlot suffer
from that kind of thing. However, it may
not be possible to maintain this record forever, and it i. with this thought in mind that
I want to give just a word of warning that in
these days, when it is difficuit to get people
to make savings, we shoulti be careful in
dealing with a bill like this.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: Do I unde-rstand
the honourable senator to say that the namne
of the government of the United States would
be on the paper?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, the name of the
United States government will ho on the
paper only'to the amount of their subscription
to the bank. I believe they have subscribed
à billion dollars.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: $3,175,000,000.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: To that extent the government will owe the money; but debentures
will ho issued for 20 billions or even 50 billions.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: Is there any limit?
Bon. Mr. HAIG: I do not think there is
any limit. We have subscrihed 325 million
dollars. To that extent I have no fear, but
that i. only a drop in the bucket.
May I dîgress for a moment and say that,
while I am whole-beartedly behind the United
Nations, there are in that organization many
nations to which I would not want to boan
any money.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
the explanation given by the honourable
senat-or from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
makes clear the purpose o~fthis bill. It is to
authorize Canadian insurance companies to
invest, as tbey see fit, their surplus funds in
the securities of the International Bank, when
suob securites are issued. That is a very
simple matter. The point is as to the soundness of such investment. It is on that point
that the leadier opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)' bas
raiseà a question. In the first place, according to the information given by the bonourable
senator wbo explained the bill the International
Bank has a subscribed capital of eight billion
dollars. 0f that amount 20 per cent is paid
up, and the balance is callable wben the
authorities of the bank think it xnecesary. to
secure additional funds.
It may be argued that if those who have
subscrihed to stock in the International Bank
are called upon to make good tbe unpaid
portion of tbe subscribed capital, they may
default in their paymients. However, as the
honourable senator from Ottawa pointed out,
the United States la by a wide margin the largest shareholder in the International Bank, and
Great Britain and Canada are also, shareholdërs. I think we can dismiss any fears that
these subscrihers would not pay up the unpaid
portions. of their subscriptions if called upon
to do so.
The bank is starting out with the subitantial
capital of eight billion dollars. The board
responsible for the management of the bank
is composed of men like Graham Towers,
who is the Canadian direotor, and top-.notch
financial men of the United States, Great
Britain, France and other countries; and if in
the course of its operations the bank wishes
to issue three billion, five billion or eigiht billion
dollars ini bonds or somne other formn of security,
I should not th-ink it likely. thiat this board
would entertain foolish investments.

488

SENATE

1 arn as strongly in favour of maintaining
security for Canadian life insurance policy
holders as is the bonourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig), but I arn bound to say that
I do flot tbink that an investrnpnt of this kind
involves any greater risk than any Canadian
company takes in buying the preferred stock,
or the common stock, of a corporation in
Canada, if that stock has a dividend record.
I say that there is less danger in investing in
the securities of the International Bank. These
securities are available to the life insurance
companies in the United States and to many

of the Canadian companies. As honourable
senators know, the larger Canadian insurance
companies have extensive business interests in
the United States. They write a great deal of
insurance in that country and under its laws
are obliged to invest a proper proportion of
their funds in United States securities. It
will probably work out that the smaller life
insurance companies, whose business is confined to Canada, will not participate in any
issue of securîties hy the International Bank;
but the larger companies. with substantial
portions of their assets in the 'United States,
will be in a position to invest, and it will b
to their advantage to do so.
I do not recaîl the rate of interest that the
International Bank is permitted to charge in
the case of loans to European and other
countries.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: It is substantial.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I arn sure there is a
substantial margin of safety in excess of what
we would regard as current rates of interest. I
see no danger in this form of investment. The
goveroment, I believe. is providing a perfectly
proper measure to enable Canadian insurance
companies to invest in this class of security.
After aIl, the directors of insurance companies
do not have to invest in these securities; there
is nothing mandatorv about the bill. They
will judge an issue of the International Bank
in precisely the samne way as they serutinize
the bonds of any commercial corporation in

Canada.

I arn bound to say, therefore, that I

do not. share the apprehension that is apparent in the mind of the honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig).
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: May I ask if any
foreign exehange factor is involved? I presume these bonds must be bought with
American funds?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: That is true.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: But will the provisions
of this bill override the restrictions whîcb
Canada bas put on the use of foreign exebange
by the general public of this country?

Hon.

Mr. LAMBERT:

The Minister of

Finance made it clear in the other bouse that
the Foreign Excbange Control Board would
be a deciding factor in controlling investrnents
of fundls.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: It would stop investments if necessary?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Quite.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Did I understand the
honourable gentleman to say that only funds
accumulated in afiother country could be
invested in this way?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: In the United States.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Do I understand that
there is no limitation in the amount of boans
which may be made? The bonourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) bas told
us about the large amount of money which is
either actually paid or subscribed-some eight
billion dollars. That amount means nothing
unless one takes into consideration the loans
whichi may be made. If there is no limitation
as to the amount that may be handed out,
the statement as to how rnuch is coming in
bas very little significance.
My second question is: if the bank boans
more than eight billion dollars and the boans
are not repaid, who stands the loss?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Who pays it?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: As a niatter of
information, nine countries bave already
applicd for boans through the International
Bank, but only one boan bas been granted.
France, wbich in this case, was the guarantor,
asked for 500 million dollars; the International
Bank granted a boan of 250 million dollars.

Loans were sought hy Czcchoslovakia, Denmark, Iran, the Netherlands, Poland, Luxembourg, and on this side of the world by Chile
and Mexico, but as yet none of these bave
been entertained.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The bank bas not

gut guing yet.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The only boan that
xvas entertained was made in haîf the amount
asked.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: But is there any limit
to which money may be advanced?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The only limît, I
would say, is the paid-up capital of the bank.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT moved that the bill
be referred to the Standing' Cornmittee on
Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.

DOMINION COAL BOARD
SECOND READING

Honi. Mr. COPPmoved the second reading
of Bill 340, an Act to 'establish the Dominion
Coal Board.
.He said: Honourable senators, the honourable senator from Margaree Forks (Hon. Mr.
MacLennan) bas kindly consented ta explain
the bill.
SHon. DONALD MacLENNAN: Honourable
senators, as you know, this bill proposes ta.
set up a board ta deal witb, coal problems in
the Dominion of Canada, a matter wbich has
vexed this country for many years. There
bave beennumerous committees and comnmissions appointed tbroughout the years ta
deal with this problem, and the very fact that
the coal situation in the Dominion fCan aa
calis for the appointment of committees and
commissions indicates, I believe, that the coal
situation in this country is a problem. One
reason for this state of affairs is that the
provinces in which coal is found are far
removed from the provinces in which most
of it la used. I believe, though I am not sure,
that the provinces of Ontario and Quebec
use as miuch coal as ail the other provinces
combined, and those two provinces are f ar
removed from the one in which coal is found.
Another phase of the problemn of coal minmng isthe unsatisfactory condition of the coal
mndustry, as evidenced in the continuai bickering bet.ween employers and employees. I amn
referring in particulair ta employees of comnpanies operating in Nova Scotia, with wbich
I am very familiar. As was said in the other
place by the Minister of Reconstruction and
Supply a few days ago, and repeated by the
honourable member for Royal, Néw Brunswick, the nature of the problem in one
province is quite different fromn that in
another. I bad always tbought that coal
mining was coal mining, and that the locality
in wbîch it was carried on did not make very
much difference, but it appears that conditions
affecting the mining of coal ini the several
provinces are by no means the samne.
In referring to the quarrelling and wrangling
between em.ployees and the employing comnpanies, I wish ta rnake it clear that in my
opinion the companies have brought a good
deal of their trouble upon themselves. Many
years ago there were no unions in. th.e Maritimes, and the men were at the mercy of the
companies. I personally know -that in those
days, the miner who- would "talk back" to a
lhom.would be imaiediately dismîssed. The
companies acted, arrogantly, and in many cases
cruelly towarde their men. I knew of one littIe
"ýRomanoff"' who came from Europe anid was
manager of a coal mine, and when a miner

wanted ta deliver a message te -him pertaining
to bis-employment hie had ta catch the stirrup
of the manager's sad-dle and trot along-sidte his
borse te makre known bis message. Subsequently unions were formed, whicb l.ncreased
in strength, and today tbey are s0 strofg that
perhaps they are 'as arrogant as the companies
ever were. They support the institution of the
closed sbop, and to my personal knowledge a
man would. not bc ailowed to get employment
in a mine unless hie belonged ta, a union, or
if he were not persona grata with the union hae
woukl not be permitted, ta join, with the consequence that hie ancb bis family were deprived
of support.
That these unions are overreacbing themsel ves is evident from what one reads and hears
of what is going on in the, United States.
There is no doubt ini.my mnd that John L.
Lewis bas done more for the United States
coal miner than any other man living, but the
great trouble, it seems ta me, is that hie does
not know where ta stop, with the result that
gains which, the miners of the United States
made in past years are being either thbreatened
or hast. Down in~ Nova Scotia, if a particular
hoise were taken froni a driver and another
borse substituted which bie dicl fot like, the
drivers would go on strike, and so tie up the
mine, because their work is necessary ta the
operation of the mine. No matter how mucb
tbe coal cutters do, unlesa the coal is removed
they cannot continue. That is another reagon
wby the situation in so far as the, Maritime
Provinces are oonoerned presents a rather
serious problem.
Another complication, wbich applies peculiarly ta Nova Scotia, is tbat 80 per cent of
aur coal is submarine. Coal companies in
years gone by-I ami not sa sure wbat they
do now-in their anxiety ta get coal and realize
money on it, extractedi the coal located near
the surface, with the result that many tons
of water Ieak down to the bottoni of the mines
and, bave ta be pumped up again, at a very
beavy expense.
I understand that in the Old Country they
went very deep into the mine before they
started extracting the coal. Instead of mining
the coal at the surface fiast tbey began at the
bottam and moved towards the surface.
This enabled tbemn to mine the coal more
cheaply. The mining of coal in the maritime
provinces is very costly. During the first
Wdrld War 1 saw a cost, list from the United
States, and tbe figure was $1.10, but the cost
to the biggest oal company in the Maritimes
wàs. 83 Lobh. The high cost of production la
another reason why companies cannot passibly pîy tàie wages that tbýe men would likeý
tu receive.

83168-32
EEVIBED EDITION

SENATE
This bill proposes to ameliorate conditions
in the coal mining industry, particularly with
the aim of having improved co-operation
between the miners and the companies. If
the board succeeds in improving Canada's
mining industry by following the recommendafions submitted by the Caitrol Commission,
I would say that the appointment of that commission and its attendant costis were flot in
vain. I understand that in the other placein the old days at home when "the other
place" was mentioned, I always took it to
mnean tbe infernal regions-Hon. Mr. HAIG: It stili *does.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: -but that is not
so here. I understand that the criticism
offered in the other place was that there is
no necessity for this board, because the
Dominion Fuel Board bas been in 'existence
since 1922 and functioning very wvell.* In
looking over the order in counicil establishing
the Fuel Board I did not find any of the
provisions that are contained in the bill under
discussion, exeept the one that provides that
the Fuel Board is authorized to secure ail
available data, to consult and co-operate with
individuals or bodies that they may deem
specifically qualifled to advise upon any
particular phase or phases of ihis work, and
with the approval of the Minister to employ
sncb technical assistance as may be found
necessary.
The new board that this bill proposes to
set up bhas far wider scope than that. For
instance, section 6 provides:
The board shahl study, review and reconimend
to the minister from time to time such po]icies
and measures as it considers necessary respecting the production, importation, distribution and
use of coal in Canada.
-The old Fuel Board had no sucb power as
that. Section 7 reads:
The board may undertake or cause to be
undertaken researches ami investigations with
respect to:
(a) the sy stems and methods of mining coal;
(b) the problems and techniques of marketing
and distribnting coal:
(c) the physical and chemical characteristics
of coal produced in Canada with a view to developing new uses therefor;
(d) the position of coal in relation to other
forms of fuel or cnergy available for use in
Canada;
(e) the costs of production and distribution
of coal and the accounting methods adopted or
used by persons dealing in coal;
I particularhy eall attention of honourable
sena tors to this section because of the fact
that now and again the coal companies apply
for subventions from the government, and it,
is a difficult matter to ascertain whetber or
not a subvention is needed. Section 7 paragraph (e) empowers this board to look over

the companies' funds and to examine their
auditing and bookkeeping, and to inquire into
the cost of production and transportation and
then-and only then-if tbey see the necessity
for it they may grant a subvention. If the
functions of the new board are carried, out
there is no douht that the governiment will be
fully aware of the existing conditions and,
in its wisdom, il may either refuse or grant
subventions.
This board. comprised. of seven members
Will be able to, do aIll these, things under
normal conditions. However, under section Il
of the bill there is set out a provision whereby
the Governor in Council can pass any order
necessary to meet an emergency. I amn of
the opinion that is a fairly wide provision
which will give satisfaction in normal times,
but if an emergency of any kind. arises I think
the Governor in Council should broaden the
functions of this board.
I must impress upon bo-noura-ble senators the
importance of having proper personnel on this
board. It is very important that its members
ho conscious of the problems concerning the
operators and are aware of the hazardoýus conditions under which the minera work. It must
ho remembered, that coýal mining is and bas
always heen a hazardous occupation. In conversation with a clergyman flot long ago I
venturcd to remark that coal mining nowadays
wus no more hazardous than driving a car on
the highway, and he replied,: "If you a.ssisted, at
the hurial of as many minera as I do. you
would nover say that". There is no doubt that
coal mining is a hazardous occupation. This
board should always bear that fact in mind
and deal most humanely with the minera, but
at the samne lime it should. not oppress the
companies.
The bill is very clear.
I am sure ail
honouiable senators understand it as well as
I do, and some perhaps a good deal hetter.
But in conclusion I may say that it would
appear that heretofore the goverfiment bas
always dealt with the larger coal companies
and ignored the amall ones. I do hope that
this board will see to it that the smaîl
operalors are given a chance commensurate at
least wilh that which the larger operators get.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable miemabers, I first wish te, congratulate the honourable senator from Margarce Forks (Hon. Mr.
MacLennan). I always enjoy listening to him,
and I appreciate the fairness with which he
bas dealt with this subject.
As a mbl I am opposed to boards because
I think they tend 10, huild up a great bureaucracy and give the govemoment a chance to,
shirk responsihihities that it should bear. Wbile
I am general
opposed to any hegishation

JUNE 26, 1947
creating a board, I must say candidly that the
coal question presents one of the most
important problema of this country. The
provinces of Ontario and Québec ha ve practically no reserve fuel of any kind; in the
Maritime provinces, especialiy Nova Scotia,
there is a large productio n of coal; and 14
per cent of the visible coal suppiy of the world
is in the province of Alberta, and it is a fine
coal. The whole subject must be deait with
in a way to make the coal resources of the
dominion available to ail parts of the country.
I do not know what arrangement in this
respect is economicaliy possible, but the whole
question bas to be investîgated. A commission
is a temporary thing; it sits for four months or
perbaps a year, makes its report, and then
is tbrougb. But if a board such as this bill
provides for is appomnted, it could survey the
whole field and be a permanent and continuing
body.
May I illustrate the thought 1 have in mind?
I am sorry that the bonourable senator from
Wellington <Hon. Mr. Howard) is flot in the
ebamber at the moment. He bas accused me
of talking frequently. about. my home city,
Winnipeg. About thirty years ago the young
lawyers there invited a central heating engineer
in Détroit to come and investigate the possibilities of central heating in our city. He said
that Winnipeg offered the most ideal conditions that lie had ever known, that even
the text-books did not describe sucb a perfect
set-up. Wbat bas happened as a result of that
meeting? My home, like many others, bas
central beating, provided by coal fromn the
province of Saskatchewan whicb selis in
Winnipeg for approximateiy $4 or $5 a ton
delivered. That coal is not touched by the
band.-of man fromn the time it is put into
the cars. It is delivered into the bins mechanicaily, and from there it goes through the
stokers to the furnaces and is transmitted
underground in the form of steamn or bot air
to the homes. Previous to central beating in
Winnipeg we used the bigh-priced Alberta and
Pennsylvania hard coal, but now we beat with
Saskatcbewan coal which. comes from a point
200 miles west of Winnipeg. No one thought
of tbe possibilities for this type of heating
before the young engineer came to Winnipeg.
The scbeme bas been so, succeseful that the
newer houses built in the districts where the
heat is availabie have no furnaces at ail.
It is miy opinion that a coal, board could
investigate possibilities -for advancement such
as the systemn I have outiined; it could
develop tbings that we do not even think
about.
The party wbich I have the honour to
represent bas always believed in certain fundamentai tariff protection for industry. I want
8316"-21

491

to say to tbe senators fromn Ontario and Quebec that irrespectîve of tbe party in power
this bas been the poiicy of this country since
1878. 1 do not propose to get into any political argument as to whetber the Liberai party
stands for free trade and the Progressive Conservative party for protection, but generaiiy
speaking, and irrespective of tbe administration in office, very few fundamental changes
in the tariff poiicy are made. I am not ignoring the tariff question, but I say that if we
give protection to tbe industries of Québec
and Ontario tbere is no defence for failure
to give similar protection to tbe industries of
tbe Maritimes and the Prairie provinces.
If we can mine coal in the Prairie provinces,
especially Alberta, as good in quality as that
soid in any place in the worid, and if the
Maritime provinces are capable of doing tbe
samne, tbe situation ougbt to be investigated
fuliy in tbe interest of Canada.
It was mentioned this afternoon tbat our
system of mining is wrong. In a recent article
I read tbat the United States produces a
larger quantity of coal per men per day tban
Great Britain does. That is sometbing that
wouid bear investigation. In the coal mining
areas of Alberta, witb wbich my honourable
friend from Letbbridge (Hon. Mr., Buchanan)
is familiar, it is too easy ýtoý open a.
mine. Mines start up, go broke and lose a
lot of money. The situation shouMi be investigated by able men who, couid prescribe
a continuing policy for the benefit of the peopie of Canada. Ontario and Quebec, bave
bad to, buy their supply of coal froin the
United States, and a probiem bas now come
up because of the exehange on American funds,
tbat we require to buy goods.
1 bave'read the bilt>carëfuliy and I believe
it is wide enougb to cover any of the 'proposais I bave suggested. I believe that thé
solution of tbe coal problesu could be effected
by a board such as the bill proposes. This
is particularly desirable after sucb a disastrous
strike as there was in the Maritimes--a strike
wbich iasted for more than a hundred days,
and in which -botb sides lost. I agree with the
honourabie senator from Margaree Forks
(Hon. Mr. MacLennan) that we bave to get
dlown to this problemn and do our part.
I was down in the United States when
their elections were ending, and it did not
take mucb intelligence to know what was
going to happen. Mr. Lewis had brought on a
strike a week or ten days before. One wouid
tbink he was hired by the Republicans to
make sure they got in. He was ail the time
tbreatening kwbat -he was going to do. That
was just what the men* opposed to unionism
wanted.

.SENATE

. No one in Canada should take aides on this
question; we sbould try to work it out impartially for the good of aIl. The great body
of public opinion belongs neither to the
capitalist class nor to thie labour clasa, but is
in between, and we must see that it has a fair
deal. It is flot organized. I arn not taking
the aide of either capital or labour. Several
times in this bouse I have stated my views on
this question, and I do not need to repeat
them. The labourer is worthy of bis hire, and
we must recognize bis fundamental right to a
wage on which he can live in decency in a
country like ours.
SI am hopeful that, if this board is appoin.ted,
it will not be merely for the purpose of giving
bonuses to the Maritime provinces for coal,
or subventions to labour, but t.hat it will
investigate the whole fuel problem and se
whether it is possible to suggest a fuel policy
for Canada which will be economically sound
and at the same time effective to protect us
against any shiortage of fuel. T-hough I amrn ot
speaking as representing Alberta, I believe that
Alberta can supply all the coal which Canada
would need if it bad a population of 100
million people; if not for ever, certainly for
as long as our present pattern of life continues.
The study of atomnie energy may produce new
forms of heat and new methods of beating;
but irrespective of sucb developments, we may
be assured that one province alone can provide ail our fuel requirements for the next
century. Yet our present position is sucb
that even now we are urging the people of
Ontario and Quebec, "Get your coal in".
I did not intend to speak so long on ibis
matter. I arn in favour of sendîng the bill
to committee. I suggest that some member of
the government, preferably the Minister of
Reconstruction, sbould. appear there, and tell
uçs what is in bis mmnd in connection witb this
bill, what purpose he wants the bill to serve
and what he expeets the commission to do. We
do flot need details, but it would bie welf to
know from him wby the board is being
appointed. We can read the speeches on the
bill, but that is not what we want; and I
should hike to bave an opportunity of asking
hirn questions about it. Personally, I intend
to vote for the bill.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, I have no extended remarks to
make in connection witb this bill. One migbt
talk on the coal question for hours. But I
would flot like it to pass witbout calling attention to sorne serious features wbich I find in
the bill. I wonder where we are drifting. At
the early stages of the war we appointed a
prices boajrd and gave it. authority to boss vari-

ous industries and, individuals. The war is
past, we thougbt we were getting rid of the
prices board and its private domination over
the nation; but, with the war gone by, we still
have our financial andý varions other controls,
and now cornes this control.
I suppose it is necessary. Undoubtedly the
matter of bcating our homes is important, but
I rather object to the note of fear wh.ich is su
frequently sounded to drive us into legialation
of this kind. 0f course I have no objection
whatever to a board investigating, if its
investigations are worth the cost. I have no
objection to a government sgency that wisbes
to bring about greater co-operation between
capital and labour in the production of coal,
-or any other production; but I do hope that
the inference which one miglit bave draiwn
from the excellent remarks of the honourable
member frorn Margaree Forks (Hon. Mr.
MacLennan) that the measure in some way is
designed to curb wbnat be termed, the arrogance
of the unions, is altogether unjustified.
I bave no objection to a considerable portion of this bill. But I should like honourable
senators to understand thoroughly a feature of
it which the bonourable gentleman frorn
Margaree Forks passeci over with not more
than two sentences. In section Il it says this:
Where the Governor in Council is of opinion
tlîat by reason of conditions or events within or
outside of Canada there is or is likely to be a
shortage of fuel in Canada of sucli dimensions
or nature as to iïnperil the welfare or national
life of Canada as a %vhole or so as to concern
Canada as a whole, lie may do and authorize
sucli acta and things and make sucli orders and
regulations as lie mnay deemn neeessary or advisable to conserve the available supply of fuel and
to regulate and control its production, distribution and use.
The issue of a proclamation by tbe Govèrn-or
in Council declaring that a national fuel emergency exists in Canada shahl be conclusive
evidence that it does exist and these extraordinary powers then reside in the executive.
Tbe executive may proceed to make regulations, and:
Ail orders and reguhations made under or pursuant to this section shall have the force of law
and shahl le enforced in sncb manner and by
such courts, officers and authorities as the
Governor iii Council may prescribe and shall for
the purposes of the Interpretation Aet be
deemed to bie regulations.
And the Governor in Council may prescribe
,for offences under the statute a fine not exceeding $5.000 or a term of imprisonment not
exceeddng five years. The regulations must be
laid before parliament while it sits, and they
shall relate to ail manner of fuel, not only
coal but also light and heavy fuel ou, kerosene,
range ou, gas oit, diesel oul and other hyd-rocarbon fuels.

JUNE 26, 1947
Now this--I think we should realize it-is
a piece of exceedingly dfrastic .legislation,
because we plaoe in the hands of the executive
the power to take over the complete admirnitrâtion of the fuel business of this dominion;flot only the mining of coal, but also the production of oil; flot only the production of.
oïl*tnl -coal, but the business conneetedl with
it; and, finally, the use of the fuel. So that
the whole matter of regulation, if it is so
desired by the minister in charge and the
ministry, will be put in th'e bands of an
appointed board acting under the authority of
the executive and, having.most drastic and
extensive powers. Well, if other members of
this house are sufficiently fearful that some
disaster rnay corne upon us unless we appoint
these potential czars--why, ail right, go ahead.,
But do nlot close your eyee to the direction
in which you are travelling.
.Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN (St. Jean Baptiste):
What other course would rny honourable friend
suggest, if a national ernergency arose? Muet
we not be in, a position to deal with it?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: What about the
national emergency in food? The general food
situation on a world-wîde scale is a very
serious one. What about. the possibility of a
criais in the matter of clothing? Clothing is
in short supply everywhere. What about a
national crisis in the matter of homes, or
building,, and so on? What about every
national crisis which you can imagine in addition to that of fuel? First it is fuel; then it
is something else; then it is sornething further
than that. I arn only saying this: do not
overlook the direction in which we are travelling.
The direction in which we are travelling is
a regulated society in which the rights of the
individual are set aside, purportedly for the
good of the public, but the final result is next
door to a controlled society or a police state
in which. the private individual and the business of the country are bossed by a few civil
servants. I say to honourable senators that
if you are afraid that a fuel crisis might corne
on your hands when parliarnent is not in
session or rnight be so drastic that a session of
parliarnent could nlot be called in tirne to deal
with it-if you are so scared that you will
aecept this kind of legislation--go ahead.
Personally, I arn not.
Let me mention an incident which occurred
recently. A farmer was grousing about the
weather, as farmers so frequently do, and he
said that because of the raina he was not going
to plant this spring. He was admonished by
somebady who had had experience on the farrn
but perhaps was not so closely eonnected
with the industry at that tine as the farmer

himself. That man asked the farmer if lie
did not have some reliance upon the natural
forces that lied seen rnkind through rnany
centuries, and if he did not think hie had
better plougli, plant and seed and have. faith.
that in due tirne lie would reap his liarvest.
I say to honourable senators that we should
have such faith. Why should we always lie
frightened into giving up the freedorn and
liberty we possess and appointing officiais to
govern us in our economic and social life? 1.
arn not strongly opposed to the bill, but 1
myself would nlot draw u-p that kind of
measure even if I did anticipate the criais te
be rnuch more serious and imminent than I:
feel it is. I 'would not draw the bill in that
way; I would still leave some power in the
hands of parliament. I know that we are
drifting towards the abolition of government
by legislation and the substitution therefor of
government by order in council. I do noît
like the -trend, nor do I like the drif t. I would
rather have the Canada. of the past than go
into the Canada of Karl Marx and of those
who would substitute intelligent directionand do.not misunderstand my use of the wor'd
"mntelligent"ý-for a belief in the natural
forces and a reliance on things working out as
they always have done in the past.
This bill will go to a comrnittee, where itý
will be explained, but 1 simply want to ask my
fellow members to realize that wheni we are
passing this tyipe of legislation we should
realize where we are going.
Some Bon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN: Honourable
senators, I do not intend to deal with the
criticism. that has been directed towards the,
bill by the honourable senator front Toronto-,
Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roeliuck). I presume t
the bill 'will eventually go to a cornmittee 1
where the point he has raised can lie con-.
sidered. I arn more concerned about the
coal problem as having a national scope and
requiring a body of a national character to
keep in touch with the problerns that affect
it. I agree with what the honourable leader,
opposite -(Hon. 'Mr. Haig) has said ini respect
to the coal situation in Western Canada,.,
because I arn fairly familiar with -the industry
in that part of the country. I should not want
the Senate to think for a monment that at.the
present time it ia as serious a problem in the
West as it ia in the Maritime provinces, for.
rnost of our western mines are active and,
free froin any labour difficulties. While there
la perhaps not a sufficient rnarket for Alberta
mines, a considerable market la available for,
our domcstic and stearn coal. This is se ini
not only Alberta, but in British Colurnbi&

SENATE

and Saskatchewan. The leader opposite made
reference to the fact that there were buge
deposits of coal in Alberta. That is correct.
1 would flot attempt to quote any figures,
because honourable senators might feel that
1 was stretching my imagination. However,
1 do. remember-and I believe I mentioned
this to the Senate a few years ago--that
Griffith Taylor, Professer of Geography at
the University of Toronto, in a recently
published bookiet stated that if the coal
resources of Alberta were fully utilized, nlot
only as fuel but for power and other purposes, that area would probably become one
of the most densely populated sections of
Canada. When le spoke of the use of coal
for other purposes than fuel ho was referring
to the uses it has been put to in Germany,
particularly during war time. Coal has been
used for sucb purposes as making certain
types of clothing, and in the manufacture of
some chemicals and drugs. However, in this
country coal has not yet been utilized for any
other purpose than as fuel.
The honouirable senator who explained the
bill (Hon. Mr. MacLennan) referred to section 7, paragrapb 3, wbicb reads:
7. The Board may undertake or cause to be
undertaken researches andl investigations witb
respect to:
(c) The physical and chiemical characteristios
of coal produced in Canada with a view to
developing new uses therefor.
That would ho one of the assigniments of
tlîis board. To my mind it is a highly important matter, as I foresee the possibility of the
Alberta coal mnarket dirninishing. Unless there
is a complete change in the railway rates to
enable coal to go beyond Winnipeg, we shall
ho limited to the Prairie provinces for our
market. Another factor is that Ive have direct
competition in the province of Alberta itself.
When 1 went to Lethbridge in 1905 it was
largely a mining camp -and depended almost
wholly on the coal mining industry. Every
home and building there was heated by coal.
I would say that in Lethibridge today nlot
10 per cent of the buildings or homes use coal.
Natural gas obtained from Turner Valley and
other fields in Adberta is being used. This
bias limited the home market for coal, and
that development bas not been confined
entirely to soutbern Alberta. Natural gas bas
been used in Edmonton, and only recently
a franchise was granted whicba will mean that
suchi places as Red Dccc, Lacombe and other
parts of Alberta, which have been using coal,
will use gas. The discovery of new oit fields
brings in a fresh supply of gas, and in the
new Leduc field gas bas been discovered. It
will no doubt be used for fuel and will ho
piped to botb eastern and central Alberta.

I mention this fact in order that honourable
senators may realize that sooner or later there
is bound to, ho a problem in Alberta in relation to coal, through competition within the
province from natural gas. The samne situation
may also develop very rapidly in the nortbern
part of Saskatchewan. That would leave us
practically with only the province of Manitoba to supply.
This board, with the powers that are to be
given it, could very we'll study other means of
utilizing coal. We know something df what
bas been donc by the Duponts, in the way of
new inventions involving the use of coal in
the United States, and I have mentioned what
bas been donc in Germany. And if thro-ugh
this board we could ascertain what new and
profitable industries could be obtained, and
proueed to, utilize our coal for the purpose of
new industries, it would ho very well. worthwbile. The day will corne when matters such
as I have referred to will have to ho studied
and sonte solution found; failing that, the
coal industry in the provinces wbere it exists
migbt ho crippled and. destroyed.
Apart from the production of the domestie
fields of Alberta. steam coal also is produced
and is3 now bring utilized by the railways.
They provide a good market today, but locomotives are rapidly being converted to the
use of fuel other than domestie coal.
It miglit ho in-teresting to, the memhprs of
the Snate to know that the coal fields of
Alberta are flot confined, to one area, but are
spread aîhl over tbe province. There are very
large fields in the vicinity of Edmonton; there
is a supply of coal in the Peace River country;
and coal is to ho found aIl through central
Alberta and right down to the American
border. Wbcn, wo speak of the coal, industry
of Alberta we think of the large mines, but
it is well to rememiber that the farmier, for
instance. g ts bis coul f romi the smeall mines
in the banks of some of the rivers where it
is readily available only a few miles from bis
farm. There is really only a limited, markct
in the agricultural areas of Alberta for the
produet of the large mines.
I arn emphasizing these important aspects
of the coal industry becauso of the possibilities
for the future and, the likelihood that a hoard
of this character, with the powers that would
ho given to it, could study the prohlem before
it develops serioýusly, and hring forward some
solution or alternative for the use of coal in
the large coal area of Canada, the province of
Alberta.
1 pr-estime the bill will go to committee
wbere. as the leadýer opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
suggested, we could heur the broader vîews the
minister bas in mmnd for the creation of this

JUNE 26, 1947
board, and aleo consider the pointe raised by
the honourable senator from Toronto-Tririity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
Hon. VINCENT DUPUIS: Honourable
senators, may 1 make a few rernarks on the
very important subj oct of fuel production in
Canada? As the distinguished leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig) bas said, this question is so
important that the matter of tariffs, as far as
the parties are concerned, becornes incidentai.
I arn indeed impressed with the debate on
this phase of aur natural resources. Canadians
who know their country well can perhaps learn
even more about it from books; and may I
say, without flattery, that from this point of
view the record of the speeches in the Senate
of Canada is one of the best books a maxn
can read. I listoned with interest ta the
rernarks of the honourable senator fromn Lothbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) on the great
wealth contained in the soul of Alberta. My
honourable friend ta my left (Hon. Mr.
Stevenson) bas just said that the city of
Edmonton is built on a coal mine. Not only
do we possess coal in this country, but we
have oil in immeasurable quantities. In the
Turner Vallev and elsewhere in the West
thero are riches of oul and gas capable of
generating heat and energy for the whole
world for centuries to corne.
While listening to the dobato on coal the
thought occurred to me, being a Quebecer as
well as a Canadian, that it would be proper
for the honourablo membors of this Upper
House ýto appoint a special committee on
Natural Resources, for the purpose of studying fuel production in Canada and of how
we could produce refined oul and seli it at
flot less than the United States price.
It makes a mani unhappy to know that
aithough his country possesses such riches,
great quantities of raw materiais are sent
elsewhere to be refined and rnanufactured,
and are sold back to this country at perhaps
ten tirnos the prico at which the produets
could be processed here.
.The phraseology of .5ection 7 (d) of the
bill, which says that the board may undertake investigations with respect to the position of coal in relation to other forrns of fuel
or energy availabie for use in Canada shouid
be broader, so as to include fuel oul.
I do agree, however, with the honourable
senator from Teronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) that we shouid not aiways delegate
to boards the powers which the people of this
country have granted ta parliament.
I submnit, honourabie senators, that it is
our duty to study and investigate the fuel
wealth of our country and to discover ways

495

and means of processing those natural
resources. If such a comrnittee as l have
suggested is, practicable, I wouid be very
much interested in its deliberations.
Hon, W. RUPERT DAVIES: Honourable
senators, I shall be vory brief, for the, hour
is late. I want to draw attention ta one
feature of this bill with which. 1 do not agree.
The sarne provision appeared in the Canadian
Maritime Commission Bill, which we discussed,
yesterday. But in the first place I should like
to associate myseif with the honourablo memfber frorn Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
We are drifting farther and farther away from
government by the elected representatives of
the people, and more and more into gavernment by appointod boards. That is a danger
to whir h we should pay a great deai of seriaus
attention. But 1 do not want to take up any
more tirno on that point. The feature of this
bill-and of the Maritime Commission Bill
which. is at present in cornmittee-to which 1
objeet is that, while the chairman is to be paîd
a salary set by the Govornor in Council, and
the commissioners are also ta be paid, when
it comnes to the advîsary committees which
are to be appointed by the commission we find
this provision:
No person appointed by the Board ta serve on
any coxpmittee shall be entitled to or receive
any fee or reward for any service rendered in
connection with the duties of the committee, but
each such person shall be entitled ta his reasanable living and travelling expenses whiio engaged
on any such service in any place other than his
ordinary place of rosidence.
The Board shall prescribe the dutiesl and
functions of each such committee and may make
rules for the regulation of its praceedings.
Now it. ocdurs to me that if this board
appoints an advisory committeo it will probably select technîcal officers, for the most part
mon from the geological departments of our
universities, who are not receiving large
salaries; and if we are to pay salaries to the
chairman and to the commissioners, as is pro.
posed in this bill and in the Maritime Commission Bill, we should also pay a reasonabie
wage to technical afficers who are called in by
these commissions to advise and help them in
the teehnical phases of their proceedings. I
do not think we are dealing fairly when we
undertake by this bill to pay a salary to the
chairman and remuneration to the commissioners, and refuse to pay anything beyond
travelling 'costs and living expenses to their
committees. What sort of mon do we suppose can afford to do the kind of work we
want, rnerely for their living and travelling
expenses? I would say, none but a poor ciass
of adviser. We shahl not get high ciass mon
unhess we make ut worth their whiho; and I

496

should like to see the bill changed so that
those who are appointed to these committees
will receive some reward beyond their travelling and living expenses.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN
moved the
second reading of Bill B13, an Act to incorporate the Yellowknife Telephone Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this motion
would enable me, if I wanted to do so, to tell
something about the remarkable development
which has been going on in the Northwest
Territories. Yellowknife is a mining area which
bas been growing rapidly in the last dozen
years or so, and which now bas a population
of some 3,500. It has a water system, an
electric light system and a sewerage system; it
is modern in every respect except that it has
not a telephone system, and that is what is to
be furnished by the company whose incorporation is provided for in the bill. I am advised
that it will be the first commercial telephone
system to be established anywhere in the
Northwest Territories.
Yellowknife has a considerable business
community. The area is administered by a
commission of seven members, four being
named by the Department of Mines and
Resources or by the Governor in Council, and
three elected by the residents of Yellowknife.
This administrative body bas approved of the
present project; the materials necessary for the
construction of the system have been acquired;
and once this bill is passed it will be possible
to begin the work of construction.
The proposed act of incorporation endows
the company with the usual powers required
in this type of enterprise, namely, power to
acquire land, buildings, equipment, apparatus
and the like necessary for the carrying out of
the undertaking, and including the right to
enter into a.greements with other telephone
and transmission companies for connecting
the company's system with other systems,
which is a common provision with all communication companies.
The proposed act

authorizes a capitalization of $250,000 divided
into shares of $50 each. Section 6 of the bill
provides that after ninety per cent of the
capital stock has been issued and fifty per
cent paid thereon, the capital stock of the
company may be increased from time to time
by such amounts as the shareholders deem
necessary for the proper extension of the
undertaking of the company; with the added
provision that the total capital of the company, including the present authorized stock,
shall not exceed the sum of $750,000.
The directors. of the company are business
and professional men at Yellowknife. The
intention is to provide a telephone service for
the community of Yellowknife and some of
the mining properties nearby.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN:
tariffs?

What about the

Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: I believe they will
be under the control of the commission that
usually deals with tariffs. I am not sure as
to that.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: I move that the
bill be referred to the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The honourable senator
from Margaree Forks (Hon. Mr. MacLennan)
has asked a question that I was going to ask.
After the bill has been considered in committee will yon be able to report back to the
house what control there will be over the rates
charged by the company? '
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: There is no mention of that in the material that has been
given to me.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I appreciate that, and I
am quite willing that the bill be referred to a
committee; but when the report of the committee is presented will that information be
provided?
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: I believe that the
solicitors of the company will appear before
the committee and be prepared to give that
information. I might add that this pýroposition has the approval of the government
authorities in the district.
The motion was agreed to.

TRUST COMPANIES BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. A. B. COPP rnoved the second reading of Bill C13, an Act to arnend the Trust
Companies Aet.
H1e -said: Honourable senators, those -who
have had an opportunity to look over this bill
since it was introduced into the house yesterday w'ill know that it centaine a number of
proposed arnendments' to the Trust Companies
Act. The original act was passed in 1914, and
from time to time amcndments have been
made as occasion required.
In recent years the trust companies
throughout Canada; have expanded their business considerably. Owing to the fact that a
great deal of money is left in the hands of
the companies for investment and other pur.
poses, il. is now necessary, in the interests of
the companies themselves as well as of the
public, that there be a littie stricter control.
The act is administered by the Superintendent
of Insurance, from. whom I have quite a long
letter of explanation; but I do. not think it is
necessary to place this upon Hansard, as I
intend to move, after second reading, that
the bill be referred to a committee for careful
study.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, an
officiai of one of the Iead-ing trust companies
intcrviewed me some time ago about this
measure. Two principles are involved, the
character of the companies' investments,' and
the control by the Superintendent of Insurance.
While I do not aiways agree with the decisions
of the Superintendent, I think this proposed
çontrol is ail to the good. My information
is that alI the trust companies welrome the
contrai. I arn in favour of the billThe motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

WISHART

McL.

ROBERTSON:

Honourable senators, I very much regret that

it is my du-ty to inform this house of the
recent death of Viscount Bennett of Mickleham, Calgary and Hopewell, former Prime
Minister of Canada.
The late Viscount Bennett was born July 3,
1870, at Hopewell Hill, New Brunswick. After
graduation from the provincial normal school

in Fredericton at the age of 17, lie put himself
through law school with money he made from
teaching. At the age of 23 lie graduated from
law school, and four years later went west to
practise law in Calgary. From 1898 to 1905
he was a member of the Legislative Assembly
of the Northwest Territories, and from 1909
to 1911 a member of the Legislative Assembly
of Alberta.
In 1911 lie was elected to the House of
Commons, and served until the election of
1917, in which he did not run. In 1925 lie
returned to the House of Commons. In 1927
he was chosen national leader of the Conservative party, a position which he held for

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable

the House of Commons to return Bill 271, an

and to change its title to the Excise Tax Act,
and to acquaint the Senate that they have

FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of

The bill was read the first time.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, when shal the bill be read the

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: With leave of the
Senate, next sitting.

nearly eleven years. During his years in the
House of Commons Lord Bennett held at

different times the offices of Minister of
Justice and Attorney General, Minister of
Finance, and Secretary of State for External
Affairs. In August 1930 he became Prime
Minister, an office which he held through the
difficult days of the depression until October
1935. During his term as Prime Minister the
late Lord Bennett played a foremost part in
conferences in London and in Canada on
various imperial, political, and economie questions. In 1934 he represented Canada at the
Assembly of the League of Nations.

In 1939 he took up residence in England,
and in 1941 was created a Viscount. From
then until his death Lord Bennett served in

the House of Lords, and during the critical
war years carried heavy responsibilities at the
Ministry of Aircraft Production, performing a
task for which he was warmly thanked by the
then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.
Lord Bennett passed away at his country home
in Surrey on June 26, 1947, at the age of
almost 77 years.
J cannot say that I ever enjoyed the honour
and privilege of personally knowing this great
Canadian. I was not a political supporter of

his, but I recognized in him a great personality, endowed

with great abilities

and

energies, and possessed of a passionate desire
to dedicate those abilities and energies,
together with his wealth, to the service of
Canada. His later years were spent in Britain;

JULY 1, 1947
bis mortal remains will rest in the churchyard
of Mickleham; but 1 arn sure that his heart
was ever in Canada, and that henceforth his
great spirit wîll ever hover over this, his
native land.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I do flot propose to refer to the varjous
incidents in the life of the lata Viscount
Bennett which have bean mentioned by the
leader of the governimant. I knew the late
Viscount Bennett hast as "R. B." He was
raally a wasternar. True, bie was born in the
province of New Brunswick, but at anl early
aga hae moved to the West, and ini time
bacama part of the tradition of the West,
particularly of Calgary. Calgary had a great
influence on bis life, and hie had a great
influence on Calgary's 111e.
I tbink history wilI record R. B. Bennett as
one of our great Canadians, aspecially frorn
thse point of view of ability of mmnd. He was
a- vary able lawyar, in every sanse of the
terni. That this was genarally recogniÉed
tbroughout the lagal profession is shown by
the fact that hae was made Honorary Life
Presida»t of the Canadian Bar Association,
the only man who bas evar bean so honoured.
Ha not only served in the Assambly of the
Northwest Territories, but, as the record
shows, for a short pariod hae was a mamber of
the Lagisiature of Alberta. In 1911 hae ws
alected to the House of Commons, of which
bie continued to be a membar for some six
years. Than hie retirad, but carne hack in
1925.
-I knew R. B. Bennett hast as a Iawyer and
as a politician. He was one of the great
lawyers of our country. He was, I thinc, the
only man 1 avar mat who possessed a dual
personalîty. As a lawyar and as a business
man lie was a "«top notcher"; but temperamentally ha rnight rather be likened to a
prima donna-ona whorn, to undarstand, it
was necessary to know-for if hae was not
feeling right it was just too had for you.
His record as a public man speaks for itsalf.
1 beliave it will ha the judgment of history
that no man could have handled tha affairs
of Canada better than hie did frorn 1930 to
1935. Thougb bis administration, rnay have
hean disastrous to the party hae led, it was
good for Canada. Ha eonducted us through a
perîo>d the like of which, I hope naither this
country nior an y othar will expeïrienca again,
for the eonditions frorn which Canada was
thaen suffeiing were shared by the whola world.
Ha had an intense lova of Canada. His
affection for- this country was such, if 1 rnay
say so witbout flattery, as peculiarly djharacter.
izes. the people: of the Maritime Provinces.

Along with bis sentiments of Canadianisrn hE
cherished an intense impariaiim. Ha it was
who drova through to coimpletion the agreernents betwaan the various miembers of the
British Brnpira-agreernants which today
underlie the business dealings bstwaen the
various parts of the commonwealth, and
which our great neighhbour to the south is
prassing to hava repaaled, because it recognizas
the great advan'taga possessed by tha differant par'ts of the -commonwealth in trading with
ona another upon a basis of praferential tariffs.
The lata Mr. Bennett's achievernant, starting out for hirnself and rnaking bis way in the
world, is an inspiring example to Canadian
yoi#ih. Trua it is that Damne Fortune smiled
upon him; but also hae had qualities whicb
rnake men great in the business world. Perbaps I rnay illustrate this by a personal raferanca. One day in the spring of 1928, when
hae was travelling east frorn Calgary, hae got
off the train at Winnipeg andi asked me to
drive him arounrd the city. On the way he
said, "I arn selling all my stocks, Jack." I
said, "Wby?" "Well," ha said, "Yo'u saîl yours
too, and in a few years frorn now 1 will tell
you why." T-hat was ona instance of the business intuition which hae so markadly displayed
while in western Canada. As a lawyer ha bas
lait to the profession an inspiring example of
what can be done by a mai of ahility, energy
and industry. I arn happy that such men are
born in Cana-da. To spaak canrdidly, I was
sorry that hae werit to the Old Land. AIthougb
ha gave great service ovar there during tihe
war, I bava always faît that bis heart was in
this country. His genarous haquasts to educational institutions- in the Maritime Provinces
and in western Canada ara a proof of bis
keen interest in the life of tbis dominion.
I join with you, Mr. Leader of the governnient, in conveying ta bis surviving relatives
our appreciation of the graatness of bis
character and ability, and the contribution hae
bas made to our country.
Hon. A. MARCOTTE: Honourabla senrators, I arn sure you will not ha surprised at
my desire ta add a faw words to wbat already
bas been said. If honourabla sanators will
peruse the Parliarnantary Guide thay wîll sea
that I was the first man called ta the Senate
by our ex-Prima Minister. I arn grateful to
hirn hecausa hae gave me the opportunity to
coma into this group of men, of which 1 know
no bettar in this country-men witb whom 1
hava lived for the lsst sixteen yaars, and for
whose knowladge of affairs, honasty of purposa and fine work for the waliare of Canada,
I hava a great admiration.

SENATE
I have another reason for which to be
thankfui to the ex-Prime Minister. He revived for one section of the people of the
province of Saskatchewan a right which they
once had enjoyed, but of which they had been
deprived for a number of years--the rigbt of
representation.
I arn grateful for this, as
have been those persons whom. I have
represented.
A great deal bas been said about Lord
Bennett's ability as a lawyer and politician.
Ail over the country, in the press as well as
in the other place, bis ability as a lawyer,
statesman and politician bas been praised.
However, I want to say that very few persons
reaily knew Lord Bennett. It bas been said
that he was a man of strong will. Sureiy ne
man wouid have attained the position he d.id
if be werc not of strong will. It has also been
said that he ivas domineering in bis manner.
That is likely, because hie had a great ability
to do things and he did themn wben lie liked.
On the other band, if yeu thioughit you were
right ina certain matter, and stood up to hirn,
and later on you turned out to be righit, hie
wvas man cnough to say-as he did to mc on
severai occasions-"You were
right".*
Lord Bennett was a very fine man and I
know many instances of biis kindness to coinmon people. He gave, and lie gave mnuch. 1
arn going to relate one instance to show what
kind of a man be was. In 1928 1 happened to
be in bis office in Calgary. We were discussing
business when bis secretary came in and said
that a certain reverend gentleman wouid like
to sec him. An old gentleman whose face I shaîl
always remember came into the room. 1 wanted
to leave, but Mr. Bennett said, "No, the interview will be short". The old man entered the
room and started to taik. Mr. Bennett, with
that ability wbichi sane lawyers have, liidened
to what was said and at the same time husied
himself with the opening of letters and filing
this and that on his desk. The oid man said,
"Mr. Bennett, yeu know that we are in unfortunate circumstances; you know that our
church is necding this and that." Mr. Bennett
who as I say, was e.pening letters, suddenly
opened one in wbich I could sec a couple of
cheques. lHe said to the nid gentleman. "Go on
and tell me your stery. 1 arn listening to you."
In tbe meanwhiie hie was endorsing one of the
cheques. Then turned te the old man and
handed him the cheque. When the gentleman
saw the figures on the cheque hie exciaimed,
"Oh, Mr. Bennett!". That was ah bhe said.
Mr. Bennett repiied, "You .Iust go home and, be
happy; forget aIl about this, and do not mention it." That is an illustration of one of the
great virtues of the ex-Prime Minister; he

would give and give gladiy, and he would say:
"Do not mention, this. This is hetween you
and me-you who have received, and 1 who
arn fortunate enough to be able te give."
I bave on niy des], a letter whîich hce wrote
in answer to a telegram sent to him thanking
him for whnt be bad donc for the seidiers
during the war. It is to this effeet: "Do flot
ever-rate what I bave been doing. It was a
pleasure for me te beip our soldiers. 1 did
it with nîl my heart."
These incidents are characteristic of this
man who meant se much te Canada and to
the Empire.
Speaking as one called to this chamber by
the late Mr. Bennett 1 arn, as are other honourable senators called by him, forever
grateful.
Hon. A. B. COPP: ilonourable senators, I
regret that 1 was not in the chamber to hear
ail of the tributes paid te the late Viscount
Bennett. I do net hope to be able to add
anything te what bas been said about him,
and enîy risc on this occasion bccause he was
horn in my own province of New Brunswick,
flot far freim the locaiity whiere 1 was horn. I
did net have the picasure of meeting him
until we were eigliteen years of age and were
hoth attcn(hing the provincial Normai Sehooi
et Fredericton. In that 9ehool we formed a
inock îparliarncnt, in which lie ivas the leader
of one party and I the leader of the other.
There we workedi eut our difficulties in a very
pleasant manner. Following normai sehool
hoth Viscount Bennett and I taught sehool for
twe or tliree years, and I did flot meet him
agnin until I was attending Dalhousie Law
Seheol, wbere we spent two years together.
In that institution aise we organized a mock
parliament, be as leader of one side and I a8
leader opposite.
After graduation he opened an office and
carried on business for a short time in Chatiîam, îlot far humr where I resided in the
town of Sackville. Diîring that .period I bad
the epportunity of meeting him eniy once in
ceurt. The late Visceunt Bennett then went
te the West, and we aul know of what strides
hie made there, pelitically and in other fields.
I bad in mmnd at that time te go west; but
after serne consideration decided te remain
in my home tewn of Sackville.
In 1911 the late Viscount Bennett came ta
Ottawa as the representative of the city of
Calgary in the Huse of Cemmons; I came
bore in 1915, and we spent a number of years
tegether in, parliament.
1 do, net cite these eariy incidents te show
that I in any way kept pace with the honourable gentleman, but sim.ply that our endeav-

JULY 1, 1947
ours were along the samne lines. Duýring the
fifty-nine years I knew him, thougli we were
diametrically opposed politically, we remained
warm personal friends.
[t was always my regret -that the late
Viscount Bennett suffered sO seriously in the
loss of a number of members of his family. A
sister cied ini the city of Vancouver at a very
early age; another sister, Mrs. Herridge, a
eharming lady who was his hostess in Ottawa,
passed away in hier early years. She was a
student at Mount Allison, in my home town,
and I knew bier there as well as here. But
"the most unkindest eut of ail" was when two
of bis nephews were killed in battie within
three or four weeks of one another. These two
fine young men were fromn Sackville, and I
knew tbemn well. If I remember correctly, the
remaining member of bis family is a brother
who now resides in Sackville, and who also is
a friend of mine. To him I extend my sympatby publicly, as I bave alreacly done persanally. in the loss of a very distinguished
brother wbo made a great mark in the warld
and whose namne will ha remem-bered for inany
years to come.
I join with other bhonourable senators in
axpressing my sorrow at the loss of Viscount
iBennett. Though hie was flot a citizen of
Caneda when the "silver cord" was laosed, we
shall always look upon hiin as a Canadian.
Hon. L. M. GOUIN: HonourahIe senators,
befoÉa the grave of Lord Bennett we forget
our political differences. I wish to pay tribute
to lis memory as a great iawyer.
The first time I had the honour t0 meet
"R. B.", as bie was popularly known by al
mambers of the legal profession, bie was chairman of a eommittee on the administration of
justice at an annual meeting of the Canadian
Bar Association. A member of that coinmittee made some remnark eoncerning the
treatment of eriminals. H1e appeared to have
more sympathy for the criminals than for
their victime. TXhe chairmýan sprang to bis
feet and said that wbile it was quite proper
that punishment be administered in a bumane
way, it was most unwise to be sentimental in
dealing witb criminals. His remarks were
impromptu, but bis eloquence, literary taste
and wit imprassed me greatly. The late Lord
Bennett had great respect for tbe law and a
keen intarest in anytbing relating to the
administration of justice. The manner in
wbich hae spoke impressad me witb, bis sincerit-y
and broad knowledge of the subjct from. a
legal and practioal point of view. I congratulated himi after that first meeting, and whenever I bappened'to be travelling on the same
train witb bim, though 1 am by nature shy,
I always took it upon myself to shake bands

M03

witb him. 1 recaîl that bie would always
recognize me at once, and would talk for a
few minutes in a most charming way. He ws
sympathetie and frie.ndly at ail tîmes.
In conclusion 1 wish tu say that Viseount
Bennett was truly a good citizen and a good
Canadian. 11e was an ornament to the legal
brotberhood, and as a jurist his naine will live
for ever.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN: Honourable
senators, it was not my intention to add to
the tributes to the late Viseount Bennett, but
sinca Alberta bas been mentioned in eonnection with bis career 1 think tbat as a senatd»r
fromn that province I should say a few words.
My acquaintance with him started whan 'we
bofli entered the Legislature of Alberta after
the provincial general clection of 1909., We
resigned from the legisiature at tlic s'amne time,
and we botli wera elected to the flouse of
Commons in the dominion -election of 1911.
During our early days in Alberta we becama
close friands, and we so remained until hie left
Canada.
In Alberta while hie was active in provincial
affairs, aven bis strongest opponents and most
bitter crities--and tbey were man.y-greatly
admired bis ability. I regard himi as the most
dynamie political personality we ever had in
that province. He' brougbt famne upon thé
wliola province, in b-is early days as well as
aftarwards.
The late Viscount Bennett bad one eharacteristie of which I tbink most people in the
country were unaware. They tliought bie was
an ardent and narrow partisan, but I know of
occasions when lie displayed a marked streak
of independance.
Hie did not besitate ta
differ witli his own party, if hie fait that it was
in the wrong and hae was rigbt.
Those of us wbo live in Alberta bave pride
in flic faet that R. B. Bennett started his
polifical career in that province and that lie
went f0 a very high place in the counicils of
this country, of the Mother Country and of
the Empire. There is mourning today in
Alberta, not oniy among those who were bis
intimate personal friends, but also among the
larger number who knew him as a greaf
citizen of the province.
Hon. FELIX P. QUINN: Honourabla mcmbers, 1 do fiot intend to rapeat what bas
already bean said about the greatness of our'
former Prime Minister and leader of flic Conservative party, the late Viscount Bennett.
When the honourable gentleman fromn Ponteix
(Hon. Mr. Marcotte) was tailing of an occasion on which the tben Mr. Bennett interviewed a clergyman while at the samne fimne
attending f0 correspondance, I was rcmindcd

SENATE

504

of an incident that occurred in the House of
Commons which illustrates the great powers
of concentration possessed by Mr. Bennett.
The honourable gentleman fromn Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) may recali this incident.
One night wben an bonourable member was
speaking in tbe far left-band corner of the
chamber, Mr. Bennett, then Prime Minister,
was writing a letter and at the same time
carrying on a conversation witb the Minister
of Justice, the Honourable Hugli Gutbrie.
The member wbo had the floor was directing
many of bis remarks at the Prime Minister,
who he thought was not listening, and lie said,
"Mr. Speaker, I wisb the Prime Minister
would pay some attention." Mr. Bennett
looked up from tbe letter that lie was writing
and said, "I arn listening to every word you
are saying." After tbe member bad finished
bis speech, Mr. Bennett rose and replied in
detail, thereby showing that lie had in fact
been followîng the debate closely while
writing a letter and from time to time carrying on a conversation with bis desk-mate.
I join with tbose wbo bave already paid
respect to the late Vîscount Bennett. I can
say this: no more loyal imperialist ever
breatbed; and there neyer lived a man who
had a greater love for lis native land, Canada.
That is one of the finest trihutes that I or
anybody else could pay him.

DOMINION DAY
ETGHTIETH ANNIVERSARY
CONFEDERATION

0F

On tbe Orders of tbe Day:
Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, I wisb to remind the
bouse tbat today is Canada's birtbday. Eigbty
years ago tbe representatives of wbat are now
the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,
Quebec and Ontario agreed to tbe act of
union tbat hrougbt into being the Dominion
of Canada. From time to time otber areas
joîned tbe federation, until today the incorporated area of Canada embraces haîf a continent. The intervening period bas witnessed
many chianges. SlowIy but surely, both in
tbe years before and after confederation, tbe
people in tbe areas designated as Canada bave
not only acbieved, the status and dignity of
nationbood, but bave given ample evidence
of tbeir willingness to assumne correeponding
responsibilities.
Today, on ber eightieth birtbdýay, Canada
stands on tbe tbhresbold oîf great world events.
Tbe people witbin ber byorders represenit an
infinitesimal proportion of tbe world's peoples,
but occupy an area wbicb embraces a very
large proportion of thbe ear.tb's surface and
Canada's acbievements
natural resourees.
during the batthes for freedom and ber willingness to aid in rebuilding tbe war-sgbttered
economies -of hess fortunate parts of tbe world
bave gained for iber a position of prominence
and good will far out -of proportion to lier
population.
Tbis position -of prominence carnies not
only great responsibilities, but great opportunities. Two of those are uppermost in my
mind at tbe moment. Neyer before bas tbere
been sucb a desire on tbe part of millions .of
people to bring here their skills and their
energies to aid us in building an ever greater
Canada. Neyer were igo many people in Canada nnxious to bave people of good will come
te t[his country. Who is there aenong us who

JULY 1, 1947
can honestly say he believes that twelve
millions of people should conitinue indeflnitely
to occupy half a continent to the exclusion oif
others of good will, considering the resources
that need ta be developed, and, perliaps,
defended?
There is another great opportunity. The
econo-mie prosperity of Canada, bath in the
past and in the future, depends to a greater
extent than that of any other country in the
waorld on -tlhe revival and eontinued develapment of international trade. There is a greater
appreciatian on thbe part of worl opinion of
the desirability of removing the barriers to
thbe free-flowing cf international trade than
there lias ever been before. Our great
neighbour to -the south, long isolationist, in
matters of tracte, is now taking the lead in
thbe building of shattered world economies.
Sheer seif-preservation will demand that
at least the peuples of those areas of the world
who think and act as we do ohould unite for
their economnic weldare. Ail who unite will
benefit, but none more than Canad'a. Today
on our eîgbtieth birthday, with sa much ta
be proud of and thankful for, a Canadian
would be callous and indifferent indeed if lie
did not thrill st the prospect of the future.
Hon. JOHN T. HIAIG: Honaurable members,e 1 shail not delay you at any length.
Eighty years ago the Fathere of Confederation were faced- with great problems. Tlie
two old provinces *of Upper and Lower Canada
were at variance within themselves and with
each other. 'Phe provinces by the seh were
isot keen t/o come into confederation and,
after -they were brouglit in, remained for years
very restiess and uneasy. The passing of time
brouglit us ta the year 1914, when Canada took
part for the first time in a world war. In
earlier years she had been affected by other
disturbances, but none of t1hemn of great importance. Following the first Great War Canada's
place among the nations was acknowledged:
lier. contributions to victory entitied lier to
r ecagnition as a world power. The general
expectation following that war was t/bat we
should settle down to enjoy a lasting perCiod
of peace and prosperity. We littie knew that
wîthin twenty-five years we would be engaged
în a war of far greater scope and potentialjty
than the former one. Yet again Canada rose
to great heiglits, not only on the field of
battie, but through lier factories and wareho-uses, ber farms and lier homes.
Today it can be saîd without boasting tliat
Canada stands liiglier in the councils of t/be
nations than ever before. Only tlie ot/ler
day an-ambassador of one of tlie five great

powers called to pay respects to the leader
of our government, and 1 was invited ta be
present. H1e saidi, "I dû not want ta flatter
Canada, but t/le importance of your place
in thle world's cuneils i greater than you
people bave any idea of." In thle light of my
experience last year at the meeting of United
Nations, I was the more impressed witli
that statement. We live alongside one of the
great nations; and also we are part of a
commonwealth, a great organization of free
peoples whicli lias demonstrated its capacity
for co-operation in the cause of peace andi
international good will. U-pon ecd occasion
of crisis thbe Prime Minister of Canada, no
matter wli lie may bave been, lias risen ta
the occasion, made Canada's position clear,
and accepted ber responsibilities. I bave no
dbubt that wben we celebrate the /bundredth
anniversary of Canada's nationihood the Prime
Minister of the day will lie no Iess ready than
were bis predocessors to demonstrate Canada's
devotion to the principles ,of freedom and
religious liberty. Wc have in this country twd
great national streams, wliose relation t a cd
other is a proof ta the worid' that people of
varying languages and creede cau live side
by. side in uni ty; and tbe greatest contribution we can make to t/he settlement of
world problems is 'ta continue sa ta live, side
by side in barmony. Let us empliasize not the
differences whîcb exist, but the facts upon
whicli we are at one. Inspired by that spirit,
Canada enu rnake a contribution greater than
she made even on t/be field of bat tle or in thbe
sphere of indust/ry, great thougli those
achievements bave been.
1 bave mucli pleasure, in joining with the
leader of the governmcnt in formally rememnbering this annîversary. Personally, 1 did not
want tbe Senate ta sit on the first of July, but
in view of what is happening in another place
I did not pratest against sitting today. I arn
sure tbe gavernment leader feels as 1 do, that
we should have been blirougli ail aur business
before tbe first of July, and able to celebrate
this day at home.
In conclusion, may I express ta thie boys
and girls of aur land the liope that tliey will
make Canadà greater than she lias ever been.
We are faced with a world situation the like
of whicli was neyer known. Our responsibility
-far greater tlian aur numbers miglit suggest,.
far more important titan aur trading capacity,
aur industrial output, or the praductivity of
our farmns, aur mines and aur forests-is to
keep things internationally on an even keel'
so that 'the three or four great nations of-the
world, governing all their relations by a recog-

nition of the supreme value of freedom, maY
live in peace with the rest of us and with
each other.
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: I should like to
join with the leader of the governinent and
the leader of the opposition in what they have
uaid, not only about this anniversary, but
about our great country. I arn sure, honourable senators that those of you who were born
in Canada not only appreciate tbe addresses to
which we have listened but feel proud of your
citizenship in this great dominion. But perhaps those of us who were flot born here, but
who came to Canada to make homes and take
advantage of her great resources, are in an
even better position to reaIize the extent of
those resources and what they mean to us.
It is fine for us to come into this chamber
and culogize our country, but there are practical ways to show our loynlty to Canada and
the fact that we are part of the British Commonwealth of Nations. I was grieviously disappointed this morning when I came up to
Parliament llI from my hotel room to find
that not one flag was flying inside of the east
aind west gates cxcept the one on the Pence
Tower.
Honourable senators, I have been coming
to this parliament for some tbirty years and
I think I have been in Ottawa on practically
every Dominion Day durîng that period, but
this is the first time I have noticed what to
my mind is a very grave omission. We who
five here and know Canada realize that perhaps it is ot necessary to have fiags flyîng to
tell us that it is Dominion Day. However, if a
stranger from our great neighbour ýto the south
or from elsewhere were to come through our
gates today and sec the Union Jack flying from
every flagstaff on Parliament 1H11l lie would
realize that we in this country are proud of
being Canadians and part of the British.Commonwealth of Nations. I say this because I
was once a stranger wi'thin the gates of Canada myscîf.
.My honourable friend rcferred to the cnrly
trials and tribulations of this country when the
different provinces could not agree and when
confederat ion was being formed. In this
respect I say to honourable senators that we
who wcre flot born here but whto came nfter
the troubles were over, realize that we are
living in the grentest country ia the world,
and wc are indecd proud of it.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. L. M. GOUIN (Translation):- Honourable senators, it hnd flot been my intention
to add my own sentiments to those that have
already been expressed; yet, I cannot but feel

that on this, our National Day, it is only just
and proper that a French voice should be heard
in the Senate.
It must be remembered that if we are able
today te, commemorate the anniversary of
Confederatioýn, that if a nation was born in
1867, we owe it to Cartier, nmongst others,
and to my fellow compatriots of French
origin.
It can be truthfully said that the participation of French Canadians was both essential
and indispensable to achileve the unity of the
four contracting parties at the time the pact
of Confederation was signed. Undoubtedly,
others than ourselves have had a share in
the birth and growth of our nation, but we
played nevertheless a part that cannot, be
ignored. Such a role we have been playing
since the earl.iest beginnings of this country.
Indeed, our contribution to the devclopment
of Canada has been such that we feel justifled
in claiming that it should be more adequately
recognized than heretofore. I firmly believe
that the future of our country depends, above
all, upon mutual understanding and goodwil!
amongst its various racial groups. It bas
alwnys been my most carnest desire to sec
harmony reiga between French-speaking and
English-speaking Canadians. I amn also firm
in my conviction 'that the mensure in which
we shahl be granted full equality of treatment
will be a dominant factor in -achieving and
strcngthening national unity in Canada.
Within the framework of Confederation we,
Canadans of French origiýn, wish to, preserve
our language, our institutions and our rights.
XVe have but one native ]and: Canada, A
mari usque ad more, as embodied in our
national motto. Nowhere do we feel that
wc are strangers; cvc.rywhcrc we are aware
not only of our righ.ts but also of our duties
which we are glad to acknowledge and fulfil.
A mari us que ad more is a fine motto since
our country ocecupies haif of the northern
part of the Ncw World. Ours is an immense
country, n country that should have n larger
population, as the leader of the govcrnmcnt
(Hon. Mr. Robcrtso'n) said a moment ago.
It is a country where we are nnxious to se
establishcd the truc meaning of the ideal
of liberty, cqunlity and fraternity.
It is on this note of fraternity that I wish
to close my remarks.
(Text) :
Honourable senators, I felt that it was not
only my right but my duty tonight, on the
birthday annýiversary of our country, to say
a fcw words in. my mother tongue.
Somne hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

JULY 1, 1947
Hon. Mr. GOT-JIN: And thus to offer evidence here in the Senate of the presence of
the race to which 1 have the honour to belong.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: I thouglit that was
perhaps the best way to assert my faith in the
future of my country, because it is essentially
upon national unity that the destiny of our
beioved country depends. Canadians of al
origins and of different religious denominatiens mnust realize that we live indeecL in a
blessed country, a land, of brotherhood and
equality. We are ail Canadians and although
we who are of French origin are in a certain
sense different, we insist upon the fact that our
country is nlot on.ly Quebec but Canada as a
whole.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: We contend that
nowhere in the dominion are we strangers or
foreigners. We contend that everywhere we
have riglits, and that we also have duties,
which we are glad to acknowledge and fulfil.
I wîsh to conclude these irnperfect remarks
with a word of faith respecting the future of
Our country. I very sincerely believe that our
past is the guarantee of our future. Canada
is open to ail men of good will, and with the
increase of our population we shall be able
to play in the worid a part which will lie
satisfactory nlot only to ourselves, but which,
I arn absolutely convinced, will contribute
greatly to international peace. As lias been
said by the honourable leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig), it has*been proven that here in
Canada we are able to live at peace in spite
of our racial and religious differenees. So it is
that we look to the future, confident that
under the eye of God we shahl carry out the
mission which we received from our ancestors;
and we hope that when, our life la ended we
shahl have been worthy of those who preceded
US.
Hon. ATHANASE DAVID: Honourable
senators will admit, I arn sure, that I seldom
abuse the privilege that is mine of addressing
this house. Men of experience can learn littie
from their juniors; but there are occasions
when, in ahl modesty and humility, one must
put aside his ehyness to speak before sO
learned a body. This ia such an occasion.
It lias often been said, perhaps too often,
that Canada as a nation was born in 1867.
I believe in ail historical faithfulness that it
was born even when France dorninated the
country which is now Canada. One has only
to recail that when Wolfe made lis attack
on Canada the Canadian militia did not

507

co-operate with the French troops. The result
was that Montcalm waited in vain on the
Plains of Abraham for the corning of General
Vaudreuil. This shows that althougli less
than 10,000 people had corne frorn Old France,
and Canada was still under the Frenchi regîme,
a pure Canadian mentality was born. This
mentality asserted itself when the saal landowners, pioneers, and humble priests-the
poorest of the then colonists--knelt on the
soul and thanked God that they had corne to
Canada. Frorn that day forward Canada
Canadians of French deacent
developed.
grew in number frorn 6,5,000 in 1753 to more
than, six millions.
Honourable senators, would you be surprised if I were to tell you that sometimes,
due to faulty teaching of history, pre-judices
are born, and that such prejudices--not only
against one province-have lived? I do not
wish to return to the seed that I sowed in my
remarks of sorne two years ago. But one
must return to it some day. History cannot
be taught frorn one text book in one province
and frorn a different and contradictory text
book in another province.
Some .Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Honourable senators,
you in your provinces and we in ours often
talk, with ail sincerity, of unity. I arn frank to
say that I do not believe unity is possible.
Religions and languages may separate us, but
one thing, is possible-union. What Switzerland lias accornplished in the union of Germans, French and Italians, can be accomplished in Canada. It is possible to have
union of good will in the sincere Canadianismn
born of a Canadian mentality.
Honourable senators, did you not deplore,
as I did, the incident reported in -our newspapers ,some weeks ago respecting certain
immigrants who had corne to Canada? Those
people came here hecaýuse of poor conditions
in their own country, and we gave thern the
best we had; we accorded 'thern ahl the privileges of citizenship and deooracy. We hoped
that -they would become Canadians, and.brothers with us. The war .was over two yeurs,
yet an appeal was made for their return. Was
it made by their own country, or by another
country dorniinating their country? A thousand of ithese people in whom 'we had placed
our confidence had -not become Canadians in
heart, spirlit and soul.
Poes that not prove that something is
missing in this couiriry of ours? Does it not
show that we -fail to make our immigrants
mnembers of our oomxnunity? If I were not
fearful, of offending, 1 would say ýthat it la all

ôw

SENATE

very fiee to speak of nationhood and very
splendid to talk of unity. But how can we
attain that goal if we cannot show ta immigrants a flag that wilil be theirs, or teach
them a national anthem, sa that they may
become part af the history tibat suc>h symbols
represent.
1
crave
your
indulgence,
honourable
senators, ta say a few more words. We often
speak of immigration. I arn in favour of it,
provided that in 1947 and the yýears that
fallow an even more strict selection will be
made than in the past. One need not be an
eminent economist -or a highly skil'led diplomat ta observe what is going on in the world
today. Two systems are apposing each other.
Will -this situation go on forever? I suppose
only God knows. But the danger being visible
ta us, should we .tbrow open aur dýoors to
people wbcse records and ideas we have not
investigat-ed? We ail know Wthat is going on
at Washington today: in certain departments
there is being carried out what in other countries would be called a purge.
Al't'hough I arn in favour of ýwell-selected
immigration, and should like ta see our country's population increased by that metbod, I
amn better pleased by the increase that occurs
naturally witbin our own borders. I prefer
the persan who is barn wk-h the lave of
Canada in his heart ta the person who bas
bad to be taught tio 'love Canada.
Hon. Mr. VAILLANCOURT: In conclusion,
let us say with one voice: "O Canada, my
country, rny love! O Canada, mon pays, mes
amours!"
INCOME WAR TAX BILL
THIRD READING

On the Order:
Resuming the adjourned debate on the third
reading of Bill 269, au Act ta amend the Incarne
War Tax Act.
lion. Mr. MARCOTTE: Stand.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: 1 arn willing ta
accommodate my bonourable friend, but I
would point out that there will be a lot af
business on aur order paper tomorrow. The
debate was adj ourned over the week-end ta
accommodate my honourable friend, and I
sbould like him ta praceed naw, if passible.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: That would be perfectly satisfactory ta me, were it flot for the
fact that an honourable member who is not
present told me lie miglit wish ta speak when
the debate was resumed. I also notice that two
senatars wbo took quite a prominent part in
the discussion the other day are not in the
bouse. What I have ta say will concern thern,

so unless there is some abjection I would ask

that the debate be not resumed until tamarrow,
when fia doubt the hanaurable senatars whom
I have in mind will be present.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I always desire
ta accommodate an honourable senator, but I
must say frankly that I ar n ot much impressed witb the argument that somebody wbo
is nat here just now miglit want ta speak on
the measure tamarraw. The debate an the
motion for the third reading was adj ourned
until this evening, and a considerable number
of members have came here for the sitting,
some perbaps at considerable inconvenience
ta tbemselves. Aside from wbat bas been said
by the honourable gentleman from Ponteix
(Hon. Mr. Marcotte) I have had no intimation, nor, I believe, bas the government whip,
that anyone not present would like the debate
adjourned until tomorrow.
In the circumstances, I would ask rny bonourable friend ta
go abead naow, if at ail possible; and at the
conclusion of bis remarks if someone wishes
ta move adjourument of tbe debate, the Senate
will deai with the motion as it sees fit.
lion. ARTHUJR MARCOTTE: Honourable
senators, I was prepared on Friday, as I arn
tonight, ta raise some objection ta this bill,
especially ta section 2, but for two reasans it
would bave suited me better if the debate lad
not been resumed until tamorrow. In the firat
place, as I bave alrendy said, an honourable
member now absent is interested in the debate;
and in tbe second place, I arn expecting ta
receeive tomorrow n certain report whicb I
nc cd.
ilonourable senators will bave notieed tbat
the debate on Tbursday last related mostly
ta companies trying ta adjust themselvies ta
new circuinstances. But let us sec wbat section 2 does. It amend.s section 3 af the act by
addýing thereto the following as subsection Il:
Whiere a person lias, on or after the first day
of January, nineteen hundred and forty-seven,
reeei\e1 a security or other riglit wholly or
partially as or in lieu of payment of or otherwise in satisfaction of an interest, dividend or
other debt the amount of which would be included in co.mputing bis ýincarne if paid,
That is the first part of the new subsection.
It applies whcre an interest dividend or other
debt bas accrucd, and security in lieu thereof
bas been receivcd by a taxpayer. The subsection goes on ta say tbat in those
circumstances:
the value of the security or other riglit or the
applicable portion thereof shah, notwithstanding
tue form or legall effeet of the transaction, be
included in computing his incarne for the taxation year in wbieh it was received..

JULY 1, 1947
What dces that mean? I have looked over
the Income War Tax Act carefuily and I
cannot find a specific definition of "security";
so we have to take the general meaning of
the word. That the general meaning is
intended to be taken is indicated by the
wordis "or other riglit" after the word
4« ecurity".
So what the subsection says is,
that if you receive a security wholly or
partially in lieu of payment of a debt which
is not paid, but which if paid would be
included in computing your income, you
must include the value of that security w.hen
computing your income for the taxation year
in which the security was received. That
security may be in the form of a first mortgage, a chattel mortgage, shares in a corporation, or in some other form; but in whateverr
form. it is, you have to comnpute the value,
flot of the debt, but of that security. If you
converted the security into cash it would be
easy to state the value, but you do flot have
to convert it; and of course in some circumstances it would be impossible to find anyone
willing to pay cash for
some securities.
And I say, you have to include the value
oi the security ini computing your income
for the taxation year in which the security was
received. That section applies to securities
recejved on or after the first of January this
year. Let us suppose that in February a man
receivedý some security, some shares, in lieu of
payment of a debt of $250, Let us further
suppose that the shares are flot quoted on the
market and that he bas no certain knowledge
of their value. In. October they may be worth
$50. If the section said that the value of the
security to be shown as income should flot
exce-ed the amount of the debt, I would- have
no objection.. But it does flot say that, and
I do flot thjnk it is fair that the income tax
departrnent should get the benefit of taxation
on the difference between $250 and $500.
The last part of the subsection says.
and a payment in redemption of the security
or in satisfaction of the right shal flot be
deenmed to be income of the recipient in the year
of payment.
What does that mean? If you accept seurxty at a certain..period of the year, its value
is to be included as income; but if the security
is subsequ.ently redeemed at an amnount greater
than the deht, you cannot compute it as income
because the section states that it "shall flot be
deemed to be income of the recipient in the
year of payment." 1 understand, of course,
that in the framing of the clause. the Department of National Revenue had this in mind,
that if you do flot receive your income-your
dividend or whatever it is--it is because it is

509

impossible to get it. But suppose you do get
security in lieu of it, in that year, according
to the first part of this section, you are to
include the value as incomne, but under the
latter part of the same section you cannot class
it as income. There is something here which
1 cannot understand, and I do flot see why it
sliould flot be cleared. up in order that the
taxpayer will know where lie stando.
I souglit some information on this matter,
and it is evident that the clause lias application to the case of companies whicli are practicslly bankrupt and, désire to reorganize and
turn over their assets to, a new company to
ho, formed. It seems to me that the section
would be greatly clarified if "security" were
defined. That is wliy I wanted a further
explariation from the two lionourable senators
from Toronto, (Hon. Mr. Hayden and Hon.
Mr. Campbell) wlio opened the discussion the
otlier day. From tlieir remarks I gathered
that, as the section is framed, you do not
know wliere you stand; and if a lawyer does
not know, liow can the average taxpayer hope
to underistand it? It was, I believe, the idea,
of lionourable senator from De Lorimier (Hon.
Mr. Vien.') to have the discussion adjourned
and the bill returned to committee to enable
us to know wliere we stand. My point, if I
may reiterate it, is that if you accept something in payment of past due interest whicli
should have been classed as income, you have
to value and include as income tlie security
which is so accepted; but if in the same year
it is redeemed, the payment in redemptionis flot to he considiered, as income. Is it a
payment as principal? Wliere do we stand
on that question?
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: I would. ask the
honourable senator if the explanatory note in
paragraph 2 does flot clarify the matter, at
lcast to a certain extent. Supposing that
a company is in arrears of dividends and the
only way it can pay tliem is by an issue of new
stock, that new stock, it is quite clearly stated,
will be regarded as income and subject to
taxation. The note reads:
To give effeet to the first part of paragraph 9
of the resolution, which, as aniended, provided
"that funding securities received on- or after
January 1-,1947, in respect of an accrued right
to, interest, dividends or other payments of an
income nature . .. be taxable as income."
Ho n. Mr. MARCOTTE: I know tliat the
honourable senator is reading the note opposite the first page of the bull, but 1 do not
know wliether it is to be regarded as an
explanation of my difficulty. Here is the
question: interest is past due; if it were
paid it would be classified as income; if it is
flot paid, andi something is accepted in lieu

SENATE
of payment during that year it is to be classified as income. But its value may be far
greater than the amount it is intended to
satisfy; then who is getting the benefit? But
if, later in the same period, you sell that
security, it is not deemed to be income any
more. You see the contradiction? Here it is
income; there it is principal. Which conclusion is to be applicable to this section?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is not the intention clearly expressed in the last paragraph
on the page opposite page 1 of the bill? It
reads:
To remove uncertainty and to ensure that tax
is not imposed at the time of redemption of the
certificates, stock or shares mentioned but is
payable at the time of issue.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: No: If my honourable friend would read carefully section 2 he
would see that as it is drafted its meaning
is not clear. I understand very well what the
department has in view, but it is not phrased
to give effect to what is intended. That is my
objection to the clause as it stands. I could
understand it if it were so worded as to state,
upon the sale of a security which is accepted
in payment, the amount over and above the
interest would accrue to the taxpayer as
principal.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Do you think the
bill should be revised upon third reading?
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: In my opinion, it
should be, because its meaning is not clear.
1 think the clause should be revised or
rewritten so that one can understand it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The thought
which occurs to me is that the proper time to
have brought out and dealt with these points
was when the departmental officials were in
attendance before the committee. However,
there are two aspects of the question of
further consideration. First, I understand that
there is to be prepared and presented for the
consideration of the House a complete new
revision of the Income Tax Act.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: When?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: During this
session. It will not now be proceeded with,
but the minister announced that it would be
presented and that consideration could be
given to it. That is the first point. The
second point is that, should my honourable
friend wish to avail himself of information
from officials of the department, or to question them as to the meaning of this particular
measure, that is what our Finance Committee
is for. We refer to it all matters rising out of
legislation of this kind, and he would not be
precluded from asking officials who come

before it any questions which bear upon this
or indeed any other bill. But I would suggest
that no good purpose would be served at this
stage, when the committee has reported on
the bill, to refer it back to the committee and
reopen the whole matter. I would ask my
honourable friend to consider these points;
and perhaps the house would agree now to
give the bill third reading.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill as
amended was read the third time, and passed.
TOURIST TRAFFIC
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN moved concurrence in the third report of the Standing
Committee on Tourist Traffic.
He said: Honourable senators, this report
contains only a recommendation that the
Tourist Traffic Committee be authorized to
print some of the evidence adduced before it,
and when I submitted the report last Friday
I asked that consideration be held over until
the next sit'ting. I did so because some members of the committee felt that 1, as chairman, should review the tourist situation in
Canada and particularly tie it up with some
of the recommendations made by the committee a year ago.
Last session I made a statement which I
feel is worthy of repeating now: This is the
only legislative body that I know of in the
English-speaking world that has a Tourist
Traffic committee. The establishment of the
committee was due to the inspiration of our
colleague from Halifax (Hon. Mr. Dennis).
The committee made its investigations last
year and offered certain recommendations
basedt upon evidence from different sources,
particularly from the Director of Parks, and
other officials of the Parks Branch of the
Department of Mines and Resources, and the
Director'of the Canadian Travel Bureau.
In reviewing those recommendations and
applying them to the present tourist situation,
I may say that some of the most important
ones-those having to do with the development of the tourist industry-have not been
dealt with in the way that the committee had
hoped they would be. The committee learned
from the evidence that came before it this
year that the most striking and persisting
criticism from tourists visiting Canada is in
relation to our highways.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: It is said that
unless there is improvement in our highways,
tourist traffic will be discouraged. I agree
with that viewpoint and I want to illustrate

JULY 1, 1947
just what it means. Canada has spent some
48 million dollars on hier national parks. Until
modern highways came into existence there
was really only one park ini Canada that
attracted many tourists. That was Banff
NationalPark in the Rocky mountains, to
which tourists travelled by railway. Jasper
Park and some others which have been
developed in recent years are aiso accesible
by railway, but there is no direct railway connection with other new parks such as the one
in Prince Edward Island, the Cape Breton
Highlands Park, the Prince Albert National
Park ini Northern Saskatchewan, The Waterton
Lakes National Park in Southern. Albierta, and
the Riding Mounitain. Park in Manitoba, upon
whicli the government has expended a great
deal of moncy during recent years. Tourists
may travel to a railway station close to these
parks, but they have to use roads to get into
tliem. As the government bas spent 48 millions on our national parks it seems to me
oniy sensible that there sliould be established
a systematie, well-defined highway policy in
which the Dominion Govemument should
co-operate with the provinces. Unless such a
policy is devised, the movement of visitors
from the United States-our greatest source
of tourists-will bie discouraged, because they
are accustomed to travelling. over the very
best roade in the worid.
If a tourist coming into western. Canadathe part of the country with which I am most
familiar-enters the province of Saskatchewan
from the United States, lie will flot strike a
hard-surfaced road at al, certainiy not in the
vicinity of the Prince Albert National Park.
I would say that this is also true with respect
to tourists entering the province of Manitoba
from the United States.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: So tourists going
to these parks upon which the governiment lias
spent so mucli money are immediately discouraged. I think that if the Tourist Traffie
Committee continues its inquiry in future
years, it sliouid concentrate upon a study of
Canadian highways and their relation to the
development of tourist business througliout
the country.
There is constant agitation for a transCanada highway, and although there is a sort
of linking of the East and West it is not a
satisfaetory one. A friend, correspondent for
my newspaper, started out the other day from
Fort William to go to Winnipeg over the
highway that rune from northwestern, Ontario
into Manitoba. The experiences lie encountered
on that highway certainly would not encourage
many people to travel over it. He would have

511

had similar experiences in many parte of
Canada. I arn not advocating permanent, ailweather highways spread ail over every prove
ince, but there has to be a main-artery highwayï
running east and west, and some roads running
north and south, to l.ink up with the main
highways and to reacli our national parks.
Last week the committee asked the officiais
of the Parks Brandi and the head of the Canadian Travel Bureau about the criticisms that
tourists were making and, as I have saidi, the
main ones related to our higliways. Some
criticism was made of accommodation, not in
major hotels, but in the type of tourist facilities
known as cabin accommodation. It is not up
to the standard to whïch many American
tourists are accustomed. Across the line
tourists travel to camps where they get ail the
facilities of an apartment or a suite: of moms
in a hotel; running water, bathing facilities and
other modemn conveniences. We have few
cabinis of that kind in Canada, and our tourist
accommodetion should lie developed. along that
line. Naturally the excuse is offered, that, due
to the shortage of materiais and. the demand
for bouses, it is unlikeiy that this ad-ditionnal
and mueli-required accommodation can be
provided at present. However, 1 think it is
something upon which emphasis shouid be
piaced- so that when materiais are availabie
that type of accommodation wilI lie provided.
I am not certain whether honourable members of the Senate are aware of what the
tourist businees meant to Canada last year.
According to estîmates provided by the Bureau
of Ststistics, which I understand were prepared
in consultation with the Bank of Canada, the
amountspent by tourists here was $221,000,000..
That is biig business, and, can lie increased. It
shoulà lie encouragedt and developed. However,
in the judgment of the officiais wlio were heard
in committee, if Canada is to continue to
attract touriste ini iarger numbers eacli year, it
lias to eliminate the grounds for some of the
criticisms being made.
As I said, these
criticisms 'have 'been directed towards the
nature of our high.way system.
It miglit lie interesting to report ithat the
total number of touriste entering Canada last
year, aocording to these estimates, was
20,85,715, and that the number of automobiles entering at the various boundary
points was 5.216,206. The visitors to our
national parks last year totailed 992,745, a
figure wlàoh was not up to the higlicat in
pre-war times when the number was ovei' a
million. National parks are now epread ail
over the dominion. There are only two or
tliree provinces without them; and from some
of the views expressed in committee, I would

512

SENATE

imagine that these provinces are going to
agitate until they also have at least one
national park each. They have an attraction
for tourists that iscarcely exisits in any other
part of those provinces. My friend to my
right (Hon. Mr. MacLennan) will admit that
there is no greater attraction in the province
of Nova Scotia than the park on Cape Breton.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: The park is the
most attractive spot in the Dominion of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: I arn quite sure
that the bonourable senators from Prince
Ecbward Island would say that the national
park in that province is the most attractive
spot on the island. In the prairie provinces,
especially in Alberta, we have a number of
parks, but the mountain parks bave always
been most appealing.
My main purpose in speaking to the Senate
toniglit in support of this report is to refer
to the particular criticisms that came to the
attention of the committae this year. Wc
asked about the courtasy of the personnel in
restaurants, garages and service stations. and
were told that there was vary little criticism
in that direction. Complimentary reference
was made to tbe Customs and Immigration
officiais -at the border points. The most pronouneed and continuing criticism was of the
condition of our bigbways.
I can quite appreciate tbat criticism, tbough
Canada cannot be expected to compete in
that respect with the United, States with its
great wealth and ability to provide higbways.
Wa musit racognize, however, that tourists
from the United States are accustomed to
good higbxvays, and we should try to provide
at least one bighway diractly across the
dominion, and to improve some of the roads
leading to it, on whicbi so much money bas
already been spent.
I sbould mention the Canadian Travel
Bureau, as it is a faderai governmant institution operated under tbe Department, of
Trada and Commerce. The bureau is asking
this year for $650,000, the same amount it
asked for last year. Tbe bulk of tbat sum is
spent, on publicity in magazines and tbe press
of tbe United, States, and in pamphlets supplied to inquirers wbo bave followed tbe
adver!ising. The diraictor of tbe bureau gave
us sonma idea of tbe tourist movement for
this yrear. H1e said that in the first six months
something lika 160,000 inquiries ware received,
as comnparad witb a smnallar nunîber for the
twelve montbs of last year. Tbat was taken
to indicate a greater interest, in Canada by

people planning bolidays and motor trips, and
that we couIc! look for an expansion in tourist
business <turing tbis year.
The committea is asking t)he Senate to
concur in a request rfor the priinting okf a number of copies of ithe evidence given by an
official of the Parks department and the head
of the Caniadian Travel Bureau. These gentlemen reviawed the itourist traffie situation of
last, year and made observations in respect of
the complaints whidh I bave brought to the
,attention of the Sanate. The committee felt
thait the evidence should be published and distributed amongst t.hose interested i'n tbe promotion osf tourist, traffie.
The committea lust year recommenided cooperation bebween tbe dominion, the provinces and the transportation companies. Last
faîl a conference atended hy representatives
of the dominion, the provinces, the -transportation interests, and -bbc Parks department
was beld in Ottawa. The various represantatives conferred on tbe developmenit of tourist
traffie in an attempt to co-ordinate their
efforts and to prevent ovar-lapping in publirity and matters of tbat sort. That conference is to be a yearly avent. From the evidence given your comrimittea rwas of tbe opinion that it was a step in tbie rigbt direction.
Honourable senators, tbat is alI I wisb to
say on the subjeet, of tourist traffic. May I
empbiasiza ithat tbe committea is asking particularly for the approval of the publication
of the evidenca givan bafore it?
Tbe motion was agrced -to.

JULY 2, 1947
BEAM TRAWLERS IN NORTH
ATLANTIC
INQUIRY POSTPONED
On the inquiry of Hon. Mr. Duff:
Reliable information bas come to me from
different sources in the Maritime provinces
stating that United States fishing vessels, commonly called and known as beam trawlers, and
which are operating on the Grand Banks of
Newfoundland and other banks in the North
Atlantic, are fishing their trawls and hauling it
from the bottom to the ship some twenty times
per day, and dumping the fish from these trawls
on their decks, and culling out from these
catches the haddock which are in the nets and
throwing back into the Atlantic all the codfish
which are taken from these catches. The result
is that hundreds of tons of edible large and
medium codfish, in addition to small codfish
which are inedible on account of size, are
thrown back into the waters dead, with the
result that the grounds where these fish are
taken from become putrid and the fish leave the
grounds and go elsewhere.
Is the government alse aware that certain
foreign trawlers from France, Spain, etc., which
are capable of carrying three million pounds of
split salted each, are on the banks fishing and
are throwing into the water dead haddock,
either full of spawn or male fish?
ls the government also aware that crews of
Canadian beam trawlers are raking the Banks
with their trawls, and within the last fortnight
one of these boats, according to the story of the
captain, hauled during that voyage some seven
hundred thousand pounds of fish and threw back
into the water some four hundred thousand
pounds in a dazed or dead condition. bringing
te the market only three hundred thousand
pounds?

Is the government also aware that these beam
trawlers operated from different countries, but
vessels whose Canadian owners were encouraged
to build them by an outright gift of the federal
treasury of $165 per ton and/or from the provincial treasury of Nova Scotia by a loan
amounting to seventy thousand each. operated
on the fishing grounds of the North Atlantic
and hauled in their trawls thousands of mother

fish full of spawn; and as these fish are thin
and unmarketable in the fresh market, are
thrown back into the sea, dead. and tons of fish
spawn are shovelled through the scuppers?
Has the government, through the Fisheries
Department, heard about the destruction as
stated above, and what action are they ýtaking
to remedy the situation? If something drastic
is not done immediately the great North Atlantic fisheries wili be a thing of the past.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I would ask that
this inquiry stand. In doing se I may say te
the honourable senator from Lunenburg (Hon.
Mr. Duff) that I have net neglected the
matter, and I hope te have a reply tomorrow.
The inquiry stands.
TREATIES

OF PEACE WITH ITALY,

ROUMANIA, HUNGARY
FINLAND

AND

MOTION OF APPROVAL

Hon.

WISHART

moved:
83168-33J

McL.

ROBERTSON

That it is expedient that the bouses of parliament do approve the treaties of peace with
Italy, Roumania, Hungary, and Finland, signed
at Paris on February 10, 1947, and that this
house do approve the sanre.
He said: Honourable senators, the main
purpose of these treaties is to formally bring
te an end the state of war existing between
Italy, Hungary, Roumania and Finland on
the one hand and the Allied Powers on the
other. This step is necessary in the re-establishment of a peaceful world. In addition, the
treaties dispose of a number of political,
economic and military questions arising out
of the war.
It will be recalled, that these treaties in
draft form were first agreed upon by the
Council of Foreign Ministers, and were submitted te a peace conference in Paris lasting
from July 29 te October 15 of 1946. Canada
was one of the twenty-one nations invited to
take part in this conference, and the Canadian delegation was headed at first by the
Prime Minister, the Right Honourable W. L.

Mackenzie King, and later by the Minister of
National Defence, the Honourable Brooke
Claxton.
Although Canada's part in the drafting of
these treaties was confined te examination and
comment on their terms at the Paris Conference, and although an earlier and more
effective association with the great powers in
the task of drawing up the treaties would have
enabled Canada te present the views of this
country more strongly, it is probably fair te
say that under the circumstances the treaties
represent the best possible method of resolving
conflicting interests among the major allies.
The early coming into force of these treaties
is essential to any long-range planning for
the reconstruction of the economic life of
Europe.
Once the treaties have become
effective the armies of occupation will be
withdrawn from these states-except for a few
Russian troops which will be left in Roumania
and Hungary te maintain communication
lines with the Austrian occupation zoneand the states will become eligible for membership in the United Nations.
Following approval of the treaties by both
houses of parliament, a submission must be
made te the King asking for the execution by
His Majesty of instruments of ratification,
and before the treaties come into force these
instruments must be deposited as provided
for in the treaties. In any event, the treaties
will net come into force until certain of the
great powers have deposited their instruments
of ratification. This they have not yet done,
aithough . the United Kingdom, the United
States, and France have secured legislative.
approval of the treaties.

516

SENATE

Although the Canadian government is at
this time seeking parliamentary approval of
the treaties of peace, it is not anticipated that
its instrument of ratification will be deposited
until the great -powers have deposited theirs.
The texts of the various treat'ies and the
report of the Canadian delegation to the Paris
conference were tabled in the Senate some
time ago.
There is not much more that I can say.
I do not know that it is within our power to
change or in any way modify the terms of
these treaties; in fact, I think there is nothing
we can do but ratify them. However, some
honourable senators may wish to ask questions of persons who are bet-ter informed on
the malter than I am, and while perhaps
there would be no particular object in referring the treaties themselves to a committee, I
see no reason why their subject-mat-ter should
net be referred to our Committee on External
Relations. I may say it is contemplated that
if at all possible the External Relations Committees of both iouses will hold a private
meeting which at least the members of these
committees will be invited to attend, tihe idea
being that at qiseh a meting it rnigiht b possible to give information which could not be
disclosed under other circumstances. I can
assure members of our Committee on External Relations that if the meeting is called they
will receive an invitation to be present.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I understand that the
Prime Minister announced in another place
yesterday that all senators would be invited
to attend a meeting to be held next Tuesday
for the purpose of dealing with European
affairs.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: At 10.30.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Can the leader of the
government
tell us approximately what
number of Russian troops would be left in
Roumania and Hungary?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am not in a
position to give much information along that
line, and that is why I suggested a moment
ago tiat perhaps hionourable senators would
like to have the subject-matter of the treaties
referred to the Committee on External Relations, whiere the information might be forthcoming.
I read in the newspapers the statement
referred to by the honourable leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), that all senators
would be invited to a secrcet meeting, but I
have iad no official confirmation of this. However, I have already spoken te the Minister
of External Affairs and expressed to htim the

hope thsat whatever privileges are extended to
members of the House of Commons will be
extended alSo to members of the Senate.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
there is very little that need be said about
these treaties. They have been made by the
great powers and I sec no object in a reference to committee. As a Canadian, I regret
that the smaller powers were not alloved te
take part in the making of the treaties.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Hear, hear.
Hon, Mr. HAIG: True, if the smaller powers
had been present the treaties might not have
been different froim what they now are; but
tho participa tion of our reprcoentatives in
tie naking of the peace treaties after the
First Great War stimuilated our national pride
and created in this country a feeling that ve
were one of the nations of the world, and
should assume responsibilities as such. While
I am not a supporter of the government of
the dv. J am deeply disappointed that noither
our Prime Minister nor anyone representing
him was allowed to b pre -cnt at the conference wlien the treaties were drafted. We
liave a teonibility t tie world and wie have
clone our very best to disharge it. It msay be
tiat we made inistakes, thot in some instances
we should have atcd differenIy. but for a
countv of tie size and population of ours
we made a reallv gr<eat effort in ti
last
World War and in the first one.
On beialf of the party which I have ihe
honour to represent in this hiouse I wish to
express deep regret that Canada was net
allowed to he represented when the treaties
iere being drafted. I can blame only one
pover for tibi. I will not name it, for if I
did the press would criicize me; but everyone knows what power I have in mind. Our
exclusion because of being a small nation
was the reSult of a continued policy aimeci at
causing di-cord. I am sure tiat Canadian
delegates would lhave given a good account of
tiemclves at the peace conference, as other
tepre-entatives of Canada did on tise field of
battle.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I agree that tise treaties
should be confirmced. I am quite willing that
there should be a reference to committee, if
that is de-ired, but I can -ce no object in it.
The sooner we get peace, the better for all of
us.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
any difference in principle

I cannot detect
between my bon-

curable friend and myself. It will be remembered that the Prime Minister and other

JULY 2, 1947
representatives of Canada attended the conference; but the delegation was presented
with what were practically completed drafts
of treaties.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: They were not allowed t
attend the first conference.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The Prime Minister was present, but the contents of the
treaties were more or less determined without
consultation of Canada and the other small
powers. It will be recalled that the government of Canada took strong exception t this.
If honourable senators are willing, I would
suggest that the resolution be concurred in
and disposed of. But I still feel that there are
a number of questions which honourable senators may wish to have answerèd, and I for my
part would be glad to do anything I can to
facilitate a meeting of the Committee on
External Relations, if that is desired.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, may I say a word or two as to
the suggestion that these treaties or the subject-matter of them be referred te the Standing Committee on External Relations? As
the treaties have been adopted by the powers
and virtually approved by the United Nations,
the only object in having a reference to committee would be to secure information on the
conditions that now obtain in the countries
affected by the treaties. As we know, some of
the subsidiary powers concerned are today
living under conditions different from those
that existed when the treaties were agreed to
in Paris in 1946. However, if since 1946 a
change bas been indicated in the political
status of Bulgaria, Roumania and Poland, we
must recognize that fact and, regardless of
the political ideologies that have been adopted,
content ourselves with the United Nations'
great objective of working out peaceful and
harmonious relationships between all countries. From that point of view it might be
desirable to refer the treaties to the Committee on External Relations, and have the
benefit of all the information on the subject
that we can get from the department.
The motion was agreed to.
PROPOSED

REFERENCE TO COMMITTEE ON
EXTERNAL RELATIONS

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I should, however, like to add, in response to the question
of my honourable friend from Kingston that
when we know a little more about the meeting
which bas been referred to, the information
for which he asks may be forthcoming. As
far as I am concerned, although the resolution has been passed, I am quite willing to

517

facilitate the provision of an opportunity for
honourable senators to ask such questions as
they see fit.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I have no desire te
press the matter.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do not suggest
a formal reference to the Committee on
External Relations but that if the contemplated meeting should not afford honourable
senators an adequate opportunity to ask questions, the chairman of the committee should
arrange a meeting at which such questions
could be put and answered.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I add a word
to what the leader bas said? If it is agreed
to refer these treaties to the Standing Committee on External Relations, notice could
be given later. We would have a prospect,
at least, of a meeting of our own committee
to elucidate the points I have mentioned; and
in the light of the possibility of a general
meeting of 'both houses, which bas been proposed in the press, we would know that at
some time in our own committee we were
going to deal specifically with this problem.
A general meeting of a private nature may
deal with matters which cover a wholly
different field. I do not know what is in the
minds of those who propose that meeting,
except to give us up-to-date information about
the whole international situation.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: To clarify the
matter, I move:
That the draft treaties be referred to the
Standing Committee on External Relations.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The leader takes his own
course, and I am not objecting to it; but I
do not like to go through motions whieh have
no meaning. We have already adopted> a
resolution on this matter, and I believe the
present motion is out of order. I shall have
no objection to a meeting of the Committee
on External Relations; those who wish to
do so can attend and ask questions of the
minister or anybody else. I am not in favour
of referring a bill to a committee when we
have absolutely no power to strike out one
line or change one syllable; and I do not
approve of such a proceeding in the present
case. As I have said, I do not press the
objection; I simply do not think it is worth
while. But if by next Tuesday the position is
not satisfactory, we should call a meeting of
the Committee on External Relations and
invite the Secretary of State for External
Affairs and his advisers to present a statement
as to their policies. This course would serve
the purpose some honourable senators have
in mind, and it would not go out to the public

that we have referred a treaty to the committee althougi we are unable to change
anything in it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I always get into
difficulty with lawyers. The purpose of my
motion is to satisfy honourable senators whose
questions appear to be quite pertinent and
in order, but I am quite willing to have it
withdrawn.
My honourable friend from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) has kindly taken
charge of the bill to provide for Privileges and
Immunities in respect of the United Nations,
which could very well be referred to the
Committee on External Relations, and I am
sure that during the discussion of that bill in
committee, officials of the department will be
willing to answer any questions covering the
general subject matter of these peace treaties.
I am therefore prepared to withdraw my
motion.
The motion to refer was withdrawn.
INTERNATIONAL LABOUR
ORGANIZATION
MOTION TO APPROVE AMENDMENT
CONSTITUTION

OF

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have asked the
honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) to move the third motion appearng in my name.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK moved:
That it is expedient that the Houses of
Parliament do approve the instruient adopted
at Montreal on October 9. 1946, for the amendment of the constitution of the International
Labour Organization, and that this House (10
approve the saine.
He said: This motion is necessary largely
because of the transfer of authority over the
Internationai Labour Organization from the
League of Nations to the United Nations.
Speaking in another place, a distinguished
gentleman, who more than any other is
closely in toucli with this particular question,
plaecd the matter before the members there,
and a similar motion was adopted. He said:
Consequent on the dissolution of the League
of Nations and the entry of the International
Labour Organization into oflicial relationship
with the United Nations, it becane urgently
necessary to amend the articles of its constitution relating to nembership, financing and pro2edure for future amendiments. Therefore an
instrument for the aimendment of the constitution was adopted at the 1945 (Paris) session
if the International Labour Conference and was
subsequently accepted by the necessary rajority
if the
iember states, beconing effective on
September 26, 1946.

Canada's ratification was

authorized by order in council P.C. 2914 of
Julv 12. 1946.
At the Montreal session of the international
labour conference last fall, the new instrænient
of aimendinent now before us was unaninously

adopted and will corne into force when ratified
by two-tirds of the nienber counîtries including
five of the eight menibers of chief industrial
importance represented on the governing body
of the ILO. of which Canada is one.
This instrument is designed to remodel the
organization in the light of the experience

gained in over a quarter of a century and to
te-equip it to discharge its responsibilitics with
greater efficiency.
The most important of the proposed amiendnients are designed to encourage wider imuple-

coinstitutional difficulties in giving effect te the
provisions of tuany of these proposals, which

It requires the

I wish to s- thtat at the meeting of the United
Nations Organization la-t October and November tiis question came up in conjunction with
tte question of finance.
I iay explain lo honourable senators that
whien the Leagut of Nations was in existence
no control was maintained over its finances or
money acquired from the world in order to
carry on. The same condition existed in the
United Nations Organization, and Mr. Trygve
Lie, the Secretary-General, started an investigation into .the entire cost of the International Labour Organization as well as of
UNESCO and other world organizations.
When the inquiry was half completed the
Russian delegation and their satellites objected, and after a bitter debate lasting two
days it was agreed by a vote of thirty-seven
to four that Mr. Lie should continue his investigation and make a report this year to
the United Nations Organization as to the
over-all expenditure

of these

zations. As a result, the International Labour

FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. C. J. VENIOT (for Hon. Mr. Robertson) moved the second reading of Bill 264,
an Act to amend the Fisheries Research
Board Act.
He said: Honourable senators, before proceeding with the short explanation of this bill,
it might be appropriate to recall briefly to
your minds the set-up and functions of the
Fisheries Research Board.
Honourable senators will remember that the
Board was established by an act of parliament
in 1937 and was composed of two representatives from the Department of Fisheries, two
representatives from the Fisheries of the
Atlantie coast, two representatives from the
fishing industry of the Pacifie coast, and nine
scientists. According to the report of the
acting chairman on December 31, 1946, the
staff consisted of 78 scientists and 80 nonscientists-that is, technicians, office and
maintenance personnel, and so forth.
The Board has several research stations
located across Canada as follows: the Biological Station at Nanaimo, B.C.; the Fisheries
Experimental Station at Vancouver, B.C.; the
Central Fisheries Research Station at Winnipeg, Manitoba; the Gaspe Fisheries Experimental Station at Grande Riviere, Que.; the
Atlantic Biological Station at St. Andrews,
N.B.; the Atlantic Fisheries Experimental
Station at Halifax, N.S.; the Biological Substation at Allerslie, P.E.I., and the Biological
Sub-station at Chatham, N.B.
Section 6 of the present Act defines the
duties of the board as follows:
The board shall have charge of all Dominion
Fisheries Research stations in Canada, and
shaH have the conduct and control of the
investigations of practical and economie problems connected with marine and fresh water
fisheries, flora and fauna, and such other work
as may be assigned to it by the minister.

520

SENATE

The purpose of this bill is to amend the
Fisheries Research Board Act so as to strengthen the administration and increase the
efficiency of the board. The group of officials
to whom I have referred as composing the
board, m'eet once a year in Ottawa to elect
a chairman and a vice-chairman, and to map
out the programme for the several research
stations throughout the dominion during the
ensuing year.
In recent years the estimates for research
have been as high as $600,000. In view of this
scale of expenditure, it is felt that the work
of the board should be put under the continuous supervision of a permanent executive
director. The bill provides that the Governor
in Couneil shall designate one of the members appointed from the department ta the
board as executive director, and that he shall
also act as secretary of the board and perform
such administrative duties as the board with
the approval of the minister prescribes.
Heretofore only a chairman was elected
but last year the chairman was unable to
function, and was replaced by an acting chairman. The bill therefore makes provision for
the election of a vice-ehairman as well as a
chairman. It also clarifies the authority of the
board to engage scientific and technical personnel, and enables civil servants employed
by the board to retain their various rights
under the Civil Service Superannuation Act.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourable
gentleman a question? What was the value
last year of the commercial fish products of
each province across Canada?
Hon. Mr. VENIOT: Honourable senators,
I regret that I am not in a position to give
the information requested by the honourable
leader opposite.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN (St. Jean Baptiste):
May I ask the honourable gentleman if the
stations he has mentioned, such as those in
New Brunswick, in Manitoba and in British
Columbia, are owned by the Department of
Fisheries or by the provinces?
Hon. Mr. VENIOT: They are the property
of the Department of Fisheries with the exception of the one at Grande Riviere, in Gaspé
County, Quebec.
As honourable senators
know, the province of Quebec has its own
Department of Fisheries. I understand that
this station is run in co-operation by the
federal Department of Fisheries and the provincial Department of Fisheries.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, when shall the bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I suggest that the bill
be referred to the appropriate committee. For
educational purposes we ought to know the
value of fish products produced by the various
provinces.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I move that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on
Natural Resources.
The motion was agreed ta.
PRIVILEG'ES AND IMMUNITIES
(UNITED NATIONS) BILL
SECOND READING

Haon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT (for Hon.
Mr. Robertson) moved second reading of Bill
272, an Act to provide for Privileges and
Immunities in respect of the United Nations
and related international organizations.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
represents another set of implied obligations
incurred by this country when it became a
member oi the United Nations organization
and when both houses of parliament approved
the United Nations charter. The title of the
bill defines its purposes.
The bill relates to articles 104 and 105 of
the United Nations Charter.
Article 104
provides:
The organization shai] enjoy in the territory
of each of its members such legal capacity as
nay be necessary for the exercise of its funetions and the fuifilinent of its purposes.
The first clause of article 105 provides:
The organization shall enjoy in the territory
of each of its members such privileges and imiunities as are necessary for the fulfilment of
its purposes.

The third clause of article 105 reads:
The General Assembly may make recoinmendations with a view to deternining the
details of the application of paragraphs 1 and
2 of this article or may propose conventions to
the niembers of the United Nations for this
purpose.

In compliance with the third clause of
article 105, the General Assembly of the United
Nations in February of last year adopted a
convention on privileges and immunities. We
are now asked to give the Governor in Council
authority to declare the accession of Canada
to this convention.
The act will he known as the "Privileges
and Immunities
(United Nations) Act".
Honoumble senators are familiar with the
diplomatie immunitv which is enjoyed by

JULY 2, 1947
representatives of other countries housed in
the various legations and embassies in Canada.
Similarly, our representatives in other coun,
tries enjoy equal privileges.
I do not think it necessary to enumerate or
to embark on a discussion of the items
contained in the convention. They are clearly
set forth in eight articles in the bill.
My friends who have already attended
meetings of the Assembly of the United
Nations Organization realize full well what
these provisions amount to. For instance, my
friend the honourable leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig) attended the meeting in New York.
Under this convention, should ho attend the
assembly at a future date, he would have
immunity from personal arrest and detention
and fron the seizure of his personal
baggage,Hon. Mr. HAIG: I would need the former.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: -and in respect of
words spoken or written, and all acts done
in his capacity as a representative of this
country. He would have immunity from legal
process of every kind, and inviolability of all
papers and documents.
Hon. Mr. COPP: The honourable gentleman can "eut loose" the next time he attends
a United Nations meeting.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The United Nations
Charter, which we have adopted, provides for
privileges and immunities as set out in the
schedule to the bill, from which I have been
reading.
I think that after second reading it would
be useful to have the bill referred to the
Committee on External Relations, where
officials would be present to enlighten us
further.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: The bill is entitled,
"An Act to provide for privileges and immunities in respect of the United Nations and
Are
related international organizations."
these international organizations enumerated
in the convention?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: There is no hist
of the organizations. Affiliated organizations,
such as UNESCO, would be included.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Does my honourable
friend know how many nations are sigùatories
to the convention?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: All those taking
part in the United Nations Assembly meetings must have certificates of accession. The
convention explains just what is required.
Section 32, in the final article, says:
83168-34

521

Accession shall be effected by deposit of an
instrument with the Secretary-General of the
United Nations and the convention shall come
into force as regards each member on the date
of deposit of each instrument of accession.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: My point is that as
we are authorizing the Governor in Council
to extend privileges and immunities to international organizations, it might be well for
us to know just what organizations are
included.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I might venture this
statement, that delegates appointed by the
government to participate in various meetings
of the United Nations would be protected by
the convention appended to this bill.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: But we are also
authorizing the Governor in Council to extend
these privileges to representatives of other
countries.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The convention is
being submitted to every member of the
United Nations, but we have nothing to do
with its approval by any other country.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Are privileges and
immunities being granted to representatives
of every country that adopts the -convention?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: By adopting the
charter of the United Nations we undertook
to do that.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: If a country to
which we extend these privileges and immunities does not adopt the éonvention, will that
country extend the privileges and immunities
to our representatives?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I think so. Suppose
Brazil, for example, did not adopt the convention: I do not think that the privileges
and immunities of our representatives at any
United Nations meetings would be affected in
the slightest degree by that fact.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT (for Hon. Mr.
Robertson) moved that the bill be referred
to the Standing Committee on External
Relations.
The motion was agreed to.
VETERANS BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL LOANS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. BREWER ROBINSON (for Hon.
Mr. Robertson) moved the second reading of
Bill 396, an Act to anend the Veterans Business and Professional Loans Act.

EDITION
EEVISED

522

SENATE

He said: Honourable senators, the amendments contained in this bill are designed to
enable the act to be administered more
efficiently. I might point out that all veterans
who have received or are entitled to war
service gratuities are eligible for loans under
this act. A loan may be made by any chartered bank, on a sound business-like basis.
Application for a loan is made directly to a
bank, which submits it to the district officer
of the Department of Veterans Affairs for
approval.
When approval is given, the
administration of the loan comes under the
Department of Finance.
The purpose of the amendments is to extend
some provisions of the act and to correct
certain clerical errors. The act as at present
worded restricts business loans to veterans
in their own business, and the Department of
Justice felt that this prevented the making of
a loan to any veteran in a partnership. The
amendment in section 2 provides the same
right to a veteran in partnership as is enjoyed
by one who is the sole owner of a business.
Another amendment bas to do with collateral security, and would permit a veteran
to use personal as well as movable assets for
this purpose. Likewise, the bill gives the
veteran the privilege of using investments
already made as his one-third part of the loan.
Hitherto he has bad to provide this in cash.
For instance, this expenditure can be met by
the use of his war service gratuity, his
re-establishment credit, or his bonds. Further,
the banks are empowered to take security on
personal property in respect of which all or
part of the loan is to be expended.
I am informed that 2,200 oans of this
nature. totalling between three and a half
and four million dollars. have been already
made. It will be seen thiat the usefulness of
the bill in providing assistance on these lines
is very great. Persons desiring to enter business will receive this additional assistance,
although of course the banks are expected 'to
use the same discretion as they would exercise
in tie matter of loans to any other class of
citizen.
Briefly, the principle of the bill is embodied
in the amendments for the two purposes I
have explained, although there are certain corrections of a clerical nature. If honourable
senators .desire any ifurther information, it
would be advisable to send the bill to the
appropriate committee. I believe that it will
make the existing ac.t more workable, and put
its purpose into effect more fully and without
unnecessary delays.

Hon. Mr. COPP: With permission, at the

Hon. Mr. HORNER: There is some information I should like to get. Should not the
bill be referred to a committee?
Hon. Mr. COPP: The honourable senator
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig), to whom I spoke
about it, does not think so.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If it is the wish of the
honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner), I am willing to let it go to a
committee.
Hon. Mr. COPP: If that is his desire, I
will certainly so move.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Perhaps I can ask
some questions on the third reading.
Hon. Mr. COPP: The honourable senator
may do so.
CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS
MOTION

The Senate resumed from Thursday, June
19, the adjourned debate on the motion of the
Honourable Senator McDonald (Kings):
That, in view of the recent discoveries of
high-grade phosphate rock in the Saguenay
area in the province of Quebec, and of good
quality potash in the province of Saskatchewan,
the Dominion and Provincial governments confer with a view to taking prompt action to
have mines developed in order to make available to our farmers, at fair prices, these
high-grade cheimicals, vhich are necessary in
building up soils, and in the production of
naximnm crops. so that Canada may be selfsuflicient so far as requirements of chemical
fertilizers are concerned.
Hon. CYRILLE VAILLANCOURT: Honourble senators, I do not propose to set forth,
as our friend from Nova Scotia (Hon. Mr.
MeDonald, King's) has done, all the advantages accruing from the use of phosphates and
potash in increasing soil fertility. I will, however, emphasize the importance of these two
elements in agriculture. If we wish some of
our lands, which are being rapidly depleted,
to continue producing, we must sec to it that
the soil recovers its fertility.
Fertilizers, such as potash and phosphates,
are extremely valuable as far as soil improvement is concerned. They enable the raising
of crops which are two or three times as large
as those raised when ordinary fertilizers are
used. Farmers are aware of the value of
chemical fertilizers but are prevented from
using them by prohibitive prices.

523

JULY 2, 1947
The sale of potash, nitrogen and phosphates
is controlled by a single powerful world cartel.
I would advise each and every honourable
senator to read the report prepared by Mr.
McGregor, entitled "Canada and International
Cartels". If they read pages 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7,
they will be properly enlightened as to what
some international organizations can do or
prevent from being done. You can get this
report at -the Distribution Office. On page 2
we read:
International cartel arrangements affect a
number of Canada's leading imports, as well as
other products which, while not ranking as high
in value, are of importance from the viewpoint
of

health

or

industrial

efficiency. . . .

The

cartel agreement may allot the Canadian market
to certain groupa, as was done in the case of
fertilizer nitrogen and plate glass, by private
arrangement among the parties with no opportunity of decision by Canada as to the desirability of such allocation. Limitations may
also be put on the types of goods which are
permitted to be shipped to Canada and on the
use to which they may subsequently be put.
Not only may the direct cost of imports be
affected by the cartel but the export of manufactured goods for which the imports may connecessary materials may also he
stitute
influenced.
We have taken some examples of cartels in
this class to illustrate the effects of such
arrangements on our foreign trade and domestic
economy....
The first group of cartel arrangements to be
examined are those relating to fertilizers. Fertilizers rank among Canada's important imports
because they constitute essential supplies for
many types of agricultural production. The
three elenents which are usually added to the
soil to stimulate effective plant growth-nitrogen. phosphorus and potassium-may be combined in commercial fertilizers in varying proportions to suit the needs of the narticular
crop to which they are to be applied.
Then, on page 7:
Inquiries iAade by the Price Spreads Commission in 1934 revealed that the principal fertilizer manufacturera in central Canada at that
time w-ere also organized in a close association
which established uniform delivered prices for
each grade of fertilizer, regardless of the actual
freight cost from the mixing plant to the farm.
The Commission reported that "this monopolistic control of the market was further bulwarked by a policy. on the part of chemical
manufacturers and importers. of hindering the

of fertilizer business by co-onerative organizations has forced some modifications in the policies of the fertilizer manufacturers. but the
control over basic materials established by the
international cartel arrangements appears to
have continued until the outbreak of war.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Who are the members
of that cartel? Are they mentioned in the
report?
Hon. Mr. VAILLANCOURT: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Who are they? Are
there many.

Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Are the members of

'Hon. Mr. VAILLANCOURT: Yes, and it is
a very interesting report. It is not at all
surprising that some people should rebel
against
certain monopolies.
Corporations
behaving in such a manner are solely responsible for their own downfall. If capital is to
remain what it always should have beenhealthy, fair and reasonable-let it rid itself
of all such organizations, vicious and rotten
to the core as they are, with their multiple
tentacles; soulless combines capitalizing on
the hunger of mankind.
In order to put a stop to abuses, governments must do all that is within their power
to develop their own natural resources so that
every country, if not completely, may become
self-sufficient, or at least endowed with enough
means of production and defence to enable it
to put an end to these dangerous abuses.
There has been, for instance, some talk of
phosphate deposits in the Saguenay district.
I do not know what is the value of this recent
discovery, since research is not yet sufficiently
advanced. However, a short distance from
Ottawa, on the Lievre and Gatineau rivers,
there is an area approximately twenty-eight
miles long and twelve miles wide which contains fairly large deposits of apatite.
Early discoveries date back to 1829, quite
a long time ago, as honourable senators will
see. Early development goes as far back as
1875. Intensive mining operations were carried
out between 1878 and 1892. During those years
more than 260,000 tons of apatite, valued at
about 4 million dollars, were mined. In those
days 4 million dollars was a tidy little sum.
In the absence of a mill, the ore was exported
to Europe and the United States, where it
was used in the production of chemical fertilizers. A very small percentage was manufactured into superphosphate in Canada.
In 1890, following the discovery and development of large deposits in Florida and in the
State of Tennessee, Canadian mines were
forced to close down. Since that time, however, the Canadian production bas averaged

524

SENATE

around 800 tons a year. Quite a large amount
is obtained as a by-product of mining. The
complete current output is now processed at
the Electrie Reduction Company chemical
plant in Buckingham, where it is used in the
production of phosphate and phosphate compounds.
To make this industry more profitable would
require a more adequate programme of
development. Any incentive to expand the
industry is paralyzed by the fear of a reaction,
or even of strangulation by the cartels. The
dominion and provincial governments would
have to undertake field investigations to assess
the value of the mines or their development.
Core samples show the mines to consist of
high grade ore and, in the opinion of geologists
with whom we discussed this matter, it is most
probable that a more extensive development
would justify the building of a concentration
mill.
If the governments were to come to an
agreement designed to facilitate the development of the phosphorous deposits of Buckingham and Lake St. John and the potash
deposits of Saskatchewan, we could, with the
water power resources available, build a large
industry. We would then have an adequate
domestie supply of chemical fertilizers, thus
freeing ourselves from dependency upon
foreign sources, while at the same time we
would be in a position to increase very considerably the yield and fertility of our soils.
For these reasons, I am pleased to second
the motion of the honourable senator for
King's (Hon. Mr. McDonald).
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: May I ask the honourable senator a question? What is the date
of that report made by Mr. McGregor? Is it
a recent investigation?
Hon. Mr. VAILLANCOURT:
1945.

It

is dated

Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Was there any action
taken on that report? I suppose it recommends that prosecution should be taken.
Hon. Mr. VAILLANCOURT: It does not
recommend that prosecution be taken but it
recommends that something be done.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: And have any changes
been made by the government since that report
was made?
Hon. Mr. VAILLANCOURT:
not.

I am afraid

Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators,
I should like to add a word in support of
anything that can be donc to encourage the
governmnent to look into this matter and effect
further chemical research.

Considcring the vast cultivated land area
in this country, Canada lags far behind the
other countries of the world in the proper
study of fertilizers. It is now known that
our older soils, though they are capable of
growing grain, lack certain qualities that are
necessary for the health of human beings and
of animals. The land has detcriorated with
age. In the West I tqied Consolidated Smelter
fertilizer on several hundred acres, of land,
but I did not have any definite information
as to the proper amount and type of fertilizer
to use or the soil upon whieh to use it. I am
now of the opinion that had I put the fertilizer on irrigated land it would have been
of far greater benefit; certainly it would have
produced an additional growth of straw. It
was found that the use of fertilizer in dry
weather sometimes resulted in less grain. I
understand that a few years ago the University
of Saskatchewan, when using a smaller quantity, or possibly a different type of fertilizer
than I used, obtained increased grain produetion under certain conditions.
I do believe. lionourable senators, that
Canada lags far b)hind many otlier countries
of the world in chemical fertilizer research.
If cartels have been carrying on te the extent
mentioned, surel'y it is strange that the government ias taken no action on a report of
such a nature as the one referred to. I believe that the deposit in Saskatchewan will
be of immense value, and I am of the opinion
that witi proper information and research the
Consolidated Sme-ters project will be a valuable ene. It is a project that was forced upon
the company. As honourable renators will
recali, lie state of Washington took action
against the Consolidated Smelters because
snoke and fumes from the smelter were
destroying the fruit trees in that state.
Recently I was speaking to an employee of
Consolidated Smelters, and he told me that
since the manufacture of this fertilizer conmenced growth is taking place again and that
now there are no damage claims to be paid.
That is an illustration of what a splendid
thing this fertilizer is to the country.
I would urge the government to art in
this matter.
I cannot think of a more
valuable field for research and investigation.
It is my honest belief that the use of fertilizer
would bring many of the abandoned farms,
particularly in the provinces of Ontario and
Quebec to the samne high standard tiat they
mtaintained when flie land was first cleared.

JULY 2, 1947
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: May I ask the
honourable senator if he cannot send samples
of his soil to the Experimental Farm at
Indian Head and get the information he
requires?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: No doubt the
pamphlets sent out by the farm are available;
but facilities at Indian Head are not as
favourable as they would be, for instance, at
Saskatoon.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, I am not as well qualified to
speak on this subject as the honourable
senator from King's (Hon. Mr. McDonald)
and the honourable senator from Kennebec
(Hon. Mr. Viaillancourt), who have preceded
me. I should like, however, to associate
myself with what has been said, and to
suggest that we adopt the proposal of the
senator from King's (Hon. Mr. McDonald)
that this subject be referred to the Committee
on Natural 'Resources.
The whole question of the supply of
fertilizer for the improvement of agricultural
resources in Canada is important. It is also
necessary to consider the position of the
fertilizer industry in relation to the so-alled
international cartel. The recent war had
a disrupting effect upon the cartel, and I
should think it would be possible, through
certain government -officials resident here, to
inform ourselves as to the production of
potash and sulphate, and more particularly
as to prices.
During the early years of the war I had
the privilege of being a member of the subcommittee on Agricultural Reconstruction,
one of several committees working on the
subject of reconstruction during 1942 and
1943. As a member of that sub-committee
I travelled across this country and interviewed
represent'atives of departments of agriculture
of all the provinces. When the senator for
King's (Hon. Mr. McDonald) was Minister of
Agriculture in Nova Scotia I spent two interesting days with various officials of his department discussing some of the things that might
be done to make agriculture a more productive industry in the future than it has been
in the past.
The honourable senator from King's in his
speech referred to the so-called marsh land
area bordering the Bay of Fundy in Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick. This area comprises some 60,000 acres of fertile hay land
which has been somewhat deteriorated by the
inundation of salt water, with a consequent
necessity for diking. The sub-committee considered this problem, and later reported that
an expenditure of one million dollars would

525

greatly improve the productivity of that area.
I was told at the time that such a project as
was suggested depended upon co-operation
between the authorities of those two provinces
and those of the dominion. So far nothing
has been done. I think that project might
be undertaken by way of an example for the
benefit of the whole agricultural population
of Canada.
It is important for the Senate to consider
this phase of the relationship between fertilizer
and the development of agricultural wealth;
and full opportunity should be given for discussion before the Standing Committee on
Natural Resources.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBTEN (St. Jean Baptiste): Honourable senators, I agree with a
great deal of what has been said by the bonourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert). I regret, however, that this subject was not brought to the attention of the
Senate until a late stage in the session.
From the information given by the member who moved the resolution (Hon. Mr. McDonald) and the honourable gentleman from
Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) there is no
doubt that the production and sale of fertilizer have been controlled by a very vicions
cartel. In other words, the supply of fertilizer
needed to re-establish the areas in this country
which have been depleted by heavy cropping
has been con.trolled.
In western Canada because of big operations we have "mdned" our land more than
have the people in other parts of Canada; our
holdings are large and probably our agricultural activities are not as intense as in the
East. We are beginning, however, to realize
that unless we put something 'back into the
soil for what we have taken out by continued
cropping it will not be long before our land
will not produce what it should. I have tried
the fertilizer from Trail, British Columbia, on
my farm and have had better results and
earlier maturing crops as a result. We are not
as familiar as we sho'uld be with the benefits
of fertilizer in the growing of crops and on
the productivity of our lands.
Certain essential raw materials for fertilizers are available in this country; and if we
cannot escape the clutches of the cartels, the
state should assume the responsibility of producing this commodity which is so essential
to our agricultural lands.
The session is coming to a close, and any
investigation the Natural Resources Committee can make of this question will surely
be limited. If we cannot get the required
information at this session, I think we should

SENATE
go into the matter thoroughly at the earliest
opportunity next year, and advise the government, the farmers, and the people generally,
of the benefits of using fertilizer. I have no
objection to the subjeet-matter of this resolution being referred to committee, and will
do all I can to support it.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is the honourable gentleman making a motion?

consented to do so. Unfortunately I was
unable to communicate with him in time to
enable him to proceedi with the explanation
today. Therefore it is my intention to have
him proceed at the next sitting.
Under these circumstances I see no reason
why we should sit tomorrow. Consequently,
when the house rises today I am going to
move that it do stand adjourned until
Monday night at eight oclock.
As honourable members will recall reference
has been made to a special meeting of the
standing committee of both houses on external

INQUIRY

Hon. WILLIAM DUFF inquired of the
government:
Reliable information has come to me from
different sources in the Maritime provinces
stating that United States fishing vessels, cornmonly called and known as beam trawlers, and
which are operating on the Grand Banks of
Newfoundland, and other banks in the north
Atlantic, are fishing their trawls and hauling it
from the bottom to the ship some twenty times
per day, and dumping the fish from these trawls
on their decks and culling out from these catches
the haddock which are in the nets and throwing
back into the Atlantic all the codlish which are
taken from these catches. The result is that hundreds of tons of edible large and medium codfish
in addition to small eodfish which are inedible on
account of size, are thrown back into the waters
dead, with the result that the grounds where
these fish are taken from become putrid and the
fish leave the grounds and go elsewhere.
Is the government also aware that certain
foreign trawlers from France, Spain, etc., which
are capable of carrying three million pounds of
split salted each, are on the banks fishing and
are throwing into the water dead haddock,
either full of spawn or male fish?
Is the government also aware that crews of
Canadian beam trawlers are raking the Banks
with their trawls, and within the last fortnight
one of these boats, according to the story of
the captain, hauled during that voyage some
seven hundred thousand pounds of lIsh and
threw back into the water some four hundred
thousand pounds in a dazed or dead condition,
bringing to the market only three hundred
thousand pounds?
Is the government also aware that these beam
trawlers operating from different countries, but
vessels whose Canadian owners were encouraged
to build them by an outright gift of the federal
treasury of $165 per ton, and/or from the provincial treasury of Nova Scotia by a loan
amounting to seventy thousand each, operating
on the fishing grounds on the North Atlantic
and hauled in their trawls thousands of mother
fish full of spawn; and as these fish are thin
and unmarketable in the fresh market, are
thrown back into the sea, dead, and tons of fish
spawn are shovelled through the scuppers?
Has the government, through the Fisheries
Department, heard about the destruction as
stated above, and what action are they taking to
remedy the situation? If something drastie is
not done immediately the great north Atlantic
fisheries will be a thing of the past.

528

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The' answer to
the hionourable gentleman's inquiry is as
follow's:
The gevernment is aware that in recent
monthei, because of the decline in cod markets,
the nationals of some countries fishing in the
northwestern Atlantic banks have been limiting their ced landings. The govcrnment,
however, lbas no evidence of the destruction
of fi'sh or its alleged effeets.
The grounds of the northwestern Atlantic,
having been fishedi by nationals of other
counitries for generations, are of an internationial ebaracter.
At present thiere is no
international convention regulating the fishery
of these off-shore grounds.
1 bave handed a cepx' of this reply to the
honourable senator from Lunenburg (Hon.
Mr. Duif).
Hou. M\r. DUFF: Honourable senators, I
know I arn out of order in rising to comment
on the reply made by the bonourable leader
of the gov ernment to my inquiry in regard to
the very serious situation that exists in the
north Atlantic, but witb the permission of
the bouse I should like to tbank bim cordially for giving me tbis answer. My only
regret is tbat it is entircly inadequate; it doci
flot deal witbi the question that I raised. It
is about time there wvas a honse-clcaning in
the Department of Fisbcries. This reply must
have conre from that departmient. anti if this
is tbe best tbey can do, if tbev are flot more
interested in the maintenance of tbe grent
cod fisbing indtsstry in the Nortb Atlantic
than this indicates, tbev bad betftr get out
of business and let the wbiole thing go to
blazes.
INTERNATIONAL REFUGEE
ORGANIZATION
MOTION

On tbr notice of motion by Hon. Mr.
RobertsonIResolved, thiat it is expedient tbat tbe flouses
of Parliament do al)prove the Constitution of
the International Refugee Organization,' signed
at Flushing !Meadows. New York, on Deceîber
16, 1946, and that this lieuse do approve tbe
samne.
Hon. WISHART
MeL. ROBERTSON:
Honouirable senators, I bave asked the honourable senator from Cariboo (Hon. Mr.
Turge n) to move the motion which stands
in my name. Apart fromt my willingness to
sbnre the work. of the session among the
excellent talent that is available in tbis bouse,
my principal reason for asking tbe honourable
gentleman from Cariboo to make this motion
is that he was Canadian delegate to the speciai committee on refugees and displaced

persons wbîcb. met at London in April and
Mav of 1946. In June of that year the coinniittee reported te the Econornie and Social
Cotincil of the United Nations, and that body
set up a Coînmittîc on Finances of tbe International Refugee Organizatiuîî. The honourable gentleman frorn Cariboo was ebairman
of this committee. wbicb sat in London in
1946. In addition, hc wvas Canadian delegate
to the Commjttee on Reconstruction of
Deva.stated Areas, wvbicb met in the saine year.
Hon. GRAXY TURGEON: Honourable senators, I wi>1 tirest of aIl te expiess my appreciation te tbe leader of the government (Hon.
McI. Robertson) for entrusting to me the meving of tbe, resolution for approval of tbe constitution of the International Refugec Organization, and on bis bebaîf I now formally make
the miotions.
As I understand it te be tbe desire of the
bonourablc leader te give tbe bouse an opportunity ýte debate the resolution, if it secs fit,
I intend te take a little time and go into
seine detoil on the whele question of refugees.
The Gencral Assembly cf tbe United
Nations, meeting in London in February,
1916, passed a re..olution that, was the coinmiencement, of ail the international -work with
respect te n fugee., and displaced peîrsons. I
shai net rcad the wvbole resolution, but I
shahl place sonne ef its contents on the record.
It declarcd. among other tbings, tbat:
1. 'l'le probiemi ef refugees and displaced
penroîîs is international in scepe and nature.
2. 'No refugees or' dispiaeed persons shall be
coinpelled te reture te their ceîîntries of enigin
if, in conîplete freedom, they have finally and
detinitely expressed valid objections te repatriatien atter they bave received full knowledge ef
the facts, including adequate information fromn
the goveroments of thîcir countries ef enigin.
3. Tbe main task eeneerning displaced persens
hs te encourage and assist in eveny way possible
their carîx return te their ceuntries of enigin.
4. No action taken as a result of this resohutien shall be et sucb a character as te intertere
in any way with the surrender ami punishment
nf war cr-iminais. quhslings and traitrns in confornmîty w itli present or future international
arrangements or agreements,
5. Gernians being transfcrred te Gerînany
from other states or who fled te other states
from ailied treops do net fali under the action
ot this declaration.
Following tbat deciaration of the General
Asscmbly, tbe, Economie and Social Councîl
set up the cemmittee et twenty nations wbicb
wans refcnned te a moment age by the benourable leader, and tbat cemmittee sat at London.
At the beginning of the discussion the delegates were divided into twe gnoups, one of
wvbicbi took tue grorînd tbat there w'as ne difficuity in soiving tbe pnoblem concerning
nefugees and displaced pensons, because the

JULY 3, 1947
only thing necessary to do was to return them
to their countries of origin. Speaking officially
for Canada, as well as personally, I stated to
the committee that on no consideration whatever would Canada be a party to the compulsory return of any of these refugees and
displaced persons, except they were criminals,
quislings, or traitors, to their countries of origin.
Thýat was the general founidation of the
report from that contmittee to. the Eeonomic
and Social Counicil at New York. In the
meantime, on the -motion of the Canadian
delegate, two sub-committees were established.
One of these sub-committees, consisting of
fourteen nations, deait with the organization
and finance of the proposed International
Refugee Organization.
Permit me here to say a word of deep
appreciation of the help provided by the
Prime Minister, then head of the Department
of External Affairs, in the assistance of the
advisers made available to me as chief
Canadian delegate during the work of the
Conferences on Refugees and 1)isphaced
Persons. Mr. Riddell, of the Department of
External Aiffairs, and Mr. Gardon Blair, of
Sask.atchewan, a Rhodes seholar temporarily
attached to the department, did excellent
work in this advisory eapacity.
I feel that I should also go out of my way
to say some things today with which al1
honourable senators may not ag-reei, but whkch
in my opinion are important because of the
circumstances of the times. We have had
Many reports of terrifie disagreements at
international conferences. But I would recail
that when I was acting as chairman of the
sub-eommittee of fourteen. nations, including
the five big powers, dealing with organization
and finance, I had occasion to announice that
I wished my assistant to present a motion
to the committee as a matter of urgency,
because lie was leaving to, catch a train to
take a plane the next morniýng, and the meeting not only passed the motion immediately
and almost without discussion, but accorded
him a cordial farewell and a send-off. Further,
I will say at this point, what miglit be more
appropriately mentioned later in the diseussien-and this has been eloquently expressed
by both the leader of the government (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) and the -leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig).-that today Canada
hias a inagnificent standing ini the world, based
Iargely on the vigerous manner in which this
country carried on its war effort, and preeminently upon the sacrificing cou-rage of
the members of our armed forces. I can
remembher my feeling uf ernutienal pride at
some of these conferences, which I attended
on behaîf of Canada, upon hearing representa-

529

tives of European counitries inscribing on
the record of the proceedings endearing
references to the behaviour of Canadian
armed forces overseas, during and after the
war. It is because of the high standing which
oui nation enj oys that those who from tâme
to, time have represented us at international
conferences have been able to make some
headway.
We have made some headway with respect
to this International Refugee Organization.
The first conference occupied two months.
Although its course was marked by some
grave disagreements. When Canada made its
declaration of policy the delegate of Poland,
one of the countries of origin, rose and said
that Peland would not ask for the compulsory return of any of its refugees or displaced
persons, unless of course they were war criminals, quislings or traitors. It was because of
this compromise which was arrived at during
the original conference in London, that the
General Assembly, which met not long ago in
New York, was able to adopt what is now the
constitution of the proposed International
Refugee Organization. That constitution provides that it shall corne into effeet wben
fifteen nations have ratified it and when the
contributions of the ratifying states amount to
at least seventy-five per cent of the total
estimated cost of operational expenses, exclusive of large-scale resettiement operations, as
to which I shahl say a word later on. I arn
very glad to be able to tell you that twenty
nations, including Canada, have now signed or
are prepared to ratify this document, and
that the total o.f the contributions of these
nations now stands at between seventy-eight
and seventy-nine per cent.
On the last day of June, UNRRA and the
Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees,
which in the meantimne were handling this
whole prohlem of refugees and displaced persons, passed out of existence. When the
General Assembly at New York adopted the
constitution. they also approved an agreement
between a number of states to set up a
preparatory commission to deal with the
matter of refugees from the end of June until
the International Refugee Organization is
brought into being-as I hope it will be
within the next few days.
Canada's contribution, set by the Committee on Finances, will be 3-2 per cent of the
cost of administration, an estimated ameunt
of $4,800,000, and 3-5 per cent of ordinary
eperational expenses, which it is estimated Will
be $151,060,500. The total cost, to Canada per
year, therefore,
will he approximately
$5,300,000. The Committee on Finances of
the International Refugee Organization, to

SENATE

which, as was pointed out by the leader of the
government, Canada had the honour to provide the chairman, decided that the scale
would be based on national income and per
capita income; and we were instructed to pay
special consideration to the financial position
of countries which had suffered under enemy
occupation. If I may digress again for a
moment, I want to say that this principle did
not permit the Committee on Finances to
give any consideration to the United Kingdom, notwithstanding the heavy damage and
financial loss which that country sustained as
a result of air raids during the war, because
the terms of reference stipulated that special
consideration must be based on the financial
position of the countries which suffered under
ceny occupation.
Honourable senators, I have before me the
Charter of the United Nations, a document
with which you are all familiar. A few minutes
ago I spoke about the difference of opinion
concerning the attitude of nations towards
refugees and displaced persons. By a majority
vote Canada with other nations decided that
there would be no compulsory return of bona
fide refugees or displaced persons who are
not in any way war criminals, traitors or quislings. That placed a suprene responsibility
upon all nations taking this attitude including
Canada, the United States, and the United
I should like to say that in
Kingdom.
assuming such an attitude Canada and these
other countries adopted what is the basis and
foundation of the Charter of the United
Nations. The preamble of the Charter of the
United Nations says that the peoples of the
United Nations have determined ta re-affirm
fatith in fundamental huian rights and in the
dignity and worth of the human person. That
is the very foundation of the United Nations
Organization, and Canada is largely responsible for iaving that principle applied te the
problem of refugees and displaced persons.
But our responsibility does net end simply
by the putting into effect of this constitution,
nor with meeting our obligations by financial
contributions. We have a definite responsibility in dealing with reconstruction, and
naking certain that everything is done ta see
that the fundamental human rights, the dignitv and worth of human beings-which conCept we have applied to the refugees and
displaced persons-is given to them in as full
a measure as is humanly possible.
Ther honourable leader of the government
bas said. thiat in addition to working on the
committee dealing with refugees, I also had
the honour of representing Canatda at the
twenty-nation International Committee on the
Reconstruction of Devastated Areas. It is not

necessary to draw the attention of honourable
senators to the fact that there is a close
relationship between the problern of refugees
and the reconstruction of areas devastated by
the war.
I wish to make a further suggestion, but
I am rather afraid that some honourable senators vill net agree with it. First, I wisli to
say that I am speaking for myself and net
for the honourable leader of the government.
I make my recommendation as a. Canadian
and as a member of this ciamber of the
Canadian parlianient. I should like honourable senators to direct their thoughts for a
moment to two conferences of the Big Three
United Kingdom, the United States
-the
and the Soviet Union-which were held during the war at Yalta and Potsdam. Honourable senators will remember how much we
built upon these conferences and the declaratiens issued from then immediately following
the end of the war; but we are all liable to
lose sight of what these declarations implied.
At tiis very moment the world is in a horrible
condition, and today's newspapers are full of
stories of the failure of the Big Four with
respect to a proposal officially made b- the
Secretary
State
through
S.tates
United
Marshall. My proposal, whiclt is related to
the question of refugees, is designed to materially assist in the social and economie reconstruction of the European statçs.
I msentioned Poland. In the two declarations issuecd from Potsdam and the Crimean
conference, direct statoments wrre made relating to the nature of Polish government; the
Polish refugees, tlie holding of frce elections
in Poland, and the eastern and northwestern
boundaries of that country. At these two
conferences it was generally admitted talt the
new eastern boundary of Poland, running
along the Bug River, gave to Russia much of
the eastern part of Poland. an area which is
rich in agriculture and in the production of oil.
This fact was accepted in the declarations with
very little question. However, because the
Big Three powers making the declaration
wishied to consult the then newly-forned Polish government with regard to new northerly
and northwesterly frontiers of Poland, jr was
decided that this question would net be settied finally until the peace conference was
held. But the declamation issued after the
Yalta Conference stated definitely that there
must be an expansion of Polisi territory to
the west and northwest.
In naking m reconmcendation I am tltinking first of all of the refugees and, secondly, of
how

ite i, tlie need of help to bring about an

My
ecotnomic reconstruetion of Etrope.
purely personal reconmiendation is that the

JULY 3, 1947
western powers, especially the United Kingdom
and the United States of America, should now
declare that when the Peace Conference is considering the Polish western boundary question,
they will confirm -the declaration made at
Potsdam and Yalta, and that they will agree
to give to Poland that portion of old Germany
which Poland is now tentatively adtministering.
When in Europe, dealing with the reconstruction of devastated areas, I was in Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Upper Silesia district.
There, in what was Polish territory before the
last war, is to be found the production of coal,
steel and zinc; and there is the same kind of
production in that part of the Silesia district
which before the war was Germany. Therefore, the recommended expansion of Poland
will not bring about any change in the
economic systen of the district.
During the war six million Polish people
were killed. Since then Poland has lost all
that portion of her eastern territory which was
given to Russia, and hundreds of thousands
of Polish citizens have become refugees and
displaced, persons. Besides that, hundreds of
thousands of Poles have migrated westward
from the eastern, portion acquired by Russia
and found a home in the new western part of
Poland. Many of the Germans who were in the
eastern portion of old Poland have moved out.
I know there is some strength in the argument that in the last election the Polish
government did not permit free voting. But it
is not 'true thaýt the granting of the new
boundary in the west and northwest was based
upon free elections. Honourable senators can
readily understand that the refusal-if I .may
use that strong term-to hold free elections
might have an effect upon Poland's domestic
legislation and perhaps on her relations with
the rest of the world. But the question whether
the last elections were free or not free has not
the slightest effect on ,the question of what is
a just and proper turritorial boundary. The
two matters are not related. I have read many
arguments against approving the ex-tension of
these boundaries. I have read many arguments
aiso against having any relations whatever
with ýthe Polish government, because there are
some eommunists in it. Now, I must repeat
what I have said here on more than one
occasion, that in my opinion no one in all
Canada is more strongly opposed: to communism
than I am. I am ready to fight with all my
strength against communism in Canada; but
also I am desirous, as I know every senator
is, to live pe-acefully in the world, although I
have knowledge that the world contains men
and women who are opposed to my political,
economie and religious doctrines.

I know that a large percentage of the people
in Poland are Roman Catholics. The Tablet,
of London, said, "The church"-meaning of
course in this case the Catholie Church--"is
the truest reflection of the Polish spirit." I
agree with that. But I also agree with this
statement, which I saw in a recent newspaper:
L'Osservatore Romano, Vatican newspaper,
says that conflict between communism and western democracy is not inevitable, and that there
is room in the world for more than one way of
life.
The same newspaper quoted these words of
Pope Pius:
But for those who see things in the light of
divine order there is no doubt that even in the
gravest antagonisms of human and national interests there is always a place for peaceful
accommodations.
The conflict that is going at the present
moment is not only between doctrines, but
between states, and the source of much of
this confliet is eastern Europe. Honourable
senators will remember that long before there
w-as any communism in Russia, long before
any government was communistic in principle,
the Balkan States were called the "cockpit of
Europe". For many generations the eyes of
the world have been directed to that part of
eastern Europe, as men wondered what might
happen there. For at least two hundred
years, long before there was any communism,
Poland has suffered from the lustful activities
of its neighbours. From time to time she has
been partitioned. We all remember the words
of the English poet on the death in battle of
one of Poland's leaders:
And Freedom shrieked as Kosciusko feU!
I would ask honourable senators to try to
realize what must be the feelings of the people
of Poland and surrounding states today after
vhat they suffered during the last war. These
countries had a heavy loss of young lives, as
we did, but in addition they were subjected
to terrible devastation. Some of us have seen
it. It is only natural that the suffering caused
by the war should have a direct bearing upon
the refugee question. The reaction on the
part of many of these people who have
endured so much is to flee to new conditions.
My feeling is that if the western democracies could make it known that they will support the present northern and western boundaries of Poland, the immediate emotional
reaction would be of direct benefit to the
world and particularly to the democratic
countries themselves. 'Realizing the differences of opinion that there were at the
Special Committee on ERefugees and Displaced
Persons between myself, as Canadian delegate, and delegates from Poland and other

countries concerning
fundamental
human
rights of these refugees and displaced persons, and realizing also the gracious manner
in which Poland, among other countries,
accepted our policies and permitted us to
reach the situation where the International
Refugee Organization was actually brought
into being, it is with much pleasure that I
take the liberty of suggesting through this
honourable body that when the Peace Treaty
is under consideration the western powers,
especially the United Kingdom and the United
States, should make a declaration that
they intend to support Poland's new western
boundaries.
I thank you, honourable senators, for the
courteous way in whoch you have listened to
me.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: For the sake of the
record, I think "Poland" should, be changed
to "Russia".
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Perhaps
one other word is required at the close of the
eloquent and forceful address to which we
have just listened. As I drank in the words of
the speaker, it struck me that Canada had a
very creditable representative on the occasions
to which my friend referred.
The one remark which I should like to make
is with reference to the standing which Canada
has acquired among the nations of the world.
The honourable senator attributed that standing, in the first place, to the accomplishments
of the Canadian people in the last war, and to
the courage and good nature of our Canadian
soldiers, which popularized thenm in all the
countries in which they operated. With this
sentiment I hcartily agree; but I am sure
my honourable friend will allow me to add
one further point, because I am satisfied that
it was in his mind. I do not wish to detract
from what he has said, but to add to it.
I should like to refer to the personality of
the Prime Minister, and the effect which he
has bad on the reputation of Canade in the
states abroad. I say this, not from a political
standpoint, although we belong to the same
political party, but because I feel impelled,
here among ourselves, to recognize the greatness of our own statesmen. Due, perhaps, to
the old aphorism that a prophet is not recognized in his own country, we in Canada have
developed the habit of neglecting the tribute
which is due to our own statesmen; and it has
become the custom to make slighting remarks
about those at the head of public affairs,
particularly, the Prime Minister. It is light
stuff, wbich does net mean anything; but I do
not think I should allow this opportunity to
pass of paying a deserved tribute to the

Prime Minister. It is my belief, and I have
evidence of it, that when people abroad think
of Canada they visualize this nation in the
person of our Prime Minister-and they do
it in a most kindly spirit. They recognize
his long standing as a statesman of Canada;
they admire his wiSdom. his patience, his skill
in both negotiation and debate. and bis general
good will to all mankind. We have had our
Macdonald, our Borden, our Laurier and our
King. It would bo invidious to compare them;
all have contributed to the greatness of
Canada; but none has contributed more to
the economie, military and political standing
of this country, none has gone further in
carrying Canada forward in the matter of
economie standards, and, virtually to independence, than has the present Prime Minister of
Canada.
The motion was agreed to.

OLD AGE PENSIONS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK (for Hon.
Mr. Robertson) mqved the second reading of
Bill 339, an Act to amend the Old Age
Pensions Act.

SENATE
He said: Honourable senators, the leader of
the government bas kindly honoured me with
the request that I move second reading of
this bill, and, as far as I can, to give the
reasons why the bill should bu carried in this
house.
No task could be more acceptable to one
with my attitude towards his fellow man than
that of moving the second reading of a bill
for the purpose of extending the benefits of
old age pensions in the various provinces of
Canada. On the grounds of sympathy and
justice, I submit, the care of the aged in our
country comes high, if not first in the list of
social obligations. A fellow-feeling, honourable senators, makes us wondrous kind. We
are all growing older; we grow older from the
day we are born. We must all look forward
to the time when our earning power has
passed and we must seek our means of existence from some source other than our own
unaided exertions. That is the course of
nature. Old age comes upon us all, if we are
fortunate to live long enough, and all of us
hope to avoid the tragedy of an age of
penury. No prospect could be more dismal.
Such a fate is indeed unjust for men and
womîen who have reached the age status of
senior citizens, and who by long years of
labour and activity have contributed to the
wealth of the country at least sufficient to
entitle them to live out their allotted span
in rcasonable comfort. These elder men and
women stand first, in my judgment, among
those for whom the state should extend its
care.
It was sentiments such as these that moved
the House of Commons and stirred the enotions of its members when, in 1924, on the
motion of the gentleman who is now the
Prime Minister of Canada, a special conmittee was appointed to inquire into an old
age pension system for this countrv. The
resolution recommended that the co-operation
of the provincial governments bu sought,
and this, of course, was done. The special
commoitte was appointed on May 1, 1925,
and on June 16 of that year it reported
recomnending the establishment of a system
of old age pensions to be carried out in
co-eoperation with the provinces.
In 1926, while the present prime minister
was still the prime minister of Canada and
there was a Liberal administration in office,
the first old age pens-ion bill was introduced.
I rrcall-I do not know tbat J should say
with regrot-that this measure produced a
prolonged debate and thorough criticism by
the Conservative opposition of that time in
the lower house; but it was passed there and
sent to the Senate, where it was defeated by

a Conservative majority. Honourable senators will recall that there were some exceedingly interesting doings politically in the
year 1926. After the general election took
place, when the Right Honourable W. L.
Mackenzie King again found himself in office,
his administration immediately reintroduced
the ident-ical old age pension bill which had
been defeated in the previous session. After
a great deal of discussion and the expression
of a good many doubts, the bill passed both
houses, and received Royal Assent on March
31, 1927. That act of 1927 is substantially the
act whichi today is on the statute books and
amendments to which we are considering this
evening.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Have any substantial
changes been made in the act since 1927?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Would the honourable
senator outdine them for us?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I intend to review
the history and explain it fairly thoroughly.
To trace the act, its history, its amendments,
its present content and the changes which are
proposed is the task-an acceptable though
difficult one-which I am attempting to perforn. My honourable friend asks whether
thiere bave been changes.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Substantial changes.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I shall leave it to
my fehlow members to judge how substantial
the changes nay be, if ithey will permit me
to state what they are. The most notable
difference between the act as it stands, and
the act of 1927, is in the proportions of the
cost borne by the dominion government and
by the provincial governments. As the act
originally stood, the Governor in Council was
authorized to enter into an agreement with
any province to repay one-half of the net
sum paid out by the province for pensions by
virtue of a provincial statute in that regard
in conformity with the dominion act and the
dominion regulations.
The topic of old age pensions is a very live
one, and an interesting feature of the act is the
conditions of entitlemnent to pension. They
nrovided ihat the individual must be:
(1) a British subject, or a widow who was
suth before lier niarriage;
(2) ias attained the age of 70 years;
(3) bas residod in Canada for 20 years
imniediately preceding;
(4) bas resided in the province in which
application is made for the five years
immeot diately prcceding;

JULY 7, 1947
(5) is not an, Indian as defined by the
Indian Act;
(6) is not in receipt of an income of as
much as $365 a year,-a dollar a day
Honourable senators will recall that in purchasing power a dollar a day was a larger sum
then than it is now. The seventh and last
condition was that the individual:
(7) has not made a voluntary assignment
or transfer of property for the purpose
of qualifying for a pension under the
act.
Those were the conditions. The maximum
pension allowed was $240 per year, which the
good mathematicians who are so kindly listening to me will realize is $20 a month. This
was subject to reduction by the amount of
income received by the pensioner in excess of
$125 per year. I am speaking slowly because
it is difficult to folilow these complicated
arrangements.
The pensioner was allowed
$125 per year, and if he received more than
that, the excess was deducted from the
pension.
If the pensioner lived in his own house and
he transferred his interest in it to the pension
authority, then the value of his house was not
deducted from the amount of the pension,
but the pension payments constituted a lien
on the house and the pension authority was
entitled to recover the amount of these payments out of the estate on the death of the
pensioner. There was an exception to that
rule in the case of property passing from one
pensioner to another. This was nat levied
upon.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: D.oes the honourable
senator know of any instance where the section has been acted upon?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes. I cannot name
any, but by reason of my experience over the
years, through a somewhat loose connection
with this administration, I am quite sure that
it has been acted upon many times.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Not that I wish it acted
upon; but I thought it was a dead letter.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I think that was
mostly the fact in the case of married people,
both being pensioners.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That was provided
for in the act.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: It applied mostly in
those cases.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I have just said that
if any property passed from one pensioner to
another, then it was not levied upon. The
provision is, in a way, so vicious and could

535

be applied so cruelly, that I believe the
pension authorities have been as kind as it
was possible for them to be under the act.
In this respect I should not be surprised if
they sometimes held a telescope to the blind
eye when looking for an opportunity to
recover money for the Crown. I give them
credit for that.
I have said that there was no levy on
property that passed from one pensioner to
another. Neither is there a levy when the
property passes from someone who has contributed regularly during the last three years
of the life of a pensioner an amount which,
under all the circumstances-including those
of the contributor as well as those of the
pensioner-are considered reasonable by the
pension authorities. That very wide and
indefinite provision in the interests of
humanity has at times, I suppose, been stressed
to its very limit. The pension authority was
authorized to recover from the estates of
others than those I have enumerated.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN:

Not in all the

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: They may not have
done it, but "under this act they were
authorized to do it.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: But they did not
do it-not in the province of Nova Scotia.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Well, I give them
credit for that.
Hon. Mr. LEGER:
eliminate that section?

Why

do

they not

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I should like to see
it eliminated, and as I continue I shall express
my views in that regard.
I think I have now pretty well indicated
my viewpoint, but I wish to recall to the
minds of honourable senators the outstanding
features that I have already mentioned:
(1) That the Act provided for a pension of
$240 per year or $20 per month;
(2) That it was payable only to those without income of as much as $365 or $1.00
per day, and for those of lesser income
was to be reduced proportionately by
the amount which the income exceeded
$125 per year. This is the much criticized and condemned "means test", and
(3) The pension was recoverable out of the
estate of the pensioner with the exceptions I have enumerated.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Did the federal
government get a share of that money which
was recovered?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes, in propotion
to the amount contributed to the pension.
It was reported by the province to the dominion pension authorities and was deducted
from the amount which the dominion treasury
was required to pay to the province quarterly
in accordance with provincial reports of the
amount of money paid out.
Of course, it took some time for an act of
this kind to get into full operation, and some
of the provinces were tardy in taking advantage of the benefits which the act provided
for their citizens. Quebec and New Brunswick, and I think Prince Edward Island, as
well, thougl I am not sure of this, did not
corne into the scheme until as late as 1936;
but since that time the act has been in full
operation in all the provinces and in the
Northwest Territories.
During the first year the act cost the
dominion government the inconsiderable sum
of $131,000. By 1931-1932 the amount had

risen to $10,000,000 a year; by 1941-1942 it
Lad still further risen to S28,000,000; and in
The estimated
1946-47 it was $42,000,000.
cost for this fiscal year, 1947-48, is $48,000,000.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: That is, if this measure
carries?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No. If this mcasure
carries, the amount which we shall expend in
the year following its commencement will be
$68,000,000.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Is that the total or just
our share?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is our share
only.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR:
$68,000,000 in what year?

The

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The first year after
this measure becomes effective. The amount
for the current fiscal year, 1947-48, is estimated at $48,000,000. It is provided that this
measure shall corne into effect on proclamation by the Governor in Council, so I suppose we should' consider the bill as coming
into operation next year, by which time the
cost will be, as estimated, $68,000,000 which
is $20,000,000 more than the estimated cost if
the bill is not carried.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN:

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The figures I am
giving are the totals.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I mean, the total
cost for the provinces and the dominion.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I have not got the
figures tabulated in that way.

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN:
have interrupted my friend.

I am sorry to

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I do not mind; I
like to answer questions as we go. This is not
a gun that I am shooting off; we are just
having a discussion.
The cost to the provinces last year, according to their reports, was approximately
315,000,000, in addition to their supplements.
I shall be mentioning the provinces later on,
and perhaps can give the details a little more
fully then.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: They pay the cost of
administration, do they not?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes. The $15,000,000 that I have mentioned is inclusive of
administration, but not of supplements.
Hon. Mr. McKEEN: It was reported in
another place that the cost to the federal
government last year was $70,000,000, and that
this measure would cost an additional $20,000,000, making a total of $90,000,000. Is that
right?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No, that is not in
accordance with what my study of the figures
shows.
Hon. Mr. McKEEN: Those figures were
given by the Parliamentary Assistant to the
Minister of Finance.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The Parliamentary
Assistant to the Minister of Finance placed on
the record in another place a statement in
which he forecast the expenditure in coming
years. It is fairly generally believed, on very
good authority, that the average age of our
population is increasing and that the proportion of old people is becoming greater year
by year. The statement tabled by the Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Finance
showed the estimated growth from year to
vear. I have the statement, but it is net in
my hand.
Hon. Mr. McKEEN: The statement I read
was that we were already spending $70,000,000.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Well, that could not
have been right, because the estimated cost for
the fiscal year 1947-48 is $48,000,000.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: That larger figure may
be right, if it includes the contribution by the
provinces.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes. If you add the
expenditure of some $15,000,000 by the provinces it would make my honourable friend's
figure fairly accurate.
I was asked how much this act had cost in
the years that have gone by. The total contribution of the dominion government since

JULY 7, 1947
the inception of the act up to the 31st of
December, 1945, the last date for which figures
are given in the Canada Year Book, was
$369,489,000. That is for old age pensions
alone, not including pensions for the blind.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: That is our share?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes, for old age
pensions alone. To find the total cost up to
the end of 1946, I suppose you would only
have to add $42,000,000.
The honourable the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) asked me if the Old Age
Pensions Act had been amended from time to
time. In 1931 parliaient changed the ratio
of the cost to be borne by the respective
jurisdictions. As I have said, up to that time
the net cost bad been shared equally between
the dominion and the provinces, the provinces
paying for the administration in addition; but
after the amendment of 1931 the dominion
assumed 75 per cent of the cost, leaving the
provinces to pay 25 per cent, plus their cost
of administration. That amendment was an
act of generosity performed while a Conservative government was in office here; and it
was in anticipation of my honourable friends
becoming boastful about it, that I was at pains
to remind them of what took place when the
act was introduiced in 1926. The assumption
by the dominion of 75 per cent of the cost
did not help the pensioners, but it certainly
did* help the provinces, though it cost the
dominion treasury a very considerable sum.
In 1937 the act was amended again-this
time under Liberal administration-to include
persons unable by reason of blindness to perform any work for which eyesight is essential.
The pension was conditional on their being
British subjects, resident in Canada for twenty
years and in the province five years, forty
years of age and not in receipt of an allowance for blindness under the War Veterans
Allowance Act or a pension under the Old Age
Pensions Act. The maximum income permitted to those persons pensioned because of
blindness, and without dependents, was $440
per year, and to those with dependents $640.
Honourable senators will note the considerable

increase in income in respect of blindness compared to the amount allowed to those pensioned on account of old age.
As one would expect, there has been a con-

stant urge through the years to increase the
amount of pensions, because a considerable
number of the pensioners were forced to live
on the meagre sum of $20 per month with no
Even to those
means of supplementation.
who had added income, the authority was sup-

537

posed to reduce the amount of pension by the
equivalent of the revenue they received in
excess of $125 a year.
With the rising cost of living during the war
years, the position of the pensioner became
absolutely intolerable. In the early days when
the act was passed I assume-though I have
not been told--that those who drafted it had
in mind that $20 a month was intended merely
to supplement what the pensioner might earn;
it was to help him along. I do not think it
was intended that the pensioner should be
condemned to live on the meagre income of
$20 a month, but in a great many cases that
was the result. In 1943 an order in council
was passed under the War Measures Act
increasing the pension from $240 to $300 a
year.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Did the provinces pay
their quarter of that extra $5.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes, they did, and
of course they have supplemented in addition
to that.
In 1944 a further order in council was passed
permitting an increase of maximum income,
including pensions, from $365 to $425. The
provinces then reviewed the difficult position
of these poor old people, and remedial action
was taken by granting supplementary amounts.
In passing I should point out that with the
supplement the provinces in recent years have
been paying just about the same amount per
pensioner as they did when the act first came
into force and the pension of $20 a month was
shared equalily by the dominion and the
provinces.

In 1931 the ratio was changed, and the
dominion's contribution rose to $15 while that
of the provinces was reduced to $5 a month.
In 1943 when the amounts were increased the
dominion's share became $18.75 and that of
the provinces $625.
It is a little difficult to give a full report
on all the provinces, because the information
comes from various sources. However, the
best information I have been able to gain is
that Alberta since 1942, and Saskatchewan
since April, 1947, have each been paying
supplemenary amounts of $5 per month. For
some little time prior to April 1947 Saskatchewan was paying $3 per month, but now that
province and Alberta are paying a supplement
of $5 per month over and above their regular
contribution. The provincial contribution is
$11.25 per month, the total amount received
by old age pensioners in those provinces being
$30 a month.
British Columbia has a most creditable
record. In 1942 it gave a supplement of $5
per month, and on January 1, 1947 it increased

538

SENATE

that to $10. The total amount received by a
pensioner in that province today is $35, the
highest in the dominion.
I regret to say that up to date the province
from whieh I come has lagged sadly behind.
Ontario, the richest and greatest of the provinces of Canada has contributed varying
amounts. It supplemented the pension by 15
per cent of the amount actually paid, with
a maximum limitation of $3 a month. Thus
Ontario's contribution, including the regular
payment and the supplement, is $9.25 pur
month as compared with British Columbia's
$16.25; and Ontario's total pension has been
$28, per month as compared with British
Colunbia's $35. I am pleased to note, however, that the Ontario government has recently
announced that the pension in that province
will be increased. It lias been suggested that
the amsount may be as high as $40 per month.
I most sincerely hope that the provincial
government will feel itself in a position to
implement that suggestion, and that the old
people of the province will be treated
accordingly.
Maitoba's record is not too good. Since
1943 it lias paid a supplement of $1.25 per
msonth. I am sure we shall hear ifrom the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) in
that regard.
Since 1943 Nova Scotia lias paid a supplement to a maximum of $10 per month, with
the limitation that the total income is net to
exceed $425 per year. It is a little difficult
to figure out just wlat $10 a month has meant
to the pensioner in that province.
I know of no supplement at all having been
granted by New Brunswick, Quebec or Prince
Edward Island. The old people in those provinces have been forced to get along on the
amount they receive in the regular way under
the Pensions Act itself.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Can the honourable senator gi ve that information with regard to the
other provinces?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I have covered them
all.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I did not hear you cover

Quebec.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: They do not give
any supplement at all in Quebec.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Prince Edward Island?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No supplement.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: New Brunswick?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No supplement.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Thank you.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I have no information at all as to these provinces giving anything. The defenders of these provinces may
be able to say that their old people have been
given dental services and benefits of that
nature-as I believe is the case in Manitobawhich would not appear in the figures I have
been able to obtain. I hope that is the case
and that mv honourable friend from Winnipeg
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: We have kept the
cost of living down in Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The cost of living
has been kept down, has it? I wish vou could
give us the recipe for that.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: May I interrupt the
honourable senator?
As I come from the
same province as he does I think it only fair
to say that old age pensioners in our province
are given free medical care.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: In most of the provinces indigent people are given free medical
care and hospitalization. Certainly thousands
of people in Ontario receive free hospitalization. I do not know of any province that does
not provide this service. If special provision
has been made for the aged in the province
of Manitoba I shall bl glad to hear of it.
There is one more point which I should like
to cover before I turn ta the proposed amendment to this important and humanitarian bill.
In its submissions te the Dominion-Provincial
Conference of August, 1945, the federal government proposed a system of national old age
pensions, and offered to assume the full financial responsibility of $30 per month to al]
citizens of Canada, male and femnale, who
attained the age of seventy years. There was
to be no means test whatever, the dominion
bearing the full cost of the payments and of
the administration, amounting, as it was estimated at the time, to $200,000,000 per year.
That was the first suggestion. Perhaps it is
worth while to repeat it in outline. The
dominion government offered without a means
test a pension of $30 per month to everyone
who reached the age of seventy years, and to
bear the entire cost of the pension together
with the cost of administration.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Is there any estimate
of what that would amount to?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: $200 million a year.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: What happened to
that proposal?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Wait a minute.
Nothing has happened so far.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Well, I will tell you.

JULY 7, 1947

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I did not quite
finish outlining the proposal. In addition to
the national pension scheme, the dominion
stated it would co-operate with the provinces
to the extent of $30 per person in old age
assistance grants for people between the ages
of sixty-five and seventy years of age before
they had graduated in their entitlement to
the national old age pension. It proposed to
divide the net cost fifty-fifty between itself
and the provinces.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am not clear on one
point. You said that they proposed to drop
the means test. I am not sure that I understand what that means. Does that mean
that there would! be no investigation of anybody who was seventy years of age, no matter how well off lie was? Would he still get
the money?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes, just the same
as in the case of family allowances and
unemployment insurance.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: They wouldi force
everyone to take it.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No, they would not
force anyone to take it.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Well they do in
the case of the baby bonuses.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Oh, no they do not.
What the government have done is this:
they have asked you to take it by way of
baby bonuses rather than by exemption from
income tax.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, they do not give
you a chance.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: If you do not take
it as a baby bonus you lose your total
exemption.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: You can lose your
total exemption if you wish to. If you do
not apply for family allowances then you
do not get any exemption. Nobody pushes
this butter down your throat.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not think that last
statement is quite correct. They only alllow
you $100 if you have children within the
age limit, and, whether you ta'ke the bonus
or not you get the $100.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: It is $108 for a
child.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK:

But you do not

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: And if you get
$60 a year from the family allowance, that is
deducted from the $108.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: J shall not discuss it, but
you are not correct.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: You are off the
trail. I did not come prepared to discuss
income tax. The question is whether, when
the means test is abolished, the old. age pension is paid to everybody irrespective of

means.
who applies would be entitled to a pension
as of right. You do not have to take it, and
I suppose there would be some who would
not do so.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Very few.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: In addlition, at the
Dominion-Provincial Conference, the dominion
government offered to reduce the age limit of
the blind for entitlement to pension from
forty years of age to twenty-one years of age.
In respect of old age assistance grants to persons between sixty-five and seventy years of
age, there was to be a means test. That is to
say, people who did, not need the money
would not have it, but those in this earlier
age group who were in need could obtain it
on the basis of a means test, somewhat more
generously conceived than the one under
which we have been working.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Would such persons
have to qualify every year, or would it continue once they had qualified?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: It would continue
unless there were a change in their circumstances which indicated that they did not
need it. Then, of course, they should not take
it. That is the case today. If an old age pensioner enjoys a windfall, let us say through
the death of a rich uncle, he must give up his
pension.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: -and return the pension
payments he has received.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: But there is no provision for anyone under seventy?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is se.
I will now answer the question as to what
happened to these proposals. Just nothing
has happened. They have not been accepted
by the provinces. But on the other hand they
still stand, and I have not the slightest doubt
that they will be accepted in due season.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: May I ask the honourable senator what it is that he thinks will
be accepted.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The dominion government's proposal to pay a national old age
pension to those over seventy years of age, and

SENATE
assistance allowances to those in need of them
who are between sixty-five and seventy. I
am confident, although I do not assume to
be a prophet, that in due season an arrangement will be reached between our provinces
and the dominion which will carry into effect
what would be, I think, a splendid piece of
humanitarian social legislation.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Of course that statement is incomplete unless you specify what
the provinces were required to give in return.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Oh, well we are not

going to get into that argument.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: But the honourable
senator bas just stated, in effect, that the
provinces had a great opportunity to benefit
those old people. He did not mention what
the provinces had to give in return.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: My friend is much
too tender under the collar.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: No.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I am afraid be is
putting on a cap which I did not have in
mind, and certainly one which I did not offer
him.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: No. But obviously the
provinces would not be se foolish as to refuse
that offer were not some demand made upon
them which they thought was not to their
benefit.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes: probably that
is the explanation. But my statement stands,
that the offer of the dominion is still in
existence, and that in the course of time this
argument between the dominion and the provinces will be resolved somehow. I have enough
faith in the publie men of our country to make
the assertion that in the course of time this
proposal will be on the statute books of the
dominion; and I hope that both my friend
and I will be in this house to vote with
common accord for a measure of that kind.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I hope so too, but
it seems to me that seventy years is an age
which very few of us may reach.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I wish my honourable friend a much better fate than he anticipates for himself. I hope he will live long to
grace the Senate chamber with his presence,
his good nature and bis keenness of mind. I
should like to see this proposal accepted
because I desire the disappearance of the
means test as applied to the older-may I say
the very old-members of our society.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Every province has a
moans test today.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes. It must be so.
It is imposed upon the provinces by this act.
I should be glad to see the age limit reduced
to below seventy, and particularly I should
welcome the lowering of the required age
where there is an actual need for the money.
This is the dominion proposition as it is on
the boards at the moment. There is no such
test in relation to family allowances.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: I gather that the
honourable senator disapproves of the means
test, and that he would like to see it abolished.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: Well, why?
I
do not think there is anything wrong with a
means test. I could understand the honourable
senator's attitude if he wanted to make the
means test more elastic, but I do not see the
force of an argument which amounts to this,
that a man with an income of say ten or
fourteen or fifteen thousand dollars a year
should get an old age pension. The means
test is to ascertain whether a man is in need,
and where need exists I would certainly approve the payment of a generous pension. I
would also approve of greater elasticity in
the operation of the means test; but to do
away, with i altogether seems to me rather
absurd.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Of course, in the
application of a general rule some regrettable
incidents will occur; some cases will arise
where the entitlement is not so strong as in
others; but if, because of a few exceptions
such as the honourable senator bas mentioned
-millionaires
and other rich men to whom
this paltry amount of money is to be paidyou are to attempt to differentiate between
those who should and those who should not
be subject to the means test, you will have a
pretty difficult job.
May I now be permitted to resume what I
was discussing a few minutes ago.
State pensions for the aged can never bc
adequate to what most of us regard as necessary to the full enjoyment of leisure on the
other side of the hill, in the evening of life.
For that reason I strongly favour supplementary government annuities, such as we
already have, or, what is very much better, a
contributory system of pensions to supplement
that which becomes one's possession as of
right. By this means we would encourage
those who ask that they should be allowed to
enjoy the benefits of their frugality by being
enabled

to

pass

their

declining

years

in

greater comfort. Such a system of annuities
or contributory pensions would help the
individual to belp himself, and at the same

JULY 7, 1947
time assist the state by furnishing it with
capital to carry on enterprises which may
benefit the comrnunity in many ways.
When we consider individuel social services
of the kind now under discussion we must be
careful that we sc, flot just one littie section, but the over-aIl picture of social services. So I say to rny fellow-members of the
Sonate, let us flot forget the Unornployment
Insurance Act, of 1940, which provides insurancýe against unemployment to 2,500,000 Canedian workers; the Family Allowances Act, of
1944,
which benefits
3,600,000
Canadian
children, in 1,600,000 hom-es; the voterans
allowances and benefits--the most comprehensive and generous scheme of veterans
assistance in any country in the world, to say
nothing of the ýOld Age Pensions Act, under
which benefits are granted this very year to
209,000 aged porsons. More than 40 per cent
of ail citizens who have attained the age of
70 years and over are drawing old age pensions. Pensions are also paid to 7,000 prsons
whose sight is such that they are uneblo to
engage in work in which sight is essontial.
Aise, in discussing these measures and porhaps grewing enthusiastie about them,' we
must not forget that a large proportion of
this year's budget is devoted to social services.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Before the honourabloe senator gets on to tbat point, may I
esk if I rightly understood hirn that 40 per
cent of the people who have reached the age
of 70 are drawing a pension?
Hon. Mr. MURDO CX: Please speak loud
enougli that wo can bear the question.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I arn not sure
that; 1 corroctly understood my honourable
friend, and I arn asking him if he said that
40 per cent of the people wbo bave reeched
the age of 70 are drawing a pension.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is right.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Do I gather from
your remarks that if the means test wero not
applied, 100 per cent of our aged people,' or
60 per cent more then now, would ho on
pension?
Hon. Mr. RLOEBUCK: No, not a full 60
per cent more. I feel tbat some would flot
d'raw the pension.
My guess is that the
number of pensioners wo;uld be rougbly twice
as meny as todýay.
I was on the point of asking my colleagues
flot te forget the very large proportion of
the national incmc wbich we are budgeting
this yeer for social services. The figures are:
for unempînyment insurence, $12,500,000; for

femily ellowances, $260,000,000; for veterens
bonefits, $363,000,000, and for old ege pensions, $48,000,000, or a total of $683,500,000.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I arn sorry to interrupt the honourable gentleman, but this is se
interesting that I should like to be sure I
understand the figures correctly. My honourable friend rnentioned an amount of $12,500,000
for unemploymont insurence.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is what it is
costing us this year.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Does thet take into
account the contributory portion?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Thet is wbat cornes
out of the dominion trcasury. I had the bonour te be on the cornrittee wbieh reviewed
the Unernployrnent Insurance Act, and my
nernory is that we flot only contribute to
the fund, but tbat we aIse pey the cost of
administration. The charge on the dominion
treasury under that act this year is estimated
et $12,500,000.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: May I interrupt the
honourable gentleman on one point? 1 understand that the Canadien National Railways

Hon. Mr. LEGER:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I was speaking, net
of those ects, but of the Unemployment
Insurance Act.
Howevcr, my honourable

It would be a wonderful thing if we could

evork out.
Hon. Mr. iORNER: I know of no one in
this chamber better qualified te answer a
question which has bothered me than the
honourable gentleman who is explaining this
bill. At a time when the government was
reluctant to pay those who attained seventy
years of age $50 a month, without any demand
from the country, it introduced the baby
bonus, which for the most part assists young
men in the prime of life and full of ambition.
It was said that because the country did not
have the money it was impossible to increase
the old age pension. Now I should like to
hear my honourable friend's explanation as
to why we inaugurated a baby bonus while
holding out a meagre $30 a month to those
who lad reached the mature age of seventy
years.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: There are a number
of observations I could make in reply to my
honourable friend's query. It should not be
and
forgotten that both the family allowance
the increase of the old age pension werç
granted towards the end of the war. The
increase from $20 te $25 a month in the old
age pension was made in 1943; the family
allowance was inaugurated in 1944.
I would ask honourable senators to observe
that the maximum pension for both the aged
and the blind is increased under this measure
frem $25 te $30 a month, of which the dominion will contribute 75 per cent, or $22.50, and
the
the province 25 per cent, or $7.50. After
over-all increase of $5 per month the dominion's contribution of $18.75 will be increased
to
by $3.75 and if the provinces continue
contribute on the present basis this would
mean that in British Columbia the pension
would be increased from $35 to $38.75; in
Alberta and Saskatchewan to would go up
from $30 to $33.75, and so on all down the
line.
It was argued in the other bouse, and it
has been stated in ýletters to the press and in
same editorials, that the pension should now
be $50 a month. If one looks at the matter
only from the standpoint of the pensioners,
one will readily agree that an increase te $50
a month is highly desirable. May I point
out to the advocates of such an increase the
way is now open te make representations
to the provincial governments, who are now
free te increase their grants in accortdance
with such requests. The maximum income
te which the pensioner is entitled nder the
new amendments is to be fixed by agreement

between the two jurisdictions. Section 9 (1)
of the act, setting the maximum pension of
$240, is dropped, and the provinces are now
in a position to assist their citizens by contributing as much or more than the dominion
is contributing.
I would next ask honourable senators to
observe that by these amendments the maximum income, including the pension which
the pensioner is permitted to retain, has been

These are very substantial payments. The
amounts are not so great, of course, as might
be approved by persons who throw caution to
the winds, as we did in war time; but neither
are they such that anyone can laugh them
off. It is estimated that these higher pension
payments, with the larger amount of other
income which is being allowed, will cause an
addition to our rolls of 60,000 pensioners. In
other words, people with incomes greater than
the present maximum for entitlement will be
added to our rolls to the number of 60,000;
and these additional pensioners, together with
the increase in the amount of pension, will

you can laugh off, as some people have been
endeavouring to do. It has been scouted,
particularly in the other place; but I would
point out that it exceeds the entire contributions now made by the provinces. Last
year the provinces, apart from suppleapproxicontributed
allowances,
mentary
mately $15,000,000 as compared with the dominion contribution of $45,000,000, which is
increased under this bill to $68000,000,

JULY 7, 1947
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Is that the entire
amount, or is it the sum by which the amounit
is increased this year?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: What I wish to
point out is that, aside froca supplementary
allowances, the total provincial contributions
are only $15,000,000. It is a littie hard to get
figure as to the supplementary allowances,
and I have flot got them in my possession.
In any event, the dominion this year wiIl be
required to pay much more than the provinces
are now paying in the regular way.
There are a number of other important
changes. Pensions are no longer restricted to
British subjects. I think that is a good thing.
They wilI now 'be extended to, many reputable
oid people who have lived in this country and
worked with us for at least twenty years, but
who, for this or that. reason-and apparently
the reasons are num*crous and varied-have
flot, taken out naturalization papers. They
will now be eligible for these benefits, just
as they are entitled to benefits in respect of
family allowance and unemployment.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: How long must
they have lived in Canada?
Hon. Mr.'ROEBUCK: Twenty years.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Even tbough they
are flot British subjecte.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Has the honourable
senator an estimate of the number of people
over seventy years of age wdho bave flot
become naturalized?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I have no figures
on that at ail. I suppose anyone's guess is
pretty nearly as good, as anyone else's.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: But there are some
of these people.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: There is no doubt
about it. Each one of us knows some who
are in that category. How many there are
in ail Canada, I cannot say.
The strict requirement of twenty years'
residence bas been made a littie less drastic,
in that absence from Canada during part of
the past twenty years is compensated for by
twice the period of residence prior to that
time. To put it another way, two years of
residence prior -to the twcnty-year period is
made equivalent to a year's absence during
the twenty-year period. There are people
who lived in this country ail their lives but
who, during this crucial period of twenty
years, were out of the country for a time.
Even if that absence were as long as ten
years. a previous residence of -twenty years
would make up the deficiency.

Formerly, when a pensioner had lived in
more than one province, some bookkceping
difficulties arose. The province in which the
application was made and the pension was
granted paid the pension, performed the
administrative work, *and then collected from
the other province concerned on the basis of
the periods in which. the pensioner had lived
in the other province. Now, as a matter of
bookkecping and for ease of administration,
it bas been agreed upon by the provinces, and
is s0 provided in the bill, that the province
wherc the pensioner now lives, and in which
his application is grantcd, will "pay the shot".
No province will collect from any other, but
it is bopcd that "ail will come out riglit in
the wash," and a good deal of trouble will be
avoided.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: It will balance
itself.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: It will balance itself
in course of time.
One point more. I am sure everyone wilI
be please-d to, know that the bill provides for
payment to blind persons over the age of
twenty-one years, înstead of over forty. That
is a fine piece of work.
There may be some minor features in the
bill which I have flot in mind at the moment,
although I gave it a careful reading, but I have
deait with ail the important ones. 0f course
the bill does not go far enough. It does not
sufficiently increase the amount. It docs not,
as so many hoped it would, abolish the means
test. But the minister made it clear, and
doubly clear, that this is flot the final
measure; that it is not the ultim-ate goal to
wvhich we arc travelling, but is only a step
forward, aithougli, 1 submit, a very considerable stop.
1 dcferred for a moment saying anything
about the means test, because I had a note to
remind me of one little incident I should like
to relate. I actually know of a case of a
worker who pays $100 per year for a goverfiment annuity to be paid for over a considerable number of years before hie could possibly
become entitled by reason of age. That man
said to me recently: "What is the use of my
spending mcney in that way whcn ail that
will happen is that the government will deduct
what I purchase with my money over these
years from the pension to which I would
otherwise be en'titled." Just meet that if you
can. You cannot meet it by instancing a
milýlionaire who might possibly get an old
age pension, because sucli mon are very few
in number, and they pay out most of their
income in income tax. Here is a person who
is now younýg and who proposes to save $100

a year from his meagre earnings in order to
pay for an annuity when he is old. The only
reason he continues these payments is that
he expects that in due season the situation
will be studied and understood by our legislators, and that a change will be made which
will give to the frugal man the fruits of his
frugality or give to the saver something of
what ho saves, and thus put him in a more
advantageous position than the man who
spends his money and in due course becomes
Surely that situaan old age pensioner.
tion is compelling. People are going on with
their savings, net only for annuities but for
houses and, various other things, because they
expect the common sense of our legislators to
observe their predicament and to prevent
thei from being victimized because of their
frugality, forethought and good citizenship.
I hope tiat in due season wr shall get rid
of the means test. The only way to do se, as
I pointed out, is to abolish it completely, and
I am in favour of abolishing it just as soon
as we can. We cannot do it under this bil .As
I said earlier in my address, I believe that
tie provinces and the dominion will come
together, as statesmen shonuld and work out
thteir difficulties, and tiat proposals for a
national old age pension scheme will finally
be adopted. Perbaps it will not be long
hience.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: May I ask the ionourable senator a question before, he takes bis
seat? Section 9, subsection 1 states:
nal ot take effect until a proclamaThis act
tion is issued and as and from the date of such
proclamation shall be deened to have come into
force on the first day of MIay, 1947.
Dors that mean that the federal government and the provinces will pay the arrears?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I understand it so.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: And what does subection (2) of the same section mean?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Subsection (2) of
Setion 9 reads as fol-lows:
Notwithstanding anything in this act, the
Governtent of Canada will continue to contribute under this act in respect of pensions paid
to persons who, immoediately prier to the coming
into force of this act. were m receipt of pension
under the Old Age Pensions Act and the regulations thereunder for so long as such persons
would, but for the coming into force of this act,
have been eligible to receive pension under the
Old Age Pensions Act and the regulations there-

uder in force immediately prier to the coming
ito force of this act.
That is to sac, if by reason of this bill there
are changes in the act that would disentitle
anyone who is now receiving payments under

the Act, le shall remain entitled, and the
dominion will continue its contributions on
his account. J do not. know what conditions
those may bc. I think it is an excess of
caution.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Will the increase
be retroactiv e to May, 1947?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I so understand.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, I
was going to speak tonight but, as somebody
near me bas said, it is getting pretty late and
some of us are nearer seventy years of age now
than we were when this house opened. I shall
not delay the honourable members at this
time, but I should like to miake just one comment with respect to the address of my honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity.
The increase in pension as provided in this
bill is from $25 to $30 a person. I have wondered what kind of speech the honourable
senator would have made if the icase had
been froin $25 to $10? I hav-c also wondered
just what criticism the honourable senator
would have made if I had been sitting opposite and had introduced a bill such as this, to
increase the pension for aged people froin $25
to $30 a month. I think the rafters of this
building would i have rung and tears would
have been shed at surît a negligible increase.
What this bill means is that the old people of
this country who each

minth are nowm getting

$25, willi receiv-e the magnificent sum of $30.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: You are getting
sarcastic now.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is a very large
increase. It is all right to talk about veterans' allowances children's allowances, and the
like. But the question old people ask is:
"Why talk about those things in the saine
breath that you talk about increasing our
pension from $25 to $30?" I am prepared to
say that the increase in the cost of living since
1927, when the act was first passed, and when
aged people were given $20 a month, is much
greater than the increase in the pension. Further, this bill still contains that iniquitous
provision whereby the rich provinces can give
their aged people much more money than the
poorer provinces can give. That is a bad
principle for this country. However, I will
not take up any more time now. I want to
study the matter fully, and I therefore move
the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

EASTERN ROCKY MOUNTAIN FOREST
CONSERVATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN moved the second
reading of Bill 362, an Act respecting the
protection and conservation of the forests on
the eastern slope of the Rocky mountains.
83168-35-

545

He said: Honourable senators, I think I
should, point out first that this bill incorporates
largely an agreement made between the federal
government and the government of Alberta in
regard to the conservation of water and forest
reserves on the eastern slope of the Rocky
mountains, but I would not want members of
the Senate to go away with the idea that the
bill concerns the province of Alberta alone.
I would call it a measure of interprovincial
importance, because in conserving the waters
and forests on the eastern slope of the Rocky
mountains we contribute to the maintenance
of the waterflow in the main rivers of Alberta,
Saskatchewan and Manitoba. I have never
counted the number of rivers, large and small,
that flow from the Rocky mountains on to the
prairies, but I imagine there would be a dozen
or so. They all eventually reach the North
and South Saskatchewan Rivers, which flow
through the province of Saskatchewan, into
the Nelson River in Manitoba, and on to
Hudson Bay.
What is the eastern slope of the Rocky
mountains? It is an area some 350 miles long,
extending from the Montana border to the
neighbourhood of Jasper Park, in wbat the
people around Edmonton call central Alberta.
It has a depth of some thirty miles. In that
area tliere are three major federal parks:
Waterton Lakes National Park, in the extremt
south; Banff National Park, further north;
and Jasper National Park, at the extreme
north. In what we will call the park are, or
thef eastern clope, there are under dominion
control 5,861,200 acres.
Prior to 1930, when the natural resources
passed to the province of Alberta, all the
forests on the eastern slope were under federal
control. Since that time those outside the
National Parks have been under the control of
Alberta. The Crows Nest, Bow River and
Clearwater forest reserves, and the southern
part of the Brazeau forest reserve constitute
an area of amost ten million acres. I am
familiar with that are and its conditions, and
I know that the part occupied by the dominion
has always been well protected, because the
officials are competent fire fighters. Great care
is taken during the summer and fall seasons
to watch for fires and to fight them immediately. In some instances in the southern areas
they receive assistance from officials of the
United States, and at other times they bave
the co-operation of the residents inside the
park areas.
Since Alberta has assumed control of the
foreste of the eastern elope of the Rocky
Mountains the cost of protection in those
areas has been beyond the resources of the

province, particularly in the depression period.
I have some figures here, which I will not give
in detail, to indicate what has happened since
the forest areas passed under the control of
the province. They show the fire losses which
have occurred from that time until the
present, as compared with the losses over the
period from 1925 to 1930. I will use those
two periods to give an idea of the comparative conditions. This information is confined
to the forest reserves, and not to the park
areas.
In the period from 1925 to 1930 the
reserves, under federal control, the fire loss
covered 58,530 acres, on which the merchantable timber was valued at $20,628. In the
period from 1931 to 1936, when the control
and protection of these areas was the responsibility of the province of Alberta, the fire loss
covered some 235,155 acres-a tremendous
increase over the previous five year period-and caused destruction of timber valued at
of Alberta

admsitted that they had net the resources to
combat this condition; consequently they
approached the Federal govermirent to find
out whether, upon a study of the situation,
co-operation of the dominion and the province
could be effected to meet this menace and
protect these forest arcas.
As I have already said, while this measure
confirms an agreement with the province of
Alberta in regard to the protection of the
eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains, it will
imean a great deal to the other western provIrrigation developments have been

going on steadily in western Canada, and
more are in prospect. Much of this development depends upon the waters which flow
froms the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains; and it is upon the same source that
certain areas of Alberta, Saskatchewan and
Manitoba depend for their power and water
supply. If further loss of the timber on the
eastern slopes of the Rockies is permitted,
with consequent diminution of the supply of
water from that area, it will be a serious
matter for the prairie provinces.
During the past year I happened to hear an
address by the president of the Canadian
Forestry Asociation, who is well informed
concerning the forests of the Dominion as a
whole. What he had to say about the eastern
slopes of the Rocky mountains is worth quoting in support of the measure which is before
os for consideration. This is a statement made
by Robson Black, President of the Canadian
Forestry Association:
The east slope watershed forest of the Rockies
is the most important single strip of forest
treasure in the whole dominion.

And the reason

is that it governs the flow of virtually every
river that waters the western plains. It is a
citadel guarding the ramparts of the West's
richest possessions-her irrigation, her hydroelectrie powers, the water levels of the rancher's
wells, and the stability of Saskatchewan and
northern Manitoba.
I commend those remarks, as coming from
an authoritative source.
Let me briefly summarize tie situation
whicb led to conferences between the province
and the federal authorities, and the introductien of the present bill, in order to assure the
proper protection of this great and important
area. Discussions of this problem between the
dominion and the province of Alberta began
in 1937, and the foltowing basic facts were
gcnerally adtnitted.
It is cessential to the well being net only of
Alberta but of Saskatchewan and Manitoba,
that the foest lands on the east slope of the
Rocky Moutttains, comprising the drainage
ha-is of the Saskatchewan river and its tributarires, shoutd b adequately protected.
The piovince of Alberta alone is financially
inable te provide the degree of protection
eqie for this valuable area.
I may say in this connection that while
considerable tiiber is te b foutnd on the
asten slopes of the Rocky Moutits,
revenue derived from it is of tno grcat contThe province itself does not benfit

to any material extent.
The dominion goverment, througlh the
Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act, which was
passed by Parliamtent in April, 1935, has to
date expended several million dollars in regulating water supply for irrigation purposes in
the three prairie provinces, and these activilies are vital to the support of provincia
economsies. Since the source of tis water
supply is chiefly dependent on the maintenance of the east slope forest cover, it follows
that the dominion government is vitally
interested in the protection of this watersied.
as well as the protection of federal financial
investments made or contemplated in the
operation or extension of the Prairie Farm
Rehiabilitation Act.
The forest lands of the east slope cannot
for sone years be expected to produce revenue
which will offset to any important degree the
expenditures necessary for adequate protection.
Changes of administration and the lack of
continuity of policy have in the past resulted
in a lowering of protection efficiency and
costly outlays in endeavouring to control
extensive forest fires which have donc tremendous damage. This situation demands a
skilled, highly trained, permanent staff for the
protection and development of this area on a
scientific basis. Substantial forest improvemonts must be made and maintained.

JULY 8, 1947
The east slope area adjoins the Waterton,
Banff, and Jasper national parks, which are
an integral part of this great watershed. As
such, adequate protection of the east slope
area is of prime importance to these federal
parks. These represent a heavy financial
investment and are of the utmost importance
to the tourist trade, while the protection of
wild life in these areas provides an overflow
in the adjoining cast slope area.
Those are what I would call the "revelations" following the conferences between the
two governments as to the situation that
existed -in this area.
'hat is the solution offered in the bill
before us? It is a measure of co-operation
between the federal government and the provincial governmen;t of Alberta.
Under this bill the dominion agrees to
make available to the board during the first
six years of the agreement a sum not exceeding $6,300,000 for capital expenditures required
for the construction of forest improvements,
the preparation of a forest inventory, and for
reforestation and other such works and services as the board may consider necessary.
In addition to the foregoing, the bill provides for an overall annual expenditure not
exceeding $300,000, of which the province
agrees to pay up to $125,000, and the dominion up to $175,000. This expenditure is to
provide for the normal administration and
operation of the area, including fire-fighting
costs up to a sum of $10,000, to le paid by
Any additional fire-fighting
the dominion.
costs will be borne equally by the dominion
and the province. The province is to retain
the revenue derived from the area, provided
that if it should exceed the amount of the
province's contribution, to that extent the
provincial expenditure will be increased.
The bill provides that this agreement shall
remain in force for a period of not less than
25 years from the date upon which it takes
effect, and may be terminated at the end of
that period, or any year thereafter, upon
either government giving one year's notice in
writing of its .intention so to do. Otherwise,
the agreement will continue in force. That,
in as concise a form as I can express it is the
meaning of the agreement between the two
governments.
The board that is to be set up will have
three members, two to be named by the
federal government and one by the province.
One of the federal members will be chairman.
I do not know that there is much more
that I can say to the Senate in support of this
important bill. I have pointed out the extent
of the eastern slope of the Rockies, the fire
losses that have taken place in more recent
S3168-35J

years, and the urgency of protection for that
area through conservation of the forest and
water reserves; I have referred to the proposed solution of the problem through the
setting up of this board and its use of money
from the federal treasury to assure conservation and reforestation. I have also emphasized
the fact that the bill does not concern the
province of Alberta alone, that it is of importance to other provinces in western Canada
as well.
In closing, may I quote something that I
read the other day in a publication that has
interested itself in the protection of the
eastern slope of the Rocky mountains. Itwas
written by Leonard D. Nesbitt, a former
Alberta weekly newspaperman, whom I know
very weli. I think lie gives a good illustration of the condition that might easily exist
or perhaps actually does exist to some extent
now on the eastern slope of the Rocky mountains. This is what he says:
If you take a large square of linoleum, slope
it into the form of a ramp, and then pour a pail
of water on the top side, you will see a quick
flood, with little moisture left thereon. But if
you put a rug over the ramp and follow the
sanie procedure with a pail of water, you will
notice the moisture seeping into the texture of
the rug and gradually flowing downward. That
example will show you what forest growth does
to melting snow and ice in the mountains.
In other words, if we alose
the timber on the
castern slope of the Rocky mountains, and
the spring waters rush along without anything
to hold them, we shall have floods and a
waste of water later in the season. But if we
have forests there to hold back the snow
waters from the eastern slope of the Rockies,
we shall be assured of a permanent supply of
water for the parts of the country that need
it badly; parts which in a sense could not
exist without it.
I consider this bill to Le important to the
economy not of western Canada alone, but
of the whole country.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
this measure is unique in one respect. Of all
the legislation which we have been considering
since the opening of parliament, this bill is
the only one or almost the only one that deals
with an important matter of conservation.
Most of the legislation that we have had to
date concerns the spending of money for
unproductive purposes. This measure, I repeat, is unique in the sense that it is an effort
to introduce a wise conservation policy in a
part of Canada where it is essentially needed.

SECOND READING

The Senate resumned from ycsterdlay

the

adjourned debate on tho motion of Hon. Mr.
Roebuck for the second reading of Bill 339, an
act to amend the Old Age* Pensions Art.

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
before speaking directly ta the bill I should
like to, elear Up a point arising out of the
discussion yesterday. The bonourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) in Lis explianation of the bill rcferred to
veterans' allowances and family allowances.
The honourable gentleman from St. Jean
Baptiste (Hon. A. L. BeauLien) interrupted to
say that the amount of the yearly incarne tax
allowance per child was not $100 but $108, and
that the $60 receiveci by way of family alloýwance was deductible froma this amount. My
honourable friend was wrong in bis assertion.
If he doubts me, I will read the statute.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I accept, my bonourable friend's word. He knows more about
I was under the
incarne tax than I do.
impression it was $108.
Hon. Mr. HAIGI: It was changed last year.
1 wanted to clear up that point so the record
would Le straight.
First, rnay I congratulate the Minister ci
Public Health and Welýfar e on the bill that
he bas braught in. I realize the difficulties Lî
labours under and I appreciate tbe advances
tbat bave been made with respect ta pensions
for tbe aged and the blind.
I wu. delighird witb tbe address made by the
member for Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. -Mr.
Roebuck). Hie bas been in public life perbaps
longer tban I have been-I bhave been in
public life for thirty-three years--but wben a

speaker is introducing a bill I do not t.hink
it proper for bim to discuss a lot of othcr
things whieh bave not.bing ta do witb the
ineasure Le is introducing. Last nigbt the
bonourable senator dealt at, ronsiderable
lengthi with farnily allowances, soldiers' relief
and other social services. That proredure
inay be ail rigbt, but I do not think it. lielps
ta enligbten those listening ta tbe debate;
in fart, I think it detrarts froma the presentatien of the subjeet.
It s omîs ta me a terrible thing ta say that
this country is paying out 260 million dollars.
for famil3y allowances. and that aIl it can
afford ta provide for aid people is 70 or 80
million dollars. I think there is sometbing
radirally wrang with aur tbinking wben we
prcent that kind of argument.
Tbe Old Age Pension bill reminds me of a
dinner at wbirb the first course is fine, and
you wait for tbe main course, wbicb is usually
meat, only ta flnd tbat there is no meat. Up
to the first of May tbis year aId age pensioners
wili rereive $25 a month, and if thbis bill passes
tbey will get $30 a montb an increase of $60
a year. Nabody can tell me tbat sucbi a set-up
is not out of uine. I can understand wby tbe
Premier of Ontaria bas just announced that Lis
province will contribute $10, making tbe total
pension $40 a montb, and that British Columnbia has announred. tbat it will increase tbe
pension ta approxirnately $38. Tbe trutb is
tbat tbe bill sbould have fixed the pension for

My Lonourable friend from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) said, a Liýberal government in 1927 introduced a bill providing for
pensions of $20 per montb; of whicb tbe federal
treasury paid 50 per cent, and that in 1931 a
Conservative administration increased tbe contribution ta 75 per cent. If one looks at
today's rost of living, one can readily see that
it is double tbat of twenty years ago. The
scale of the rising cost of living at the present
time is readily sbowa ta Le double what it
was twenty years ago.

In Winnipeg, or in any otber town or city
tbat I know, the aId people L'ave Lad a terrible
struggle ta exist on $25 a month. My bonourable friend bas said tbat the additional contribution made by rny province amounts ta, only

$1.25 per capita. Well, I arn not responsible
for wbat Manitoba daes. Our government is

a vcrvamaway from iîn; if it does, lie clîases it down
the "Sreet witîh a cycle squad to Catch up
with it he-fore it goes out of sigbit; so I amn
net astonished that the gox crnment's contribuiiton is oil v $1.25 as contrasted wjth the $5

I ain net rei-poraible foi' the fiait that Mlanitoba lia- net done se wvell in this tcpetaciLhl'o f the other prairie provinces.
The fundamental point is, that if tlie

it shoîîld bc willing to pay 90 per cenît; I
w'oîld liave said 100 per cent, but for the cost
cf administration. If $40 per mnonth is the
proeper pension for the elderlY people of
Ouilaii, it .,,liotild be the prQper pension for
agi d pcr-.ens elsewhere in Canada. I do net
think that <an ho contradicted. I arn persuaded
that ouui people cani live more cheaply in
Ontarie tlian in Manitoba, because the long
period cf colJd weather on the prairies necessitziles hecavici' clothing, warmer bouses, and
hetter living accommodation. I think the
govcernment wcî'e on the righ't track when, in
August of 1945, they offered to defray the
cosýt of olci age pensions at 70. That undertalcing should have been imiplemented in this
bill. The ar-guments presented. in the other
place do net answer this contention. We are
told tliot two provinces have î'efused to enter

of railroads, of the big stores and other corporations whio pay so much a month, and
who at the end of an agreed period are
entitled to receive a pension upon a basis
whichi makes it possible for theiii ta preseirve
their self-respect. We shouid adopt the contribiitory syvstern without any loss of time,
because the sooner it is begun the better for
ail concerned.
That is about ail I wish to say with regard
to the bill. I believe the Minister of Health
and Public Welfare is just as anxious as I
amn to put old age pensions on a proper basis.
He bas gone a long way, but I do flot t.hink
lie has gone far enough.
As I bave said before. there are thrce main
points. The first is that the basic pension is
nut laige enouglh. My prouf of that lies in
the fact that there are at least two provinces
which could immediately finance practically
$140 per month. The second is that the dominion governiment shouid pay a larger proportion. The îlîird point is that a contributory
schiemc should be started at once to put old
age pensions on a proper basis.
The Hon. the SPE AKER: Honourabie senators. is it your pleasure to give second reading
to Bill 339, an Act to amend the Oid Age Pensions Act?
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourabie
senators, I believ e I have the right to close
the debate.
I have one or- two observations to make in
reply to the honourabie senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig). In n very kindiy way
he criticized the roferences I made to other
nets of parliament in the course of my speech
in support of the second reading of this bill.
The honouraibie senator suggested that he
did not think these references helped in the
presentation of the bill. I do net agree with
that. It seemns to me that any teferences to
ailiel siibjects are enlightening and serve
some uiseful purpose; certainiy they are within
the rules. It seems to me that the honourabie
gentleman was the one who led me down the
biind aiiey of incomne tax and uniess I arn
mistaken, nearly ail of the discussion on
aliied measures was raised by questions put
to me by honourabie members.
The most
irrelevant matter was raised by the honourabie
senator hirnseif. Hie stated that the amouint*
of income permitted should be raised to $960
per vear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I said it should be $720,
and tiîat 1 should. like to see it raised to $960.
I did not go beyond the figure of $720 as a
rea! proposition.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK:

Do I underÉtand

froni that rcmark that the honourmbie gentleman makes some distinction between his

officiai opinion and his personai opinion?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Oh, yes, quite clearly.
I do not propose to carry the parity with me
that far.
Hon. Mr. HOEBITCK:
not go to $960.

The paclty would

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Not as yet.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I like those words
"as yet", hpcause they show that even the
Conservative par'ty is subI cet to growth. However, whichever figure is accepted, the $720
or the $980, I take issue with the statement
that an increase in thec amount of income
allowed %ould not add to the cost of the
pension because such an increase would
cstablish a furiher set of pensieners. Every
person whose incarme ranges between the
present amount of $600 and tha't of $720-the
amount mentioned hy my honourable fricndwouid bc added to our rolis. The increase
which we now find in the neit has itself added
an estimated 60,000 people. So let the bonourabie senator flot fool himself.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, it would not add
that. You would only take the $120 extra
off the $360. I say $720; that is $120 more.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The difference wouid
be t-hat ail people over seventy yýears of age
who hakd incomes bctvccn $600 and $720 per
year wouid he added ta our rels as pensioners.
A,11 that wouild
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No.
happen is this: instead of my carnings being
rcstricted to $600. I would be permitted to
earn another $120. But if you do not put it
in you take it off the $360. 1 can stili earn
the $720 and corne under your act.

Hon. Mr. HOEBUCK: I think there is
saine confusion hcre. It is hardly worth while
to pursui' it further in discussion.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: There would be the
benefit of increased production.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Perhaps, and there
would be other benefits as well. A larger
number of people would be drawing oid age
pensions, and that in somne respeots is highly
I wil'i1 go with my honourable
desirable.
friend (Hon. Mr. Haig) further than his $720;
I wihi go with him te his $960, both officially
and personaliy; but do not let us fool ourselves into beiieving that these things do not

tioned, or the flight of the offender upon the
commission or attempted commission thereof,
and death ensues from such injury.
Section 260 contains two other paragraphs.
which I need not read, and now it is proposed
to add a fourth paragraph, as follows:
(d) if he uses any weapon for the purpose of
facilitating the commission of any of the offences
in this section mentioned, or the flight of the
offender upon the commission or attempted commission thereof, and death ensues as a consequence of such use.
The effect of that amendment is this. If
death ensues from the use of any weapon by a
person for the purpose of facilitating the commission of any of the offences mentioned in
this section or of facilitating his flight after
committing or attempting to commit any
such offence, that- person can be charged with
murder. It will be immaterial whether or not
he intended to infliet injury.
So far as I personally am concerned I would
strongly support any change in our criminal
law which might have the effecit of curbing
the reckless disregard of life that seems to
imbue those who carry weapons when they
embark on unlawful enterprises. I think that
the severest penalties of the law should be
imposed upon any person who was even in
possession of a weapon at the time of conmitting or attempting to commit an offence.
All too often romance or glamour seems to
attach to such a person if he kills someone
élse. There is a good deal of public hysteria
in many of these cases. But I am always
driven to think of the innocent victim, who
did not invite the attack which was suddenly
made upon him and who had no opportunity
of measuring its force. If there is any sympathy
to be extended, I would rather that it go to
the innocent victim than to the person who in
reckless disregard of law and order armed
himself for the purpose of enforcing his will
arbitrarily.
Another important feature of the bill is the
addition to the Code of the new Part X (A),
dealing with habitual criminals.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Would the honourable
gentleman allow a question? Would "weapon"
cover a substance used by a robber to blind
his victim before escaping?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: It is difficult for me
to give an interpretation, and I expect that
ultimately it will be a matter for the courts
to decide. There is a definition of "weapon",
but the broad use of the word in the proposed
amendment has to do with a situation where a
person uses any weapon for the purpose of
facilitating the commission of an offence. The
throwing of acid or powder into the eyes of a
victini might impede the arrest of the person
83168-36

committing an offence. This particular section
of the bill is confined to dealing with the
situation where death is the resulit of the
criminal carrying out his plan of escape, or
where, in the commission of an offence, be
perpetrates the further crime of killing or
bringing about the death of the person he
bas attacked.
Section 18 of the bill provides for a new
Part X (A) dealing with habitual criminals.
The purpose of this section is to provide for
preventive detention of habitual criminals
for an indeterminate period. A person, in order
to be a habitual criminal, must come within
the following formula:-he must have been
convicted at least four times of indictable
offences, three of which must have been of
such a nature that he was liable on conviction
to imprisonment' for at least five years; those
offences must have taken place after he
attained the age of eighteen years, and in
addition there must be evidence that he is
persistently of a criminal character or nature.
There is a provision under which, after three
convictions an accused person may, on his
fourth indictment, be charged not only
with the offence named in the indictnent but
with being a habitual criminal. If he is convicted on the substantive charge in the indictment, and that is the only part on which he
is arraigned in the first instance, the judge or
jury, as the case may be, may proceed on the
question of whether or not he is a habitual
criminal. If a finding of guilty is recorded
he may be sentenced for an indeterminate
The law,
period to preventive detention.
under this proposed measure, requires that
persons convicted of being habitual criminals
be imprisoned in a separate and distinct portion of the reformatory or penitentiary to
which they are sent.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I believe the honourable gentleman bas omitted to mention subsection 4 which requires the consent of the
Attorney General.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I am coming to that
point now. I embarked on the procedure in
a case of a habitual criminal and wanted to
follow it through. The Minister of Justice
must review every three years the conditions,
and I suppose the reputation and attitude of a
person convicted under this charge. Before a
charge of being a habitual criminal can be
proceeded with two things must happen: first,
the Attorney General of the province must
give consent, and secondly, notice must be
given to the person charged within at least
seven days before the charge is to be proceeded with. That notice must specify the
previous convictions and also the grounds

ARMY BENEVOLENT FUND BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN (for Hon. Mr.
Robertson) mov'ed the second ieading of Bill
410, an Act to establish a benevolent fund for
army canteens and other service clubs.
He said: During the hast war certain sums
of money wcre accumulated through the
canteen funds of the army and the auxiliary
services. This bill is to create a board ta
administer that fund, which today stands at
over $8,000,000, and will amaunt ta around
$9,000,000 when the moncys receivable from
the auxiliary services are paid.
As I have stated. the bill creates a board
ta administer this fund, and ail moneys and
be
secikrities thereunder wvi11 transferrcd ta the
Recciver General ta ensure a proper chcck on
the outgoings.
The bill provides:
(1) There shall be constituted a Board ta be
called "Thep Army Benevoleot Fund Board" consisting of five members appointed by the Gavernor in Council of whom one shall have been
norninated by the Canadian Legian of the British
Empire Service League and one by the National
Council of Veterans Associations in Canada.
No suember of the board shall hold pr occupy a
position in the public service of Canada.
(2) The members of the board shahl be appointed for a term of four years: Provided
that of the members first appoînted one shahl be
appointed for a termi of six years, twvo for a
term of four years each and two for a term of
two years each.
(3) A member is, upon the expiration of his
term of office, eligible for re-appointment.
The members of the board will act wjthout
any salaries, except that the board may fix an
amount for days while in attendance at
meetings of the board.
Provincial committees will be appointed ta
act in the different provinces, and the board
will have the right ta fix an amount for
travelling thereto and returning ta the place
of rosidence, and actual travelling expenses.
Section 8 provides:
(1) The Board shahl appoint a veteran as
secretary ta the board at an anoual salary flot
exceeding six thonsand five hondred dollars and
may appoint such other officers, clerks and employees as may he required on sncb terms and
conditions as it deems expedient,...
(2) The Board mnay inclîr such expenses as
it considers necessary for carrying out this Act:
aud expenses. including salaries, shahl be paid
out of the fond.
The fond will be controhled, and interest at
two and a haîf per cent per annum will be
paid an any money that is in the treasury.
This money -,vas accumulated by the canteens of armed forces during the war, and the
dependents of the war veterans are entitlpd
ta receive that money as the board sees fit
ta award it.
83168 36l

I do not think there is anything else ta add.
The bill has aIl the protecting clauses that
1 think are necessary ta ensure that this fund
is well administered. The board will be an
entirely independent body and their recoinmendatians will be independent.
Hon. G. V. WHITE: Honourable senatars,
1 should like ýta say a word or two in connection with ane of the auxiliary services
which is making a large contribution ta this
fund. I refer ta the Canadian Legion War
Ser%-iccs, an organization with which I was
first as.sociated at the outbreak of the war.
That, organization came inta being in Oecober,
1939, whcen a nunuber af legion men including
myself werc summoned ta Ottawa by Gencral Foster who, at that time, was Dominion
President of the Canadian Legion. The purpose of the meeting was ta organize 'the
Canadian Legion War Services as an auxiliary to perform certain services for the troaps
dùring the war. The Dominion Command, of
the legion guaranteed our organization an
amount of $25,000 ta enable us ta stýait aur
work. It was nat long, however. until the
amount which had been guaranteed was

expended, and we were compelled ta approach
the Canadian Red Cross Society for an
af sufficient money ta, enable
advance
us ta carry on until aur flrst campaign, which
taak place in the' spring of 1940. At that
time we appealed to the public for fonds to
enable us ta carry oni our work. The Red

Cross very generously came ta aur assistance
and furnished os with the amaunt which wc
had requested-S$10,000 a month for four
mnonths. When the proceeds of aur campaign
in we approached the Red Cross ta
(,.men
repay the amouint hoaned, but they kindly
said that it had been a gift and that they
did not expect it ta be returned. Hawever,
ne insisted upon making repayment.
In the following year, 1941, the Legion War
Services, tagether with tihe three other
auxiliary services-the Knights of Columbus,
the Y.M.C.A., and the Salvation Armyentered ino an arrangement whereby they
made a joint appeal for fonds, rather than
separate appeals, ta carry an their several
auxiliary services. As was usual on occasions
of that kind, the public very generoushy came
to aur assistance, and we were able ta create
(bite a fond which enabled us ta carry on
during the following year. In 1942, 1 think
it was. the goverameat decided ta take the
financing of the anxiliary services ra.ther than
have the different arganizations making separate appeals to the public, and fram that time
on the services werc financed by the government.

A few figures may be interesting. I hold
in my hand the final report of the Legion
War Sei-vices -ubmitted. just a few weeks
ago by our general manager. It shows what
the organization accomplishied. I amrn ft

other services, but I know whiat 'vas arcomI)lishied by the Legion.

In view of the fact that the number of applications for divorce bas been increasing 'by Ieaps
and bounds, this year reached an ali-time high,
and may eontinue to increase, your committee
recommends that parliament shouid immediately
seek a solution of the problem of dealing with
divorce in the province of Quebec by other than
parliamentary action.
AIl of which is respectfuliy submitted.
I move, seconded by Honourable Senator
Haig, that this report be now adopted. I sug-

gest that it be flot read by the Clerk, but
that the

motion

for its adoption he put,

when I shall make some general remarks
with regard to the divorce situation.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is moved by
Honourable Senator Aseltine, seconded by
Honourable Senator Haig, that the fin-al
report of the Standing Committee on Divorce
for 1947 be, now concurred in.
Hon. Mr,. ASELTINE: Honourable senators, for Vhe further benefit of ail hon-aurahle
meashers, I should like ito add to the information contained in the report.
Fees received with petitions for bills of
divorce which were heard before -the Stand.
ing Committee on Divorce totalled $65,730.
From this surm, wh.ich includes fees on petitions wi'thdrawn and petitions ungranted, is
to be dieducted $4,562, the amount of .refunds
to poor persons who were unahie to pay the
full parliamentary fee. The net sum received
by parliament in connection with t1hese
divorces is $61,168.
1 should like to, take this opportunity to
express my ithanks and appreciation to the

members of the divorce committee for the
vcry faithfui manner in which they carried
out their düties this year. The work was
very onerous, and the conimittee found it
necessary to sit four days a week-Mondays,
Tuesdays, Fridnays and Saturday&--on three
of whidh the Senate as a rule was not, sitting.
The reporting staff also worked on those days;
we appreciate the wonderfui work they did.
Aiso, I arn particulariy indebted to the honourabie senator fxrm Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig), who, aeted throughout the session as
deputy chairman, and to the honourahie senator from Westmorland

(Hon.

Mr. Copp)

for bis assistance, particuiarly when either
Senator Haig or 1 was unabie to be prescrit.

I would also express my thanks to the individuai members

of the committee, who day

after day sat for hours at a -time to hear what
one may characterize as very disagreeable
evidence, and by whose services the coinmittee as a whole was wonderfully heiped.
It shouid be mentioned that in the conduet
of these cases your committee does its best
to follow the miles of evidence and, in general,
to try the cases in the sanie manner as such
cases are tried! in court of law in any province
having jurisdiction in mratters of divorce. In
fact, in many cases we give thein more consideration than the courts do. When we suspect collusion or connivance, we examine the
witnesses very carefuiiy on those points. On
occasion the committee has invited members of
the House of Commons to he present and
many of themn have attended and iistened to
the proceedings. Many times they have
complimentedi the deputy chairman (Hon. Mr.
Haig) and myseif on the manner in which the
nases have been conducted. We hope that we
have d.one a good job.

Honourabie senators will note thiat the
greatest increase hias been in the province of
British Columbia, where in 1946 one divorce
xvas granted for every five marriages. In my
opinion the reason for that is that after a
divorce is granted in British Columbia no
waiting period is required hefoc-e the parties
can remarry. I think I am correct in making
that statement.
In the other provinces
wlsen an order nisi is issued three to six
months must elapse before a final decree can
be obtained.
It is quite possible that on
accounit of the comparative ieniency shown in

Britishî Columbia a considerable number of
people have estahlislied domicile in that
province mn order ta obtain divorces.
In eonnection with divorce there are severai
features of interest that I should like to point
out. South Carolina, Southern Ireland-that
is Eir-o-nd Quehec are tise only places in
tise world wliere divorce cannot be ohtained.
In Canada, except in Nova Scotia, where
iiet is a ground for divorce, the only
ground on xvbicls n divorce can ba ohtained
is iulev
It is my opinion that this rcstrictlion Ia an(, gron( bias resulted in the wholesasle commission of adultery hy peoiple seeking
frecdonm frons unhappy marriogos.

JULY 9, 1947
I (Io flot say that I arn in favour of going
as far as the Dominion of New Zealand has
gone, but I arn strongly in favour of Canada
doing something along the line attempted by
the Senate whien it. passed the Divorce and
Matrimonial Causes Bill in 1938.
lion. JOHN_ý T. HAIG: Honourable nierabers. I cannot add much to what the Chairman of the Divorce Committee has said, but
1 do wiAh to refer to the faithful service rendered bY the members of his committee. It
is diýagreeable, hard work; nobody wants the
job.
The xvork falis large]y on certain
sena tors from the Maritimes and the Western
provinces, but I say without conceit that I
have never served on a better comrnittee than
we had this session, when we had a bigger
volume of work than ever before.
In mv opinion no court in the land gives
more sincere consideration to every case
coming before it than does the Senate comnmittec. The committee and subcommittee
always consist of at least one lawyer of many
vears standing. and not, less than two other
senators, whose position could be likened to
that of assessors or members of a jury. The
non-legal members may not be able to rule
as to tbe admissibility of evidence, but they
certainlv can tell 'whether a man or woman
in the witness box istelling the truth.
I arn confident that I amn expressing, not
only my own attitude, but that of the other
members; of the comrnittee, when I state
emphatically that we do flot want the job.
However, since the time of Confederation the
work of the divorce committee has been one
of the duties of this chamber, and I and the
other members of the committee were determined that if we had to do the job we would
do it properly, and there would be no complaint about our work.
During this session we invited members of
the other chamber to corne in and listen to
the proceedings of the committee. More
members than ever before came over from
the other house, and there was not one who
did not compliment us on the fairness and
care with which we examined ail cases. We
also asked members of this house to listen in,
but few accepted the invitation.
I do not think the people of Canada are
alive to this iissue. It is no use, as I said on a
previous occasion, for ministers of any denomination or faith to get up and say that we
should flot have divorce. Their job is to cure
the cause of divorce.

I do not propose to repeat the figures given
by the chairman, but I have done a littie
research on rny own. The figures I have here
will convince honourable senators of the real
problema faciflg this country.
I did not
examine the evidence given on ahl the applications heard, because it was not printed in
everv case and was not out in time to enable
me to speak, today. I did, however, examine
the 317 cases heard up to July 3, and my
statisties are as follows:
Petitions presented .................

Honourable members, when young women
of twenty-four, twenty-five or twenty-seven
years of age come into court to apply for a
divorce and tell their story in the witness
box, they are tel.ling the truth. You can see
it in them. Their whole life has been broken
by some individual. I would point out that
225 of the 317 applicants were wornen. The
men responsible for this condition were not
properly trained in their homes before they
started out. and the cburch neyer got to them
and told them their responsibility. No one
can tell me that, we should not grant divorces
to young women under forty on, the facts as
we bear them. I arn not talking about
adultery which, as my honourable friend said,
has to be proved. That is not, the thing that
bothers us in the cornmittee; it is the way
the men have acted towards decent. women.
They walk out and leave them. That condition has to be cured. We hear that 7,500
divorces were granted in Canada in 1946, and
I prediet there will be more in, 1947. It is
no use saying we should not have divorce.
Any fool can say that; but the wise man or
woman asks: How can we prevent the things
that bring about divorce?

to do so xxould lead it down a blind alley;
thosýe who are net in faveur of liberalizing
divorce wouild pro>bably wish ho express their
opposition. What I propose is that an investigation be mnade to detoî mine the basic causes
ef those divorces; and in particular, hoew it
comes about that in over 200 of the total of
317 cases the petitioners were under thirty-five

I haxve onie other piece of information which

I should lîke at Ibis timie to thank the
inembers of the staff of the Senate whio helped
me to compile this information. I take full
i'osponsibility for the figures, but their help
s very mcicli apprcciated.
I suggest that the Parliamient of Canada
should ot only discuss the question of how
c e should deal with the divorce question, as
iny hionourable friend suggested, but should
also investigate the cause of divorce. I do
rot think it is suflicient inerely te say "wo
%ilido thiis" and thoen proceed to do it. Parliameot should invcstigate before it decides
how Ibis matter of divorce is to be hiandled.
I recognize that a large majorîty of the people
of Quhbec arc opposcd to divorce as a method
cf separation. The church to which they
belong prohihits divorce, and 1 eau under-stand and appreciate that point of view.
for eue xxiii nover do anything to offend the
convictions of the majority, in Quebec or any
other province, on questions of this kind. But
1 suggest that this is a subject which sheuld
jrnvcstigated, though perhaps
ho thorouall
not iii public, and that the Sonate should
invite other organizations te participato in
the inquiry. If one may use a medical term,
there should be a clinical examinatien.
As I have pointed eut, in the 317 cases I
exaniincd forty-four petitioner,---39 women
and 5 mnienwerc less than twenty-five years
nid. I should like te hiave an inquiry inte the
hackground of tliese cases for the purpose of

JULY 9, 1947
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. But the number of
divorces is increasing in every province every
year. The tendency was the same before the
war; and although, but for the war, the
increase might have been less, there is definiteiy an increase. 1 think the reason that
more applications were received this year is
that there is more money around. I asked
severai applicants why, when the cause they
alieged occurred ten or eigbt or five years ago,
they had not brought the applications eariier,
and they said, "Weil, 1 simpiy did not have
the money. Now that 1 have the money 1 arn
suing for divorce."
Hon, W. RUPERT DAVIES - I intend to
be very brief. I arn not going to discuss the
question of divorce, although 1 have very
de~cided opinions about it. I agree with the
chairman of the divorce committee (Hon. Mr.
Aseitine) that divorce should be iiberalized.
1 also agree with the honourable senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) that it is useless
to say that we should not have divorce. We
have it, and we have it in a big way.
What I rose to suggest is that, as the hearing
of divorce petitions bas become a very large
part of the work of the Senate, and as it
devolves upon a small committee, the niemabers of tl:e committee should ha paid. We
have now set up a court-for the Senate committee is practically a court-which coiiected
Iast year for the Dominion of Canada $65,000.
The burden is increasing every year, and I
do flot believe that day in and day out, and
throughi week-ends when the rest of us are on
holidays from the Senate, the members of
this committee should ha expected to devote
their time to the performance of this work
without seme recompense. As the bonourable
scnator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) said,
we shaIl have more divorce petitions next
session. I do not know what is the proper
procedure, but it seems to me that it is about
time that some consideration was given to
paying a fac to the members of the committee.
Hon. J. J. KINLEY: As a junior member
of the divorce committee, having been a
member of it for but two sessions, I shouid
like to take this opportunity to pay a compliment, to those who acted as chairmen of
the committee, namely the honourable senator
from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), the
bonourahie senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig) and the honourable senator from Westmorland (lion. Mr. Copp). Regarding what
may be termed the virtue of this divorce
court of the Senate, I believe that ail honourable memibers will agree that the three
gentlemen 1 have named wouid adorn the
bench of any court in Canada, and in

561

addition that the members of the committee
and its sub-committees are men of knowiedge
and experience. They have devoted to this
work a great deal of time, and they have donc
a good measure of service for the country.
We are reminded-as I was, soon after I
j oined the committee-that while adultery
must be aileged in a petition for divorce,
parliament is aboya the law and can, if it sees
fit, grant a divorce on whatever grounds it
wishes. However, there are rules of the
Senate, and the divorce rules define pretty
well the grounds and terms upon which, a
divorce should be gra'nted.
As a lay member of this committee, I arn a
little timid about discussing what is largely a
legal mat-ter, but since we have suai good
chairmen, and the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) has remarlked that other
members of the committee may be said to constitute a jury, I as one of the jury, would
say, that it is composed of medical men of
axperience and business men of long training
and teclinical kno-wiedge in the affairs of the
country, and that, its virtue as a court is not
inferior to tbat of any divorce tribnunal in
the land.
I feel that I can make that statement
bacause I know something about what is going
on in provincial courts. It was an education
to me to see the efficient way in which this
work is carried on by the Senate committee.
The procedura is fairly weil defined. The
marriage, domicile and the cause-aduiterymiust ha proved, and there must be no collusion or conmivance. These points are quickly
disposed of if the evidence is good, and I
fe-el that the testimony is aiways weli considered and that there are few mistaken
deci8ions.

Attending this divorce committee has proven
to ha an experience in buman relations, but it
bas not been pleasant each morning in the
wcek to iisteîi to the sordid donuestic troubles
of unfortunate people. It bas an enervating
affect. I do not think we sbould adopt the
suggestion of tbe honourabie senator from
Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies) in regard to.
paying the members of the committee, but it
is my opinion that they should ha changed
each session. Coming bere year after year
and listening to divorce trials is bound to
affect a man's mentaiity, I have always fait
that it was rather unfair to ask the leader of
the opposition to be a member of the divorce
committea, and I think wa shouid ha very
grateful to him for giving up a great deal of
bis valuable time to act as a sub-cbairman of
the committee.

SENATE
_As thr chairiman of the divorce committee
(Honi. M\r. Aseltine) and the sub-cbairman
(Hon. Mir. Haig) have both said, there is a
generai need in r'elation to the divorce preble", tiîî-ougbýout this country, and there Iuts
to lic ý4onîc way of dealing witli the matter.
Itccî
to me( that because marriage and
ivor ce, under Section 91 of the British North
Amierica Act, are the responsibility of the
Pariliamoint of Canada, the federal governimcnt
could establish a divorce court in Qucbec if
ii wi.shed to dIo se. There are remsous îvhy
that ba,, îot bccn donc, but 1 arn not going to

JULY 9. 1947

The divorce commitfee lias worked persistentiy throughout flic session. On the presentation of fhis report by flie ciairman (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) 1 have taken occasion ta convcey to the Senaf c a few impressions that I
have reccived whulc scrving as a very humble
member of tlic committcc.
Hon. CYR ILLE VAILIAN_1COURT (Translation) :Honourabie sena tors, I should like f0
add a word, since flie discussion scems fa
liave revoivcd around tlic province of Quebec.
I amn aiarmed af flic increase in flic numiber of
divorce pefifions, nof only fron flic province
of Quebcc, but from other parts of tlic counfry.
These iasf fcw days I made a brief survey by
examining flic divorce reports from flic
province of Quelice. I nofed fliat over ninefy
per cent of flic pefifions come from a single
cify, whie flicre wcre pracfically none from
other parts of tlic province.
We are now wondering liow we carn besf
remedy this cvii, and severai practical suggestions have licen offercd. Do you not raflier
f hink, honourabie senators. fliat flic reai cause
of this evil is fa lic found in flic hearfs and
minds of men? The mind is aiiing and tlic
heart is even sieker. If we wisli aur country
fa go forward in ifs devclopmcnt and if we
wisi f0, build a nation, not on ruins, but on
life, we must deveiop flic sense of spiritual
values fa lie, found in flic mmnd, and fhe moral
values found in flic heart. These values are
fa lie found in flic home wliere fliere is sfill
faifli in God. However ingenious flic means
fliaf we may resort fa in our efforts fa curb
thie risc of divorce, f0 prevent flic dcgeneracy
of flic human race, fley will lie of no avail if
we pusli God out oS flic door. If, in years
gane by, flua affliction was nof wif h us, if is
because in fliose days men learned from flic
cradle fa pray fa God and fa believe in Him.
Wlieflir if lie at flic foot of flic altar, or in
flic presence of a minister or of a judge, if is
God wlio wifnesses flic oafli of fidelify, and
lie or she wlio profanes thaf oath knows fliat
flic breaking of if is perjury. Do people fýhink
sufficientiy fliat fhey are thus calling God fa
* wifness?
How can we cure this social cancer? One is
terrified af flic thouglf fliaf in flic United
States one ouf of evcry flirce marriages ends
in divorce, and that in British Colum-bia, as
stafcd by flic honourable senaf or for Saskafcliewan-West -Central (Hon. Mr. Aselfine),
flicre i.s anc divorce ouf of every five
marriages! I ask you, is if possible under
sucli conditions f0 develop a country in
peace, .franquilify and brothcrly love? Man's
firsf love is for his parents, then cornes flic
love of onc's wife or husband. That love
is learned in flic home. That flicre sliouid

563

be exceptions, unliappy homes, is inevitabie,
because no man-made law is perfect and there
are exceptions to crvery rule. As my old
father used to say: "You must not throw
the skin after the beast, if might turn ouf
to be useful". There wiii always be exceptians to general laýws. It wili neyer be
possible to cure this cvii by means of law
based on exceptional cases.
So I beg my colleagues from Quebec, our
clergy and ail those who hold dear the future
of our country and of our race, to cease
indulging in negative, propaganda of flic "don't
do this. don't do thaf" varicfy. I ask tliem
rather f0 heraid the cry: "Believe in God.
believe in the life of the spirit, and you wiil
soan find that tomorrow's world wiil be better
than the world of today".
(Tcxf):
Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON.
Honourabie scnators, I do flot think I can
usefuiiy contribute anything to the general
discussion on the report, but I wish to take
adva-ntage of this opportunity to express, both
in my officiai eapacity and personally, my
appreciation of the services that have been
rendered f0 fthe Senafe by honourable mcmrbers of flic Standing Committee on Divorce.
In tlic discharge of their duties they have had
a difficuit task, involving long hours and conTIhe Senate and flic
f înued application.
country are indebted f0 the chairman of the
commitfce (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), flic deputy
chairman (Hon. Mr. Haig) and ail ather nicrbcrs for their excellent and arduous services.
I hope flic other members of fthc commitfee
wiii not think if amiss if 1 refer parficularly
to the deputy chairman. That hie, who is
cliarged with the responsibilifies aftaching f0

the office of leader of the opposition in flic
Senate, sliould continue to give so liberally of
bis fime and great abilities f0 the work of
flic divorce commitf ce, is an indication of a
very higli sense of duty. I know the other
members of the commiftee wiil j oin with me
in this fribufe f0 him.
Rame Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. GUSTAVE LACASSE: Honourable
senators, 1 hope the honourabie leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) did *nof
take flic floor for the purpose of shutting off
flic debafe.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I did flot mnove
adoption of the report.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE:- I wish f0 make a few
remarks, which I think will serve some good
purpose. First, I caîl attention to a stafement
made by the -leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig).
In fairness to hima I shouid say that I do not
think lie fully meant what his words conveyed,

564

SENATE

or at least what they sounded like, when he
said that any fool can say there should not be
any divorce. That statement is an indictment
of more than 40 per cent of the population of
Canada. In the name of that more than 40 per
cent I do say that there should not be any
divorce.
Hon. Mr. VAILLANCOURT: Right.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I feel that I am doing
a favour to the honourable leader opposite in
drawing his attention to the remark, which
was made in the heat of debate and the purport
of which, as I say, I do not think he fully
intended.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I was not casting any
reflection on any one. I said that no one
who heard the evidence we heard could say
that there should not be divorce in those cases;
and I still say that.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I am sorry that my
honourable friend did not give me time to
finish what I wished to say.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But I want to keep the
record correct.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I was going to say, in
fairness to mv honourable friend, that later in
his speech he made himself much clearer than
lie did at first, and I do appreciate that.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I want to express my
thanks to the chairinan of the committee for
presenting unquestionable figures which give
the lie to a certain section of flic press of
Canada that is continually emphasizing and
drawing a wrong conclusion from the fact that
all the divorce applications considered by our
committee corne from the province of Quebec.
J hope that in the future those figures will be
quoted for the true enligtenment of the people
of Canada. What was even more generous and
magnanimous on his part, was that he made
a comparison involving his own province of
Saskatchewan.
I also wish to comment upon -the argument
raiscd by my friend from Queen's-Lunenburg
(Hon. Mr. Kinley).
He emphasized the
suicriority of the Senate committee on
divorce over the courts, and on that score I
readily agree with him. But he socms to be
illogical when he indicates that he is in favour
of imposing divorce courts on the only province which bas not got them as yet. I may
have misinterpreted his meaning, but I take
his words as I hear them.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Will my honourable
friend permit me to explain? I do not want
to impose divorce courts on Quebec. I simp'ly

stated the fact that since marriage and divorce
are federal matters it is within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada to establish
courts where and when needed.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: At least my remarks
prompted the honourable gentleman to restate his remarks, showing clearly what he
meant.
(Translation):
Honourable senators, I wish to offer my
sncere congratulations to my honourable
friend from Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt)
far his srirring and inspiring profession of
faith.
It was high time to recognize the moral
aspect of the problem of divorce and to point
out in this house and outside that the increase
in the number of divorces in Canada goes
hand in hand with the rise of immorality.
No one bas any claim to holiness, I suppose,
but there are certain basic standards that must
not be disregarded in the social life of a
country, especially when such disregard endangers net only the normal development but the
very existence of what we have agreed to call
the fundamental cell of our civilized society:
the famil.
Hon. J. E. SINCLAIR: Honourable senators, the question of divorce bas for many
years becn a hardy annual before the Parliament of Canada. I do not wish to enter into
an argument for or against divorce, but I
think it proper, as one who ha, been a member of the commiittee for several years. that I
should pay tribute to the chairman for the
way lie bas carried on his duties.
At timcs the committee bas had to divide,
and in those instances the chairman had the
a's:stance cf his deputies, the honourable
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) and
the honourable senator from Westmorland
(Hon. Mc. Copp). These two gentlemen have
hal many other duties to perform in connection with the sittings of the Sonate this year,
but in spite of that they gave good service
to the divorce conmmittee. I think that every
member of this bouse owes those three honcurable gentlemen a debt of gratitude for the
services they have rendered in this respect.
I shoild like to leave a suggestion with
honourable senators. The closing paragraph
of the chairman's report reads in part as
follows:
Your commnîittee recommends that parliament
should iiimediately seek a solution of the prob-

lem of dealing with divorce in the province of
Quiebec, other than by parlianentary action.
We are very near the end of this session,
and it is scacely feasible for us to do anything on this matter now. We should, how-

JULY 9, 1947
ever, charge the leader of tihe governrnent
with the duty of having the Law Olerk of the
Senate study this subi oct during the recess of
parliament, and of seeing to it when the next
session begins tdiat a spe-cia)d commi'ttee of this
house is appointed to deal with this particular
paragraph of the chaiýrman's report. During
the recess the Law Clerk could compile the
fa)cts and information nýecessary to assist the
committee. To this comrnittee should be
appoint4ed those senators with the most experience in the field, for tihere are many honouirable gentilemen other than those serving on
the divorce committee wtho have had wide
experience in mâtters of Iaw.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourable gentleman, if he would include in hiýs
sii.gestion that a joint committee be formed?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Wo would consider
that point when the time came. If it was feit
that a joint committee could botter deal withi
the problem, that would be the course we would
follow. I offer my suggestion as the best
method of approach to the subi oct.
Hon. L. M. GOUIN: Honourable senators, I
dýid not expect to say anything this afternoon,'
but I believe it is my duty to make a few,
short remarks on this su'bjoct.
We are dealing flot only with a question of
procedure but a question of principle. We ail]
realize, whatever may bo our points of view,
that this is a vital question, and that we must
aid sincerely try to find a remedy for the
causes which give rise to the increasing
frequency of divorce. This is flot only a legal
prohlem 'but a moral one, and is of the greatest
importance to our nation as a whole.
The attitude of members of my faith is se,
well known that 1 do flot think I need to emphasize it, but I think I am justified in repeating that we are opposed in principle to divorce,
because we believe that marriage is a sacred
and porpetual union whîch terminates only
with the death of one of the two parties. At
this time of the session I do not think I would
serve any useful purpose by prolonging this
debate, so I will only say, very sincerely, that
1 approciato very much the attitude of ail
those who, though they do flot share our views.
realize that we are sincere in our belief, and
that our ancient faith, cannot ho expected to
change.
Hon. THO MAS VIEN: I think thore is one
aspect of this problem on which wo can ahl
agree-the feeling of gratitude which we should
express to the chairmen and the members of
the committoo on divorce who, day in and day
out, during week-ends and recesses of the
Sonate, have given se much of their time,

565

attention and devotion to duty in disposing
of the cases which came hefore them. The
burden which rested on their shoulders was
almost crushing, and the report which is before
us reflects the yery difficuit situation which
the greatly augmented list of applications for
divorce has created for them. 'On this matter,
I think, we are unanimous.
Next, as a member for the metropolis of
Canada, the city of Montreal, and one who
was horn in Levis and las lived, in and practised law at Quebec for a considerable period,
I think I should express some dissent as to
the scope of the remarks made hy the honourable sonator for Kennebec (Hon. Mr.
Vaillancourt) with respect to Montreal. Like
nîl the other metropolises, Montreal is cosmopolitan; and if there is muel evil in
Montreal. not a little of it is due to some
of the people from Levis-and to others who
corne from the good old city of Quebec.
Therefore, I should net like the responsibility for what is complained of to ho
pinned on the city of Mentreal without some
of ià being distributed over a wider field,
extending even heyond the boundaries of the
province of Quehec. In the city of Mentreal
I have some very good friends from other
provinces and cities--from the Queen City,
Toronto, and from western cities as woll,
including Winnipeg, the very fine city represented by the honourahle leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), to say nothing of Vancouver and other important centres in the
various provinces of Canada.
Hon. Mr. BURCHI-LL: But none from the
Maritimes.
.Hon. Mr. VIEN: I trust that what I have
said will dispel an.y mistaken impression
which may have resulted from a few of the
remarks which wore made today. As a matter
of fact, since I live in Montreal, I may state,
that the people with whom I corne in contact
there are very good, people, and just as sound.
law-abiding and righteous as those who -live in
any other great metropolis.
We ail realize the urgency of the question
whieh has been raised, and the seriousness of
the problem which confronts us. May I suggest, as a practical solution, that we concur
in the proposai of the honourable senator from
Queens (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) that at the opening of next session a special committee of the
Sonate be selectcd to study this question and
find a solution of the prohlem. Perhaps the
geveroment leader and the parliamentary
risel of the Sonate ivill have an opportunity of studying the subjeet before next
session.

4. The Committee recommend that authority
be granted for the printing of 500 copies in
English and 200 copies in French of the proceedings of the Committee on the said subject matter; and that Rule 100 be suspended insofar as
it relates to the said printing.
lon. Mr. DONNELLY: Honourable senators at the meeting this morning I was very
much impressed by the fact that ail the
memlyers of the commit-tee seemed to feel
that they were dealing with a very important
subj ectL
Evidence was presented to the
committee indicating a ýstrong likelihood that
in the near future Canada will be unable to
obtain what is required for the manufacture
of fertilizers. Sources of supply that are now
available in Canada may be soon exhausted,
and there is a possibility that, this country
will be unable to import as much fertilizer
as it formerly did.
Such a situation wouîld, have a very serious
effect on the food problema of this country as
well as on our agricultural industry. It was
feit that tlîis matter could not be dealt with
now and receive the attention it deserves; but
before the committee adijourned this morning
the opinion was strongly expressed that next
session. this matter should he referred to one
of the Senate standing committees or to a
specially appointed committee for the purpose
of study, and in the hope that the problem
might be solved.
The motion was agreed to, and the report
was adopted.

DIPLOMATIC SERVICE (SPECIAL)
SUPERANNIJATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT (for Hon.
Mr. Robertson) moved the second reading
of Bill 412. an Act to, provide superannuation
benefitis fotr senior appointees of the Department of External Affairs serving outside
Canada.
H1e said: Honourable sena tors. I trust that
those members of the Senate who are interested in this bill will have perused the discussion in another place, as reportedi in Hansard.
The Minister of External Affairs. who sponsored the bill there, was at considerable pains
to give details concerning individuals affected
by the measure, the amounts of their salaries,
and thieir possible pensions. The debate in
the other place dealt almost excliîsively with
personal details, and to a certain degree some
invidiaus distinction was d.rawn between different classes in the civil ser-vice. I do not
intend to retrace that ground. because I think
it fails entircly to cover the importance and
real purport of tbe bill.
The bill affects three classes of people. The
minister stated that two of these classes
comprise twelve persons, six of wvhom would
not otherwise be entitled to any superannuation alhowance. and. six of whom would get
some increased benefit from the time spent
with the Department of External Affairs. The
third chass. which is referred. to generalhy in
clause 2 of the bill. would represent "such
other persons of comparable status scrv ing in

568

SENATE

another countr'y in the public service of
Canada as the Governor in Council may
designate".
In replying to questions about the third
category the minister explained that it might
becoîne necessarv for Canada to hav e a permanent reprcsentative at the seat of the
United Nations, and that if the work lie was
doing tbere ivas of similar importance to that
performed by an ambassador lie might become
a permanent officiai of the Departmcnt of
External Affair-. and as such entitled to pension bcnefits.
1 should like to empliasize whiat 1 think
rnav be coiksidercd ns the real purport of the
bill. For sorne lime now this country lias
been asumiing its responsibilities in the field
of internaiLtiona.l relations. As everyoae bore
know s, i le wai causcd those respon ebilities to
inecase at a far greater rate than any one
liad previously ant icipated. Consequently, the
De1 artmont of External Affairs is obliged to
pay the elosest attention to the qualities and
capabilities of the serv ants wlîom it engages
to represcnt this country abread. in making diplomnatie appointrnents two fields have
been drawn upon. I think that for some years
now the tendency lias been to draw upon the
Exiernal Affairs service itself, to develop iii
oui cmbassies, legations and consulates a type
calleti 'career men' frein arnongst those wbo
have entered the service when fairly young
and been gradually promoted as they gai'ned
experience and proved their ability . The
other field wbich lias been drawn upon is that
of ]aymen of outstanding qualifications who
have been available to serve Canada in
foroiga count ries.
I think it will be geneî'ally admiitted that
anv man w-ho agrees to cut himself away frorn
bis business or professional interests in Canada in order îo serve this country abroad as
one of its cbief representatives in maintaining
t le status of nationbood whbieb we now dlaim
for oîirselvcs. is deservirg of the higliest consicleration fromi parlinînent and bis fellowcitizens. It seenis to me that, by way of
i'ecogniziog tlie imp)ortance of that service and
ibe increasing dernand fbat will ho made upon
the country for qualificd appointees, we should
wihout becsitation adopt the provisions of this
bill fer pensions covering periods of service
r.anging fiomi fi' e years or loss up to twenty
a:îd fbîrtv y cars.
The îletaiL, of the pensions are set out
pie 1it '
vfinitely in clause 5 of the bill and
w cie( explaicî with great clarity by the minister in thle olet
behouse. If nv member of
tbe Seinae desires to biave more specific

information on the pensions relating to the
twelve individuals referred to in the Hansard
report of the debate in the other place, this
bill could, affer second reading, ho referred
to the Standing Cornrittee on External
Relations.
Incidentahlv, rnay 1 take tbis oppertunity of
pointing ont a typographical error in flic Order.
Paper, wbich announees a rneeting of the
('onîrniittce on External Relations at Il p.ni.

ineinbei- thiat the correct tirne appears on the
noti(-e board dow nstaiix.
I arn entirelv in the liands of tbe Sonate as
lu wblihr this bill sboul(l bi rcferred to a
coînittec. Per.sonally, 1 think the principle
of ftic bull iz vr clear. I bave no intention
aînd I tliink it undesirablc to enter into a dis(îi1-ion of personalities sncb as chîaîacterized
tLe entre debate in the offier place.
lon. JOHN T. HAIG: ilonourable senator-7, 1 do net intend to indulge in the sort of
deliate te whici rny Lonourable friond objeets.
and I ar not anxieus, that the bllI should, go
te cernmittec.
My feeling in thîis matter is that the pensions
te be graiîted are very higli. If tîmese persons
were, as my friend callcd tliem, "caicer men"
who bail worked up througli the department,
tbe ' would corne under the regular superannuaflion, subjeet to any extensions granted to them.
Witlî that arrangement I arn in entire agreement. But I do feel that the proposed pension
to tliose outsiders is very high. For instance,
suppoSe ibese mon cýerve five years at a salary
of $10»90 a year: a large part of that money
Nvill be used in expenses, and they will bave
certain allowances. After five years service
they inay go on a pension for the rcst of their
li vos.
Hon. Mr. ILAMBERT: At about a thîird of
fbeir salary.
Hon. -\I. HAIG: It is fiftcen-fiftbits of
f leir average silary. On a salary of $10,000
tLe pen-in woild, be 83,000.
I arn not accusing thîe goveroment of anyxtliing impreper, but tlîis lcaves the door open
for ý;ome futlure gox erinent, te take adxvantage
of such a. provision. Suippose a person wlîo is
fifcv-nine years old is put in office for a period
lir.îre
e woîild hav e te rernain
of five
six yeàrs, to reach sixty-fivelie tdieu woîild
bo gix un a pe n-ion of $3,000 a vcar. Jn mvy
opinion that is tee mîteb.

JULY 9, 1947
I think our diplomats ought to be trained.
I arn entirely in accordance with the policy
adopted by the Department of External Affairs
whereby it trains men such as the present
Under Secretary of State for External Affajîs,
wbio was trained here and then sent to
Washington where hie became an ambassador.
Another instance is that of the High Coinmissioner in London.
1 do not wjsh, as I said, to indulge in a
discussion of personalities. As a matter of
fact, the persons that I know who are mentioned in the bill are well qualified for what
they are doing. But I do not like the
principle of the measure.
However, 1 do not regard the bill as important, and I would agree to giving ýit second
and third readings today.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shahl the
bill be read the third time.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Witb leave of the
Senate, 1 move third reading now.
The motion was agreed to, the bill was
read the third time, and passed.

CIViIL SERVICE SUPERANNUATION
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. CHARLES L. BISHOP (for Hon.
Mr. Robertson) moved second reading of
Bill 415, an act to amend the Civil Service
Superannuation Act.
H1e said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill, a response to many urgings and
recommendations, is to make a numbe-r of
important changes in the act, designed to meet
certain new conditions arising out of the war
and to increase the general efflciency of the
service.
The first major change is the lowering of
the retirement age. At present the age for
voluntary retirement is 65 years, and for compulsory retirement 70 years, subject to extension by order ini council for a further five
years. The government bas decided to reduce
the voluntary retirement age to 60 and the
compulsory retirement age to 65, subject to
extension up to five years by reason of
peculiar efflciency or fitness for the position.
Provision is made that no civil servant will
have to retire because bie bas reached the age
of seventy until two years after the act bas
corne into force. After August 1, 1957, no

569

additional retirement benefits may .accrue
after the age of 65 years. Tbe effect of these
provisions wvi1l be earlier retirernent, both
voluntarily and otberwise, witb a resultant
increase in efflciency and more rapid prnmotion.
A second major change provided for in the
bill is designed to remove one of the malin
obstacles to mobility in the civil service.
Previously, an annuity wvas granted only to
civil servants who had Qerved a minimum of
ten yoars and who had reacbed retirement age,
or wcre incapacitated or retired bccause their
office had been abolisbcd or they were inefficient. In aaiy other case a retiring civil servant
got onIy the amount he had, contributcd te the
superannuation fund, without intcrest, or,
alternatively, a gratuit.y rf one inontb's pay
for each year of service. This provision
involved too drastie a penalty in the case of
an employee who wished to leave the service
or an employer who wished to get iid of
incompetent employees.
It is now proposed to eliminate this tenyear rule for most purposes, and to provide
a d-eferred annuity in cases where at presenit
only a return of contributions or a gratuity
may be granted. Any civil servant contributing to the superannuation fuad may now retire
and carry with bim bis fulîl pension benefits
if he bais servedi for t.wenty ycars, and benefits
on a reduced scale if be hîas served less than
twenty years.
Furthermore, any civil-servant-contributor
wbo retires with hess than ten years' service
may now be granted an annuity deferred to
age sixty, on a scale adjusted downward hy
one per cent for each year of service less than
twenty. If he d-ies, bis adjusted annuity is
paid immediately to his widow or dependents.
The effect of the different changes will be to
very muchi reduce the financial penal-ty
involved in rctiring from the civil service
before the retirement age. It will also enable
employees of a number of government boards
and agencies to participate in the superannuation plan.
It is aisa proposed to remove many of the
financial difficulties which prevent persons
emphoyed in other fields from joining the
civil service. One of these obstacles concerns
persons wbo are at present employed in fields
other than the civil service and wbo are contributing to some forma of pension plan. If
they enter the civil service tbey lose their
pension rigbts in their old employment, witbout being able to receive comparable protection in the civil service. It is now proposed1

SENATE
that, sucl persons mav count their period of
emîiloynient in sucbi 'pensionable employmentý as service for purposes of the Civil
Serv ice Superlannuation Act, if thoir entry
int the civil scrvice invulves loss of for-mer
pension righrs. and if they agree te contributn wice the amount of the regular cone
tributimons, with intercst, to cover their own
and the govcrnment's share. This will make
ià possibîle for, persons in outside empleynient to enter the civil service without loss
of puinrighuts and with litile financial sacrifice.

BIRTHDAY

FELICITATIONS

ilonourable
Hon. M.ROBERTSON:
sntrsome time ago 1 made reference to
the birthday celebration of the senior senator
of this bodyv. I should like to have extended
that practice, and to have congratulatcd al
hionourable senators upon their birthdays. But
that migbt be dangerous, for should I slip
at any time, and fail to do so, it would
resoît in unfairness to the person overlooked.
Howcver, 1 hope that bonourable senators will
pardon mie If I refer to the fact that today is
the birthdav of my very distinguisbed deputy
leader (Hon. Mr. Copp).
Some lion. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hou. Mr. ROBERTSON: I could not let this
opportunity pass, hecause, during the time
whicbi I have occupied the position of leader
of the govcrnment, it bas heen my good
fortune to receive much good counsel and
f-iendly assistance from hlm. His great experience in public affairs bas given bimi a sound
knowledge of ail problems.
1 realize that every birtbday makes one
older; but may I say to my bonourable fricnd
that biirthdays; make no apparent difference
in him.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Whatev er otber
cifect the years may have on him, tbey seem
onhy to perpetuate bis cbarm, boyisbi activities
and enthusiasm. I hope that hie will long be

spared, so that wc may continue to enjoy bis
companionsbip and the henefit of bis wvide
experience.

Sorte Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: By a remarkabhe
coincidence tbe bonourable senator from
Waterloo (lion. Mr. Euler), wbio sits immediatcly beside the deputy leader, is also celebrating bis birthday today. Although the bonourable senator is not here, I wisb to extend to
hlm our bappiest felicitations.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: 1 certainly wish ta
join in tbe congratulations to the honourable
senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Copp).
It took me quite a while to get acquainted
witb the bonourable senator. I bave heen
bere twelvc ycars and it bas only heen during
the past year that I have come ta really

know himi; but the longer I know him the
better I like him, and 1 hope that the next
twelve years; will have the same effeet on
both of us.
1 arn sorry that t-he honourable senator
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) is not in
his place today, for I also wish to extend
hirthday congratulations to him. 'While I
generally disagree with the honourable senator, I like to hear hlm talk.
Alt.bough I do not feel that extending hirthday felicitations 8bould be a regular custom
in this chaniber I certainly want to extend my
congratulatory remarks to these two honourable senators. The difficulty in connection
with extending birthday greetings here is that
honourable senators neyer know whether
thnse oif us who celebrate our hirtbdâys when
the bouse is not sitting ever get any older.
1 offer you, sir, (Hon. Mr. Copp) on behaif
f this side of the bouse beartiest congratulations, and may you have many years yet to
give us the benefit of your wisdom and
experience.
Some hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. B. COPP: One could nlot listen to
the flattering tribute paid by the honourable
leader on this sicbe (Hon. Mr. Robertson) and
the bonourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) without tbinking of another occasion
wbich we are ail forced, to contemplate, sometimes unwillingly. When I came into this
chamiber, some twenity-two years ago, trihutes
were paid only to those members wbo had
passed away. That was a very good custom,
because anyone who knew something bad of
a deceased member dared not say it, and the
deceased member himself could not hear al]
the good tbings that were said about him.
I arn glad to have the opportunity of saying "Thank you" to my associates biere for
the kind words--exaggerated to some degree,
I must acimit-that have been said about me
andi my appearance. I had a desire to live
as long as I could, even hefore I came into
the Senate.
Some Honi. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Now my desire in that
regard is aven stronger. Some years ago I
tried to curb -the activities as record'ed on my
life's speedometer, and to some extent I have
succeeded. I have net been able to make
any change in the caliendar, however, and the
y-ears corne and the years go.
My leader referred to my boyish appearance and actions. I do not know wbat informat-ion he possesses about my actions, but
tonighit 1 sh-al have a specially good look in
the mirror to sec how murli hie bas exaggerateci. 1 may say that 1 bave to some degree

energies of the honourable members of the
House of Commons. That house is faced year
after year with the difficulty that at the beginning of the session four or six weeks are
entirely taken up with the debate on the
address in reply to the Speech from the Throne,
During this period the Senate bas no business
to do, and consequently meets only briefly
and then adjourns for a time. For honourable
senators who live in the vinicity of Ottawa
that arrangement is perhaps not inconvenient,
but for those who come from a distance and
have to arrange their business affairs before
leaving home, it is often very embarrassing
and discouraging.
It is therefore reasonable, I think, for me to
ask that consideration be given now to the
suggestion that more legislation be introduced
in the Senate so as to permit of us utilizing
our time during the first month or six weeks of
the session, thereby depriving the departments
of at least one excuse for delay in preparing
their legislation for introduction in the early
weeks of the session.
As I have already said, the responsibility
of making a decision was left to me. Had it
not been for a remark made yesterday by a
member in the other place, I do not know
what I would have donc. That remark, however, dissipated my indecision. Honourable
senators know that yesterday a resolution was
presented elsewhere in anticipation of the
introduction of a bill to provide additional
annual allowances to the leader of the government and the leader of the opposition in
the Senate. They may recall also that opposition was voiced by a member .of parliament,
Mr. Knowles, who purported to express the
official attitude of the C.C.F. Of course I
must thank him, as no doubt my honourable
friend.the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig) would wish to do, for prefacing his
remarks with the statement that he was not
expressing any criticism of the honourable
senators immediately affected; that there was
nothing personal in his opposition, but that it
was based on a maïtter of principle. I will
quote one sentence from his speech which has
changed my mind and definitely induced me
to go ahead at this time. He said:
To us the function played by the Senate in
our Canadian life is a useless one, and to be
strengthening its position in this way just does
not come very well from a Liberal government.
This remark calls for one or two comments.
Although by tradition and instinct I may be
counted a strong party man, I have never
thought that my party had any monopoly
of good intentions. The goodwill with which
I credit the official opposition I extend also
to other and smaller political groups. I am
frank to say that I always enjoy getting the

other man's viewpoint, and I make no exception of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. I look upon myself as being a liberal
in a sphere not confined to politics; and if I
find in some other parties evidences of liberal
instincts, I am not to be put in the position
of opposing some reform merely because they
advocate it.
On the general question of social security
there is not much about the policy of the
C.C.F. of which I can complain, except that I
think they attempt to go too far and too fast.
I hope that my humanitarian instincts are no
less keen than theirs. I have never been terrified
by the general policy of nationalization; it
depends how far it goes. As a liberal member
of a government that is operating a railroad,
an airways system and various other public
services,

I

could

not

consistently

oppose

nationalization. I bear in mind also that I
am speaking in a province which has public
ownership of the generation and distribution
of electric power, and, has had it so long that
most people have forgotten that it was instituted by a Conservative government. The
largest city in Ontario operates its own transportation system, and similar enterprises are
carried out under public ownership throughout
the length and breadth of the country. In the
province from which the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) comes, a coalition
government of Liberals and Conservatives
operates a public telephone system.
I have no doubt that as time goes onwhether public ownership be right or wrongour governments, federal, provincial and municipal, will continue and enlarge activities of
this kind, and all these will be judged on their
merits. But if they announce their intention
to nationalize every phase of production and
distribution and to place the control of the
whole economic life of this country in th'e
hands of a few people, I shall ask someone who
is skilled in the fine points of the law to tell
me what difference there is between a state
organized on those lines and Soviet Russia.
I am ready to give the C.C.F. credit for good
intentions so long as it is not their policy to
embark on a programme of that kind. I have
been privileged to meet and to know various
men who are prominent in their councils. I
can respect their viewpoints even when I disagree with them, and I do not asperse their
motives. But I say, with all the emphasis at
my command, that if the considered purpose
of the C.C.F. party is to belittle the influence
and gradually accomplish the dissolution of
this chamber, the traditional bulwark of the
rights of minorities, whether racial, religious,
or-as in the case of the maritime provinceseconomic, their policy is a menace to the
future of Canada.

SENATE

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have no hesitation about making that statement, and I
associate with it the remarks I previously
made.
What I am proposing, honourable senators,
I have hurriedly
contains nothing new.
looked through the records and I find that
so long ago as 1868 the very matter which I
am suggesting for your consideration was
before the Senate. It came before this house
in 1868, 1874, 1879, 1882, 1908, 1918, 1921, 1931,
and 1934; but I cannot find that a formal
change of our rules to permit this proceeding
was ever made. The motion I am proposing
is, so far as I remember, in the exact phraseology of one which was proposed about the
year 1934, but was not proceeded with. In
1944, prebably as a result of unaniýmous consent, the then Minister of National War Services, the Honourable J. G. Gardiner, was
accorded the privileges of this bouse. In
reading the report of the Senate debates, I
notice that Honourable Mr. Dandurand, the
then leader, stated that the iinister was
prepared to attendand, if the Senate bas no objection, he is
ready to sit by my side and answer directly,
and not through me, the questions you may ask
him. Is that satisfactory?
The Right Honourable Mr. Meighen then
said:
That is quite a change. I have no objection.
It will be a precedent, though, which will likely
be invoked for a long time to corne.
I think that took place.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It did.

I was present.

had more experience tian I have had in the
history of this bouse would know.
I make this proposal because it will give
me an opportunity to learn what tangible evidence there is of our willingness to co-operate.
I do not regard the proposal as a panacea, and
I should like any honourable senator to say
whether he is opposed to it or is in doubt as
to what it might accomplish. If future circumstances warrant me in doing so, I shal
not Lesitate to adivise this house that the
proposal lias accomplished nothing; but I
should like to choose this moment to say to
the government, the House of Commons, and
the nation as a whole, that although this may
not turo out to be the most effective method
of accomplishing our desire to render good
service, I think, nevertheless, it should be
given a trial. If a provision in accordance

with this proposal were placed upon our
statute books or in our rules, and someone in
authority doubted that it would accomplish
anything and suggested that there was some
better method, I would raise no objection in
having it removedi. Common sense dictates
that the condition which is now beginning to
prevail in the Canadian parliament should be
rectified tbis vear. From the verv drop of
the hat, from the beginning of the present
se-ssion the House of Commons has been sitting constantly, every afternoon and evening,

a meniber is charged with the responsibility
on behalf of his constituents, of being present
at morning and sometimes evening committee
meetings. In addition, each member bas some
interest of bis own to which he should give
sorne consideration. No one can tell me that

po-sibly bring their best intellect to bear on
important questions that come before them.
Froim the ministers down, the members of
the House of Commons are having their capacities taxed to such an extent that many of
them will collapse physically as the result of
the strain.
What is the situation today? Here in the
Senate is a body of men who have well and

incorporated in Hansard. Why it is the very

service to their country.
Consequently I
say to my colleagues that for the mutual
benefit of all concerned the Senate should be
permitted a larger share in the work -of the
Canadian government.
Honourable senators, because of the existing situation and the remarks made in this
connection in the House of Commons, I would
ask that you give this proposal as speedy consideration as is reasonable.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I do not intend to speak on the motion,
because it was only a few hours ago that I was
first advised by the leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) that this proposal was
going to bo introduced. In the first place, I
always like to make up my own mind as to
what I should do, and when I have done
that I consuit my party. Frequently I have
had to change my mind, but at least I have
first had an opportunity to consider the proposition myself. On such an important matter as this I would not for a moment suggest
what either the house or the group on this side
should do. I do not look upon this as a
party question at all, but rather as a matter
which concerns the best interests of the
Canadian people.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is the only criterion
hy wbich I feel this matter should be judged.
All should be given time to consider this proposal, and for this reason I intend to move
the adjournment of the debate. Nothing can
really be accomplished at this late date, and
the interval between now and next session will
provide parliament and the Canadian people
with an opportunity to study this matter, so
that when we meet again the proposal may
be actively considered.
I did not want to raise this point, but I
believe my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) transgressed against the rules just
a little. I do not for the world want to
object now, but I think the xules should be
observed in the future. I am confident that
His Honour the Speaker was aware of what
was happening, because I saw him flinch
slightly. The rule I refer to provides that an
honourable senator must not, while in this
house, refer to and answer a speech made by
a member in the other place. The infringement of that rule, if permitted, can only lead
to disputes between the two houses.
Great Britain faced the same problem that
confronts us. Maybe the House of Commons
over there went too far in the steps it took,
but it did limit debate. There is further

precedent in the limiting of debate by the
House of Representatives at Washington.
Debate has also been limited to some degree
even in the United States Senate. That house
used to have filibusters. It came pretty close
to having one recently on discussion of a
presidential veto, when one senator spoke for
eight hours and another for ten hours. A
filibuster is no longer permitted, and the
Speaker is the one who decides whaýt constitutes a filibuster. Before the anti-filibuster
cule was adopted a senator could read at
length from a newspaper anything at all,
regardless of whether it was relevant to the
bill or other issue before the chamber.
If I might, in all humility, offer a suggestion,
it would be that the House of Commons ought
seriously to consider its whole machinery.
There is no limit to the debate on the
Speech from the Throne. for instance, and
sometimes it lasts three or four weeks. The
budget is brought down several months after
the session opens. This session there was a
six-weeks debate on controls.
Everybody
knows that controls are important, but they
all were being terminated this spring except
a number that were to be extended for a year
or a little longer. When I first began to think
over this matter I felt that the government
should introduce celosure, but I am afraid of
that procedure because I think it restricts freedom of speech. Though closure may have to
be resorted to in certain circumstances, as a
general rule I am not in favour of it.
I think the House of Commons has got to
amend its rules so as to facilitate reasonable
debate, but prohibit unlimited debate. Once
the session starts that house sits every afternoon and evening, except Wednesday evening,
from Monday to Friday; and towards the end
of the session its sittings are even longer. I
do not know how honourable members over
there manage to attend to their correspondence, to say nothing of any other business outside the regular work of parliament. I am
thinking particularly of members from the
Maritimes and the West, who are unable to
make frequent trips home. In the Senate we
sit only three or four afternoons a weekwe also spend a good deal of time in committees, of course, as do members of the other
house-and there is not too much time left
for correspondence.
We are anxious to relieve the House of
Commons of some of its great burden of
work. Or, as I am concerned more with the
interests of the people than with those of
the House of Commons, perhaps I should put
it this way: we are anxious to do a good job
for the people. The Senate has its own functions to perform. I doubt that the Maritime

SENATE

provinces would have come into Confederation
in 1867 if the British North America Act liad
not provided for the establishment of the
Senate.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Or Quebec, either.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I doubt if Quebec would
have come in either. If I read the Confederatien reports aright, the Senate was intended to
be a bulwark for the Maritimes, the small
provinces. Quebec was not a small province
in 1867, but it was then, as it is to some
extcnt now, a minority province, and it bas
always looked to the Senate for protection.
Hostility to the Senate is stronger in my, part
of the country than in any other part. The
rcsson is that the people out there feel that we
in the Senate are not faniliar withs the problei of the day, that wc have a capitalistic
attitude. In that they are wrong, ab-olutely
wrong. As was pointed out in another place
one dv, a large number of senators were
ncmbers of tlc House of Commons
formerl
or of a pirovincial legislature; and a good
m any entors h ave served in a legislature as
will a' in the Hou-e of Conmmons.
Hon, Mr. L.ACASSE: And on a municipal
couicýil.
Hon. Mr. HAiG: On a municipal council, a
sîhool board and other public bodies. Any
man or woman who has represonted the publie on one or more of these bodies for any
leigth of time docs not need to be told about
the problems of the day. He or she would
never have been re-eleebcd unless familiar
with the various matters with which the
people arc concerned.
This problein is a very vexed one.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Which problem?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The problem of trying to
relieve the House of Commons of some of its
work. If a feasible scheme could be worked
out I would probably support it, but I want
to consider the matter fully and I therefore
move adjournment of the debate.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Haig was agreed
to, and the debate was adjourned.

CIVIL SERVICE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. L. M. GOUIN (for Hon. Mr. Rober-tson) moved the second reading of Bill 413,
an Act to amend the Civil Service Act.
Ho said: Honourable senators, the first purpose of this bill, wbich is popularly known as
the "Veteran's Preference Bill", is to provido
a preferenco for the veterans of the Second
World WVar. Two other main purposes are ta
provido for 'the romunoration of both tomporary employees and membors of the Civil
Service CommiK-ion. There are also somo
minor amendmcnts made to the Civil Service
AXct.
If honourablo senators turo to the first
section of the bill they will find that it contains various definitions. It deals in particular with the extension of certain preferonces to the veterans of the Second World
\Var. These preferences are the resuit of the
recommendation made by the Veterans Affairs
Committee which sat in another place last
year. The committoo recommended, in substance, thiat the preferences providod for during the hast w'ar as a tomporary measure be
'ont înued as a permanent measure in1 favoeur
of the veterans of the Second World War.
Thesc veterans' proferences ire based on the
principle of service to the nation rendercd
lw' those who sorved overseas, and apply to
those who served "outsido the western hemisphiere". That is the expression which is 110w
found in our various statutes to describo
prsons who are deemed voterans for the purpose of the vetorans' preference in the mattor
of appointmont to the Civil Service.
Section 29 of the Civil Ser-vice Act already
provides for preferences in favour cf the
vetorans of the First World War. The profcrences in favour of vetorans of the Second
WTorld War are at the present time authorized
by orders in counicil passed uncler the War
Measures Art and National Emergencv Transitional Po.wcrs Act, 1945, and bv chapters
34. 64 and 66 of the Statutes of 1946. The
first, section of the bill contains additional
definitions of persons who mnav ho regarded as
voterans for the purposo of the ' etcrans'
preference under the Civil Service Aet. This
applies to vetorans of both World .Wars.
Paragraph Mf of subsection (1) of section 1
of the bill gives a definition of "momber of
the W'omený's Royal Naval Services", a definition wliich is already contained in chapter 34
of the Statutes of 1946. Subparagraph (i) of
paragraph (g) defines a "voteran" of World
War I. and subparagraph (ii) dofines a 'x etcran" of World War IH. In the definition of
a "veter-an" of World WTar Il the test is ser-

JIYLY 10, 1947
vice outside the western hemisphere, and
domicile in Canada at the time of becoming
a member of the force or service concerned,
but there is this exception: that a person who
enlisted in the naval, military or air forces of
Canada anil is a Canadian citizen need not
have been domiciled in Canada at the date
of enlistment. As I have said, thc test is now
sýervica outside the western hemisphere, and to
arrive at a uniform basis in t'his regard it lias
been, necessary to make somne changes in
existing legislation.
The requirements for
",scrvice outside Canada" in the case of the
Women's Royal Naval Services and the South
African Military Nursing Service, for instance,
lias been altered to "service outside the western liemisphere".
Subparagraph (iv) deals with the case of
special operators, who are now required to be
"domicileil in Canada" at the date of enrolment, instead of "resident in Canada", in
order to benefit from the veterans' preference.
Sulparagrapli (y) deals with auxiliary services supervisors, for whom also the test is
"domicile in Canada".
Hon. Mr. WHITE: May I asIc the honourable gentleman a question? Does the definitien of a veteran of World War I include
women as well as men? Some women served
overseas in World War 1.
Hon.. Mr. GOUIN: The definition referred
to is taken frorn section 29 of the Civil Service Act. It says:
"Veteran" means a person wloHon. Mr. WHITE: That would include
females as well as maies.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: Under the Interpretatien Act, it would include botI maies and
fernales.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Does flot section 1
of the bill apply only to womnen?
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: Oh, no. Paragrapli (f)
refers only to members of the Women's
Royal Naval Services, but paragrapli (g)
defines "veteran," in a way that wouid apply
to both males and females. In the majority
of cases, the veterans would of course be
maies, but in my humble opinion women
veterans would flot le exciuded from this
definitioxi, even Vhiough there is special mention of women in certain services. For
instance, -on. page 2 of tIc bill there is a
definition applying to memabers of the
Womnen's Royal Naval Services and the
South African Military Nursing Service.
ThougI. I arn only too glad to attempt to
answer any questions asked. of me, I frankly
admit that, a good many matters connected
83168-37J

579

with the bill are beyond my limited knowledke. After second reading is given I will
move that, the bill he referred to the Standing Committee on Civil Service Administration, where officiais couid be questioned about
details of the pro.posed amendments.
1 corne now to subparagraphs (vi) and
(vii) of paragraph (g), which specifies classes
of persons who are not entitled to veterans'
preference. Subparagraph. (vi) excepts any
person who:
served outside of the western hemisphere or
on the high seas only in that lie was a passenger
in au aircraft, ship or other vessel, or only in
that lie underwent a limited period of training
in an aireraft, ship or other vessel incidentai to
a programme of instruction.
Subparagrapli (vii) excepts any person
who received a dishonourabie discharge or the
equivalent thereof.
Paragrapli (h) defines "western hemnisphere".
Paragraph (i) defines "ýwidow of a veteran."
Paragraphs (j) and (k) define "World War 1"
and "World War II."
Subsection (2) of section i deals 'with the
termina tion of the Second World War for the
purpose of determining who is a veteran.
Section 2 of the bill has to do with the
increase of salaries paid to the chairman and
commissioners. The bill proposes that the
annual salary of 87,000 now paid ta the chairman be increased to $10,000, and that, the
salaries of the commissioners be increased from
the present rate of 86,000 to $8,000.
Section 3 deals with the subi ect of temporary employees, which I referred to, at the
beginning of my explanation. Paragrapli (a)
of the new section 15 replaces subsection (2)
of section 15 of the present act, and provides for the payment of the prevailing rates
of pay to temporary employees outside of
Ottawa. For instance, if for a stenographer
in Montreal the prevailing rates were $125 a
month, that would be the amount paid to the
temporary civil servant irrespective of the
minimum rate otherwise provided for. Thenew
section is merely a change of wording, and fromn
a practical point of view provides the only possible way for the government to obtain
employees outside Ottawa, namely, by paying
the prevailing rates.
Paragrapli (b) of the new section '15 provides that when a temporary employee
becomes permanent lis salary shahl not be
reduced. That, I submit, is a logical provision.
We know of cases where temporary employees
would not becorne permanent, because if they
lad their pay would bave been reduced to the
minimum rate. Under this measure temporary
employees who become permanent continue to
receive at least the saiary tbey have been paid
as temporaries.

580

SENATE

Section 4 of the bill bas to do with officers,
clerks or employees in the Prime Minister's
office. Such persons who are employed on a
temporary basis are to continue to work
under prescribed conditions and at such salary
as may be fixed by the Governor in Council.
Their appointments were made under special
provisions in effect during the war, and now
that the war is over it bas been foeund necessary to make the provisions covering them
part and parcel of our statutes.
Section 5 of the bill sets out the new section
28 of the Act, and extends the right to reinstatement to veterans of World War II, who
were permanent civil servants before their
military service. Under the Act there was no
provision covering veterans of World War II
who wished to return to the government
service; and it is deemed only fair that they
should be put on the same footing as other
veterans.
Section 6 of the bill sets forth the new section 29 of the Act, and has to do with procedure. Following an examination a list of
the competitors el.igiblýe for appointment is
publisied in the Canada Gazette, and preference is given to veterans. Subsection (2) of
the new section provides that persons who are
incapacitated and receive pensions by reason
of their services in World War I or World
War II be given priority. Next in point of
preference are veterans who are not in receipt
of a pension. Also in this group are widows
of veterans, as defined in section 1 of the bill.
Paragraph (c) of subsection 2 of the new section provides for the placing of other coinpetitors in order of merit.
Section 7 of the bill sets out the new section 30 of the act, which provides that the
age limit and physical requirements applicable
to veterans of World War I be now extended
to veterans of World War Il.
Section 8, which deals with section 43 of the
Act, concerns oaths to be administered to civil
servants. All civil servants are now required
to take the oath of secrecy as well as the oath
of office. For this reason there is to be found
in section 9, the new oath to be used-what
I would call a combined oath of office and
secrecy. The new section 43 enumerates the
persons before whom the oath in question shall
be taken. There is also a subsection concerning the taking of oaths by the Clerk of
the Privy Couneil, and another subsection
which requires him to keep a register of the
oaths of office and secrecy administered to
civil servants. A new section, section 43A,
is inserted to enable the Governor in Council
to authorize any person to administer oaths,
and to take and receive affidavits, declarations

and affirmations for any of the purposes of
the Civil Service Act or of any regulation made
thereunder.
I have already mentioned section 9, which
contains schedule A, the oath of office and
secrecy.
The last section of the bill, No. 10, repeals
as a matter of course various provisions which
are no longer necessary, namely the definitions
under previous acts of the word "veterans".
Instead of these definitions being scattered
through various statutes, they will be found
in section 2 of the Civil Service Act as
amended by section 1 of the present bill.
Hon. J. J. KINLEY: Honourable senators,
I would like to make a few observations with
regard to the bill which is now before the
house for second reading. I wish to refer particularly to that part of the bill which deals
with preference. By "preference" I mean what
is usually known as the veterans preferencethat is the preference in the employment of
the country which, by statute, is given to
persons for meritorious service to their country
during the war.
I desire to deal particularly with the auxiliary services. We know that there is preference for veterans of World War I and World
War II, who were members of the navy,
army and air force, and that preference is also
given in respect of the auxiliary services.
Under section 1 "t eteran" is defined as a
person who(iv) bas been certified by the Under Secretary of State for External Affairs as having
been enrolled in Canada by United Kingdom
authorities for special duty during world war H1
in war areas outside of the western hemisphere,
and at the time of his enrolment was domieiled
in Canada;
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: May I make a remark
here?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Yes.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: That covers the case of
the special operators only.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: And the fire-fighters.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: Paragraph (iv), which
the honourable senator from Queens-Lunenburg
(Hon. Mr. Kinley) bas just read, covers the
case of special operators only, not members of
the auxiliary services who, as regards certain
authorizations, are mentioned in paragraph
(v). The special operators performed certain
work about which I have never received any
information, but the nature of which I may
leave to the imagination of honourable members. They were enlisted by the British
authorities in Canada; and I submit they have
nothing to do with the auxiliary services.

JULY 10, 1947
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Very good. I will flot
dwell on that matter now; we can consider it

in committee. A "veteran" as defined under
paragraph (y) of section 1, is a, person whoduring world war II served outside of the west-

ern hemisphere with the naval, military or air
forces of His MUajesty raised in Canada as a
"riepresentattive of C anadian Legion War Services Lue., the National Council of Young Men's
Christian Associations of Canada, Knights of
(3olumbus Canadian Army Huts, or Salvation
Army Canadian War Services," and who was
authorized so to serve by the appropriate naval,
military or air force authority and who, at the

commencement of his services with those fores
during world war Il, was domiciled in Canada.
My message to the Senate today is on
behaîf of what was known as Canada's wartime merchant navy. This bill was the subject of a keen debate in the House of
Commons; so much so, that both, the Prime
Minister and the leader of the opposition
made statements which clearly indicate that
the bill should receive the serions consideration of this bouse. Further, a member of the
C.C.F. party moved an amendment to include
members of the Canadian wartimc merchant
navy under the definition of "veterans" for
the purpose of preference in respect of cmployment in Canada.
Hon. Mr. bORNER: Do you mean merchant scamen or merchant navy?
Hon. Mr. KINLIEY: The member who
moved the amcndment refcrred to those who
served in the wartime merchant navy, wbichi
is really the merchant seamen in peacetime.
The amendment was keenly debated, but on
a point of order the Speaker ruled that it
was out of order, on the ground that a committec could not be instructed to do something whieh it already had the power to do
and had not donc. The vote, which, was on
the point of ordier, not on the merits of the
amendment itself, was carried by the narrow
margin of 93 votes to 76. That indicates that
had a vote been taken on the principle of the
amendiment it would have received a very
large measure of support.
AIl my life I have been associated with
merchant; seamen; and during the war, being
engaged in the repairing of merchant vessels
and naval shlips, I had an intimate knowledge
of what was going on.
Honourable senators, I submit that if any
men in the auxiliary services of this country
are descrving of recognition, they are the men
who wcnt to sea in Canada's merdhant navy.
These men faced two enemies. Thcy lad to
contend with the clements in a battle in
wbich there is no quarter. Anyone who lias
experienced the hazards of thc North Atlantic
in winter will know that these men wcrc truly

581

in great peril. They also had to face enemy
forces, who were ever present. I recail being
told by the master of a merchant vessel out
of Liverpool-which is in a part of the riding
that I had the bonour of representing in the
Huse of Commons--that he was torpedoed in
the Caribbcan Sea. He said that when the
men got in the boat, after the torpedoing the
enemy submarine surfaced, and its captain
called through a megaphone, "Are any of
your men missing?"
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Will the honourable senator excuse me? Is this bill fot going
to committee?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Yes, but I am speaking
on the motion for second reading and I amn
perfectly in order.
When the captain of the mcrchant vessel
replied "Yes", the German officer said that.
lie was sorry, but that hie could not give
warning because the Canadian ship had carried
a gun on ber deck and was therefore an armed
vessel. It is truc that the merchant seamen
m-ere armed. They were expected to pro-teet
themselves as best they could with armns that
were supplied them during the war. Occasionally they had the assistance of a naval
gun crew.
Another friend and neighbour of mine was
the captain of a ship that hie brought out of a
French port at a most perilous period of the
is
war. For this hie was recognized by
Majesty, and received the Order of the British
Empire. During the war hie was the captain
of a ship which sailed through hazardous
waters, but today, if hie wishes to get a job in
the Canadian Civil Service, he is given no
preference because hie is not included among
the persons who come under this bill.

reason given was that the seamen were supposed to have received bigler pay during the
war years than -the men of other services. It
is true that they did receivo good pay, but
theirs was a very perilous duty. The pay of

is claimed 'that merchaût seamen were not
cnlisted men, and; that they enjoyed a personal liberty not enjoyed by ot.hers. But
when a merchant seaman joined a ship he
had to sign articles enlisting him as a crew
member and restricting bis liherties. Anyone
who is conversant with the Canada Shipping
Act of this country knows that nowhcrc during the war was a man under more stern discipline than in the merchant navy of Canala.

SENATE

This bill does flot involve the question of
pay but of preference for services rendered;
and it does flot cost the country a cent. The
bringing of merchant seamen under its provisions would sirnply make available a greater
seleoticît of good men fur the civil service.
This does flot appoar to me to ho a "preference bill", but a "shut-out" bill for many
men, who did meritorieus service for this
coun.try during the war. The samne morchant
seamen who transported shipload after shipload cf soldiers, food, and munitions across
the Atlantic, new they find that in the preforence established for civil service jobs they
are net inceludýed because they are not
considered te bave ýbeen members cf an auxiliary scrvice under the terms cf the legisiation.
Honourable senators, I say that bccauso
morchant ships were vital te succcess ini the
war, and bccause tbc losses of personnel of
the merchant marine wcre beavior than those
cf any ether service in preportion te its
membcrs, tbcse mnen sheuld be includcd
ameng thesce whc are deemcd te be "vetorans'
fer the purpose cf the preference je the matter cf appeintinent te the civil service. The
termi 'hazarcîcus waters" dees net include the
Great Lakes, but moans waters extra-territorial te Canada. Se far as the vetcran cf
the merchant marine is ccncorned, lie would
have te be a Canadian scaman who had
servod on a Canadian ship sailing on the
high soas.
When these mattcrs arc considored, I say that by ail the rules Canada's
merohiant seamen should be included among
those te receive veterans' preforence.
A few days ago I teck part in tbe debate
:>n a bill te establish a maritime commission.
At that time 1 said the United States bad
a similar bill with a preamble. This preamble
states. in part:
It is necessary for the national defence and
developincut cf its fereign and domestie comnmerce that tdie United States shaîl have a merchant marine.
Then it goos on te say:
. . .,capable cf serving as a naval and military
auxiliary in tîrne cf w-ar or national emergency.
That shows what the peopleocf the L-Tnitcd
States think cf thieir morchant. service. Some
time ago I hâd the privilege cf hearing some
Aincrîcan officers speak before a body cf mon

JULY 10, 1947
Canada lias done "far more" for lier merchant
seamen than any other country.
Our record in this respect is good, but not
equal to that of the United States. In any
ex ent, honourable senators, we dlaim that we
have donc more for ail our armed services
than other countries have donc for theirs;
so, wh should we not do likewise for our
merchant seamen?
The report then states that the ministerrevieived the speciai benefits given the merchant
seamen and said it could not be said Canada
had tione nothing for them.
Well, I agree with that. But in view of the
statements made in another place by the
Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition, and in view of the C.C.F. amendment,
and of the vote on the point of order-a
manoeuvre which prevented a recorded vote
on the arnendment-it seems to me that the
Senate cou!d amend this bill hy making it
apply to merchant seamen. The leader of the
opposition in this house (Hon. Mr. Haig)
said this afternoon that the Senate was a
hulwark of protection for the Maritimes and
other smaii provinces. 1 accept that statement, and I trust that the merchant seamen
of this country will be able to say "Amen" to
it. It is nxy hope that in our committee
we shahl do what the House of Commons did
not do, and thus make the bill apply to merchant seamen.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourahie senators,
I should like to ask three questions with
regard to section 2 of the bill: (1) Are the

officers mentioned therein fuil-time'employees?
(2) If not, how often do they meet, and what
are their funictions? (3) What are their namnes?
I do flot know whether the acting leader of
the house (Hon. Mr. Copp) is able to give me
this information.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I have not the information, but I shall be glad to see that it is
given to my honourable friend in committee.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: I understand it is
intended to send this bill to committee.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: 1 presumne that
officiais of the Civil Service Commission or
the Treasury Board will he present at the
committee to answer the questions just asked
by the honourable gentleman from L'Acadie
(Hon. Mr. Leger) and to give any other
information that is required.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Yes.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. GOUIN moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Civil
Service Administration.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

APPENDIX 4"A"
REPORT ON INDIAN AFFAIRS
The Joint Committee of the Senate and
the House of Commons appointed to continue
and complete the examination and consideration of the Indian Act (Chapter 98, R.S.C.,
1927) and ail such other matters as have been
referred to the said committee, beg heave to
make their fourth report, as followsPursuant to orders of reference dated 13th
February, 1947, your committee bas heid 67
meetings and bas heard 102 witnesses, inchuding departmental officiais, church dignitaries
and Indian representatives from ail provinces
in Canada except the Maritimes, which were
visited last autumn by a commission under
the Inquiries Act, appointed by order in
counicil P.C. 3797, dated 1lth October, 1946.
Embodied in the minutes of evidence, as
appendices thereto, are 153 written briefs or
submissions received by your committee from

Indian bands or organizations and from other
Canadian individuais or groups interested in
the weifare and wel-being of our natives of
Indian descent. The minutes of proceedings
and evidence cover approximateiy 2,500 pages.
Your committee was instructed. to "continue
and compiete" the examînation. and consideration of the Indian Act. However, the actual
recasting, or revision of that act, which is
long overdue, could not possibiy be attempted
until a full opportunîty had been afforded to
ail interested parties to make representations
in that regard.
Your committee is agreed that the Joint
Committee on Indian Affairs which was
appointed in 1946 was warranted, as it repo'rted
to, parliament, in adopting a programme which
envisaged the revision of the Indian Act oniy
during the 1948 session of parliament.

,584

SENATE

The 19416 Joint Committee on Indian Affairs,
on August 15 last, aiso reported:
The lîearing of departmental officiais
.
bas disciosed the necessity for certain administrative improvements which can be effected
without the revision of any existing legisiation
and which, when put into cffect, wiil remove
some of the causes out of which have arisen
grievances and compiaints of many Indians"..
Your prcsent committee notes with extreino
regret that recommendation No. 8 of the said
report of August 15, 1946, which was concurred
in by both hou.es of parliament, bas flot yet
been implemented.
That recommendation was:
8.. That more direct methods be
empioyed for the retura of rentais coilected

Your committee, therefore, recommends:
1. That immediate stc1)s hc taken hy ail
responsihie officiais to remove without further
(lelay tbis iongstanding grievance with regard
to rentais due te Indians;
an(l your comimittee further finds and
recommends:
2. That a commission, in the nature cf a
claims commission, bo set up with the ieast
possible deaty to inquiie into the terms of ail

6. Certain Indian bands resident on "lands

legisiation. It is therefore recommended that
a reference be made to the proper court te
determine the iegality of any taxation imposed
on Indians;
7. That encroachments of persons other than
Indians uipon lands reserved for Indians are
no,' viewc( it~'h favour bv eithcr the members
of 'he Induen band concernc(i or bhv the Indian
.\ffairs Branch. It is recîoended that the
Indian Affairs Branch take immediate stops,
consistent with the wishes cf the Indian bands

concerned, te remove from Indian reserves aI!
persons other than Indians who reside in, or
carry on business on an Indian reserve;
8. That the whole matter of the educatien

impertant office in Indian administration, that
cf Indian Agent;
13. That the retiring beave ef any Agent er
offleer in Indian administration ho granted

of an agency is not possible, a promotion
should, when practicable, be made from junior
officers in the district who may desire promotion and who are suited and qualified for
a senior post;
18. That when promotion within the staff
of an agency is not feasible, the field of comnpetition for applications from the general
public shouid be made wide enough to ensure
the selection and appointment of a fuily
quaiified person;
19. That examinations, whenever possible,
shouid be conducted by the district offices of
the Civil Service Commission rather than at
headquartcrs of the Civil Service Commission
at Ottawa;
20. That Indian Agents who have undergone a period of probation satisfactory to the

to single out for special mention the very
valuabie contribution made by Mr. Wiliam
Zimmerman, Jr.. Assistant Commissioner of

SENATE

The fact that transportation hias been found
by the government and by private enterprise
in certain cases added fuel to the discontent
particularly of those, whose relatives have
remained unreucd.
The goverement lias endeavoured to meet
the situation by repeated requests to the
Britishi Ministry of Transport for additional
shipping, with some littie success. and by the
success-ive moderating of restrictiv e regulations.
To rnecent years, immigration las been
limnited to British subjeets. Uinited States citizens fromn that country, the w'ife and unmaried chljdren undet' 18 years of age of residents
of Cîîïada, and agrieulturists; with funds
intending to farm in Canada.
On the 26th of May, 19L16, the, government
provided by order in council P.C. 2071, for the
admission of the fathier and mother, the
uomarried son and daughiter without limitation as to age, the unmarried brother and
sister and the nephew and niece orphianed of
both parents and under 16 years of age, of
persons legally resident in Canada, who are in
a position to receive and care for siich
immigrants.
On January 30, 1947, the regulations as to
admissibility were further widened by orderin-council P.C. 371, to include the widowed
daughter and sister together ivith their unmariied children under 18 years of age, of legal
residents of Canada. and the age limitation of
orphaned nephews and nieces was raised from
under 16 years to under 18 years of age.
Provision was also made for the admission of
farma labour and of persons experienced in
mining, lumbering and logging when assiîred
of employment.
The preference extended to, single persons
and the continued exclusion of relatives on the
ground of marriage was the subjeet of many
expressions of disapproval and on the lst of
May, 1947. the Prime Minister announced that
the order-in-council as te, those admissible had
been ret ised to read as follows:
"The husband or wife; the son, daughter.
brother or sister, together with husband or
wife and unmarried cbildren if any; the father
or miother; the orphaned nephew or niece
uoder 21 years of age; of any person legally
resident in Canada who is in a position to
receive and care for sucb relatives. The termi
"lorphan" used in this clause means a child
bereaved of hoth parents."
Tlïe effect of this enactment was to wipe
out the legal ban against, marriage, and te
make admisible whole family units. short of
marîied cbildrco. when one of tbe spouses
comnes witbin the class of admissible relatives.
This chang-e xvas hailed witli j oy in tbousands
)f honmes througbhout Canada.

Up to this time, the fiancee of a maie adult
was admi,.ible but not of a female adult.
This meaot a mnan could bring an intended
wife to Canada, but a Canadian woman could
not bring bier intendod husband. This was an
uinfair and uonecessary discrimination. The
new Order abolislied the distinction. making
admis.ib le:
"A person eoteriog Canada for the purpose
of marriage to a legal resident thereof; provided tbe prospective husband is able to
maintain his intended wife."
This too. brouglbt joy in some quarters.
In bis statemient thec Prime Minister rccognized Caoada's moral obligation to as.sist in
meeting the probleni of European refugees
and disp)lziae
persoos, and arneunced that. the
goveroiment is taking steps lookiog towards
the early admis.sion to Canada of somne thonsaods of their number.
This sterment was followcd hy order-incouneril P.C. 2180, dated 6th June 1947, in
wbich authority was provided for the "immediate admission te Canada of 5,000 individuals
from tlîe displaeed persons camps in Europe."
The selection and transportation to Canada
of these persoos is under the direction of the
Immigration Brancli of the Departmeot of
Mines and Resourees, and their reception and
distribution througliout Canada is to be
arranged by the Department of Labour.
Under authority of thîs order, the department lias approved the admission of 2.620
woods workers and requests bave been received
for tue admission of garment workers,
domestie workers and others, and consideratien is being given.
The alien labour law bias been suspendcd
wlîen workers are coming to assured employmient at tîte provailing rates of wages.
Duriog recent weeks the interpretation of
tbe orders-in-council respecting admissibility
bave been relaxed and broadened. Since the
regulations bave permitted the admission of
5,000 displaced persons witbout the requirement of blond relationsbip and guarantee, the
departmcnt bias taken the logical step of
î'eceiviog ap)plications supported by guarantees
by Canadian residents for the admission of
friends now in dýisplaced peisons camps, as
well as of relatives. Frieods of Canadians who
are prepared te back tbeir frieodship with the
assumption of respoosibility are assured of
priority within tlîe limitations imposed by the
shortage of sbîppîog.
MWhile these changes in the regulations were
îaking place. the Department cf Immigration
was preparing for the mov ement cf people to
Canada whili oîa be expected te follow the
provision cf shipping. During the war, the
depaitec t 's branri offices in Europe were

JULY 10, 1947
necessarily closed, other than those in the
United Kingdom. In November, 1946, Canadian inspectional offices were opened in
France, Belgium and Rolland, and provision
was later made for the granting of visas at
Canadian missions in Norway, Swedený, Denmark, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Portugal,
Greece, Palestine, and Pretoria, South Africa.
Early this year offices bave been opened in.
Warsaw, Poland. Visas to Canada are also
granted by Canadian agencies in Buenos Aires,
Argentine; Rio de Janiero, Brazil; Santiago,
Chule; Lima, Peru; Havana, Cuba; Mexico
City, Mexico; St. Johns, Newfoundland; Wellington, New Zealand; Canberra, Australia,
Dublin, Eire; Nanking, China and Shanghai.
So that at the present time, Canada bas immigration offices in whicb visas to Canada may
be granted in 24 countries. This is a considerably larger number than existed prior to
tbe war, the added offices being necessary
because of present day restrictions on travel
in Europe.
The departmnent has enlisted the aid of the
Inter-Governmental Committee on Refugees,
and together the overseas representatives of
the department and of this committee have
been searching out persons in Europe for
wbose admission to Canada applications have
been made by relatives in Canada, or who are
in public camps for displaced persons and who
desire residence in Canada. These people in
considerable numbers are being exam'ined by
Canadian inspectional officers, whereupon the
committee officers take charge of the problemns
of individual transportation.
Medical examinations bave been conducted
witbin the camps with the aid of the InterGovernmental Committee, but in this connection great difficulty bas been -met with outside the camps, 'wbere the travel of intending
immigrants is under mil'itary -control. The
Director of Immigration is now on his way
to Europe to endeavour to facilitate arrangements for these medical examinations.
In Canada, tihe, department's officers have
been very active in receiving and reviewing
applications and, when the proposed immnigrants appear to be admissible under the
regulations, in cond'ucting investigations in ahl
parts of Canada as to, settlement conditions,
that, is to say, the financial ability of the applicants to guarantee the reception and subsequent success of the proposed immigrants. The
volume of correspondence is very great and
the rapidly gro-wing store of active files is
numbered in thousands.
A considerable number of applications have
been received from farmners seeking farm
labour hel.p, and from lumtbering, mining,

sbippîng and manufacturing companies for
men to engage in these occupations. Eaeh
application, if apparently bona fide and within
the regulations, is the subject of special
investigation.
Many requests have been
received from industrial companies seeking
skilled and unskilled labour.
Early thîs year tbe government agreed with
tbe British Ministry to admit to Canada
under obligation to work as agricultural
labourers for a .period of at least two years,
4,000 Polish soldiers from Italy. The Labour
Department and tbe Department of Health
and Welfare made the inspections of the
applîicants in Italy and 2,876 were admitted,
shipping being provided wben it suits its purposes by the British Ministry of Transport.
Since t:ben a further 1,630 Polish soldiers have
been similarly admitted from England making
a total of 4,506. These men are now working
on farms tbrougbout Canada where they are
contributin-g to the Canadian économy and
to tbe solution of the world food problem.
Your committee holds that immigration is
a proper function of government and that
under no circumstances should control be permittýed to fail into privatefhands. Sueh immigrants as are admitted should come to, Canada
under government auspices, and should be free
on arrival to accept employment from. any
employer within the class or classes of industry to which they are destined.
Such are the conditions under which 998
imm-igrants have recentýly arrived fromn Rolland. They are agriculturists displaced by
the war and for whom locations are flot available in the Netherlands. Admission of lihese
highly desirable immigrants was arranged
between the Canadian Immigration Department and the Dutceh governmient, and Rolland
provided the required shipping. Others are
expected to, follow. Every one of these immigrants bas funds in Rolland which it is hoped
will later be transferred to Canada and every
one bas been applied for by a farmer applicant in Canada who bas assured both housing
and employment and each is accordingly
destined to a predetermined farmer.
Despite tbe number of persons wishing entry
to Canada and the number of Canadjians desirîng to bring about admissions, the volume of
immigrants arriving in Canada during the first
three montbs of this year bias been disappointîngly small. Immigrants are 4,729 fewer for
that period of 1947 than for tbe corresponding
period of 1946. These entries numbered, 8,009
this year as against 12,738 last year. Tbe
figures for persons of British national origin
were 5,262 tbis year and 8,694 last year. The

SENATE
explanation of this decline is the shortage of
shipping. Last year the British Ministry provided ships for the transportation of service
men's wives and families, while for the period
under review 1,000 immigrants only were in
that category, as against 8,000 for the same
period of last year.
So far there bas been no immigration directly
from Italy, Austria, Hungary, Roumania,
Finland and Germany, for the citizens of these
countries are still deemed to be enemy aliens.
However, treaties of peace have been tabled in
parliament
between
Canada
and
Italy,
Roumania, Hungary and Finland, and. so soon
as approved and completed the enemy obstruction will not longer exist, and the Canadian
offices may be expected to be opened in these
countries.
But even if these treaties are completed as
promptly as expected, the removal of the
obstruction will apply to only the four
countries named, and the nationals of Austria,
and Germany will still remain under the ban
of a Canadian order-in-council prohibiting
immigration to Canada from enemy countries.
Your committee is of opinion that this orderin-council is now unnecessary and should be
repealed,.
The prohibition against the admission of
enemy aliens bas been moderated by the rile
as to refugees. Those who fled these countries
during the war, or who were treated as slave
labour, have not been regarded as enemy
aliens, and, some have been admitted.
It is reported, that large numbers of persons
in the British Isles are willing and anxious to
come to Canada or other of the self-governing
British countries. Various estimates of from
300,000 to still more impressive figures have
been published. Australia signed an agreement
with the British Ministry effective on and after
April 1 of this year, under which Great Britain
pays the passage of British soldiers migrating
permanently to that country. Similar agreements have not, so far been offered to other
Dominions. Australia expects a normal flow
of 70,000 immigrants annually, 40,000 of them
from Great Britain.
Twenty thousand from
Brtiain is the Australian estimate for this year.
It is estimated by Mr. Randles, of the Cunard
Donaldson White Star Line, that 25,000 will
be the maximum number of immigrants which
can be transported to Canada from overseas
this year.
Whether or not this estimate can be exceeded
will depend on the success achieved by Mr.
A. L. Jolliffe, the Canadian Director of Immigration, who a few days ago left for England
where he will urge upon the British Ministry
of Transport the desirability of a more generous assignment of shipping to the Canadian
service.

Your Committee wishes Mr. Jolliffe success,
for as stated above, se far this year the numbers of immigrants arriving in Canada is very
disappointing, and particularly so within the
classification of relatives
There are an estimated 15,000 persons in Europe for whom
admission to Canada has been requested by
close relatives within the degrees defined, who
have signed the department's form of guarantee, and who have been found by the
department able financially to discharge the
obligations assumed, and so far only 275 of
these proposed immigrants have arrived in
Canada.
This practical failure of Canadian citizens
to rescue unfortunate relatives in Europe is
due to the requisition by the British Ministry
of ships which would otherwise ply the Canadian route. The Cunard White Star Line
bas been endeavouring to procure return to
its service of several of its passenger liners
still requisitioned by the British Ministry. It
was hoped that the Ascania with 850 passenger
capacity. would be released this summer but
so far the only ship in the Canadian regular
service is the Canadian Pacific liner, Empress
of Canada, which makes its first sailing from
Liverpool on the 16th of July, supplemented
by part-time assignment of the Aquitania a
46,000 ton former troopship, which bas been
on the Canadian route since the first of the
year and is promised te remain until
September.
Dr. Hugh Keenleyside, Deputy Minister of
Mines and Resources, said recently that the
total shipping space available for all passengers is sufficient for the accommodation of
only 3,000 per month, and of these it is
expected that only 200 to 300 per month will
be immigrants.
This dismal prospect was considerably
brightened within the past few days by an
announcement that the Right Honourable
C. D. Howe. Acting Minister of Immigration,
bad arranged with the North American Transport Company for the assignment of its ship,
Huascara to the immigration service exclusively. The ship, in a damaged condition,
was turned over to Canada by the Reparations
Committee at a German port, and was
promptly sold by Canada through the War
Assets Corporation to the above company.
The ship is now in Canada undergoing repairs
and refitting and is expected to be ready for
service sometime in September. It is a fast
ship capable of a round trip every three weeks
and will carry 600 passengers.
Some few immigrants have been fortunate
in obtaining transportation to Canada via
United States ports.

JUIY 10, 1947
There bas been talk of reconditioning cargo
ships for passenger accommodation 'but tbis
is said to bc impossible by private companies
wîtbout active government
co-operation,
because passenger ships must comply witb tbe
Britisb Board of Trade regulations and this is
impracticable. A government can disregard
safety and other regulations and a private company cannot.
The cost of building passenger liners is
severai times in excess of pre-war prices, and
the sbipping companies say tbat such construction is economi-cally impossible without government assurance of continued immigration, an
assurance wbich so far has flot been given.
Your commit.tee approves tbe action of
the government in broadening the regulations
to include tbe families of tbose admitted on
the ground of reiationship. Tbat is to say, the
wives and husbands and tbe cbildren of tbe
sons and daugbters and brothers and sisters
of Canadians able and wiiling to receive and
care for tbem. The committee also approves
tbe increase in the age limit of orpbaned
nephews and nieces from 18 to 21 years. Your
committee would go further, bowever, and
recommends, tbat as soon as the main body of
the classes as now defined are disposed of by
admission or otberwise, the classes be furtber
broadened to include cousins and their families
and nepbews and nieces of ail ages and
wbetber or flot orpbaned or married.
Your committee is of opinion that generally
speaking the best immigrants obtainable are
tbe relatives of persons wbo are already bere
and who have themselves made good to tbe
extent that tbey are in a position to guarantee
tbe success of tbe newcomer relatives from
abroad. Such immigrants bave a welcome
awaiting them, and someone to aid, guide and
advise tbem on arrivai. and during tbe establishment stages following. They have a family
source from wbich to iearn the Canadian way
of life, how tbings are donc in Canada, and
bow te be successfui, and tbey bave before
tbemn an example of success. Such immigrants
are tbe most likely of ail newcomers to deveiop
into permanent Canadians and are the least
likeiy by reason of loneliness, iack of tics,
unsuccess, or otberwise, to make Canada a
mere port of entry te some other country.
For tbese reasons we recommend tbe
broadening of the regulations immediately, to
include relatives of ail degrees together with
tbeir families and without limit as to age.
Your committee favours the married immigrant over the unmarried man or woman.
Fa-eedomn from responsibiiity may be a temporary convenience under some circumstances.
but wbhen permanent citizens are being sougbt
tbe advantage of the family unit is very
great.

591

In your committee's records there appears
a statement by the Episceopate of the Province
of Quebec expressing approvai of aid by
Canada to "those displaced and wandering
populations of many European countries by
ailowing tbem te come and settie in Canada"
but the reverend bishops warn of tbe "necessity of safeguarding the peace of our constitutionally Christian country and of basing tbe
future prosperity of our country first of ail in
the family."
Your committee recommends tbat preference
be given to family groups over unmarried men
and women, and tbat efforts be made to bring
to Canada in eacb instance tbe entire family
group, s0 tbat the transplanting of the unit be
comrplete and notbing remain in Europe -to
preserve a divided interest and loyalty.
We bave bad experience in this connection.
Some years ago numbers of men arrived from
European countries, intending to bring their
wives and families to join tbem later wben
tbey had themselves become establisbed and
bad earned tbe cost of transportation. Tbe
depression of 1930 foilowed and then tbe war,
and tbe resuit is many families bave remained
separated tbrougb tbe years and are stili
separated. Such conditions are to be avoided.
It would bave been better for these people
and for Canada bad it been made possible
for ail to come togetber to the new land of
tbpir adoption.
There bas been an apparent tendency
recently in connection witb tbe immigration
sponsored by the Labour department to favour
single men and women. Tbat policy sbould
be reconsidered witb, a view to long term
advantages ratber than to immediate and
temporary convenience. In tbose. cases wben
single persons9 bave been admitted. every
facility sbould bc given for the subsequent

admission of spouses and families and fiancees.
The Stcretary of S'tate for Canada is giving
attention toe tbe problem of receiving and
weicoming immigrants on tbeir arrivai in
Canada. Representatives of bis department
baave already been active in imparting information as to Canadian civics, and what is known
as "the Canadian way of life". This is adinir-

able, and your committee beartily approves
the general prînciple of their plans, and
bespeaks tbe co-operation of tbe provinces.

It

is important tbat immigrants be made into
informed and loyal Canadians as promptly as
possible.
There is some difflcuity in laying down a
general policy, and some objection te settling
policies for months or years te come, but
sometbing of the kind is now required. Beyond

tbe order in council that Canada wili admit
5,000 displaced persons, as a part of her aid-

592

SENATE

to-Europe contribution, and the presently
defined classes of admissible persons; there is
no settled policy in existence. One may assume
what Canada will do, in this regard in the
future, but there is no pronouncement upon
which business men may rely. An immigration movement to be successful must be
organized. Ships must be provided, and shipping companies will not build or re-design
vessels for the immigrant service unless assured
for at least a few years of continuous employment. Facilities for the reception of immigrants, their primary education and training
and their settlement in rural or urban communities cannot be successfully provided on a
short term or sporadic basis. What is needed
is a steady flow of newcomers maintained over
the years, and the first essential to the planning of such a movement is the governmental
assurance that it will be permitted. Such a
pronouncement of policy would take courage,
but it would be worthwhile.
The defining by regulations of the classes
of admissible persons« has served the useful
purpose of establishing priorities for those
groups whom it was thought were most needy,
most deserving and most desirable, but such
rules, if too rigidly followed, may become
straight-jackets. It is difficult to imagine
anything more cruel than stereotyped phrases
rigidly applied as determining who can come
to Canada and who cannot. A rule differs
from a law in that it may be broken with
impunity when circumstances warrant, and
should at times be broken. In recent months
the rules of admissibility as laid down in the
regulations have been applied in a manner
reminiscent of the laws of the Medes and
Persians, which altered net. Hardship in
certain cases has resulted.
For example,
nephews and nieces who have attained 21
years of age have been flatly turned down.
Se too have the married children of sons,
daughters, brothers and sisters.
Can one
imagine a father and mother with a number of
children leaving one child behind because
married. Grounds of excessive hardship or
unusual circumstances are seldon or never
considered by our immigration authorities
because of the inflexibility of the regulations.
Pleas for sympathy fall on deaf cars. This
should not be, and it is not in keeping with
the real character of our immigration officials,
who are by inclination sympathetic, helpful
and understanding.
This committee recommends that the goveriment extend to its immigration officials a
greater liberty of discretion in special cases,
and it suggests that the officials themselves
take courage to apply for special orders in
council whenever circumstances warrant, so

that undesirable rigidity be avoided and the
administration of the Act be made as humane
and considerate as possible.
Your committee reports that its meetings
have constituted a research into conditions
relating to immigration which in its opinion
has been exceedingly valuable. The oral evidence given, and the carefully prepared statements and briefs in considerable numbers, contain a vast amount of useful information. The
material contained in the record is too great
for even summary in this report, but it bas
enabled the committee to reach a number of
general conclusions.
We are of opinion:(1) That there are within Canada natural
resources sufficient for the support of a very
mch larger population than Canada now
possesses, providing the resources are intelligently used for production, and not merely
held.
(2) Industrial conditions in Canada are
favourable at present for a considerable expansion in manpower both in primary industries
and in manufacturing.
(3) The admission of a considerable number
of immigrants to engage in farming, lumbering,
mining, and shipping and, as well, those
skilled in urban production, would- not lower
the standard of living in Canada, but rather
would at present tend to improve it.
(4) A better balanced economy, the result
of an expansion of industries other than farming, can be brought about only by increases
in population.
(5) There are available in Europe numbers
of skilled artisans, technicians and professional
men, workers experienced in new trades and
masters of various established arts, men havng creative and managerial capacity capable
of founding new industries or improving old
ones, "entrepreneurs" and so forth. Such men
should be welcomed to this country in all
cases where there is a reasonable assurance
that they will add to our knowledge, capacity
or efficiency, contribute to our economy, or
assist us in competition.
(6) In the camps for displaced persons in
Europe there are great numbers of people who
are suitable in accordance with the most
exacting standards, for settlement as immigrants in this country.
(7) The success achieved in past years by
immigrants of such national groups as
Ukrainians, Poles, Greeks, Scandinavians,
Germans, Italians, Hungarians, Roumanians,
Austrians and others, as described in many
weighty representations convinces us that the
policy of admitting such people should be
continued.

JIJLY 10, 1947
(8) Public opinion approves a carefully
selective immigration in numbers flot exceeding frorn time to time the absorptive capacity
of our country, and industrial and economic
conditions at present are favourable. The government should in consequence find some way
to provide the .necessary ocean transportation,
the failure of which is the only physical bar
now to a successful immigration movement.
Ail of which is respectfully submitted.

MOTION FOR SECOND READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shahl thîs
bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, this bill lias received first reading, as will
another bill authorizing the negotiation of
ag-reements between the dominion and the
prov inces. I have asked two honourable
senators to explain the bis, but as these
gentlemen probably will not be here at the
next sitting, I would request that the buis be
given second reading today.

For the information of honourable senators,
I niay say that it seems unlikely that parliament can prorogue this week; therefore I
intend to move at the close of this sitting
that the Senate adi ourn until Monday evening
next.
Hon. A. B. COPP moved the second reading of tbe bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a very
short bill and we ail know the contents of it,
so it requires very littie explanation; but perhaps honourable members ivili not objeet if I
take a few moments to make some reference
to it. When I came to this chamber, twentytwo years ago, the government leader was the
late Senator Dandurand, and I soon realized
the heavy responsibilities andI the great
importance attaching to bis office. It bas
often been said in private discussion that
sooner or later tbe Lime wou]d come wbenHon. Mr. M'URDOCK: May I ask wby we
cannot bave a copy of tbis bill?
Hon. Mr. COPP: It bias just corne over
from tbe other bouse.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am told that
tbere are no copies bere. I. as one member of
tbe Senate. insist that we hiave an opportunity to read tbe bill.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Tbe bill con tains only
one clause. and tbe Clerk could read iL.Would
that be satisfactory to rny bonourable friend?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: We are entitled to
see the bill, and we are going to see it, I hope.
Tbe Hon. the SPEAKER: I arn informed
by the Clerk that we bave so far received
only the original of the bihl from the otber
bouse. We aIl reahize tbat we are nearing
prorogation, and tbat tbe Printing Bureau is
flot able to keep abreast of its present large
volume of work-a condition that is not
unusual in the hast days of the session. Tbe
bonourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) bias properly objected to our proceeding with second reading before copies of
the bill bave been distriubted. On occasions
this bas been donc by unanimous consent.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable zenators, I
regret very mucbHoni. Mr. MURDOCK: Wait tilt w'e get the
bill.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Can I ot speak to the

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Not on a bill tbat is

Hon. Mr. COPP: 1 amrn ot speaking now on
the bill. I was going to say a word in commiendation of my honourabie friend from

position. The honourabie leader (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) asked me to mox e second reading
andi make some reference to the bill, and as
tliis is the hast sitting which 1 shahl be able
to attend this session I thought that perhaps
honourable rnembers--incling my honourabie friend frein Parkdale, whom we ail holti in

MOTION FOR SECOND READING

H on. 'I
Mr.
ROBERTSýON:
Honourable
senators, the objection of my honourable
friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Mu.rdock) on
the previous bill wouhd flot appiy to this one,
as copies of it have been, distributcd.
I have asked the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) to move
second reading of the bill.
Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: (for Hon. Mr.
Robertson) moveti second reading cf the bill.

He said: Honourable senators, it sernetimes
happens t.hat thc more tirne one bas to con£ider a matter the longer anc delays attendinig

to it.

I have donc some genicrai readýing on

tbe subject-matter cf this bill. I sccured the
so-called "green bock", and some wecks ago
whihe at Niagara Falls, when net watching the
falis, 1 read it. I cannet commenti it to honcurable members as holiday literature.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: WVhat' is the "green
bock"?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I will refer to it later.
For the' present may I say that it contains the
dis-ciî,ssins at the plcnary conference of the
dominion and the provinces in connection with
the queteion cf taxation and subsidies te be
gîanted, te the provinces under the varions
proposals that have been made.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Dees it include flhc
1941 conference?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: No, it docs net. Another
bock was prcpared in connection with that
conference, at that time Mr. Hepburn was
Premier cf Octaneo and my good friend Mr.
Pattuilo -a-. Premier cf British Columbia. That
ccnfcîenre, as I recaîl, was baseti on the
Sirois Report. and was shcrt-lived, lasting cnly
three d.ays. Objection was se pronounced from
three provinces, particuiariy the two 1 have
mentioned, that it ended rather abruptly. As
for the "zreen bock", I adcpted tîtat titie
becauise of the colour cf the bock and the fact
that it was given that designation in the debate
in the other bouse. it centains a record cf the
conferenees subsequent te 1941.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I presome the bock
is available te members cf tbis bouse?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I puslied the buzzer and
ask1ed the attendant fer a copy, and be brougbt
me the one I now have. I presumne that every
boncurable member bas a buzzer and can get
a eopy as I did. Perhaps my bonourabie friend
ta hcoking forward te a vacation this summer
wher lie can enjoy bimscîf reacLing tbis
d ocumecnt.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I shail very mucli
cnjoy reading it. 1 ivas flot nwarc tbat sncb
a publication was in existence.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I amn only serry that
1 diii net complete my reading cf the dcument, so tbat I could entertain this bonourable
lîorie liv giving a full rcvîew cf its contents.
It would be better, bewever, if honourable
members wculd reati the bock themseives. It
cLoes throw some light on the issues that must
be considercd in cennectien with this bill.
Complaints arc made that the govcrnment's
pcliey as indicateti in tbis bill is a policy cf
dealing witb provinces piecemeai, one by one;
and it bas been charged by the leader cf the
opposition and other men prominent in the

JULY 11, 1947
public life of this country that the government has not pursued the proper policy, that
of co-operation with the various provinces. I
suggest that honourable members who read
this book will find that full and complete
attempts were made to bring about unanimity
and agreement between the provinces and the
dominion; and my submission is that the
course adopted by the dominion was the only
practical one in the circumstances.
What is that policy? The government has
from time to time modified its proposals. I
am not going into them in detail; it was not
my intention to refer to them even at this
length; but as I recall it, the first proposal was
on the basis of a minimum allowance of $12
per capita. This amount has been materially
increased, and although it is not now calculated on a per capita basis, it is very easy
to work out the result in that form.
What happened? You will recall that the
final conference took place in May, 1946, a
little over a year ago, and you know why it
broke down. The conferees were seated in
this chamber, and many of us were sitting in
the gallery watching them. On the last day of
the session the Prime Minister of Quebec
announced that he had other business to
attend to, and left for Quebec to look after
other public affairs. The result was that the
conference was adjourned sine die; and since
then the dominion government, of necessity,
I submit has had recourse to negotiation
with the provinces to arrive at agreement
in respect of income tax, corporation tax,
grants to the provinces, and the allowances
which the dominion government should make
if the provinces agreed to surrender for the
time being certain rights of taxation. I
would point out here that I have used the
wrong word; a very important word: the
proposal was, not that the provinces should
"surrender" their right to collect succession
duties and income tax, but that for the time
being they should rent to the dominion more
or less exclusively the field of income taxes
and succession duties. Of course, the word
"rent" is not of go much importance in the
matter of the machinery of collection as in
the implication that, so to speak, the provinces
who own the rights to these taxes which have
been rented are to be regarded as landlords,
and that therefore, if one may carry the
analogy this far, the rights of ownership
remain as fully in the provinces as they remain
in the owner of a house who grants a five-year
lease.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Is not the simile that
of a joint tenancy rather than of an ownership
in fee?

595

Hon. Mr. FARIRIS: That is true also.
There is no question that the dominion has
always had the right to impose income taxes.
The expression used in Section 91 of the
British North America Act is "any mode or
system of taxation." I agree with my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). However, there is no merger of the two rights.
The right of the dominion remains as it
alwa-ys has been; the thing that has been
rented, and which is the subject matter of this
so-called rental is only the right of the provinces, and not the entire right, which as my
honourable friend has correctly put it is
vested in both the dominion and the provinces.
So far as the machinery is concerned I
attach little importance to the use of the
word "rent"--I take it that ,that expression
was deliberately used-but because of its significance it is of the utmost importance in
that the implication arising therefrom, so far
as the provinces are concerned, is that they
have had the unqualified right of direct taxation, which includes the right to impose
income tax. The right to impose the corporation tax, wohich generally speaking is a
form of income tax, and the right to impose
a succession duty, have always been rights
that the dominion has exercised along with
the provinces. When the rights of the provinces are rented for five years, there can be
no question of the answer. The only conclusion is that at the termination of that
period the complete and unqualified righ-ts
of the provinces are intact, and that this
agreement has in no way impaired those
rights.
With this somewhat longer explanation than
I had intended to give, I now refer to the bill
itself. I may say to honourable senators
that in another place the Minister -of Finance
gave a most comprehensive and careful problem study of this whole subject matter. It
appears in the House of Commons Hansard
of July 9. !My explanation here will not be
an attempt either to repeat what the minister said or to compote with him in giving
a full and complete explanation. Rather, I
shall attempt in this warm afternoon to give
to honourable senat'ors a brief outline of the
general subject dealt with in the statute.
The purpose of the bill is to authorize the
government to enter into agreements with
the provinces respecting their financial relations. That is not, however, a blanket authority under this bill. The terms of the agreement appear in Section 3 of the bill. Arising
out of negotiations, the government will pay
to the provinces compensation in amounts
that are specifically limited in the document
itself. I may inform honourable senators that

596

SENATE

negotiations have been completed with all
provinces in Canada except Ontario and Quebec. As regards those two provinces the bill
imposes the same principles of negotiation
and agreement as are imposed in connection
with the other provinces. It not only authorizes the completion of agreements with the
provinces with which successful negotiations
have already been made, but with all the
provinces. I am sure we all hope the time
will cone when Ontario and Quebec see their
way to entering into agreements with the
dominion.
The dominion will pay compensation in
accordance with the terms set out in the bill.
J shall refer to these terms in a moment.
During the five year period the provinces
must do certain things, the first of which is
that they must refrain from imposing a personal income tax or a corporation tax, save
for certain exceptions that are provided for
in the bill. Secondly, the provinces will have
to refrain from imposing succession duties
and, of course, the concessions which the
provinces are making are very important and
drastic. It will be the duty of the members
of parliament in both houses to consider how
far the compensation given to the provinces
is adequate. J think there should be some
scrutiny to sec if the dominion bas given too
much. It is not our primary duty to see
whether it bas given enough, because I think
the premiers and finance ministers of each of
tbe seven provinces which have expressed their
agreement with the amount of the contributions being made may be relied upon to have
determined that question for themselves, in
so far made. I think we can accept that as
prima facie if not conclusive evidence that the
amounts of the grants are adequate in the
circumstances.
There are certain provisoes in this bill
in regard to which I think I should mention
the need of parliament refraining from doing
certain things. I call the attention of honurable senators to section 3, subsection 2, paragraphs (a) and (b).
Paragraph (a) is a very important one. It
is of particular importance in the province
of British Columbia and will be so in many
other provinces as well. It deals with certain
income taxes imposed upon mining and
Honourable senators
lumbering operations.
will see the object and purpose of it. The
title to the mineral and timber lands in a
province is vested in that province; 'these
are its assets and when they are removedwhen the minerals are taken out of the soil
and the trees are cut-the province bas lest
those natural assets. The taxes on profits
made by owners out of assets acquired from

the province are not strictly income tax; they
are a portion of the return from the conversion
of the capital assets, and so a sensible provision
bas been inserted into this bill making certain
exceptions. I need not mention the details
of them. The principle is the main point
that I wish to call to the attention of honourable senators.
Paragraph (b) contains certain limitations
with respect to corporation taxes, and provision is made whereby provinces may impose
a tax of five per cent on the corporations and
that the amount collected by the province
may be deducted from the sums granted to it
under the scbedule of allowances.
Hon. Mr. BURCHILL: Would the honourable senator explain the need for that section?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: My honourable friend
must have read my mind, and observing that
I was stumbling a bit over the section he has
taken advantage of the situation. I asked Mr.
Hart, the Prime Minister of British Columbia,
about the section. I feel much like the student in the astronomy class who was asked one
morning by his professor to state the cause
of the aurora borealis. The student replied:
"Well, professor, I did know that, but I have
forgotten it." The professor then remarked:
"It is most unfortunate that the only person
in the world who ever knew the explanation
has forgotten it." I cannot claim to be in
quite that position, for I am not the only
person who ever knew why this section was
inserted in the bil-L. The details of the
explanation were given te me by Mr. Hart,
but are not fresh in my mind at the moment
I could secure the information for my honourable friend, though, from notes that are in my
office.
Subsection 3 of section 4 of the bill sets
out a schedule of the minimum grants to the
various provinces. The subsection says:
The guaranteed minimum annual amount of
compensation payable under an agreement with
the government of a province shall not exceed
the respective amounts and in respect to the
several eamed provinces, as follows:
I do net need te read all the figures. The
amount payable
to Nvew Brunswick is
.8,773,420.
For Ontario, if that province
entered into an agreement, the amount would
be $67,158,027; and for the province of QueThe amount
bec, it xould be $56.382,127.
payable to British Columbia is $18.120,124.
The provinces are net tied to those minimum amounts, because subsection (4) provides that each province shall have the right
to receive, in addition to the specified miniThis
mum, an adjusted annual amount.
adjusted annual amount is not to exceed the

JITLY 1l, 1947
average of amounts for each of the three
calendar yeacs immediately preceding the fiscal year in respect of which-payinent is to be
made. The amount for each such calendar
yeac is ta be based on a ratio of population
and of pec capita production. That la a
littie tao complicated for us to attempt to
study just now. Pechaps it would be sufficient
to say that under this subsectýion any province
which has an increase in per capita production
or in population will receive an additional
annual amount.
Hon. Mc. LEGER: la that ta be calculated
evecy yeac?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yes, as I undecstand
it. It is called "the adjusted annual amount."
May I ask my
Hon. Mc. CRERAR:
honoucable fciend a question? In addition to
the amounts specified in section 4, do the
provinces receive subsidies and assistance that
they have been getting in ane way and another
prior ta the agreements?
Hon. Mc. FARRIS: In the July 9th
Haneard of another place my honourable
friand will find two tables of figures given
by the Minister of Finance. The firat table
shows the guaranteed minimum annuai
amount, including statutory subsidies, payable
ta aach province under the agreement; and
the second table shows the adjustad annual
payments ta the variaus provinces. By subtracting the figures in the firat table from
those in the second my honourable friend
will find the amount wbich it is calcuiýated
each province will receive in addition ta the
guarantaa minimum annual compensation
under the agreement.
The agreement provides that the goverfiment of the province may impose corporation
incarne tax at a rate of 5 per cent, but there
is a vecy sensible provision that any such
taxes will be colactad under nia;cbinery set
This will avoid the
up by the dominion.
inaquity of the old double system of collection
of taxes.
There ara certain provisions with respect ta
provinces that have not yet entered into an
agreement. If the province of Ontario, for
instance, finds it necessary to impose a provincial income tax in addition ta the faderaI
income tax, the persans who pay provincial
incarne tax may daduct the tax up to 5 par
cent on their incarne from the amount of
their incarne tax otherwisa payable ta the
dominion.
I have given a general autline of the bill,
and I would suggaat that honoucable members desicing further details should read the
speech made in another place by the Minister of Finance.

597

In short, the bill authorizes the dominion
to give effect to the agreements made with
various provinces. If the Senate were to reject
the bill at this stage it would create complete
chaos ail across the country, and be a more
serious interferenee with affaira than I thinýk
would be warranted. Of course, the Senate
has a constitutional right to reject the
measure, but to do so at this stage of the
negotiations would be a most serions matter
for the seven provinces that have already
entered into agreements, and wauld impede
the domninion's power ta continue negotiations with the other two provinces. If honourable senators feel that the governiment has
flot exercised proper judgment, if they feel
that the dominion bas acted arbitrarily
towards any of the provinces and bas not
attempted as strongiy as it shouid to resume
negotiations, they are free to voice their
unqualified criticism. But I would most res-.
pectfuily submait that that is as far as the
Senate should go, and that we should not, take
any action that would interfere with what
might ibe calied a fait accompli between the
dominion and various provinces.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: May I ask one question?
Is there anywhece a comparative tabulation
of the estiimated revenue and disibursements
applicable to the federal government?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I expert my honourable
friend would be able ta find that information
in the speech by the Minieter of Finance on
the budget.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I tried to find lt.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: This copy of the recent
speech made by the Minister of Finance
reached me only a short time ago, and honourable senators can understand the difficuity
of going thcough it on short notice.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: May I be permitted
another question that would seem to follow
îny pcevious quecy? If the dominion is
required to return to the provinces an amount
equivalent to -the revenue from certain
taxation, what is the advantage to the federai
treasucy? If the amount returned is nat
equivalent ta the revenue, who stands to gain,
the dominion or the provinces?
Hon. Mr. FA.RRIS: I should think the
taxpayer stands to gain.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I agcee.
-Hon. Mr. I41ARRIS: Onl.y one tax an
income is imposed and oniy one return bas to
be made. Honourable senators wiil recali
that already thece have been agreements in
principie so fac as the 'things my honourahie

SENATE
friend refers to. Since the early dayq of the
war there have been agreements with ail the
provinces., and any taxpayer will bear testimony to the fact that to have only one income
tax, imposed. by one taxing autbority, is a
great adiavn'tage.
Wi'th an extensiv e post-war programme and
a heavy burden of debt the dominion is faced
with the prohlem of finaneing. If the dominion
imposes a maximum incomo tax and the
provinces are left to fend for themselves,
very serious things may bappon. Sinco income
tax or anv other tax must be uniform to
approach fairneis, somne of the provinces
would find their bands tied in any attempt to
add another tax. Certain of the more wealthy
provinces might be able te add another income
tax. On the other hand, the whole financial
system of the dominion would be greatly
enîbarrassedi hy reason of the fact that the
gover-nmcnt would flot know from yoar to
year whoîher to levy an addi'tional income
tax, or how muceh might ho imposed by any
givon province. From the standpoint of the
dominion, the provinces and the public as a
whole, àt seemsý to me ezsential that somne
form of uniformi agreement be reachied bctween
the dominion and the provinces.
I wish to deal only briofly with the objections te the bill. and in this respect I do not
wish to enter into any political discussion,
which one might easily do. Within the past
week, or so the newspapers have carried statements by the premiers of Ontario and Quebec
which, even on a warm afternoon, might provoke one te make comments which could Le
interproted as partisan. Without wishing to
do that I may say that one objection that
might be raised to this measure is that the
grants under the formula are not fair and not
enough are matie.
The first answer te tbat, objection wou]d
be that the provinces most in need of allowances have accepted an agreement; Ontario
and Quebec bave not But I have not read
anywbere in the speeches of Mr. Duplessis or
Mr. Drew acy complaint that tbe allowances
to their provinces were inadequate.
If I
migbit read between the linos of their remarks,
I would interpret tbem the other way. Witbin
tbe last two wecks I rcad in headlines Mr.
Drew's statement that Ontario was cot for
sale; andi within tbe past few days I read in
the Montreal Gazette a strong statement by
Mr. Dulsi--sif
à were necossary to proclaim it-that these two provinces were not
for sale. The only infereace one can draw is
that there must bave beca higb biddicg to
stimulate suticient moral courage and selfresbrnînt to resist an attcmipt to buy these two
provinces. I repeat that the inference is that

the purchase price, if one wants to put it on
that scale, must have been high or there
would have been 110 noed to preclaim that the
provinces were not for sale.
But speaking seriously, hocourable senators,
in a debate in a forum sucb as the Senate,
I ihink we can at once roject, the suggestion that the goveroment of Canada is
dishonourably attempticg to purchase acy
part of Canada. After aIl the Dominion of
Canada is Canada, and the two great provinces of Ontario and Quebec are integral parts
of Canada. It is hard to believe that anyone
xvould seriously entertain tbe thongbt that tbe
dominion as a whole ivas secking to purchase
the inalienable rights of any province in
Canada.
An ana]Nsis of the speeches about the two
provinces not being for sale, leads me te
believe that if there is anythicg in tbem, iL is
the suggestion that for a mess of pottage these
provinces are asked to surrender, not al, but
part of their autonomny; and the further suggestion is made tbat by renticg for five years
the right te colleet iccome and corporation
t axes. these provinces would be surrcndering
their independence. It has been said many
times, and of course it is true, that the right
te tax carrnes with it tremendous controllicg
power; but, the providing of gracîs to the
provinces ont of moeys collected by the
dominion lias been a bas.ic princîple in the
operation of [lie affairs of this country sicce
Confetîcration.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Before the hocourable
senator pursues that lino of thougbt farther,
would hie permit a question?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Certainly.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: As I understand iL,
when the first ngreement was entered into with
the provinces it was te be for the duration of
the war; and now wlien the war is over, it is
proposed that it ho extended for a furthor
pel iod of five yoars. Wbat guarantee have the

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The provinces have the

any position they wisli wben the time comes.
Hon. Mns. FALLIS: Exact ly. I think that
what Octaneo and Queboc obj oct to is the
rentaI of those rights witbout any guarantoe

JULY 11, 1947
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: My point is that the
provinces were supposed to be free at the end
of the war, but a new proposal is made, which
results in this debate today. The same thing
might happen again in five years.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Ontario has not accepted
the proposal, but has demonstrated her freedom to reject it. If later on she should find it
to her interest to accept this agreement, she
will be as free as a landlord is at the expiration
of a five year lease of his building to rent it
to someone else. It may be more to his
interest to deal with the old tenant than to
seek a new one, but lie is entirely at liberty
to do the one or the other.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Suppose Ontario accepts
the federal government's terrns for five years,
as she did for the duration of the war, when
the time comes to make another agreement
she must either go through all these negotiations over again or permit the existing
arrangement to go on and on.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Why should it not go
on and on?
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Why should it, if
Ontario does not consider it to her advantage?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: If Ontario does not consider it to her advantage, she is free at the
end of five years to say so, and to reject it.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: That is the position
Ontario is in now.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Well, what is wrong
with it? I cannot see any difficulty. It is
easy to make general statements, to go on the
platform and proclaim "We must be free".
But I submit that not only must we be free,
but we must be sensible, we must be realistic.
We must recognize that the responsibility of
carrying on the war rested with the dominion;
that the postwar problems of this country
impose burdens hardly less great than those
which were carried during the war; and that
the primary problem in Canada today is to
maintain our financial stability in spite of
the great burden of debt we incurred during
the war and the heavy obligations we have
assumed to our returned soldiers and to the
citizens generally. In face of these tremendous
necessities it is no use to sidetrack the question by raising imaginary threats to freedorn
-a freedom which has never been seriously
nterfered with, and in my opinion never
will be.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: That is not the point
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Will the honourable senator, if he finds it convenient to de
so, explain the contrast between the application of the arrangement to Quebec and Ontario

and its application to other provinces, having
in mind the idea of double taxation in these
provinces as compared with the others.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I am not sure that
I understand my honourable friend's question.
Does he mean that if these provinces do not
come in they will incur double taxation?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT:

That is it.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That may be so. I
have pointed out that a 5 per cent income
tax may be imposed by these provinces on
their citizens without subjecting them to
double taxation; and no doubt there are
other details of the proposal with which
honourable senators will wish to become
familiar. I have given them the reference to
Hansard containing Mr. Abbott's speech, and
I would urge them to read and consider it.
It may be that at another session, if it
becomes evident that these provinces intend
to remain permanently outside the agreements,
the Minister of Finance will find it necessary
to make other adjustments to meet that
condition. Do not forget that no federal
government can continue to exist in Canada
if it treats with unfairness the two great
provinces of Quebec and Ontario. But it must
be assumed that the government, if they are
giving any consideration to their political
welfare, honestly believe that they are treating
these provinces fairly; and it must be conceded that if they are seized of their responsibilities in the administraiton of this country,
they will give appropriate relief if unfair and
unjust conditions develop.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Would the honourable
senator answer a question regarding this matter of taxation? Even though Ontario and
Quebec do not enter into agreements, will
they not, through taxation, contribute to
what the federal government pays to the
other provinces? I ask this question merely
for my own information.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I have explained that
already provisions have been made which will
relieve that situation to a very substantial
extent. I have no doubt, and I am sure my
honourable friend has no doubt, that if it
becomes clear that these provinces are to
remain permanently outside the range of
agreements, and if it appears also that the
reliefs already provided for in this connection
are inadequate, a further revision will be
made. This is assured for the two reasons
I have already mentioned. The first is that
no government in Canada would wish, even
though it had not to pay the price politically,
to continue the imposition of unjust taxation
on a very large proportion of the population.

The soecond guarantee is that no goverament

Se miucbi on the question of interference
witli the independonce of the provinces. 1
have bren puzzled over the question of possible alternative policies. We in Canada have
a burden of dcbt; wr have a standard of
expeuditure irnpoý-ed by the demands of the
Canadian people. Canada bias to raise the
neoearvN rev enuie. If sorne seheme such as
the dominion ,ov erninent lias proposed is flot

whvlielt wvill guiarantee ýte the provinces the
aut ouemnv
andI
indopedence
which
the
premiers. of tite two great prov inres feri is
heiug titreatenrd? I hav e read in the n.ewspap( rs their recout speeche s, and I have net
di'ee\ eî,cd anov alternative. The headjines of
Mr. Duplessis.' speech the other day ronrerilîng tItis question announcrd ýthat Quebre was
no-t for sale. Mr. Drew, speaking two or
thre weeks age. anticipatcd tilis slogan by
stating that Ontario ivas not, for sale. But
ran au"ene bore tell me offhand what alternative rither of ýthese gentlemen bias offcrrd
te the terms pîoposod by the dominion and
acropted by seven provinces? The only suggeM ion the two premiers have made, se far
as 1 knom, is: "Yen ought te have a goneral
ronforienco." As I have said. we must ho
reali..tic; and vvhat assurance haveo we that a
general ronferenre would produre any more
than the ronfereures we have already had?
Iu this same book I find the proposai which
Mr. Drew's government made
te the
c, which. met in 1946. It was that a conferdominioit-provincial co-ordinating cemmittee should
ho set up, and that it be given power te
dletermine. from information supplird by the
Doininion-Provinrial Eronomir Board, the
amiount of the adjustment grants. I arn net
goiug into the dotails, but I invite bonourable
senaters to read themn on page 239 of the
"ýgron book". The proposaIs were made by
Mr-. Drew in good faith, and they are sensible
pi oposals; nobody questions that. But wbrn
eue examines them in the ligbit of the prinriple of autonomy, tbey provoke the reflection
that if todav there is any interferenre with
provincial or federal autonomy, it is tbrough
tho autonomy of boards, organizations which
are b ,ing, set up aIl over this country te run
publie .tffairs outside the autbority of parliamont. 1 would soonet' see the provinces subj tot some dogree of domination by the
dominion tItan ho under the domination of
another boeard. Honourable senators, I comnmound thiis bill te your favourable constdot-ation.

Hon. Mr. HORNER: The honourable senater spoke of tw e remaining provinces. Nova
Scotia did very well by holding eut under a
Liberal prime minister until just recently, and
other provinces may follow ber example.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I would be sorry te
think that any province acted on the basis
of how murh it rouîd chisel off.
Hon. Mr. BORNER: Nova Scotia did weIl.

602

SENATE

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: This is fine!1 This
is the original bill that came ovor froma tjhe
House of Commons. 1 presumne that everybody elSe is without one.
Hon. Mr. CC)PP: Honourable senators, I
should now like to, continue with the few
remarks 1 have to make in reference to this
bill.
When the bonourable senator from Parkdlaie (Hon. Mr. Murdock) registered bis protest, I was saving that the lat-e Senator
Dandurain.d was the leader of tbe gcvernment
here when I first came to this ehaniber.
Althcuigbi at thiat time I was more or less
aware of the volume of work he did, it has
onlv bec-n during the past few years that I
bao(one te realize fully the great amount
of time and labour that his duties demanded
cf hiiîu.
Tho governmrent leader in the Senate,
whiorv(r lie may be, represents seventeen,
eigbteen or more cabinet ministers, who carry
on the busines.s of this country.
For a few weeks in the present session,
while I was: acting as leader of the government in th)e Senate, 1 realized just how much
work attaches 10 the office. The leader lias te
attendl cabinet meetings, wbich are bcld almost
dail 'v during the sesscion and at frequent intervals duriing the parliamentary recess. He bias
te confer with the chairman of varieous coimmittees andi the Ch-ief Clerk of Committees
in arranging for committee meetings. And
thiere are consultations with the leader of the
oppos~ition in regard 10 matters more mimerous and vaî'ied than, most of us have ever
imaffined.
-1 good manv Years ago the otlier bouse
voed a special indemnity for the leader of
die opposition in that chamber. I canneýt
recali jus. iwbat vear that was.
Hon. Mr. HYXIG: It was 1905, wbien Sir
Wilfrid Laurier xvas Prime Minister.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I did not think it was
that long- ago; I tbought it was under Sir
Rob<rit Borden. In any evcnt, a statutory
allo-wance was voted for tlie leader of tbe
oppo-jition, an office wbich is a very important part cf the parliamentary machinery in
a ilcinocratic country. Froin time t0 time an
extra .ý-atutory allowxance lias been suggested
for ilie leader of the governiment and the
leadcr of die opposition in the Senate, but
tliý i the fir-.t lime thavt definite action in
tliât regard Laý been taken. Now the governin hla- introduced a bill te gi ant tlîe leader
of tlie gox ernment bore, in addition te bis
rer ssional indenmitv, an allowance of

$7,000 per annum, in order te help bum to
fulfil in a dignified and appropriate manner the
duties and responsibilities of bis office.
My reinarks on the leader of the goverfiment aren fot reýLticted to anýy person in par'icular; they -are ineant te apply te the person holding the office aI any time, now or in
the fctutre. Similarlv what I bave te say
about tie leader cf the opposition is meant
te apply net only te the present leader, but
tr bis .successors. The incumbent of tbis office
also bas te shoulder many duties and responsibilities besides tboe imposed upon tbe ordinary senator, and tlie propos-aI i that by way
cf compensation an extra annual allowance cf
S4,000 ho voted. 1 bolieve that we shou1d
recegnizo the fairness ocf tlîe practice adopted
by the othor bioiiw( many years ago cf grantîng an add.itional indemnity 10 the leader cf
the epposition.
I commend this bill te the favourable con.-îderatien of bonourable member..
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable sonators,
becau.,e the two gentlemen wbo at p)iesent
occupy t1e offices of leader of tbe gcverniment and leader cf tlie opposition in tbe
Sen-ate are seo amiab)le, I regret tbat, I feel il
implossible te refrain from ob.iecting 10 Ibis
biH. Each one cf us bere bas net only privileges, but duties and responsibilities te the
people cf Canada. I feel as keenly as il is
possible for nie te feel that this measure is
unwise in the extreme. Lt bogins by saying:
His -Majesty. by and witb the advice and
ceusent of the Senate...
The bill bas net been introduced by and
wvîtb the advice cf the Seniate. Honourable
members will revaîl that their summons 1o
this cbamber requires tbem te give advice
based. on tbeir good judgmnent. My judgment
rnay be at fanît, but in view cf the increased
sessional indemnity that was granted net se
long age I do flot feel that the additional
allowanýces previded for in Ibis bill are justified.
I know that the leaders on botb sides bave
more work te do than the rest cf us have,
but from my experience 1 bav e net found
that tlhere ivas any difficulty in getting senators
te filI the offices. I ean speak witb sonme
knowledge as te t1e leader on our side (Hen.
Mr. Haig-).
I do nut tbink tliere was any
reluctance on is part 10 accept the position
witbout anv additional .,alary. I can assure
the bouse that if Ibis bill is defeated we shahl
find semnie te carry on as leader on Ibis
side.

JULY 11, 1947
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I do flot know that
there is any .object in proloniging discussion on
the bill. I have no desire to place the Senate
in an unfavourable liglit throughout the
country by re-hashing what has been said
many times about ail the work we do here or
fail to do. Perhaps it would be sufficient for
me to urge with ail the emphasis that I can
that there should be a recorded vote on this
rnatter. It seerns to me that insuit is added
to injury when we are asked to deal with the
measure today because some servators wish to
go home after this sitting. If possible, I
wou]d like týo adjourn the debate. But if that
is not agrecable to the hou8e, Il certainly
think :that we should have a recorded vote.
I want to record my vote against the measure.
as I feel sure that in years to corne that
action will be highly commended throughout
Canada.
Let me emphasize that because of tlie very
amiable, capable and likeable gentlemen who
at present occupy the positions of leaders, I
deeply regret having to take this stand.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: May I ask the
honourable gentleman if lie voted against the
increase of $2,000 in his own sessional
indemrnity?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: No, I did not, nor
did I vote for it. I do not think that lias
anything to do witli this case.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: I felt that I was
in a position to ask that question, because I
voted against the increase.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: As a matter of fact,
1 was not in the chamber when t1ýe vote was
taken on that matter.
In the past if a senator was requested to
substitute temporarily for the leader of the
government or the leader on this side, it was
his duty to do so. But if this bill passes it
may become necessary to caîl in a labour
organizer and organize a union, so that every
senator will know what fees lie should charge
if lie is called upon to be an acting leader ini
the future.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators. the extra $2,000 of sessional indemnity for senators was carried in tliis house by
a vote of 39 to 11. I can scarcely agree with
the kind of remarks that have been made
about these two gentlemen who are to get
this additional money but, from some experience mn-shahl I say, the underworld?
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Huit. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes, I will say in
the underworld of Chicago and various other
places, representing the under-dog wlio was

603

trying to get some reasonable compensation
for lis labour. That lias been the real underworld of Canada, and for that matter of the
world, for many years. Let me say that if
this bill is passed, as of course it will be,
it is the finest piece of communism-manufacturing argument that lias been produced
for many years.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: That is quite riglit.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: In addition, and
second to it, is the $2,000 senators granted
themselves, by a vote of 39 to 1l. What does
thc under-dog, the fellow in the backwoods,
think about the Senate?
I have a statement here sliowing liow many
hours this august body has sat during the
present session and here we are, in sudh a rush
that we present and argue about bills before
they reach us in proper form from the House
of Commons. In the month of January this
year we were in session one hour and thirtyfive minutes.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Do the
include the committee sittings?

figures

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I will deal with that
later. For the present I am talking about
the hours the Senate lias been in session.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Then tlie figures do
not include the sittings of committees.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No, of course not.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: Is it not a fact that this
session started on January 30?
Hon. Mr. MLURDOCK: Yes, and we sat for
one hour and thirty-five minutes in that
month.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Do we work by the
hour?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: In the month of
February the Senate was in session eleven
hours and fifty minutes; in the montli of
Mardi, twenty-four liours and five minutes;
April, five hours and thirty-five minutes; in
May, ten hours and thirty-five minutes; in
June, seventeen hours and forty minutes; in
July, up to the 9th, ten hours and forty-five
minutes.
I arn not offering any particular criticism
about that, but I would like to caîl the attexition of the Senate to what the underdog, the
man on tlie street, the working man, thinks
about it.
Hon. Mr. DAIGLE: May I ask the lionourable senator if lie is including the number of
hours spent in committee during the same
period cf tirne?

604

SENATE

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No. I know that
members of committees, particularly of the
divorce committees, sat long hours; but I am
talking about the time we actually sat in this
chamber. I have given the hours, mon-th by
month, from the time the 1947 session opened
until July 9.
The other day the Senate passed the Old
Age Pension bill, and from the standpoint of
some other things it was simply appalling to
see how little our old people are getting. If
I had not been appointed to the Senate I
would probably be an old age pensioner
myself, being -over seventy-five years of age,
and I would have to live, or try to live on
whatever the pension happened to be-$35 or
$40 a month. The point I want to bring to
the attention of this bouse, if I can, is that
at the next election, whenever it is held the
people will analyse fully what is being donc
by the bill now before us and what was done
a little while ago when the Senate voted 38
to Il to increase our sessional indemnities by
50 per cent.
I am sure that nothing I say will change
the intention of the Senate to vote for this
bill and pass along the additional money for
these deserving gentlemen; but the future
will show whether we were right or wrong.
There will be an accounting some dayalready it is developing on the 50 per cent
increase in wages that we gave ourselves by
a vote of 39 to 11.
That is ail I have to say.
Hon. IVA C. FALLIS: Honourable senators, I had not intended to say a word on
this bill, but I feel that I must answer one
of the s.tatemenýts made by my good friend
the senator from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr.
Murdock).
When I was appointed to this honourable
body I was given to understand that senators
were appointed to act in a judicial capacity
in the government of this country. Does
anyone stop to figure out how many hours in
the day, week or year a judge of the Supreme
Court or of the County Court sits on the
bench? Is that the yardstick by which we
should measure the value of the services of
judges to this country? My idea of the way
in which we should measure the value of the
services of those who are appointed to act
in a judicial capacity is this:
Are they
doing the work which they were appointed
to do for the country? If tbey are, it does not
matter whe'ther they work one hour a day or
twelve hours. If they are not doing what
they were appointed to do, that is a different
matter altogether.

If any statement is going out to the press
from this controversy today as to the number
of hours the Senate bas worked, it should
definitely include the number of hours worked
in committees.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
During a previous
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS:
session I was a member of ten committees;
this session I have been a member of nine
standing committees and two special cormmittees. I wish I had an account of my
working hours. I think it would be rather
creditable.
The com.mittee appointed to
investigate the Indian Act, of whirh I am a
member, held 67 meetings. It sat three or
four days a week, never for less than two
hours, more frequently for four, and on many
days it sat six hours-from eleven to one,
four ta six, and nine to eleven in the evening.
If these hours were added together they
would make an impressive total-and that is
the work of the Senate.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS:
I do not consider
that it is the duty of this chamber to spend
hours threshing over old straw that bas already
been reduced to chaff in the House of Commons before it gets here. The purpose for
which we were appointed, I believe, was to
do work in committees and do it thoroughly.
That, I submit, we have donc.
I intend to support the bill.
Hon. Mr. LEGER:
Honourable senators,
I do not know where the honourable gentleman from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) got
his figures about the number of hours we hava
satHon. Mr. LACASSE:

From labour unions.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: -but I wonder whether
in that number of hours be bas mentioned it
would be possible for any man to utter ail
the words that comprise 666 pages of fine
print.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I got the figures
by looking at the clock when the session
started and looking at it when the Senate quit.
I am one of those peculiar fellows who keep
diaries; I have kept a diary for forty-five
years, and I can show it to you.
Hon. Mr. LEGER:
anything.

That does not prove

Hon. Mr. WHITE: I should like to say a
word or two in connection with this matter.
It bas been my pleasure and good fortune to
be a member of this chamber for a good many
year, during a fa ir portion of which I have
bad the bonour of serving as party whip.

JULY 11, 1947
Therefore I feel that I have some knowledge
of the amount of work which the leaders of
this house accomplish. As the honourable
senator from West.morland (Hon. Mr. Copp)
stated, the leader of the government. and also.
I take it, the leader of the opposition, are
required to become conversant with every bit
of legisiation wbich cornes over from the
House of Commons. In other words, the
leaders here have to assume the responsibilities and duties of practically every cabinet
minister who sits in another place. Therefore 1
feel, in supporting this proposai, as I intend to
do, that our leaders are entitled to additions!
remuneration for the great services which they
render.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it your
pleasure to concur in the motion?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Can we have a
recorded vote?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: If it is the desire
of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: I would like to
adjourn, this debate. Owing to some statements whicb have recently been made in this
bouse, I beliave the suhjact deserves more
consideration. I intend to support the bill,
and I wish to present some arguments witb
relation to something whicb was said this
afternoon. After ahl, it is not merely a maJtter
of the nurnber of hours we spend in this
chamber.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No, no.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: Because, if that
were alHon. Mr. COPP: That has been well said
already.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: I arn in my office
every morning at eight o'clock, and, 1 leave
here in the evening at half-past ten or eleven.
That is a long day's work. I bave sacrificed
my whole law practice to my duties here. Does
anybody think it bas paid me, financially?,
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I was only talking
about the hours spent in the Sanate.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: Yems, but the hours
we spend here do flot account for ahl the
work we do.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: Wbat counts is
the work we do in prepartion for our sittings
here and what wa do afterwards, as well as the
actual sittings of tbe; bouse. I bate to refer
t(> anything personal, but I can assura you,
honourable senators, that if. the only factor to
ha considered was the matter of pay, I would
leave this chamber in two minutes and return

605

to my law practice, because every day I am
here represents a financial sacrifice. But money
is not the only tbing; thera is a duty to he
perforrned; and it is because I want to bring
forward some other reasons bearing on this
matter that I move the ad'journýment of the
debate.
So-me Hon. MEMBERS: Question.
Tbe Hon. the SPEAKER: Is there a
seconder of the motion of Senator Marcotte?
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: I understand that
another honourable senator wanted to adjourn
the debate.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Tbere was a suggestion of an adjournrnent, but it was not
followed through.
Senator Marcotte bas
rnoved that the dehate be adjourned. Is there
a. secondýer?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I second tha amendment.
Tbe motion of Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE was
negatived.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it your pleasure
to concur in tha motion for the second raading
of this bill? The motion is carried.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Could we bave a
standing vote?
The Hon. -the SPEAKER: I would ask
those in favour of 'the motion to say
"Content".
Some H-on. SENATORS: Content.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Those opposed
will say "Non-content".
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Non-content.
Thýe Hon. the SPEAKER: In my opinion
the Contents have it. Oarriad.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was reaýd the second time.

GOVERNMENT BUSINESS
PARTICIPATION BY MINISTERS IN
DEBATES-PROPOSED RULE

SENATE

On the Order: Resuming the adjourned
debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Robertson:
Tiat the rules of the Senate be amended by
adding thereto as Rule 18A the following:
18A. When a bill or other matter relating to
any subject administered by a departmnent of
tie Government of Canada bas originated in and
is being considered by the Senate or in Committee of the Whole, a minister representing the
department, not being a member of the Senate,
may enter the Senate chamber, and, subject to
the rules, orders, forms of proceedings, and
usages of the Senate, take part in the debate.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I am not ready to proceed, and therefore I
would move that this order be discharged and
be placed on the Order Paper for Tuesday,
July 15.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I may say to the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
that I have discussed this matter with my
colleagues. and. as some of them expect ta
leave here shortly, they are particularly

JULY 11, 1947
anxious that the discussion on this motion be
completed today. If the discussion were to
take too long a time this afternoon, with the
consent of bonourabie senators we couid sit
this evening. I appreciate that I should nlot
have left this matter to this late stage of
the session; but as our numbers wiil be
dwindling between now and next sitting, on
behaif of those senators who would like to
speak this afternoon, I wouid ask that we 110W
continue.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourabie senators, in
answer to rny honourabie friend (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) I wish to say that I do not think
that this motion eau go to a vote. With the
consent of the Senate 1 would be quite wiiling to stand down-if 1 may use that termiand let any honourabte senator speak on this
debate now if hie wishes to do so. Then I
wouid adjourn the debate, if the bouse wouid
so permit.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Once you give up
your rigbt you cannot get it back.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If nobody objected, I
could adjourn the debate.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: What is your objection
to going on now?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am not ready to go on.
Tbis matter bas been discussed by the government party at seve-rai caucuses, and it was
only yesterday that 1 bad any opportunity of
knowing wbat was being done. I was oniy
informed of this matter the day before yesterday, and aithough tbat is perfectly proper and
I offer no objection to it, I bave had no
opportunity of consulting witb the members of
iny party. I would not presume to say what
our party woutd or would not do. I have
asked the advice of my coileagues individualty,
and some said they were agreeab]e whiie
otbers stated they were not. Tbe oniy tbing
that 1 can do is to cati a caucus. If I had to
go on 1 would ask my party to vote against
the motion, wbich is something I do not wish
to do.
Like the leader of the governrnent (Hon.
Mr. Robertson), I arn most anxious to assist
the )Iouse of Commons in shortening the
sessions of parliament. However, I do not
sec bow this proposai wouid facilitate matters.
1 recail at least one instance when a minister
did corne and address tbe Senate, but I do
not believe tbat, as a general ruie, ministers
would consent to defend their legisintion in
the Senate, knowing that they wouid bave to
defend it all over again in the Houset of Coinmons. They may be wiiiing te corne to the
Senate to sponsor non-political measures, but
the trouble is that usuaiiy a minister would
bave difficulty in explaining a bill witbout

607

indulging in potiticai rernarks, and these bie
wouid be bound to repent in tbe otber bouse.
Especially is this so when tbe government's
mai ority in tbe House of Commons is smait,
as it is today. For instance, the vote on a
government measure there tbe otber day was
70 to 63. That is a very close vote. I arn
pointing out tbese things to show wby 1 do
not betieve the proposed rute would resuit in
expediting the work of tbe session.
I arn certainty going to ask our' group to
vote against the motion, and if they agrýee
with me I shall know tbat I arn not wrong.
I hope tbe Senate wiit permit me to adjourn
the debaýte. «I arn quite wiling to bave any
member intervene and speak now so long as
I do not run the risk, as suggested by my
bonourabie friend. freim Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock), of iosing my rigbt to speak again.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I wouid not insist
on that rote agaînst you.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I hope you wouid not.
I tbink it is only fair that I sbouid be given
an opportunity to consuit with my party.
Nothing coutd be done to give effect te the
rule -this session or before tbe commencement
of the next session. It is iikeiy tbat we shall
meet some time in January next ye.ar, and
after that the House of Commons wiil spend
at ieast four weeks debating tbe address in
r.epty to thte Speech fromu the Tbrone. That
woutd give us lots of time to consider this
matter before a fuit bouse.
For myseif I say to tbe leader of tbe governrnent (Hon. Mr. Roberston), as I have
said ýbefore, that 1 shahl do everything te facilýitate the sbortening of sessions of parliament. If I can be c.onvinoed tbat tbis motion
wil biring that resut't, weli and good. However, I say quite candidiy that if I cannot be
se convinoed I wili vote against the motion.
As honourabie senators know, I bave not had
an epportunity to discuss tbiis matter wi-th rny
foiiowers.
Tbe underground-wire service
actvises me that our honourable friends
opposite heid severai meetings about tbis
matter and that committees were appointed
to deal with it.
Hon. Mr. PATERISON: Wbat bill are you
speaking about?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I arn speaking on the
motion. My honourabje friend was a-t tbose
meetings.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Is the bonourabie
leader opposite suggesting tbat this matter
shouid not be vated on aet all in the presýent
session?

SENATE

608

Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, I
that. I do not know what
group is on this matter.
think that they may agree

am not suggesting
the attitude of my
I have reason to
to it, but I cannot

be sure before Tuesday.

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: To put it over till
Tuesday will be to put it over till after
prorogation.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: If the motion were
carried now the officers of the Senate would
have an oppo'rtunity to revise the forms of
procedure where necessary to conform with
the new rule; but, if the motion is not passed
today a good deal of time would be lest next
session.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Whether or nut this
motion is passed, today, there will be plenty
of time for the honourable leader to have a
discussion with his cabinet colleagues next
session during the month or so that tho
House of Commons is debating the Speech
from the Throne. There is no question at al
that a general election will be hel-d in the
fall of 1948.
Hou. Mr. MURDOCK: Is that a promise
or a threat?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is a prophecy, based
on many years of experience in public life.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Did I understand
the leader opposite to say that he is against
tthis proposed new rule?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I gathered that
impression from something that he said in his
series of rernarks.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, I never said that. I
telil you candidly that if you force a vote
on the motion now I shall have to vote
against it, because I have not badi time to
consult the menbers of our group.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Did the honourable
gentleman not say that he did not think
ministers would come over to the Senate to
explain their bill's?
Hon. Mr. HAlG: I still say that, but of
course that in itself is no reason why we
should not adopt the rule. If the rule were
adopted the leader of the government could
at any time invite a minister to come here
and expliain legislation. The minister could
refuse, but that is another matter.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: What I had in
mind was that if the motion were adopted this
session I could approach ministers at the

beginning of the next session, while the
Speech from the Throne was being debated in
the other house and ministers were not as
busily engaged as they woul.d be later on in
the session. If the motion is not passed before
we prorogue and the whole matter had to be
debated again next session, much time would
be lost.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Honourable senators,
I do not remember that the leader on this side
(Hon. Mr. Haig) ever consulted me about
Bill 443, which was given second reading this
afternoon. I cannot understand why he is so
particular about consulting us on this motion.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I rise on a point of
privilege. My honourable friend from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) says I did not
consult him on Bill 443. I did not consult
anyone, or even think the thing out for myself.
But I certainly shall consult him on this
motion whben we have a caucus.
On the
indemnity question the members of our group
were entitled to vote just as they pleased.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, the debate on the motion for adoption of Rule 18A was adjourned yesterday by
the honourable leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig).
Under our rules, he is not
entitled to move a further adjournment.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Mr. Speaker, I moved
that this order be discharged and placed on
the order paper for Tuesday. July 15. That is
seconded by the bonourable gentleman from
L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger).
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I understood from
a statement made by the leader of the bouse
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) that we are to meet on
Monday. Why should this order be put over
until Tuesday?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Some members of our
group are away and will not be back until
Monday night. I wish to consult them in
caucus, but that cannot be done until Tuesday.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Suppose the session is
prorogued Monday night?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: 'There is not a chance of
that.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I understand there is a
good chance of that.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is moved by
the Honourable Senator Haig, seconded by
the Honourable Senator Leger, that order
No. 1 be discharged and placed on the order
paper for Tuesday next. All in favour say
"Content".
Some Hon. SENATORS: Content.

JiyrY 11, 1947
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Ail opposed,
please say "Non-content".
Sovme Hon. SENATORS: Non-content.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: 1 think the Noncontents have it.
The debate is now on the motion of the
Honouiable Senator Robertson, that the Rules
of the Senate be amended by adding thereto
as Rule 18A, the foliowing:Sorne Hon. SENATORtS: Dispense.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I feel very sorry in many ways that the
debate lias taken this turn. I can see the
problem. of the banourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig). Frankly, 1 do flot attach
as much importance to the proposed change
in aur rules as perhaps some senators do. 1
suggested that it waa just a meana which I
hoped would prove effective in helping us to
accomplish what I understoad was the general
wish of the house. 1 had noticed from reports
of discussion in the past that leaders on both
sides-the Right Honourable Senator Meighen
and the late Right Hanourable Senator Dandurand, and others--were in favour of such
an amendment to our rules, and I was unable
to find that Ithere had been any disagreernent
with the proposai. There undoubtedly is considerable question as to whether or not the
proposed new rule would lie effective, and I
frankly admit that I arn not too certain about
it myseif. Any member who objecta to the
present motion is of course free to say so and
ta vote against it, but I feit that if the motion
were adopted I couid avail myseif of the
opportunity to approach ministers early next
session, and that at that time there would
probably be a good chance of seeing whether
the rule couid be made to work. Unless the
motion were adopted there would of course
be too much uncertainty about the whole
proposai to permit of any progress being made.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senatars, beifore this motion passes I
should like ta express a doubt that is in my
mind as to its advisability. I do not wish to
attack the idea horse, foot and artiilery but
I doubt that this proposai wili accompiish
what ita advocates have in mînd. I do not
think that if passed it wouid relieve to any
appreciabie extent the pressure of work in
the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. LAMB&ERT: May I interrupt my
honaurable friend to say that I think lie is
out of order. He is speaking to a motion
that was defeated.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, hie is speaking on the
original motion.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I was under the
impression that the motion to set the matter
over was defeated, and therefore we must go
on with the substance of the motion.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That la correct.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: And accordingly I
was speaking to it. I think a mistake was
made in not putting it over, but I ar n ot
allowed to criticize the hxouse for what it lias
already done. I believe it wauld have been
wiser ta have proceeded slowly. I arn quite
sure the house will carry the motion, but I
wish ta go on record as doubting the wisdom
of it.
Whea I was interrupted I was about to
say that 1 did flot think this proposai would
relieve matters in the House of Commons,
because legisiation of a cantentiaus nature
wii provoke debate in the other house
whether or flot we in this house liave passed
it. 0f course there are some things that we
turn down and which neyer get to the other
house, but it is not to be expected that we
wouid turn down goverfiment legisiation
whether or flot it was sponsared by a minister
of the Crown. Such a situation would happen
very seldom.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Wliy?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: My honourable
friend has had sarne experience in these halls,
as I have. I say it would be seidorn that we
would do that. Moreover, if in that way we
saved some tirne for the House of Commons,
it would aecornplish littie ini the end.
Tlie fact that we in this house ait fewer
hours than they do in the House of Commons
-and I ar nfot by any means adopting the
figures given to us-is due to two reasona.
First, we have only 96 membera as compared
with 245 in tlie other place, and added mernbership means added debate. Allied witli that
is the fact that we are flot making speeches
for aur constituents. In the second place the
great difference is that we do tbe moat of our
work in committee and nat an the floor of
the house. The obviaus answer is that the
House of Commnons should do more work in
committee. It might weli take a leaf out of
the books of the United States Congress,
where most of the debate takes place in camrnîttee. The House of Commons bas no appropriations carnrittee. Expenditures are determined by civil servants; the estimates that
corne down are practically neyer' çhanged.
There is no chance, except in the Public
Accounts Cornrittee, ta question expenditures.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Wliat about the Finance
Cornmittee?

83168-39
REVISED EDITION

SENATE
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The Finance Comnmittee hardly ever meets. For two or three
years while I sat in the House of Commons
the Public Accounts Committee did not meet;
everything was done in committee of the
whole with the printed amounts before us, and
a minister who had two civil servants sitting
in front of him telling what to say.
The House of Commons should have an
appropriations committee before which civil
servants with knowledge of particular divisions of accounts would appear and be asked
why they wanted so much money and what
they did with what they had received the
previous year. The committee would then be
in a position to recommend to the house
that certain expenditures be made. The debate
would be an informed one, and things would
be donc rapidly.
My feeling, and I emphasize it, is that this
proposal will not do what those who are
advocating it expect it to do. Some honourable senators may remember that in a debate
of a similar nature two or three sessions
ago I pointed out that the strength of this
house lay in its disinterested character, that
except one minister its members did not
hold office of any kind and were totally disassociated from the executive. We know that
the executive in the parliamentary system in
England robbed all other jurisdictions of their
powers. The Prime Minister, with his hand
on the purse strings, robbed the Crown of
all its powers, so that today it reigns but
does not rule. The executive then turned
its attention to parliament, and gradually
gathered into its hands nearly all the powers
of parliament. That may be a natural trend,
but it is one that we in this bouse, to the
utmost of our ability, should avoid.
Honourable senators will recall what took
place at the famous convention of 1787 in the
United States, when the question of the powers
of the executive was discussed and that country
framed its constitution. It provided that the
executive should not have the right to sit in
either house. Whether or not that was a
wise procedure, the purpose in mind was to
preserve the independence of parliament in its
statute-making powers. The philosophy of
England at that time and for a few years
afterwards was to keep all patronage out of
the house. The same thought was carried into
the American constitution, and it separated the
executive,
administrative
and
patronage
branches from the bouse which made the substantive law. That country determined that
it would not allow a minister to sit on the
floor of either house, and that the President
must select his advisers from among those who
do not sit in the house. The system of govern-

ment in the United States bas no direct application to what is now proposed, but it throws
a certain light on this measure.
The Senate of Canada bas been strong and
its advice has been listened to because it bas
been felt that its members were separated from
and not under the control of the executive.
Now you are stepping in the wrong direction.
Only this afternoon we gave second reading
to a measure to increase very generously the
stipends of the two leaders in this bouse; and
now we are proposing to rob them of their
chief importance, to take out of their hands
the work which they have been doing, and
place it in the hands of members of the
executive and bring them here.
Some Hon. MEMBERS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Of course that is
what you are doing. Do not fool yourselves,
gentleman. In the past the leaders of this
house-Senator Dandurand, Senator Meighen
and others-brought forward and explained
all the legislation which was passed; and they
knew their work. They did not need to have
civil servants sitting in front of them to tell
them what to say, and they did not have a
minister of the Crown sitting at their elbow
to make the speech for them. They made it
themselves, and explained the bill or whatever it was, and it was passed. Now what
are you going to do?-bring a minister 'here,
and allow the rest of us to be the audience?
Is that it? We are to be instructed by a minister on what this house is to do; we are to
be reasoned with and cajoled:
be will
explain his views, and with reasons answer you.
I do not like it, I am very doubtful of it;
I do not think we shall accomplish anything
through it; and I think it will have a deteriorating effect upon the status and procedure
of this chanber.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: May I point out
to the honourable member for TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) that a few
moments ago we listened to a real diatribe on
the uselessness of the Senate and the short
hours we put in. This is a real, honest, sincere effort to make the Senate more useful;
and unless some alternative proposal is made,
I am in favour of this suggestion.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is why I
expressed doubt, instead of attacking it. I
know it is a sincere effort on the part of
those who are advocating this measure to
improve the situation; and all I have done is
to express my doubt that they will suceed,
and to say that I do not like it.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I do not share the
apprehension expressed a few moments ago
by the honourable member from Toronto-

JULY 11, 1947
Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). If the change in
the rules of this house to permit a minister of
the Crown temporarily to enjoy a seat in this
house, to explain a measure, detracted in any
way from, or lessened, or was likely to lessen
the importance of the work which this house
has to do, I think I should agree with the
honourable memiber from Toronto-Trinity.
But I maintain that that is not the result
which we shall reach. Any person who studies
the events which led to the confederation
of the Canadian provinces cannot be other
than impressed with the purpose in the minds
of the founders of our nation as to what
responsibilities the Senate should discharge.
The Senate was to be essentially a revising
body. It was to be a body-to quote as I
recall them the words of Sir John A.
Macdonald, with which I agree-which would
have "a sober second iook" at legislation which
originated in the House of Commons. That
to my mind is the primary function that this
honourable house has to discharge in its
place ii the governing of our country. I do
not anticipate that the passage of this resolution, which will amend our rules, will interfere
with or lessen that function in any respect.
What happens? An opportunity will be
given in the first instance for the introduction
of measures, which I anticipate will be in the
main non-contentious measures, on the floor of
this house. The minister in charge will explain
them; he will state the purpose of the legislation, the facts which led to a decision on
the part of the executive to introduce them
and make them part of the laws of this
country. We shall listen to him if be comes,
we shall ask him questions and then we shall
consider the measure before us in precisely the
saime fashion as we would consider it if it had
originated in the House of Commons and
come to this chamber in the ordinary way.
Our powers of taking a "sober second look"
at the measure, our powers to revise it, are not
in any way lessened or reduced.
I do think that on the positive side we
may make a contribution to the more effective functioning of our parliamentary institution as a whole, because our parliamentary
institution is comprised of two bodies ,the
House of Commons and the Senate. It should
assist in expediting the legislative work of
parliament, and to the extent that it did so
I should think it would prove a distinct
adivantage. Therefore I do not share the
apprehensions expressed by the honourable
member from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck).
There is a good deal of talk about the
position of the Senate: indeed,, some people
in this country think that the Senate is a

831689j

n[i[u]]

sort of useless appendage to our law-making
machinery. I said on one occasion before in
this house, and, I repeat it now, that the
Senate, with the functions it has to discharge,
is just as important a body in the law-making
process as the flouse of Commons; and if
there are any in this country who think that
they could wipe the Senate out of existence
without tremendous repercussions throughout
Canada, they are very much mistaken. I am
somewhat amused at times in reading the
obiter dicta of some intellectual gentlemen
who dwell on Mount Olympus and imagine
that they are endowed with some sort of
superior wisdom which enables them to organize the life of the nation. In my judgment
that doctrine will never receive acceptance by
the Canadian people.
I have just one thought more to add. There
have been some suggestions in recent days
that the Senate should be reformed. I shall
not say where those suggestions originated.
All of us are familiar with them. In the first
place we should clarify our own thought as to
what is meanft by "Senate reform"; and in the
second place, if any joint committee of the
Commons and the Senate is to be set up to
consider Senate reform, I for one want such
a committee to consider not only Senate
ieform but parliamentary reform, and that
includes reform of the procedure in the flouse
of Commons.
iMr. Speaker, I may be skating close to
the rules and I do not wish to say anything
in criticism of what we sometimes euphemis.tically describe as the other place. In the
other place this year the budget debate lasted
for three weeks and over ninety speeches
were made, most of which contributed
nothing whatever to the welfare of Canada
and were simply the propaganda of certain
elements in the political life of this country.
Therefore, if there is to be a joint inquiry
into the reform of the Senate it had better
take on a wider aspect and include an inquiry
into the procedure of the fHouse of Commons.
I am satisfied that improvements could be
made in both chambers that would place them
in a more effective position to carry out the
responsibility that parliament was created to
discharge. In my judgment there is nothing
more important than to maintain and retain
throughout the great body politie of this
country a high regard and respect for our
law making institutions. It is the responsibility of members of parliament, whether
they are here or in the Commons, to keep
that thought before them at all times and

612

SENATE

so order their conduct that they earn and
retain the respect of the people who, in the
last analysis, it is their duty to serve.
Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, there are reasons why more should
be said on this question than has been said
so far. I personally regret having to be one
of those who have denied the wishes of my
honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig),
for I have received from him a great many
personal courtesies during the ten years that
we have been associated in this chamber.
It seems to me that this question does not
need a great deal of further consideration
from any experienced member in this bouse.
The matter was fully discussed in 1934, at
which time both Senator Dandurand and
Senator Meighen expressed approval of the
My honourable friend
principle involved.
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) knows-and he
knows I know-that this proposal has been
the subject of iniformal discussion in our
offices, in the corridors and elsewhere around
this building for a great many years.
There is no profound problem in this
motion; and there is no finality ta it. The
matter will be disposed of in a few days and
if, at any time in the development of this
matter, any of the dire predictions that have
been made really threaten us, they cannot
fall upon us like an avalanche and wipe us
out in one blow. They would first show
symptoms and they could be corrected by
repealing the amendment.
At the moment I am more concerned with
the philosophy of the problem, the purpose
that is behind this resolution and the criticisms that arise from time to time-and will
arise in the future-as a resuilt of what is
being done here today. I therefore think it
is necessary that some further discussion
should be had. We start out with the principle, with which I am sure every senator is
in accord, that in these times the work of
parliament is increasing. No one is being
done an injustice. When one looks around
at one's associates one sees that they are
some of the most experienced men in Canada.
They represent all branches of activity in the
country, and no group of men in the country
is better equipped to assist in connection with
legislation and all other matters that pertain
to the problems of good government in
Canada. All that is involved in this legislation is to see that the basic difficulty in the
functioning of our governmental sys'tem in
the Senate is removed.

What is the difficulty? I would say without
any question that the basic difficulty is the
fact that legislation does not come to the
Senate early enough in the session.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: During the remarks
made by the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock), in which he only
touched the fringe of the subject when be
should have said more, be indicated how little
the Senate sat when the debate of the address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne was
in progress. That situation is not the fault
of the Senate. The difficulty is that while
speeches are being made in reply to the
Speech from the Throne by members who
have been elected to office, and who feel very
properly that they must speak for their constituents, no legislation is being passed in the
House of Commons. The result is that no
legislation comes to the Senate for days and
weeks.
One of the ideas in the minds of those who
are pressing for this proposal-one that was
strongly adivocated in 1934 by Senators
Dandurand and Meighen-is that, if contemporaneously with the Speech from the
Throne legislation could be originated and
considered by the Senate, much time and
effort would be saved. It would also mean
that our efforts could then be directed to the
work for which we are here. I am still practising law and I find it a financial sacrifice,
as does my honourable friend opposite (Hon.
Mr. Marcotte), to come here under this setup. Perhaps it makes no difference because
the governmenit takes most of our money
away from us anyway. It is not a desirable
situation that compels us to come to the
opening of parliament from the city of Vancouver or from other places, only to find ourselves kicking our heels around here while
speeches go on day after day in the House
of Commons. Neither is it desirable to have
to travel back and forth when adjournments
take place. Surely if men are willing to sacrifice of their time and their private affairs
to attend parliament there ought to be some
method of diealing with legislation that would
enable us to do our share in giving good
governmen't to Canada.
What is the real reason that prevents this
being done? One reason, of course, is that
legislation is not always ready in the other
bouse; but if the ministers thenselves knew
that there was a place in which their legislation could be d'ealt with, there would not be
the samne excuse for delay. I say to honourable senators ithat it would be just as easy
ta introduce certain legislation into this house

JULY 11, 1947
on January 30 as it ie at the end, of the session. For example, I refer to the amendiments

to -the Crimi-nal Code tihat the Senate did flot
have an opportunîty of consideriing in comrnittee, until the other day, and to which no
consideration enuId 'be given in the Senate

chamber because our amendments to the bill
had to go to the other house in time to be
considered before prorogation.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That situation applies
to much other leg-isiation. Honourable senators, from what I have heard and seen I would
say that one of the main reasons why a minister does not, have bis legîclation introduced

here je that he d'oes flot wish to sec it introduced by somebody else. That is only buman
nature. He does flot want to have it discussed
and passed through one branch of parliament,
and perhaps have it receive, much newspaper
publicity, wbile ail the time be bas flot had a
single word to say either ini defence of it or as
to bis policy in connection witb it. That je the
basic reason. For eigbty years we bave had
that experience, and for seventy-nine years

complainte bave been made in this bouse and
ail over Canada that not enougb legislation je
initiated in the Senate. I think it je .iust about
time that some attempt was made to meet
that complaint.
My bonourable friend fron Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) says be je afraid tbe
proposed new rule will not work in practice.
He may be rigbt. But if it doce flot work, no
barm will be donc. No ministers will then be
coming into this chamber to tell us what to
do, and: not a cingle one of the other direful
predictions of my bonourable friend will corne
to pass. But if the rule dioes work and, ministers come into the chamber and recommend
that we pass their measures, that will be only
what the leader of the government in the
Senate bas alwaye donc. Like bis predecessors,
my bonourable fritind the present leader (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) was not selected for bis office
by the Senate; be was selected by the Prime
Minister. Wben the leader speaks to a bill
in the Senate be is speaking for the government, juet as surely as the minister responsible
for the bill would be speaking for the government und:er the proposed new rule; and the
leader's instructions to this bouse are just as
mandatory as would be those of any of bis
colîcagues. The point is, in my humble suggestion, that no instructions are given by the
leader. and none would be given by any other
member of the cabinet.
Let me remind my honourable friend from
Toronto-Trinity that for a long time it bas
been the customn for cabinet ministers to
corne to our commibtees and defend their

615

legisiation. Has anybody ever felt thýat the
dîgnity of the Senate was impaired wben a
cabinet minister told senators in eommittee
what be thougbt they should do? Has a
cingle member of this house ever been conscious of the oppressive influence of a cabinet

minister upon himn at one of our committee
meetings? I do flot tbink so. And I believe
that if my bonourable friend fromn TorontoTrinity gives furtber consideration -to the
matter he will agree that there je no more
danger of oppressive influence being exercised
hy a cabinet minister in Committee of the
Whole, or at a regular sitting of the Senate
than in one of our standing committees. I
predict that if a cabinet minister were to
corne over fromn the Huse of Commone and
make a speech here in support of a bill, the
memnbers of this bouse would be on their tocs
to offer far stronger criticisrm and opposition
than tbey ordinarily do under precent conditions. I know of aggreceive ministers, and if
one of them cponsored corne legielation here
and it contained eometbing I did no-t like I
would enjoy attacking it more than if the
measure had been introduced here by my
most inoffensive end courteous leader (Hon.
Mr. Robertson).

Havîng made those observations, I ack the
indulgence of bonourable members

wbile I

speak for a few moments on what I think are
the fundamental questions raised by this
motion. It seeme to me that corne barm. may
be donc by speeches made in another place
and inaccurate statements made in this bouse
which will be spread ail over the country.
It bas been said many times that the great
function of the Senate is to exercice independent second thought directed to protection of
the rigbts of citizens, individually or in groups
-racial, territorial or religiouc or other groupe.
I do not tbink anyone can dispute the statement, whicb bas so often been made, that but
for the establishment of the Senate there
neyer would have been Confederation.
Sonie Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: My suggestion to
bonourable senators is that there are stronger
reasons today for a body with the constitutional powers and limitations of the Senate
than there bas ever beeýn before in the history
of our country.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: 1 have heard it said that
abolition of the Senate je a plank in the platform of the C.C.F. party. They dlaimn that the
Senate je flot an elected body, that it does not
represent the people and therefore doce not
accord with democracy. I know of no word
in the Englisb language that je more often

614

SENATE

misinterpreted and abused than that good word
"democracy."
Any person who thinks that
"democracy" means majority rule and nothing
more has no correct conception of the word.
I have given a good deal of thought to the
function of the Senate, and on more than one
occasion have made speeches about it to
service clubs. I have not spoken as eloquently
and effectively as my honourable friend from
Lincoln (Hon. Mr. Bench), whom I am sorry
to see I have driven out of the bouse.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: He is down at the far
end.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: He usually sits behind
me, but he apparently could not take this
speech of mine at short range.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: My conclusion is that
the best definition of "democracy" was given
by Abraham Lincoln:
Government of the people, by the people, for
the people.
That is not government of the majority, by
the majority and for the majority; it is government of the people, by the people and for
the people-and that means all the people.
The government in power is under obligation
to see that minorities in the country get just
as fair treatment as those who happen for
the time being to be in the majority. Majority
rule may be mob rule, if it is made the only
basis on which government is conducted. The
unbridled and unrestricted action of a majority
may be, not democracy, but pure dictatorship.
[f by any chance there was in Canada a
majority government, inflamed by class hatred
and spurred on by lust for power, it would be
as far from democratic government as anything that anyone could conceive.
The reason why I am emphasizing this
matter just now is that the C.C.F. party saysI am referring, not to what bas been stated
in the other bouse, but to speeches and
pamphlets that have been circulated throughout this country for years-that the Senate
should be abolished, so that if that party
comes into power it will have a free hand in
giving effect to its policies. To my mind
that attitude is not justified by the facts, and
the proposal is a sinister threat to the rights
of minorities. The Senate would never block
any policy that it considered te be in the
interest of the people, whether that policy
was advocated by the C.C.F. or by any other
party.
In his book on the British Constitution, Mr.
Dicey, the great constitutional authority,
devotes more than one chapter to the "conventions of the constitution". Most lawyers,

though net all of them, understand the principles of that doctrine, and many laymen who
have studied the constitution understand the
doctrine just as well. The doctrine is that
certain things are done, as it were, by convention, without any specific statutory authority.
For instance, if a, ministry is defeated in the
House of Commons it resigns. But there is
net a word in any statute requiring it to do se.
Ministers could net be taken into court and
compelled to resign. That is one of the basic
conventions of the constitution; it is one of
the things that is net done. The duty of His
Majesty the King in giving assent to bills is
controlled largely by the conventions of the
constitution, and so it is with the Canadian
Senate.
I do know of no one who had a clearer
conception of the fun'etions of the Senate than
Mr. Arthur Meighen. I have listened, to him
when ho was leader in this bouse, analysing,
criticizing and alnost destroying by his forceful argument the reasons adxvanced for the
introduction and passage of government bills.
But if those bills concerned government policy
and were representative of the sentiment of
the people who elected the government, and
no minority rights were being involved, Mr.
Meighen would never go further than to
protest the measures. Even when he conmanded a majority in this bouse ho recognized
the conventions of the constitution.
That is the way the Senate will function,
irrespective of the party in power. But any
time that a government seeks te use its
majority as an instrument of tyranny to
deprive provinces, religions denominations,
corporations or individuals of their rights;
then under our system of government the
Senate bas a power that it must exercise.
The government of the day, by an appeal to
the people, always bas the power of overcoming any obstruction the Senate might
put up. No matter how serious the tyranny
may be if the people back up the government,
there comes a tinie when majority rule must
take its course.
The people of Great Britain have had the
finest conception of democracy of any people
in the world. In working it out they have
recognized the necessity for majority rule. I
regard it more as an expedient than a justification of a principle. Somebody bas to rule,
and under the democratie system the majority
must do it. The British people have also recognized that a majority, unrestricted and uncontrolled, may be as harmful as seme great
mecbanical instrument which bas no brakes or
regulating influence to slow it down.

JULY 11, 1947

That, ta my mind, illustrates the basic funetian of the Senate. Its service cannat be messured in hours, even if tbey were taken from. a
diary and sbowed the correct number of hours
spent. I submit. t.hat tbe only way :the service of the Senate can be measured is in the
functions which required the creation of this
institution, and demand its perpetuation. It is
not, in regard ta the fundamental funictions
of the Senate that this amendment is proposed, but rather as regards what I cali the
secondary function of the Senat.e. We are here
both to gîve service and ta assure the people that
fair play will be meted out. We know that. as
long as a policeman walks the streets there is
not much danger of anything going wrang;
but bis absence miglit resuit in a great deal
of harm. One cannot judge bis service by the
number of arrests hie makes, and the service
af the Senate should not be judged by the
number of times it bas bsd ta step in snd
exercise its power, but by the fsct that its very
existence assures protection.
Let us now corne ta the second phase of
tbe argument. I bave said, and flot in a
bosst fui way, that we are a group of men of
experience; we have been active in many
branches of public life; we have bad experienc-e in professional and industrial fieldis, and
are here desirous of gi-ving service. 'The
debaIes in the Flouse of Commons take up a
great deal of time and -the demsnd an the
cabinet ministers is so tremendous that it is
affedting their nervaus energy and, phyvsical
bealth. I doa nat see bow it is possible for
nien ta sit in the bouse for tbe long bours that
tbey are required to put in, and ta hold
cabinet meetings, receive delegationis, go out
in the country and make speeches, do the
innumerable otber things that cabinet minmsters bave ta do, and still retain sufficienit
energy and vigour ta enable tbema ta thin
clearly. If we could do sometbing ta alleviste
nootbing could be more
that situation.
desirable.
friend from Torontohonourable
My
Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roehuck) says that hie is
afraid the proposai will not work out. Maybe
lie is correct in bis view; but I believe that
if tbe scbeme f ails the responsibility will flot
be on this bouse but on the Dominion
Cabinet.
May I read whst tbe Prime Minister sajd
in the otber boeuse yesterday? Sinýce it is
material ta justify what we are praposmng ta
do, I tbink I arn entitled ta refer ta it. Hie
is reported in Hansard as follows:
I would say ta my bion. friend that I have
had several conversations with the leader of
the government in the Senate and witb some of
the senators as ta the possibility of some im-

mediate reforms being made whieh would enable
the Senate ta play a more important and effective part in the business of parliament. As a
resuit of these conversations I understand that
there has been consideration by hion. members
of the Senate of some of the matters raised and
,that at the present time they are receiving
f avourab]e consideration by members of the
Senate.
I cail honourable senators particular attention to the following words:
1 might mention one question. I had suggested that I thought it wou]d facilitate further
co-operation between the two bouses if ministers
of the croivn were granted permission to appear
on the floor of the Senate chamber when important government measures were being presented and that they should have the rigbt to
participate in the debate and to answer any
questions which miglit 'be asked. I believe that
that refornm would be most he]pful and 1 have
reason tao believe that it is one which will be
favourably entertained by the Senate.
That is the statement of tbe Prime Minister of Canada, and I think that -my bhonourable frienci is en'titled. ta take him. at hýis
word. If tihis proposai is carried out it can
only mean, as the Prime Minister saidL, that
thie minist-ers will send legisiation ta this
bouse eariy in the session and bave it introduced her.e. If tbat is done, honaurable senatars, one part of what we are seeking ta do
will have been accomplisbed.
My bonourable friend frorn TorontoTrinity bas said that tthat would flot salve
the question as far as ýtbe other ýhouse is concerned. While thet may -be true, it does
solive tie problem ta this extent, tibat while
the ather bouse is engaged in day-to-day
discussion on tbe Address in Reply ta tbe
Speecb from the Tbrone, and a similar discussion on the budget-and how .mueb does
tbat long discussion ev.er save this country?
-new legîsiation S-n be intraduced in the
Senate. Once in a while sornetbing cornes up,
but for the most parnt the debate des not
effect any saving of the time of the bouse, and
it is not expeoted ta do so; the speeches are
for another wortby purpose-to, send word ta
"tbe boys baok home."
Referring to this bill cancerning dominionprovincial relations, my honourable friend
spoke ta me about it soine weeks ago. I do
flot know wbether it was ready then, but
tibere was no reason in tbe world wby it
should not have been. It could bave been
ready long ago, and had ýit been introduced
in the Senate we would have bad an opportunity for a full discussion. Suppose tbat, in
the first week of -the session, the DominionProvincial Relatione Bill bad been introduced
in this bouse, moved hy rny honourable
friend thbe leader, aecording ta bis constitutional duty; biben bis colleague the Minister

SENATE
of Finance, seated in one of these chairs,
could have been called upon t.o prescrnt his
argument in support of the measure.
What objection can there be to that proceeding?
Wben the minister had been heard,
other speeches would be made, and, there
would hav e been ample time for consideration
of the bill either in cornrittee of the whole
or by one of the standing committees. An
opportunity would have been availýable to Mr.
Abbott, wbile speech after speech was being
made in the other place, on the Speech frorn
the Tbrone to appear before us at a time
wbicb would alloxv ample opportunity for full
consideration. The main point to, be ernplasized is, nlot that the minister could deal with
the matter any better than my bonourabl-e
friend the leader of this house or rnany other
honuurable senatoîr. wlîu right be assigned to
do it. but that under the present systern these
bonourable gentlemen do not get an opportunity to do it here. If by the present proposai
we can correct that condition, we shail have
done sometbing well worth while; and if otherwise. the Senate will be tlien in a position to
say, "We did our best; the Prime Minister
gave us an assurance in the House of Comnmons that the cpportunity would be afforded
us; and the failiire rests elsewhere, not witb
us"
There is another point to whicbi I wish to
eall attention. We are told that if this change
is made no tirne will be env cd, because the
work wvill be donc ahl over again in the House
of Commons. But does anyone suppose that
so rnucb limiie would be sputl onLhe bills
in the other bouse if they were thorougbly
examined here? Bear in mind that the news
value of legislation bias an influence on the
time spEnt in discussing il. Wben a bill bias
been discussed first in thi,. house, and the
"break of the news" lias taken place frorn here,
the chances are that there will not be the samne
motive for long speeches in the other bouse.
Apart frnrn tisat con..ideratinn, we shah bring
to an end a specta(cle which to my knowledge
bias goîse on in ev cry sess'ion for the ladt ten
years.
1 ask, ry bonourable friend from
Queen's MHon. Mr. Sinclair), during tIse time
ho bias been biere if hoe bias not witnessed a
similar congestion of logishation, rarnmed
tbrough at the tast, minute, millions of dollars
voted and aIl sorts of problems deterrnined
and rushed tbrough the House of Commons
by tired and jadcd men, and tossed. in here
witb the warning that "you have got to put
it tbrough this afte-rnoon or you wiil liold up
the wbolo House of Commons". That, to
my mi, is one of the worst features, not of
the Senate's work, but of tbe work of parliament. I say, honourable senators, without

any doubt that at least twenty bills with
wbich sve are called upon to deal this session
could bave been sent to us earlier, and no
suggestion would arise that proper consideration was not given tbern. Many ýpieces of
legislation are being tossed in during this bot
weatber, and more will be received in tbe
next few days. This sort of tbing bias been
going on-and it is no reflection on the
Senate-for eigbty years.
Today we are nearer to a solution than
at any previous lime, and I env to the leader
of the opposition that the tirne to deal witb
it ie now. My bionourable friend says, "Oh,
we can do it next session". But wbat wo
sbould do is to put it up to the goverrnent
at a time wvben tbe government say they are
prepared to consider il. If we do nol pass
this resolutiun nuw, the mnrbers of the
goverfirnent will be justified in saying, "You
do not take tîsis seriously; you do a lot of
talking, but the trouble is, you do flot want
to do any work." If we want to accomplisb
sorncthing during tbe opening weeks of the
next session, we sbould act on tbis proposai
now, so tbat the governent will know, in
tbe period frorn now until next January,
while tbey are preparing tbeir legislation, that
tbe way is open to bring in legislation without
any loss of tinie. Tbey wvill know more:
-,hey will know, too, tbat they are e.xpected
to carry out the~ obligation implied in tbse
.,taternent of tbe Prime Minister. I hope,
isonourable senators, that tbis resolution will
carry this aftcrnoon.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Would the leader of
the governrnent accept a sligbt ameodment
of bis motion? I suggest that after the word
"1may", in tbe flftb line, the words "witb leave
of the Sonate" ho added. I do not tbink the
effect of the motion will ho cbanged.
lIon. Mr. FARRIS: It will be, for tbis
reason: a minister rnay say, "I am flot going
to introduce a bill bere, because I shaîl not
know until the time cornes wbetber tbey are
going to Jet me in or nlot."
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Well, it will always
have to ho done witb leave of tbe Sonate.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: But if we give thse
beave in advance, tbe minister will know that
hoe can corne here; wbereas if beave is to be
given on each occasion, after tbe introduction of the bill, he will bave an "alibi"; bie
w'îhl say, "I won't take any chances".
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: I do not want to
add more than a word or two. Wben I proposed to, adjourn tbe debate on a certain other
matter, I bad it in rnind to speak along rnucb
the same lines as rny bonourable friend bias

JULY 11, 1947
done, although not as eloquently as he has.
The leader on this aide bas not asked the
house to defeat the motion; what he bas said
is, "Pass it at this session, but gîve us until
Tuesday to consider it." I do flot think it wil
do any harm to wait until Tuesday.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I wouhd like to vote
for it wbile we are here.
Hon. Mr. MARGOTTE: We will be here
then.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: There is a rumour that
we shahl have finished on Monday.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: With ahh deference to my honourable friend, whose position
I quite understand, I feel that in the circumstances I must take the responsibility of
asking for immediate action. Some of those
who have spoken doubt the effectiveness of
the proposal. I can sec no harmn in trying it,
and if it fails to produce the desired resuits
I shaîl he one of the first to admit the fact,
and wouhd he quite willing to entertain a
motion to eiminate it. But I can sec no particular harm in taking this action, and I
should hike very much to he armed with this
permission. At the same time I recognize the
viewpoint of my honourable friend the leader
of the opposition, in expressing grave doubts
of its effectiveness.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Robertson was
agreed to on the folhowîng division:

READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shahl this
bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If the house is
agreeable, I should like to have second reading
now. It is a very short bill, and, I think, not
a contentious one. I have asked the bonourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
to move the second reading.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR moved the second
reading of -the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, thýis bill
is somewhat unusual. I am informed that if
the so-called labour code introduced in -the
Gommons to provide for the investigation,
conciliation and settiement of industrial
disputes had been proceeded with, the clauses

RzVISzu EDITION

SENATE
in the bill now before us would have been
part of that measure. However, when it was
decided net to proceed witb the labour code
this year, the Hudson Bay Mining and
Smelting Company found itself in a rather
unusual position.
The company is operating in northwestern
Manitoba; it lias invested approximately 35
million dollars in power plant and mining
works; it mines more than 5,000 tons of ore
per day, and employs between 2,200 and 2,300
men. In 1929, when the company located
its plant in Manitoba, the boundary line botween that province and tbe province of
Saskatchewan had net been defined at the
particular point in question. Later. ie 1936
or 1937, the boundary was defined, and after
its demarkation the company found that nlot
only was its mine partly in Manitoba and
partlv in Sas~katchewan, but that the boundary
ran right througb a number of its buildings,
witb the result that some of its employees
were working on botb sides of tbe lino-part,
of the time in Manitoba. and part in Saskatchewan-a situation wbich brougbt these
employees under tbe labour provisions of the
two provinces.
During tbe war tbe employees operated
under Order in Council P.C. 1003, the provisions of wbicb are carried on today under the
Emergency Powers Transitional Act. The
company is now asking that, in accordanre
with the provisions in tbe constitution, its
works bo declared a work for the advantage
of ta o provinces. This request is supported
by the governments of Saskatchewan and
Manitoba and by the unions in tbe plant.
We have this rather unusual situation: the
two provinces affected and the employees con(trned have asked that when the new federal
labour code finally becomes law the employees
bc broug-ht uinder it, except in respect te workmen's compensation, whicb, by agreement of
tbe provinces, the men and the company, is
ef t outside the purview of federal control.
I hav e explained briefly the necessity for
the legislation, and I do net sec that there can
bc any objection te it. I hope tbe bill will
net only receive second reading tonight, but
aIse, if agrecable, third reading. I sec ne
occasion for sending it te a cemmittee.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators. naturally I know quite a bit about the
mining operation referred te, in this bill, as
I had the pleasure of visiting the area in
August, 1920, before there was a mine there
et ail.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I was there in 1917.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: My honourable friend
will remember that there was scarcely a hole
there in 1920-j ust a pile of material on top
of the ground.
I arn entirely in accord with what is propused by this bill, and sbould like te caîl
attention te an intcresting feature with respect
to this particular mininig devclepmcnt. The
ore wvas sent te American smelters and aise te
the Britis~h Columbia smelters, but ne formula
ceuld be found for separating the minerai frem
the ore. The prometers of the mine then
spent a million dollars on a pilot plant in
order te discover how te separate the varieus
mineraIs frein the ore body, and they have
been highly successful.
As my honourable friend from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) has said, the mine is
lt,cated right on the boundary line between
Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and a satisfactory arrangement with respect te werkmen's
compensation hias been worked eut between
the two provinces.
1 amn heartily in accord with the proposaIs
contained in the bill, and sec ne necessity for
sending it te committee.
Ncxt year the
labour code will corne inte effect, and of
course this particular eperation will corne
under it.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: May I ask the
honourable senator if this mine is near a place
called Winnipeg?
Hon. Mr. HAIýG: No, but somne of its shares
are held there.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: It dees seem. te me
a most cxtraordinary thing, in order te bring
a cempany under the labour code, te declare
it te be for the general advantage of Canada.
1 may bc wrong; 1 have net followed tbe
details of this bill; but if ail that is required
is te make tbis code applicable te the cernpany. the ternis of the bill sbould directly
express tbat purpose, and there sbould net be
this rouindabout methed of declaring it te be
"for the general advantage of Canada-with
ail the possible implications whicb, on short
notice, I arn unable te imagine. It sounds
a little like burning down a bouse te roa.st a
l)ig. Why net go at it tbe direct way instead
of the reundabeut way?
The motion was agreed te, and the bill was
read the second time.

HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL
FREEDOMS
THIRD REPORT OF JOINT COMMITTEE

Hon. L. M. GOUIN presented the third
report of the Joint Committee on Human
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as follows:
Saturday, July 12, 1947.
The Joint Committee on Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms beg leave to make their
third report, as follows:To obtain a clearer concept of its duties, your
Committee, as a preliminary step in its inquiry,
resolved its Order of Reference of May 26 into
three divisions, namely:(1) To consider the question of human rights
and fundamental freedoms, and the manner in
which those obligations accepted by all members
of the United Nations may (best be implemented;
And, in particular, in the light of the provisions contained in the Charter of the United
Nations, and the establishment by the Economie
and Social Council thereof of a Commission on
Human Rights:
(2) What is the legal and constitutional situation in Canada with respect to such rights:
(3) And, what steps, if any, it would be advisable to take or to recommend for the purpose of preserving in Canada respect for and
observance of human rights and fundamental
freedoms.
The Deputy Minister of Justice was heard in
regard to the legal and constitutional position
in Canada in so far as human rights are concerned, while an officer of the Department of
External Affairs gave evidence respecting the
obligations assumed by Canada as a meniber of
the United Nations.
The Director of the Division of Human Rights,
Department of Social Affairs, United Nations,
appeared and supplied information relative to
the activities of the United Nations in the matter of humai rights.
Contained in your Committee's minutes of
proceedings and evidence are copies of documents relative to the subject-matter of the
Order of Reference.
At the outset, it was apparent that at the
present session only preparations could be made
for a subsequent detailed study of human rights
and fundamental freedoms. Consequently, your
Committee has invited the attorneys-general of
the provinces and the heads of Canadian law
schools to furnish views and opinions on the
question of the power of the Parliament of
Canada to enact a comprehensive Bill of Rights
applicable to all Canada.
83168-40J

It is recommended that early next session a
joint committee be appointed to resume consideration of the task assigned to your Committee.
A printed copy of the minutes of proceedings
and evidence is appended.
All which is respectfully submitted.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into
consideration
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: At the next sitting of
the Senate.
FOURTH REPORT OF JOINT COMMITTEE

Hon. L. M. GOUIN presentedi the fourth
report of the Joint Committee on Human
Fundamental Freedoms, as
Rights and
follows:
The Joint Committee on Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms beg leave to make their
fourth and final report, as follows:
The subject-matter of Bill 133, an Act to
amend the Criminal Code (Illegal Organizations), came before your Committee for consideration. Much of the attention of your Committee having been devoted to other matters
referred to it in a prior Order of Reference, it
became apparent that, at this late stage of the
session, proper consideration could not be given
to the subject-matter of Bill No. 133.
In view, however, of the fact that your Committee, in its third report, recommended the
appointment early next session of a similar
Committee, it is anticipated that it would be
possible at that time to give consideration to
the subject-matter of such a bill.
A copy of the relevant printed minutes of
proceedings and evidence of the CommitteeNos. 1, 6 and 7-is appended.
All which is respectfully submitted.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, when shal this report be considered?
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: At the next sitting of
the Senate.

The motion was agreed to.
SECOND REPORT OF JOINT COMMITTEE

Hon. Mrs. FALLIS presented the second
report of the Joint Committee on the Printng
of Parliament as follows:
It lias corne to the attention of your Committee that, with the considerable increase in the
volume of work of the Printing Bureau during
the session, the reprinting of members' speeches
causes serions delay in the official printing of
parliament and that, as a result, it bas been
uecessary to "farm out" some of the latter at
increased cost to the public, Your Committee,
accordingly, reconmends:
(1) That the official printing of parlianent
take precedence over the reprinting of such
speeches as are ordered by the mnembers
individually;

(2) That in the reprinting of members'
speeches the following ruies be strictly adhered
to:
(a) Each reprint of a spccLh or speeches,
ordered by a member shall be an exact
replica in context of the report as

photographs, or illustrations, and
onlY such subiect-natter or main headngs as appear in the official reports;
(t) No special cover shall be used and no
covering letters shall be added to or
included in the speeches so reprinted.
Ail which is respectfully suîbmitted.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
report be considered,?
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Next sitting.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, T wish to make a suggestion to the house
which might facilitate the business of the
Senate. As there are many items on the order

paper, it is possible that we shall be unable to
deal with them all tonight. Therefore I would
ask the Senate to consent to having two items
that are close to the end of the order paper
moved forward. I should like to have item
No. 9 called at once. It is my intention to
move that we insist upon our amendments to
the Criminal Code bill, and if the Senate supports that motion a message will have to be
seuf to the House of Commons and another
message will have to be returned here asking
for a conference. This would be followed by
a motion to appoint managers for the
conference.
After order No. 9 has been dealt with, I
should like to have the Clerk call order No. 4,
for the second reading of Bill 451, the Western
Provinces Treasury Bills and Natural Resources Settlement Act. My reason for desiring
to have this order called second is that I had
asked my honourable friend, from QueensLunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) to move the
second reading and explain the bill, and he
finds it necessary to be away tomorrow. I
should very much like to avail myself of his
services, and it occurs to me that he could
explain the bill, and that any other honourable
senator who desires to speak on it might move
adjournment of the debate, so that we can
proceed with the remainder of the order paper.
Next, I should be glad if the house would
consent to the calling of item No. 7, consideration of the amendments made by the Standing
Committee on Civil Service Administration to
Bill 413. The honourable gentleman from
Queens-Lunenberg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) is particularly interested in this subject and would
like to have it dealt with this evening. After
these three items have been disposed of, we
could proceed with the remaining items, commencing with order No. 1.
I therefore move that order No. 9 be called
first, order No. 4 second. and order No. 7 third,
and that the remaining orders, beginning with
No. 1, be then proceeded with.
The motion was agreed to.
CRIMINAL CODE BILL
INSISTENCE UPON SENATE AMENDMENTS

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, it bas been suggested that perhaps at
this stage of the session a joint conference of
managers of both bouses might be successful in
resolving differences of opinion regarding two
of the Sonate amendments to the Criminal
Code Bill. whieh were not accepted by the
other house. As a firsf step to this end I would
therefore move:
That the Senate do insist upon its second and
fif-teenth amendments made to Bill 364, an Act
to anend the Criminal Code, to which the

621

JULY 14, 1947
House of Commons has disagreed, and that a
message be sent to the House of Commons
accordingly.
The motion was agreed to.
WESTERN PROVINCES TREASURY
BILLS AND NATURAL RESOURCES
SETTLEMENT BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. J. J. KINLEY movecd the second
reading of Bill 451, an Act respecting the
refunding and adjustment of indebtedness of
the four western provinces to the Government
of Canada in respect of certain outstanding
loans for relief and, other purposes and final
settlement of the claims of the provinces of
Alberta and Saskatchewan in respect of
natural resources.
He said: Honourable senators, the members
of this house, and, I am sure, most Canadians
of mature age, remember the depression which
overtook this country and a large part of
the world in the thirties. In -Canada the
depression was especially bad in the western
provinces, whose economy largely depends
upon agricultural products of a certain type.
The people out there were mostly growers of
grain, and the grain price on the world market
fell below the cost of production. Then there
was a drought, accompanied by various
scourges-such as hordes of grasshoppers-that usually result from any prolonged lack of
rain. The western provinces therefore found
themselves in a hopeless financial condition
and had to appeal to the fedieral government
for loans and for guarantees of loans. Their
credit and financial independence were gone.
It was my privilege to travel through western Canada when the depression was at its
height, and I must say that as I journeyed
from Winnipeg to Moose Jaw, on to Regina
and through to Calgary, I had -the feeling
that it must be a terrible country to live in.
I am sure that all who remember the situation
in those days will agree with me that the
people there were in a bad plight indeed.
Down in the Maritimes we never have very
prosperous years, but neither are we subjected
to the extremely bad years that some other
parts of the country have. We usually do
have a crop, and we try in so far as we can
to maintain our economie independence, and
in that regard I think that perhaps our western neighbours could take a lesson from us.
However, the situation that developed in
western Canada as a result of the depression
of the thirties could not be overcome by the
people out there alone. The Sirois commission went into this matter, and it reported
that the western provinces had completely

lost their financial independence. They said
that during the whole period of the depression
60 per cent of the revenues of those provinces
had to be used for relief; and at one timein 1937-the cost of relief was 163 per cent
of their total municipal and provincial revenue. It is not surprising, therefore, that the
debt of the western provinces became very
large. They made loans from the Dominion
government in the following amounts:
Manitoba ................
$24,734,451.82
Saskatchewan ............
Alberta ..................

80,361,852.44
26,212,000.00

British Columbia ......... .34,031,219.04

$165,339,523.30
This debt was in an unsatisfactory condition.
No interest was paid on about 75 million
dollars of it. At one time a loan was made to
the province of Saskatchewan of over 10 million dollars for the purposes of seed. An
arbitration committee which tried to settle
this matter could not come to any agreement
and the amount was refunded. Honourable
senators can readily see what the position
would be with respect to entering into dominion-provincial relations while these debts were
unsettled and the people of those provinces
felt that they could not afford to rent their
privileges to the federal goveriment because
they were so heavily in debt to it.
About a year ago the, former Minister of
Finance came to an arrangement with the
minister for the Saskatchewan government,
which was the biggest debtor. After this, it
was fairly easy to come to terms along similar
lines with the other provinces.
There are two or three features about these
arrangements to which I should like to call
attention. The first is the question of the
counterclaims of the provinces with respect
to patural resources. The claim of the province of Manitoba was settled some years ago.
A commission was appointed, and I believe
the province got about $4,485,000. As honourable senators know, Alberta and Saskatchewan
were created provinces in 1905, but it was not
until 1930 that their natural resources were
handed over to them. Two royal commissions
were appointed, one for Alberta and one for
Saskatchewan, to decide what amount should
go to each in respect of the period between
1905 and 1930. These commissions each made
a finding that five million dollars was due to
the province whose case it had considered.
Alberta agreed to accept that amount. But in
the case of Saskatchewan the commission
investigating made a minority report which
recommended payment of $58,242,691. This
amount was out of the question, and the
government of the day sent an official note
saying what would be done under the circum-

622

SENATE

stances. Then Alberta said: "Very good, we
have ag-reed to accept a certain sum, but if
more is paid to Saskatchewan we will expect
te receive the oquivalent." As a resuit no
settiement was reached.
In the measure ilow before us we find that
there is a setriement of the couniter dlaims
whereby each of the two provinces is given
fiv e million dollars, plus interest for a
certain period, which brings tbe amounit up
to $8,031,250. The total cf the existing provincial treasury bis indcbtedness to the
dominion by the four western provinces of
$165,000,000 includes debots arising out of
relief, for capital and ordinary goveromontal
purposes.
The division is as follows:
Treasury
Treasury
Bis for
Bis for
Capital and
Direct and
Ordinary
AgriculGovernniental
tural
Purposes
Relief
Manitoba........$13,855,100.66 $10,879,351.16
Saskatchewan . .
13,414,440.93 61,221,227.44
Alberta ..........
15.617.000. 00 10,595,000.00
British Columbia
17,346.837.65 16,684,381.39
$60,ý233,379. 24 $99,379,959 .99
The bill proposes t'hat one-hiaif of tîte debt
due by each of these provinces in connection
with relief ýbe forgiven, and in addition that
an amount of $5,726,184.07 of capitalized
interesr, on bbce Saskatchewan debt be cancelled. In other words, the bill proposes that
out of a total existing treasury bill dobt of
$165 million, $55 million be cancellcd, leaving
to be paid approximately $1,10 million; or to
put it another way, the total dcbt of these
four provinces te the dominion is eut by onethird. The total amount remaining to be
paid would be approximatoly $94 million, and
is divided into two parts: (1) Dcbt for relief
purposes. some $50 million, refunded witholat
interest an.d repayable over the next ithirty
vears-that is to say, 'haîf tlhe debt for relief
purposes was cancelled and the other biaîf ivas
refunded without intercst; and (2) Debt for
capital and o.rdinary governmental purposos,
some $44 million, is refunded at 2,' per
cent.
'Today the sum $165,000,000 stands against
the four western provinces as a dcbt which
they cannot pay and on which it is impossible
to collect part of the interest. If it is not
settled, negotiations in respect of dominionprovincial relations will be rendered vory
difficult. Ib is felt that the arrangement 1
have outlined is in keeping with the conditions which prevail in that area, and conforms
Io tlhe adx ico contained in the Sirois report.
It is also in line with the reports of the coinmaissioners in relation to the counter-claims,

and I believe that if ib is ratified, the western
provinces will face the future with more confidence. and be in a position to play their part
in our national development.
For these
reasons tliis bill is presented, and I trust and
believe that it will meet with the favourable
consideration of the Sonate.
Hon. Mr. ROEI3UCK: May 1 ask whether
thc wecstcrn provinces will be satisfied with
this arrangement?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Oh, yes.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIO: I shiaîl not prolong
the dehate more than a minute or two. As I
come from one of the western provinces I am
not inclined to look a gift borse in the mouth,
but there is a point about this proposai which
worries me quiite a bir. Haif the debt, of the
provinces for unemployment relief during the
period 1930-35 will bo cancelled if this bill is
adopted; the otbei' baîf will beur ne interest.
What disquiets me in regard te this wliole
settlement is that a largo part of the expense
occasioncd by the drought was paid 1)'v the
western cities. The Dominion government
may quite preperly take the attitude on tliis
inatter tlîat the chties sbould deal wiîb t beir
resc,etve provincial governments. But the
problcmi is a dithecult one. 1 (I0 not know
mucbel about conditions at the coast, but to my
knowleige RePgina, Sas ka toon, Clalgary and
Edmonton c-arried a terriffie burden as a consequence- of unemplovment duriug this period.
Onlv those who lived in western Canada
from 1930 te 1935 can understand w'hat happened in those years. Apart from the consequences of the world depression, and goneral
conditions in Canada, for two years grasshoppers swarmed in western Canada and ate
cverything up. Thcy moved in like an army.
The first vcar thero wvas a dried-out condition;
in 1935 there w~as a rusted-out condition. The
wheat grew beautifullv until about the 12th
or lSth of July; dieu it was attacked by rust,
which is a spore carried from Mexico ýby the
wvarm air; it sotties on the stem and bores a
hole in the stem se that ne more sap goos te
the berry. The resuit was the total loss of
the crop. Added te that misfortune was a
lewer demand from overseas. Europe was
preparing in dead earnest for war, and, remembering that it had been starved out in the
first world wvar, determined te grow aIl the
wbeat it couid. Italy and Germany imposed
tariffs five times as high as anything known
before.
My opinion with regard te tbis bill is that
tho governmoint, bas done the proper tbîng. To
people in other parts of Canada who may
inquire they should be expected te pay n part

JutY 14, 1947
of this cost, 1 would say that it was occasioned flot by ordinary unemployrnent relief
but by a series of crop failures about five, years
in a row resulting in what was really a famine
condition. I recali that during this period I
travelled from Winnipeg to Saskatoon. The
car I rode in was one of these Buicks which
takes not too much gas and lots of water, and
on the road between Saskatoon and Moose
Jaw 1 sent the driver to a farm bouse, located
a few hundred yards fromn the main road, to
get some water for the engine. He came back
without any water. I said, "What is the
matter?" H1e said, "Mr., you had better go
and get your own water at the house." I asked
hima why. Hie said, "The husband is away up
in northern Saskatchewan cutting hay to try
to carry the stock through this winter. His
wif e bas little water which has got to 'make
do' until lie comes back, because it is an eight
mile drive to the river to get any more." I
did not get any water at that, farm bouse.
I drove haîf a mile to a filling station.
Nearby was a beautiful haîf-section of land,
and ail that was growing on itewas one weed,
bright, red and prosperous. My honourable
friend from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson) will understand what I refer to. I said
to the man at the filling station, "Why don't
you go and pull out that weed?" H1e said,
"Say, mister, where do you come from?"
I said, "I corne frorn Winnipeg." "Well," hie
said, "that is the only green thing in this
country, and I arn keeping it there so I can
rernember what green looks like."
I shaîl vote for this bill.
Hon. IR. B. HORNER: Did I understand
the leader to say that lie wished to move the
adjournent of the debate?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, but if -the honourable
gentleman wishes to move the ad-journrnent hie
may do so.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I corne froma Saskatchewan, which bas the largest area of agricultural land of any province ini the dominion;
an area larger than that of the Maritime
Provinces, Quebec and Ontario cornbined.
Some reference bas been made te grasshoppers.
I miglit rernark that neyer in my experience
have they attacked the whole of the country
at once, aithougli they have done great damage
in many districts. This year a large section
of northern Saskatchewan around Tisdale and
Melfort, which neyer before knew drought,
will suifer a crop failure.
My purpose in rising at thîs time is to
object to the flippant manner in which the
senator Who introduced the bill read a lecture
to the western provinces on maintaining their
economie stability, and the comparison. lie

623

drew between the prairie econorny and that of
Nova Scotia. I wonder whether hie bas ever
tlotalled the amount of -the subventions which
have been paid to his province in the past
fifteen years, and the benefits it bas obtained
from free freight on feed goîng there in the
past three or four years from western Canada.
If the reports of the commissions whose
stati,,tics he quoted are examined, I think it
will be found that the .îudge who presented
the minority report on behai-f of Saskatchewan
made a very sound argument on behaîf of that
province. It can easily be proved by reference
to the reports on alienation of natural resources
before .1930, that Saskatchewan's resources were
àepleted by the federal governmnent to a far
greater extent than were those of -Alberta.
At that time capital development whieb was
flowing from the East bit Saskatchewan like
a plague of grasshoppers and "tied into"
hundreds of millions of good timber that was
easily accessible. I also know of an instance
in which the federal government sold sorne
farrn land in Saskatchewan for a small cash
payment. The farmer allowed the land to
become polluted with weeds and suïbsequently
retired to California. For twenty-five years
no attempt was made by the federal government to realize on the natural resources on
tha:t particular land.
Honourable senators I doubt that it can be
said Saskatchewan is really in debt. Our
province produces more new wealth than any
other in the dominion of Canada. In one
year Saskatchewan produced three-hundred
million bushels of wheat when it was worth a
dollar a bushel. I would ask the honourable
senator frorn Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr.
Kinley) how long it would take Nova Scotia
to produce that mu*ch wealth?
Hon. Mr. KINýLEY: We would save the
money for a rainy day.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Saskatchewan paid
twice that debt in duty on implements to
farmn this land. I just rose to remark that
Saskatchewan is still the banner province of
the Dominion of Canada, and that we do not
need to be lectured by any honourable senator from the Maritimes on how to rnaintain
our economic security. We will obtain it and
I hope the Maritime Provinces will be able
to do the same.
The motion waa agreed to. and the 'bill was

SENATE
CIVIL SERVICE BILL
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS REJECTED

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of amendments made by the Standing Committee on Civil Service Administration on
Bill 413, an Act to amend the Civil Service
Act.
Hon. ARTHUR MARCOTTE: Honourable
senators, on July 11, I presented the report of
the Standing Committee on Civil Service
Administration on this bill. I now move that
the report be adopted.
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, because of the importance of this matter I feel that I should express
my views with respect to the adoption of
these amendments.
I am sure honourable
senators are familiar with the provisions of
the veterans' preference, and are aware that
veterans who qualify under the act will enjoy
a preference in the civil service. The preference does not extend to all veterans, but is
limited to those members of the army, navy
and air force who served outside the western
hemisphere. This is by no means a simple
matter because once a preference is established
for a particular group of veterans, whatever
the yardstick may be, claims will be made
from persons who do not come strictly under
the established classification of eligible veterans. These men, particularly those who
served outside the western hemisphere, feel
that their cases should be considered and that,
because they served their country during the
war, they should be included in the veterans'
preference.
In 1946 the Special Veterans Affairs Committee of the House of Commons gave a great
deal of consideration to many problems,
including that of the veterans' preference in
the civil service. At that time representations of merit were made to show ,that certain
classes of persons were entitled to receive
veterans' preference. Among those suggested
were men of the merchant marine, a group
which played an important part in the winning of the war. Since then representations
have been made on behalf of others who,
although not veterans of the army, navy or air
force, performed meritorious service overseas.
I refer ta personnel of the St. John Ambulance, the Fire Fighters and the Forestry
Corps. During the late war, organizations such
as these were subject to service anywhere, and
sometimes, when no,t asked to proceed overseas, they performed relatively dangerous
duties in Canada.
As time goes on persons who were engaged
in very hazardous wartime occupations, such
as the manufacture of munitions, may make

demands for preferential treatment. Requests
may come from various border-line groups
for a widening of the act. I can imagine that
sections of some of these groups might be
brought under the preference, in the same way
that it is now proposed 'to include some merchant seamen.
Ordinarily one's inclination
would be to extend ,the benefit 'to all who had
during the war served the country ýin one way
or another, but of course there is a risk that
you might so dilute the preference that
it would cease to have much value.
In 1946, after a good deal of consideration
had been given to this matter and a certain
widening of the preference had been made in
favour of various auxiliary services, it was
evidently determined that there should be no
extension outside a certain definite classification. Claims of the merchant marine and of
various auxiliary services, such as the fire
fighters, were not granted. As honourable
senators know, there was no meeting of the
Veterans Affairs Committee this year. The
measure now before us extends the preference
to such classes of veterans as it had been
decided were entitled to it, and in our Committee on Civil Service Administration amendments were made to include merchant seamen,
or at least those who were sailing on ships of
Canadian registry. I imagine it could be
argued that if merchant seamen are to be
given preference under the act this amendment is not wide enough, as no similar limitation applies to veterans of the military, naval
or air forces. Furthermore, advocates of
preference for merchant seamen might argue
that consideration should be given to length
of service and other things. It seems to me
that we could hardly make a simple amendment providing for extension of preference to
members of the Merchant Marine, regardless
of where or how long a man may have served.
Coming from the part of Nova Scotia that
I do, I particularly do not want to be understood as opposing consideration of the case of
the merchant seamen. In the last few months
I have seen representations to the government
for better treatment of merchant seamen, and
in one or two instances I noticed that stress
was laid on other matters than the veterans
preference. I do not mean to suggest that the
merchant seamen are not interested in veterans
preference, but I do suggest that treatment of
the merchant marine is a question that should
be considered in relation to treatment of
various other groups which rendered wartime service to Canada under more or less
dangerous conditions. I think that when an
amendment is being framed there should be an
attempt to differentiate, as far as is humanly
possible, between merchant seamen who are

JULY 14, 1947
entitled to the preference and those who,
because of service of short duration or in
waters that could not by any stretch of the
imagination be called dangerous, are not
entitled to it. I am not trying to belittle the
importance of this question; I am merely
pointing out some of the ramifications that
need to be considered in relation to this
amendment.
The bill came to us at a late hour in the
session. As an amendment that has not received
careful consideration might work injustice to
those who are already, enjoying the veterans
preference, I think the matter is too important
to be dealt with on such short notice as we
have had. When the question was under discussion in another place, the Prime Minister
definitely stated that he felt it should be
referred to a special committee next session,
and he undertook to advocate that that be
done. In all fairness to those who are entitled
to the veterans preference now and whose benefits will become less valuable if the preference
is diluted, and to the merchant seamen themselves, who have asked for benefits in other
forms; and bearing in mind that the proposed
amendment would give preference to only a
certain group of merchant seamen and might
be a grave injustice to others, I suggest that
honourable senators take cognizance of the
Prime Minister's undertaking to advocate next
session the appointment of a committee to deal
with the matter in all its ramifications. I
would further suggest that perhaps, in the
circumstances, honourable senators might
sec fit not to concur in the amendments
made by the Committee on Civil Service
Administration.
Hon. J. J. KINLEY: Honourable senators,
I am much interested in what bas been said by
the leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), and parteiularly as to the government's intention to have the whole matter
considered next session. It is good to have
that on the record, anyway.
Honourable senators, I was a member of
the other house when the veterans' charter, as
it may be called, having to do with this and
other types of legislation coming before parliament from time to time, was in the making.
I recall that on several occasions it was brought
to the attention af that house that the men
of the merchant navy were not included in
many of the provisions which it had been
expected they would share in. We were always
told that it was going to be donc in another
way; but it was never done.
When this bill came from the other house I
looked up the Commons Hansard, and I
learned that the members did not have a
chance to vote on it. The bill was submerged

by a point of order, and the ruling was that
the committee could not be instructed to do
something which it already had the power to
do and had not done.
I

am not questioning

the

ruling, which

was sustained', on division, by a vote of 93
to 76; but if the decision applied in this
house we could do very little with the committee report which is before us tonight. I
would point out that such a close vote indicates the feeling of that house with regard
to recognizing as veterans merchant seamen

who served during the war.
The subject was discussed in the other house
by such enthusiastic veterans as Green, Cruickshank, Brooks and Diefenbaker. I was glad
to see that what I had in mind from my
experience over there was also in the minds
of these men. One member who spoke is
reported in the Commons Hansard of July 8
as follows:
There was a complete misunderstanding in
that committee from start to finish. Not until
the last few days did the members realize that
this matter was not receiving the attention of
the Department of -Transport, and that something more should be done. It was then too
late for the members of the veterans committee

to give it the attention it should have received.
The same gentleman concluded his remarks
in these words:

I think we should give serious consideration
to this matter, and this bill affords us an opportunity of giving these men at least some measure
of justice until something can be donc later on.
Honourable senators, that is the attitude I
take; this.amendment will give merchant sea-

men a measure of justice until some future
time, when we can do more for them.
I proposed the amendment before the
Senate committee on Civil Service Adminis-

tration and therefore feel responsible for it.
The amendment was carried in committee
after a minister of the Crown had appeared

before it and explained his viewpoint.

After

hearing the evidence the committee brought

in the favourable report, which has been presented by the chairman.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: I donot wish to interfere with the remarks of my honourable
friend, but I understand that one is not permitted to describe the detail of the proceedings before a committee. This report was not
carried unanimously, but by a majority of one.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I thank the hon. sena-

tor for drawing my attention to that matter,

but I believe that after a committee makes a
report it is then competent to discuss in this
chamber the proceedings of that committee.
I think I am quite in order in dealing with

626

SENATE

what happened in cornmittee.
The chief
criticism in committee was that men of the
merchant marine were civilians, and therefore,
for the purpose of the preference, could not
be regarded as having been on active service.
I have before me an extract from a speech
made in Halifax-and I am sure we all feel
kindly towards that city tonightSome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: It was delivered by
the Honourable Brooke Claxton, before the
Rotary Club on June 14, 1947. The minister
spoke, in part. as follows:
In World War II a threat to our very existence was launced against us on the high seas.
Nowhere was there demanded a higher standard
of constant courage and endurance. In the end
the bridge of ships was the lifeline of victory ...
It would be a long story to give the names and
records of the officers and men who came from
Halifax or vicinity.
I call particular attention to the following:
Since the control of merchant shipping was so
vital a factor in the ultimate Atlantic victory, I
eau perhaps mention the name of Captain Dick
Oland, the first Naval Control Service officer in
Halifax during the last war, who did so much
during the early desperate years te build the
the remarkable system which survived the savage
attack the enemy was to make upon merchant
shipping . . .

In

1939 world shipping totalled

almost 70,000,000 gross tons. Enemy submarines
sank one quarter of about 3,000 ships. In the
dark days of 1942 the graph of ships sunk rose
like a fever chart. Yet just how serious the
losses were is not generally recognized even teday. Month after month losses exceeded launchings. Had no solution been found, the end was
inevitable and catastrophic. But an answer
was found by the navies and air forces of the
Allies, the line on the chart fell, we stayed in
the fight and won the last round. At the
beginning of the war the Germans had about
70 operational submarines.
During the war
781 enemy submarines were sunk by the Allies
and 286 were captured or capitulated at the end
if the war. In the North Atlantic alone the
Canadian Navy convoyed safely more than 25,000
merchant ship voyages, many of them starting
from Halifax, resulting in the safe landing of
more than 180,000,000 tons of goods from North
America te the United Kingdom.
This speech, which was made only a few
days ago, indicates that the subject of the
merchant marine is,something that should be
brought to the attention of the people in the
community.
It is said that these men are civilians. I
have lived among these men, and know many
of them. I recall that the government established a training centre for merchant seamen
at Hubbard, between Lunenburg and Halifax.
Men were enlisted all over Canada, brought
there, and trained for an emergency. These
ment trained, at Hubbard were expected to
take their places in the merchant marine at

a time when casualties in that service were
heavier proportionately than those in any
branch of the armed services.
After a merchant seaman had seen three
months' service on the high seas and in
dangerous waters te received a badge issued
by the government. It did bear the inscription "merchant marine," but displayed the
letters "M.N."-meaning merchant navy-with
a crown above. The badges were numbered,
and the owner of one carried a permission card
stating that the badge could not be replaced,
and indicating thet any unauthorized person
found wearing the badge would be subject to
a fine of $500.
That seeums to me to indicate the position
of members of the merchant marine and
demonstrates that they were "in the service."
The fact that they were not in uniform is not
a point at all, because it was the view of the
government of this country that it was not
proper to have them in uniform. Further, the
seamen had an organization, built up over
years, which it was felt could take care of
the situation, and the merchant navy was
regarded as one arm of the services. Every
man who went on board ship had to sign a
document prescribed under the Canada Shipping Act. It was a severe commitment; it
constituted him a member of the crew of the
ship, subjeet to discipline, and obligated him
to serve as his officers required.
Hon.
only.

Mr.

SINCLAIR:

For

that

voyage

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Yes, but these seamen
had to join a pool, whose members committed
themselves to serve or to be available for
service until the end of the war.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: On whatever ship
they chose to serve.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Naturally, where possible, those in command would be happy to
give the man the ship that he wanted; but
when a seaman joined the pool te was bound
to go to the ship on which he was told
to serve.
We realize that the armed forces are entitled
to a certain preference; but surely, when the
Canadian Legion, through General LaFleche,
invited these boys to join that organization,
and accepted them as comrades, it would be
no undue widening to include them in it.
Surely it was to be expected that, having been
given standing in the legion, they would receive
favourable treatment at the tands of the
country.

JIJLY 14, 1947
If one reads the definition of "veteran" in
this bill one finds that it includes, first, and
very properly, veterans of World War I; then,
veterans of World War II; and then, under
paragraph (iv) of section I, any man who bas
been-certified hy the Under Secretary of State for
External Affairs as having -been enrolled in
Canada by United Kingdomn authorities for
special duty during World War Il in war areas
outside of the western hemaisphere, and who
served outside the western hemaisphere, and at
the time of bis enrolment was domniciled in
Canada.
The government leader bas said, the test
is that of service outside of Canada. It is the
test applied in the army, in the navy, and ail
along the line, and if? is one under which the
men of the merchant marine wanted to qualify,
hecause naturally their service had to be outside Canada. When one turns to paragraph (y)
one finds that "veteran" is defined as a
person who-during World War II served outside of 'the
western hemnisphere with the naval, military or
air forces of His Majesty raised in Caùada as
a "representative of Canadiaai Legion War Services toc., The National Couneil of the Young
Mea's Christian Associations of Canada, Knights
of Columbus Canadian Armiy Huts, or Salvation Army Canadian War Services," and who
was authorized s0 to serve by the appropriate
naval, military or air force authority and who,
at the commencement of bis service with those
forces during World War II, was domiciled in
Canada.
Now will any'body contend that these men,
trained by the government and in receipt of
a badge from it, particularly in view of what
bas been said in the bouse of Commons and
ail over this country about the quality of
the services which they rendered during the
war, are not entitled to preference just as
much as memýbers of the auxiliary service that
are mentioned in paragraph (y) of this bill?
Inideed, have they not a superior dlaim? In
my opinion, as an auxiliary service the Caoadian merchant navy should rank next to the
armed forces, and abead of the members of
the organizations enumerated in paragraph (y)
to whomn this consideration bas been granted.
Hon. Mr. MURDOOK: Were not a number
of these men United States citizens?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY:
question.

I did not catch the

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: What would happen
if many of these men were United States
citizens serving on a ship of Canadian registry?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Well, it seems f0 me,
bonourable senators, that tbe Unit ed States
15 weIl able f0 look after its own citizens. I
believe thaf it does sn.

This proposed amendment provides for the
case of a man wbo, being a Canadian seaman
served during World War II as a member of
the crew of a ship of Canadian registry on
the lîigh seas, and bas an bonourable discharge. I so worded the amendmeof witb a
purpose: it is ooly a start. We were told that
the veteran preference concession must not
be ton much diluted, and that if we dilute
if too much if will be of no use to aoybody.
If we decide that men serving in Canadian
ships sbould have the preference, I thiok we
shoul'd be d'oing sornetbiog for the nationals
of this country. If bonourable senators wisb
f0 make the provision more inclusive I do not
know tbat I would object very greafly.
Some persone bave objecfed because this
amendment would ot inchide personnel wbo
served on sb'ips of the Canadian Pacifie Railway. Well. tbe C.P.R. boats--apart from a few
on the cnast-are not Canadian sbips, but
ships of British regisfry. Many in tbe crews
are orientais, lower paîd men, and no large
proportion are Canadians eitber in times of
war or times of peace.
I thiok we are n0W in a position to make a
good sfart. If tbe amendment does not satisfy
ail of nur friends, improvemeots cao be made
when this committee wbich we are told is to
be appoioted looks info the matter. In the
meantime, our men would bave their feet on
the thresbold of this preference in keeping
wif b the services they have rend-ered. My
impression 15, that once this matter is closed,
it will be hard to reopen it. The bill which is
before us is here for adoption by the parliament of this country, and to reopen the
subject later will be very difficult. Lt seems
f0 me that the appropriate time, to improve
the situation is now, when members of tbe
Senate are free to dieal with it on its merits,
and if they consider it in tbat spirit I arn sure
they will give this recognition to the merchant
seamen. Remember that tbe seamen, are not
asking for a cent. If is not mnioey they are
seeking; wbat they want is recognition, and
the rigbf f0 equality as men who. have given
useful war service to their country. Ail tbey
ask is thaf, if fbey are qualified and selected
as the best persons applyiog for jobs ini the
civil service of the country, they shall receive
the appointment.
The ameodment is not
intendedt to give tbemn jobs, but only tbe
chance to apply for the.m. Down in Nova
Scotia at the present time a man wbo served
on the seas during the war camiot apply on a
prefereoce basis for a lighthouse job. Appointments in the Deparfment of Fisheries are
being made every day, but the men in the
merchant service who d1id sucb good work bave
no chance, because tbey are not eligible for

SENATE
the civil service preference. Every one who
gave meritorious service in the war should
have an equal opportunity to secure a position
in their own country. That is the point at
issue.
We are told that these men should not be
given recognition because they received good
pay. However, I do flot think that argument
will hold water whcn the pay of other
services is taken into consideration. Take
for example the salary of a navy captain
whose basic pay is $420 a month. In addition
to this amount he receives a sustenance allowance of $80 and, if he is married, a furthcýr $30
making a total of $53 per month. The captain of a ten-thousand ton cargo boat receives $400 a month, plus a bonus of $50 if he
makes a satisfactory voyage. Frorn these
figures it can be seen that a captain in the
navy receives $6,360 if employed the year
round, while the captain of a cargo ship receives $5,400 for a similar pcriod.
In addition to good pay a captain in the
navy hias a splendid opportunity for promotion, and hie receives a pension. During the
war men -of thc merchant marine had no
separation allowance and had to pay income
tax whule afloat, whcreas personnel of thc
Canadian navy were flot subject to income
tax when outside of this country. The employment of a merchant seaman was not
continuous, because hie had to wait for a
ship, and his cmployment was not permanent.
In some cases hie was maintainied in the hostels
of the Navy League of Canada. During the
war navy vessels would dock for refitting for
a period of from six to eiglit weeks, during
which their personnel would continue to
draw pay. 1 am not criticizing; I am mcrcly
cemparing.
It hias been said that men of the merchant
marine reccix ed bonuses. That is truc, but
everybody cisc in Canada get a cost of living
bonus. It 'vas part of our social legislation.
Why wcre these men of the merchant marine
given a bonus? Most business mcn know. I
hiad soe
conncction with the merchant
nmarine, and I would say the reason was
that the employers did not want highcr salaries to become permanent. It is also a fact
that there was competition from other sources
and that men wcrc given bonuses in order
to compensate for the dangers of sailing. It
is not propcr to say that the men of the
merchant marine were well paid merely bccause they rccived this bonus. I arn aware
of what these sailors reccived. During a good
part of the war $125 a rnonth was considered
a good wage.

Hon. Mr. PATERýSON: I t.hink the hionourable senator is mistaken. I should like to
furnish him with certain figures, because I
arn satisfied that bis are away off the mark.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I knýow exactly what
was paid to marchant seamen off the coast
of Nova Scotia during the first part of the
war. It is true that at the end of the war,
when prices got higher, thcy rcceived larger
wagcs.
lion. Mr. PATERSON: I paid wages
mysaîf.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: The merchant shipping
industry was a profitable one, and those interestcd in it did not do so badly. I think the
men were cntitled to the money they got.
When they reeived gond wages it made for
better feeling.
Besides having to pay income tax the men
of the merchant marine had to provide their
own clothing and cquipmcat. Thcy could net
wear their uniforms at ahl tirnes, because thcy
had to proteet themselvcs in ahl kinds of
weather.
lion. Mr. LESAGE: You have said during
your speech that scamcn were not asking for
money, but it would seem that your complaint
is with respect te meney.
lion. Mr. KINLEY: All I anm saying is that
the objection hias been raised that seamen
sheuld net get the veterans' prefercace because
they were se well paid during the war. I say
that, by cemparisen, seamen wcrc neither
better paid ner better trcated than the ether
services, and that thcy deserve the recognition
accorded them in the ameadment.
lieneurable senators knew that the navy is
very particular about sanitatien. The sailers of
the merchant navy often hiad te sleep with bcd
bugs.
Everybedy hias hiad a great deal of praise
for the merchiant navy and lias aeknowledged
that they werc neccssary for the succcssful
presecutien of the war. Let us net ferget them
new. This is net a nmattcr of dollars and cents;
but simply one of justice and fair treatmient
for these scamen whien thcy apply fer jobs in
the Civil Service.
lion. Mr. DAVIES: Are t'here any inspecters
for the merchant marine? You have stated that
these sailors have had te slccp with bcd bugs.
Are there ne inspectors te take care of sucli a
situation?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: It hias always been
thus. There are inspecters, but they do net
seem te be able te overcome this forrn of
pestilence.

JUIY 14, 1947
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the honourable senator a question, and I shall refer
to bis words? In another place a vote on a
similar question was defeated by 93 to 76.
Does the bonourable senator (Hon. Mr. Kinley) feel that the Senate has a right to take
a stand other than that indicated by that
vote.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: The honourable senator
is labouring under an erroneous impression.
There was no vote in another place on this
measure.
Hon. Mr. MTJRDOCK: This amendment
was discussed at great iengtb in the other place,
and to aIl intents and purposes the vote was
on the exact wording of this amendment.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: No. The vote was
on a point of order, which suhmerged the
main question. This meant that the merit
of the suggestion could not corne be-fore the
members of the other place.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The Speaker ruled
tbat it was out of order on the ground that
a committee could not be instructed to do
something which. it had the power to do but
had not done. That is what the vote was on.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: The vote was on a
point of order.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The amendment
is what was under discussion at great lengtb.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: They did not permit
a vote to lie taken on it, but the matter was
voted on by the committee of this bouse
andl the amendment carnied by a mai ority.
Hon. Mr. HIAIG: What was the vote in
the Senate committee?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Four to three. There
is no complaint about the treatment of the
merchant seamen of Canada during the war.
They were assisted financially and were better
treated than those of most other countnies. I
admit that merchant seamen got good treatment at that time, and so did ail the other
services. When certain measures were brought
down for tbe granting of benefits, merchant
seamen were consistently excluded, and we who
protested against tbis were told that they were
entitled to workmen's compensation and unemployment insurance. Well, workmen's compensation, which lias been in force in this
country for tbirty or forty years, is paid for
by tbe employers; and it was only because of
the difficulty of controlling regulations beyond
the confines of the country that its -application
to seamen was delayed s0 long. IJnemployment insurance is paid for by employers and
employees, and a contribution is made by the
government. Ail classes of citizens are entitled

629

to it. Yet, when we advocate extension of the
veterans preference to merchant eeamen., we
are told that they sbould be thankful because
tliey already receive workmen's compensation
and unemployment insurance: or, in other
words, because they are treated the same as
ahl other employees in the country. I will
admit ýthat if a merchant seaman is injured
by enemy action, direct or indirect, lie is
entitled to a pension, just as is a member of
the armed services wbo is wounded on duty.
Then we are told tbat merchant seamen get
technical training. Under certain conditions
they do, if tbey continue to go to sea; but
a mercliant seaman wlio wishes to get a general education is not entitled to the veterans
preference that is given to inembers of the
other services. Further, the marchant seamen
get no gratuity. We were always told that
the matter was going to lie deait with in
another way. And now we have a bill wbich
gives preference to members of various services and we find that the merchant seaman
is not treated as well e-yen as members of the
auxiliary services. It seems strange that a
man wbo lias served as an engineer in the
mercbant marine is not eligible to apply for
the position of superintendent of a dredge in
Nova Scotia, and that no merchant seaman
can apply for a job as liglithouse keeper, slipping master, barbour-master or fisliery officer.
I felt that this amendment would give a start
to the men of our Canadian merdhant marine.
It could be made to apply only to Canadian
nationals wbo served on Canadian ships. Then
if the matter were brought up next session, as
my honourable friend tonight promised it
would 'be, more favourable consideration could
be extended to other groups of mercliant seamen, and we would support that. But let 'the
change tbat we are now proposing be charter
legisiation for the benefit of men wbo served in
Canadian sbips on the high seas. It is not
necessary to require tbat a seaman must have
served for any minimum period in order to be
entîtled to tbe preference, for there is no sudh
requirement with respect to veterans.
I believe that ex-members of the armed forces would be glad if the benefits of the preference were extended to merdhant seamen as
suggested in the amendment, and 1 trust that
honourable senators will use tbeir good.judgment and deal witli this question on its merits.
Hon. L. M. GOUIN: Honourable senators,
I desire to say a word or two in support of the
suggestion by the leader of the government
that the amendment made by the comînittee
be not concurred in. iMy reason for doing s0
is that there la a fundamental differen-ce

SENATE

between merchant seamen and veterans of the
navy, the army or the air force, or persons
who served with the naval, military or air forces in any of the auxiliary services mentioned
in paragraph (v) on page 2 of the bill. I wish
to assure my honourable colleague from
Queens-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) that
every Canadian from coast to coast recognizes
the heroic service rendered by merchant seamen during the war. Proof of that is found in
the fact that we have given them benefits far
in excess of those enjoyed by the merchant
seamen of any other country. I know very
well that if I refer to other countries I may be
told that chey are free to adopt any course
which they may deem desirable, but still I wish
to point out that neither in Britain nor the
United States-nor, so far as I know, anywhere
in the world-are merchant seamen accorded
the preference that is proposed in the committee's report now before us.
I submit that seamanship is a trade. During
the war the members of the merchant marine
were of course subjected to terrible perils;
and I wish to emphasize that I bow with the
greatest respect in tribute to the heroism of
our seamen. I do not say they have received
too much in cither wages or bonuses, for they
could never receive too much for what they
did; but I believe that a comparison of the
compensation paid to the average seaman with
that paid to the average private in the army,
would show that the two were on an altogether different basis.
It must also be remembered that merchant
seamen were not thrown out of their employment when the war ended. and that the war
brought about a tremendous increase in their
wages.
I should like to point out that the Veterans
Affairs Committee passed a resolution to the
effect that the preference as it now exists
should not be extended, and that resolutions
to that effect have been passed also by army,
navy and air force veterans.
Merchant seamen were paid a basic rate of
$89.93 a month, to which was added a warrisk bonus of $44.50. The honourable senator
from Queens-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley)
stated that merchant seamen had to pay in-ome tax, but the tax was imposed on the
basic wage only, the war bonus and subsistence having been exempted.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY:

I said that.

Hon. Mr. GOUIN: I wish to add that under
certain conditions a special bonus of 10 per
cent of gross earnings was paid, and that
merchant seamen were made eligible to participate in benefits under the Veterans Insur-

anoe Act. At the end of each year they enjoyed leave, and transportation was provided
at a cost of one-third of the one-way fare
to their homes. Also they had frec transportation to their homes at the completion
of their service.
If we wish to have the complete picture
of the position of the mon of the merchant
marine before us, it is necessary to recapitulate the advantages so as to show how these
good servants of our country were treated.
During service meinbers of the merchant marine, if incapacitatedi by sickness or injury,
received the basic pay for a maximum period
of twelve weeks. As stated by the honourable senator from Queens-Lunenburg, they
were entitled under certain conditions to
vocational training. In the government estimates there is an item of $97,000 for that
purpose. Under the Reinstatement in CivilEmployment Act, these men had the privilege
of returning to their previous employment.
Under the Unemployment Insurance Act they
received the special advantage that their service at sea was credited to them in any
they subsequently
insurance employment
entered.
The men of the merchant marine were given
the further advantage of special out-of-work
allowances; they receive pensions for disabilities resulting from enemy action, and as
pensioners are entitled to free medical care
and allowances during hospitalization. They
are eligible, under certain conditions, to
participate in the benefits under the Veterans'
Land Act. If a merchant seaman is prevented by reason of service during the war
from continuing to follow his work at sea,
hie may obtain vocational training under the
Veterans' Rehabilitation Act. In case of
death his widow and dependent children
receive a pension. An allowance is provided
for a seaman and his dependents when he

workman's compensation, I admit quite readily
that it is only fair that it should include
merchant seamen, and we ail rejoice that
through federal legislation they were included.
Atter all, I believe that my honourable friend
from Queens-Lunenburg and I are not so far
apart on the question of sympathy towards the
merchant seamen; but I would point out that
under prosent circumstances Canadian seamen
are better treated than the seamen of any other
country. In Great Britain, because they were
paid throughout the war at industrial rates,
they have not been given the preference
granted to service men. We have had before
us the recommendation of the House of

JULY 14, 1947
Commons committee on Veterans Affairs and
in view of that, to class merchant seamen as
veterans at the present tirne would, I believe,
be unfair to the veteran, and to such people
as the instructors in the air force who served
in Canada but incurred tremendous risk. No
preference is given fo the men who beroically
ferried the new planes across the sea, nor
members of the Victorian Order of Nurses or
the Fire Figbters.

IMMIGRATION
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
>f the final report of the Standing Committee
sn Immigration and Labour.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK moved concurrence
in the report. He said: Honourable senators,
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) will speak to the motion.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK:Honourable
senators, an extensive address in connection
with this important matter is hardly required
on this occasion, because the sentiments of the
committee and myself have been expressed
very fully in a fairly extensive report which
has been before you for the last two or three
days, and which, I assume, you all- have read.
At the same time I think some observations
are in order.
In the first instance, I would like to assure
the house that its committee on Immigration
and Labour looked upon the instructions of
this house to make the inquiry in question
seriously, and that it industriously and earnestly made the inquiry. Since hours of sitting
seem to be a -matter of some importance
today, it may be of interest to note that the
committee held no less than twenty meetings
of three and a half hours' duration, or somewhere in the neighbourhood of seventy hours
of hearings. I know that that would not compare with the extent of the sittings of the
Banking and Commerce Committee, or perhaps of some others, but it is a very impressive figure. As many as 49 witnesses were
heard, together with the reading of 13 briefs.
In the report-I wish to emphasize this-there
is an expression of appreciation for the numerous witnesses who came before the committee.
I would like to note that they came at their
own expense, nearly fifty of them, and at very
great cost to themselves in time and effort. It
is also to be noted that all were in favour of
immigration. There was no one in favour of
the closed door. All favoured various forms of
selective immigration and stressed the desirability of bringing to this country men of skill,

of industry and of character, the type of individual who would naturally be expected to contribute to the social, economie and political
welfare of a democracy such as ours.
The subject of immigration, as appearing
from the statements of all these witnesses
and from our own knowledge, is particularly
important and opportune to-day. I submit
that there was never a time in the history of
the country when immigration was more to
the fore than it is at this moment. There
was never a time in the history of Canada,
at least in recent years, when the need for
manpower was more pressing that it is now.
At the present time there is a demand for
labour on the farms, in the mines, in the
lum'ber woods; and in the manufacturing and
business life of our cities. There was never
a time in the history of Canada when our
power to absorb men in considerable numbers
was greater than it is to-day. That, I think,
has been already demonstrated by the comparatively few immigrants who have already
arrived, and at once have been absorbed into
our industrial life. There was never a time,
I am sure, in the history of this country when
a greater number of people urgently desired
to bring immigrants to this country. That of
course is the result of the disturbed conditions
in Europe and also the economic conditions
in Canada. It is a matter of some note that
15,000 people in Europe have friends or relatives in Canada within the definition of the
regulations who have applied for their admission to this country; whose settlement
conditions, as ýthey are called, have been investigated-that is to say, their financial
ability to satisfy the obligations which they
propose to assume, to receive and care for
the immigrants-and whose names have actually been sent overseas to our officers in
Europe, with instructions that settlement conditions in this country are satisfactory, that
the parties are admissible, and that if they
pass examination they are to have visas.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES:
British?

Does that include the

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes, those for whom
the applications have been made. There are
some British included. As I have said 15,000
is a conservative estimate of the number of
people for whom citizens of this country have
applied. In addition, many applications have
been received from Canadian industries, such
as mining and lumbering establishments, and
from individual farmers, etc. There bas never
been a time in all our history when so many
people have been desirous of immigrating to
Canada. That of course is explained by the
fact that there are as many as 850,000 men

JULY 14, 1947
snd women in the displaced persons camps
of Europe wbo apparently bave no place to
go and are looking for new homes. It bas
also been reported that 300,000 persons in the
British Isles bave signified their desire to
emigrate.
Other figures that bave been publisbed are
more impressive than tbose 1 have just given.
Iu spite of theSe circumstances there bas
neyer been a time when the number of arrivals
in Canada bas heen so disappointing. The
latest figures obtainable are for the firat tbree
months of this year, during wbich time 8,009
immigrants arrived here from overseas. Compared to that number, 12,738 immigrants
arrîved lu Canada the first tbree montbs of
1946. In other words, 4,729 more immigrants
were brougbt to this country lu the first three
montbis of 1946 than lu the corresponding
period of this year. The arrival of British
immigrants is somewbat lu the same ratio.
The figures 1 bave indicate tbat 8,694 immigrants came to Canada from Great Britain
lu 1946, wbereas in 1947, this number sank
te 5,262, or 3,432 fewer tbau lu the previous
year. The explanation is simple-a abortage
of sbipping space. Iun1946 the British Ministry of Transport assigned sbîps to the duty
of repatriating Canadian soldiers and citizens,
sud of transporting to Canada the dependents
of our service men, war brides sud their
familles. Wben that task was completed
tbose sbips wbicb otberwise would bave been
assigned to Canadian routes, were sent on
other duties. It should be realized that Great
Britain bas a million men under arma today
sud that tbey and their supplies and equipment must be moved from place to place.
These troops are stationed all over the world,
and s0 the ships that Canada so urgently
needs are used ini other quarters of the
globe. Tbe British Ministry bas actualýly
requisitioned tbe sbîps which would otherwise
bave been plying Canadian routes. The Canadian Pacifie Railway Company's liuer Empress
of Canada ta tbe only ship that bas been
engaged lu the regular Canadian service, and
it is to make its first trip from Liverpool on
July 16. Iu addition to this vessel the
Aquitania bas served Canada since the firat
of the year, and it is promrised that she will
,continue lu tbe service until early in September. The Aquitania la a 40,000 ton former
troop sbîp witb a capacity of approximately
1,500 persous per trip. The Deputy Miniieter
of Mines and Resources, Mr. Keenleyside,
who is lu cbarge of immigration tells us that
the total sbipping capacity te Canada during
the concluding rnonths of this year will be
about 3,000 persons per montb, and tbat only
200 or 300 of these pensons will be immigrants.

633

To those Canadians wbo are iuterested in
bringing people to, this country, the one bright
spot in the otberwise dismal picture is the
enterprise of the Minister of Reconstruction
and Supply-now acting Minister of Immigration-in obtaining the Hua.scara by way of a
German war reparation. This ship bas been
brought to Canada and is now undergoing
repairs.
The Huascara is a fast sbip which can m-ake
the round trip iu three weeks, and she can
carry approximately 60M immigrants pe-r trip.
Under the auspices of Mr. Howe, arrangements have been made between the Immigration Department, and the present owncrs of
the Huascara to equip ber to bandie Canadian
immigration. Therefore, it is possible that
by tbe end of this year the picture may be
more favourable than it bas been for the first
tbree months of 1947.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Doea tbe honeurable
senator know between wbat ports this sbip
will ply?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I do not. Sbe may
ply between Great Britaîn and Canada, or
between European ports and this country. I
tbink it is probable tbat sbe would eall at
European ports and toucb at ports ini the
British Isies as weIl.
Tbe committee members feit sure that
Canada bad flot exbausted its enterprise in
endeavouring to eliminate the sbipping hottleneck. Today we are lookîug forward to the
minister in charge of immigration to solive this
problem. We do not know bow be will do> it,
but we bave confidence in bis enterprise,
ability and vigour, and are sure that if tbe
bottle-neck eau be broken be willJ do it. 0f
course, in tbe circumatances, during tbis past
year people in Canada have beenl very impatient at the stalemate. And no wonder. The
names of people in Canada who bave made
application for the admission of tbe 15,000
relatives whom I mentioned, and wbo are
able and willing toi assist tbem, bave been sent
to our immigration officers in England and
otber parts of Europe, but flot more than 27.5
of tbose relatives bave arrived in Canada. The
remainder of the 15,000 are stili awaiting
transportation.
That is not good enougb, and I arn glad to
note that Mr. Jolliffe, Director of Immigration
for Canada, is uow lu England, wbere part of
bis mission is to impress upon the British Ministry of Transport tbe necessity of supplying
to Canada a more generous assignment of sblpping for immigrants. 1 know that the sbipping
bas been well used: firstly, for the repatriation
of members of our armed services, Britisb war
brides and Canadian civilians wbo were

634

SENATE

abroad; and secondly, for bringing to Canada
this year 4,506 Polish soldiers-2,876 from
Italy and 1,630 from England. These men
formed a part of the allied army, and today
they are taking part in the economie life of
Canada and. I presume, playing a real part
in helping Canada overcome the world shortage of food and other supplies. There are
2,630 woodworkers on the way here. They
will arrive, not all at once, but in the near
future. Applications have been received by
the Immigration Branch for a consignment
of garment workers, domestic workers and
others, and these applications are now being
considered.
One of the rather delightful incidents of our
immigration activities during the last year was
the recent arrival in Canada of 998 immigrants
from Holland; and we are told that more are
coming. They are all men of substance, people
who in years gone by farmed in Holland but
in some way were displaced and are now unable
to find locations in their homeland. I am told
that everyone of them has a bank account,
and is assigned to a farmer who has asked for
his services. Accommodation is supplied for
these men and they are filtered through our
rural communities.
That is good, so far as it goes, but in the
light of the fact that we have been able to
tansport 1,000 farmers from Holland and more
than 4,000 Polish soldiers, one can appreciate
the dissatisfaction of Canadians who have been
unable to rescue relatives from abroad. I
think there will be general agreement with my
statement that the admission of 275 out of
15,000 relatives is not good enough. I am
expecting and hoping confidently that we shall
make a better showing in the next six months.
The government is to be congratulated on
doing what it could to have the regulations
modified over and over again since your committee made its report one year ago. In the
years prior to the war our immigration was
negligible. The reason for that is to be found
not only in our economic conditions but in
governmental obstruction. In these past years
immigration was limited to British subjects,
to American citizens coming from the United
States, to the wives and unmarried children
under 18 years of people in Canada who were
able and willing to guarantee their support,
and to agriculturalists who had funds with
which to farm in this country. But during these
past few months we have markedly widened
the classes of persons admissible. On the 26th
of May, 1946, an order in council was passed
admitting the following classes of relatives of
legal residents of Canada who are in a position

to receive and care for them and guarantee
their success: the father and mother, the unmarried son and daughter, the unmarried
brother and sister, the unmarried nephew and
niece under 16 years of age and orphaned of
both parents.
That order in council brought joy to many
Canadian families, who looked upon it as a
means of enabling them to rescue relatives
who had passed through the hell of the last
war. On the 30th of January this year the
order was widened to include the widowed
daughter and sister and their unmarried children under 18 years of age. That too was a
humanitarian move on the part of the government. The age of the nephew was raised to
18 years. The order also provided for the
admissibility of farm labourers and mining and
lumbering men for whom employment on
arrival was assured.
While that order was
welcomed throughout Canada, it was soon
criticized for its restrictions, particularly its
exclusion of married relatives. As I put it
when speaking on the matter before, it excluded relatives who had committed the sin
of matrimony.
On the 1st of May a further order in council
made admissible the husband and wife, the
son and daughter, the brother and sister, together with their husbands and wives and
families, and their unmarried children, if any.
There was no longer any age limit for children, but they could only be admitted if unmarried. I hope to sec that restriction removed in due season. One can imagine a
family in Europe contemplating coming to
Canada-a father, mother and children-and
their consternation upon being informed that
one of their children must remain behind because he or she is married. That regulation
is of course unnecessary. A girl should be
allowed to bring her husband and a boy to
bring his wife. The family unit should not
be broken up because of any such regulation,
and immigrants otherwise entitled to come
should not be prevented from doing so because they do not wish to break the family
circle. The committee has reported that it
secs no reason for admitting only unmarried
children. I am sure all honourable members
will agree that it is better to bring to Canada
the whole family units, so that none will be
left behind to create a divided interest and
possibly divided loyalty. Had that practice
been followed more frequently in the past
some regrettable incidents would not have
occurred, and fewer immigrants would have
made Canada a mere stepping-stone to some
other land.

JULY 14, 1947
I do not propose to read much from the
report, but I should like to draw attention to
a particular passage -contained in it. It is
as follows:
Your committee is of opinion that generally
speaking the best immigrants obtainable are
the relatives of persons who are already here
and who have themselves made good to the extent that they are in a position to guarantee the
euccess of the newcomer relatives from abroad.
Such immigrants have a welcome awaiting them,
and someone to aid, guide and advise them on
arrival and during the establishment stages
following. They have a family source from
which to learn the Canadian way of life, how
things are done in Canada, and how to be
successful, and they have before them an exSuch immigrants are the
ample of success.
most likely of all newcomers to develop into
permanent Canadians and are the least likely by
reason of loneliness, lack of ties, unsuccess, or
otherwise, to make Canada a mere port of entry
to some other country.
For these reasons we recommend the broadening of the regulations immediately, to include
relatives of all degrees together with their
families and without limit as to age.
Your committee favours the married immigrant over the unmarried man or woman. Freedom from responsibility may be a temporary
convenience under some circumstances, but when
permanent citizens are being sought the advantage of the family is very great.
Your committee recommends that preference
be given to family groups over unmarried men
and women, and that efforts be made to bring
to Canada in each instance the entire family
group so that the transplanting of the unit be
complete and nothing remain in Europe to
preserve a divided interest and loyalty.
In support of that portion of the report
may I say that we have had some experience
in Canada along that line. Prior to 1920 quite
a large number of men came to this country
leaving their wives and children at home. They
expected that once they had established themselves in this country and were able to pay
the costs of transportation, their families
would follow them. As we know, the terrible
depression of the 30's fol-lowed, and after that
the war. As a result, in Canada today there
are many Europeans who are separated from
their wives and children, and, who are now
looking forward to bringing them here when
shipping is provided. We strongly urge that
single men should give way to those who are
married; and that if single men are brought
here every facility should be providied to
enable them to bring their fiancees, so that
they may establish themselves as a family unit
and really become part of our nation.
A step in the right direction has recently
been made by the granting of landing rights
in Canada to 5,000 of the depressed persons.
Hon. Mrs. WILSON: Displaced persons.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I thank the honourable lady for the correction, but either word
would be correct. No one could listen to the

stories of hardships through which these people
have passed, and the conditions under which
they live, without being moved by an urge
to do something to help them. So I congratulate the government of Canada on passing

an order in council making admissible 5,000
of these displaced persons, irrespective of
whether they have relatives in this country or
not. I understand that a further order in
council is contemplated, and will soon be
passed, increasing the number to 10,000.

Is it not illogical, if diisplaced persons who
have no relatives in Canada are permitted to
come here, that others who have relatives here
should be excluded, even though strictly speaking they may be outside the classes defined
by the order in council.

In this connection I am pleased to announce
that during the past week instructions went
out to Canadian immigration officers to accept
applications from those who have cousins,
nephews or others outside the definition of
relatives in the displaced persons camps.
Applications will now be received for those for
whom guarantees are given by relatives in
Canada, and they will get the same preference
as are given to those within the prescribed
classes. That change in the regulations is a
very important one, because it will affect
thousands of people in Canada with relatives
in the displaced persons camps who did not
come within the restricted definition. I believe
that as soon as this new provision becomes
known the Immigration Department will
receive a large number of applications from
the relatives in Canada of the 10,000 or so
displaced persons whom it is proposed will
come to this country.
Those of us who have been in touch with
immigration matters during the past year have
been impressed with the rigidity with which
the regulations have been followed. I referred
to the department at one time as a slot
machine into which you placed the right token
and you got the same answer; if you did not
have the exact size of token you got no
answer at all. I am pleased to observe that
of late months there has been a tendency to
get away frorm slavish rigidity in the following of rules. We say in our report that a
rule is different from a law, in that under
certain circunmstances the rule may be broken,
and at times it should be broken. On many
occasions during the past months applications
have been made to ad'nit poor lone people
in Europe who, though, not under twenty-one,
years, are, say, twenty-two years of age, who
in each case are the sole surviving remnant
of a once numerous family, and whose relatives here desire to rescue them, yet they were
turned down completely because they did not
quite fit into the defined classes. I am pleased

to note that a somewhat different attitude is
being adopted by our immigration officials.
We recommend that a greater latitude be
given them to use their own judgment in
many matters. We have also recommended
that the officials themselves take courage to
apply for special orders in council whenever
the circumstances seem to warrant special
procedure, the object being to make the
administration of our Immigration Act as
humane, as considerate, and as wise as possible.
I attribute some part of the change in the
official attitude to two circumstances. First,
our Immigration Branch during recent years
was exclusionist; the heads had learned to
say "no" much better than they said "yes",
and it has taken them some little time to
change their minds in this particular and to
realize that circumstances in Canada today
are very different from what they were in the
hungry thirties. This change, I repeat, took
time, but today there is a different psychology
among them as a result of their applying
their minds to the administraton of a law
more generous than it was their misfortune
to have to administer in the past. The second
reason, I think, is the courage of the minister
in charge of immigration. I give a very great
deal of credit to the Right Honourable C. D.
Howe for his forthright thinking on immigration lines and his readiness to carry out what
he thinks he ought to do, to judge cases on
their merits and get away from this idea of
following slavishly the rules as though they
were a law of the Medes and Persians "that
altereth not", and of regarding the chief duty
of the immigration branch as being to keep
people out.
I would like to devote a word or two to
another matter of considerable importance, that
is to say, the so-called enemy nationals. Honou-rable senators will recall that we recently
passed ard approved treaties with four countries-Italy, Roumania, Hungary and Finland.
As honourable senators know, so soon as these
treaties have been ratified by executive action
these countries will be no longer enemy
countries nor will their nationals be enemy
aliens. They will then cease to be affected
by a standing order in council which excludes
enemy aliens from this country and makes
them inadmissible, irrespective of other circumstances, to Canada, unless it can be shown,
of course, that they are refugees or were
opponents of the enemy governments. But,
gentlemen, that leaves out two very important
nationalities, that is to say Germany and
Austria. The treaties with these states have
not yet been approved by this house. So
far as those treaties which are approved are
concerned no one knows when they will go
into effect. A treaty is a matter of executive,

not parliamentary, action. The executive, as
a matter of courtesy and, of course, common
sense submitted these treaties to our two
houses for approval.
But it is not our
approval which brings the treaties into effect;
it is the action of the Governor General in
Council. It is obvious that the Governor General in Council will act in connection with
these treaties only in concert with other nations; and it is not to be expected that we shall
deliver our treaties prior to the time when the
Big Four deliver theirs. All will be done
together; and when that will take place,
neither you nor I nor anybody, I suppose,
knows. So perhaps a long delay may be
anticipated, even in bringing to consummation
the treaties with the four countries which we
have approved; and when the other two will
be finalized, nobody knows.
I therefore suggest to the government of
this country that the substance of this concept of "enemy alien" is no longer applicable;
it is a thing of the past. The war is over,
and our immigration officials should be allowed to bring in men irrespective of their
nationality, enemy or otherwise so long as
the prospective immigrants did not play a
part, and a reprehensible part, in the Hitlerite movement. I submit that it is time this
order in council should be rescinded in full.
Now I must bring my remarks to a close.
The committee wishes to commend the great
activity which has been evidenced by our
immigration officials. They have received applications to the number of many thousands.
Their files are positively monumental. They
have made 15,000 investigations as the result
of applications by relatives. They have also
investigated many thousands of applications
from friends, mining companies, logging companies, industrial concerns, and others. As I
have said, a new spirit of activity is evidenced
in our department by the widening of the
regulations and the better thinking of those
in charge.
Honourable senators, I look forward with
hope to the successful development of a reasonable and sensible immigration policy as
soon as the minister breaks the bottle-neck
of shipping, and I am confident ho can do
that.

"2. Delete all the words in Section 222B
after the word "one", in line twenty-four, to
and inclusive of the word "otherwise" in line

"not being in a dwelling bouse, who causes
a disturbance in or near any street, road,

DIVORCE BILLS
REFUND

OF FEES

Hon. Mr. HAIG moved:
That the parliamentary fees paid under Rule
140 with respect to the following petitions, viz:
of Pierre Behocaray, of Sherbrooke. Quebec;
praying for a Bill of Divorce from Catherine
Behocaray.

of Elerick Montgomery Barton, of Montreal, Quebec; praying for a Bill of Divorce
from Beatrice Mary Fraser Barton,
be refunded to the petitioner in each case, less
printing and translation costs.
He said: Honourable members, this motion
has to do with two divorce bills which were
passed by the Senate on the recommendation
of the Committee on Divorce, but which were
not passed by the House of Commons.

Hon. Mr. VIEN: May I ask the honourable senator if itLhere is any particular reason
why the fees should be -refunded in these
two cases?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The amount to be paid
back in each case will be only about $15. The
Chief Clerk of Committees informs me that
in such circumstances it has been the practice
to refund the fees.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Is this a recommendation
of the committee?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: This was not recommended by the committee, because we could
not get a quorum.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
The petitions were
refused by the other house.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The bills were -rejected.

The motion was agreed to.
INDIAN ACT
REPORT OF

JOINT COMMITTEE

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of the fourth report of the Joint Committee
appointed to examine and consider the Indian
Act.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR moved concurrence in
the report.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable senators, I doubt the wisdom of the Senate
concurring in this report at the present time.
No opportunity has been given to examine
the
twenty-six
recommendations
made.
Evidently it is the expectation of the Joint
Committee that it will be reconstituted at
the beginning of next session for the purpose
of revising the act. Under these circumstances I suggest to the mover, who is joint
chairman of the committee, that we should
not be asked to concur in this report at the
present time, but that the report be laid on
the table so that an opportunity will be given
to consider more fully the recommendations
it contains. In any case, apparently the
whole matter will again come before parliament at the next session.
I therefore move in amendment to the
motion, that the report be not now concurred
in, but that it be tabled. Probably that is all
that is needed.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is all.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The point which
has been brought up by the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) is, I
think, very important. In asking for concurrence, probably the joint chairman who represented the Senate on the committee is
following the usual procedure; but there is

638

SENATE

considerable force in the observations whieh
we have just heard. Our committees, both
joint committees and others, have rendered
great service in bringing before us a weaith
of information on particular subjeets, but either
because of iack of time to study their reports,
or for some other reason, it bias been the
customn to vote concurrence hecause no one
bas expressed any objection. It seeme to me
that the sanie effeet would be more appropriately achieved by tabling the report for
information, rather than requiring formai concurrence. Actuaiiy, those wbo have studied
the report and, are in favour of it in ail its
details should signify approval by concurring;
those who are opposed to it in any respect
should also register their opinions. It migbt
bc desiralale to. consider that procedure in relation to not only this particular case, but ail
inquiries of this ýcharacter upon wbich general
reports are made to the boeuse. In saying this
I do not doubt that the chairman, in moving
concurrence, followed our established practice.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: I arn not opposing the
amendment of tbe honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), nor do 1 really
concur in it. The text of this report hias been
in the Minutes of the Proceedings since last
Thursday, and anyone wlio is particularly
interested, in thc subject-matter hias had nearly
a w'eek, to look over the recommendations. The
committee lias been sitting during two sessions;
the evidence lias 'been printed, and as it came
from the press it lias been suhmitted for our
consideration.
However, if it is the desire of honourable
senators to concur in the motion, I will not
oppose it. I sbould like however, to say a
word or two in coninection witb the report
it.self. M3, first reason for doing so is that,
as a member of the committee, I bave had a
very dieep interest in ail phases of this subject.
My second reason is the appearance in the
Toronto Globe and Mail of Saturday, July 12,
of a quite ienigthy editorial dealing with the
report.
Even thougli honourable senators
have not had time to analyse the report, it
would seemn that editorial writers on our newspapers were able to examine it in some detaîl
between the date of its appearance, on
Thiurzsday, andi the issue of the paper on
Saturday.
Wbile the editorial writer commendied the
committee for the very thorougb investigation
it had made, and for its obvious sympathy
and sincerity in dealing wit-h ail aspects of this
question, lie expressed one or two criticisms;
and it is because I believe that the criticisms
contained in this editorial may also be present

in the minds of some bonourable senators, as
wvell ais of other citizens, that I should like
very briefly to answer tbem.
The first criticism. was a very minor one,
and expressed regret that the repprt was
brought down so late in tbe session. Tle
answver to that is very easy. There were se
many witnesses who wanted to be heard that
the committee was taking evidence until
aimost the end of the session, and ail the
witnesses had to be heard before the report
was framed. It was therefore flot possible to,
bring in the report any sonner. The second
criticismn vas more serious. It was this: "We
,are left to wonder if it'"-that is the committee
-"lias flot been inclined to miss some of the
fundamental issues involved, such as education and enfranehisement".
For the information of honourable senators
Who are not on the committee, I may say
that when tbe committee was established last
session the magnitude of the task confronting
it ivas very apparent, and the work to he
done was divided into tbree parts, extending
over three sessions of parliament. Tlie sessions
of 1946 and 1947 were to be devoted to the
hearing of witnesses--officiais of the Department of Inidian Affairs, representatives of ail
Indian bands and organizations from. coast to
coast, and representatives of the ciergy of
different denominations who carry on mission
work among the Indians, or other interested
bodies. During the 1947 session alone sixtysev en meetings of the committee wcre held,
none of which lasted less than two hours.
During tlîis time 102 witnesses were cailed,
and the evidence taken covered 2,500 pages.
I think it can at least be agreed that the
committee was not idie. Considering that
volume of evidence, honourable senators can
readily undcrstand that it was not possible in
the few days ieft before the close of this
se(ssion to frame a report wbich would deal
wiîth ail the matters that have to lie settled
))efore the Indian Act can be revised.
The report whicli is now submitted contains
twenty-six clauses, emhodyxing ail the issues
upon whicb the committee wer-e mn unanimomîs
agreement. These clauses were thoroughly
examined by the commrittee, and flot a dissentîng voice w'as beard when this report was presented, to parliamnent. Howcver. more contentious matters, sncb as education and enfranchisement, could n!ot be deait with in the
closing days of the session. These matters will
require a great deai of consideration, and will
be the first part of the work of the committee
at its sittings during the 1948 sess-ion. I might
say that there is not, onmb a division of opinion
among members of the committee on these
niatters, 'but that there is a1so a very great

JULY 15, 1947
diversity of views among the Indians themselves. Consequently, all the evidence has
to be sifted and gone into very carefully before
we can bring a report on these matters.
Honourable senators may recall that a report
brought in from this com-mittee to both
houses of parliament earlier this session contained a recommendation that the government
should consider the granting of oldi age pensions to Indians. That report was unanimously
adopted in both chambers. There was a great
deal of discussion on the matter in another
place, but members of all parties supported
it, including-if my memory serves me correctly, some members of the government who
had taken part in the discussion.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: When was that?
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Earlier this session.
When the amendments 'to the Old Age Pensions Act were brought in we were disappointed that provision had not been made for
the Indians. Particularly were we disappointed
that the minister had not seen fit to extend the
benefits of pensions for the blind to the blind
Indians of this country. In the other house
there was a spirited debate on this matter and
great persistence was shown, but the minister
was adamant and would not bring the Indians
under the amendments. I quite understand
the attitude he took. He said the whole matter was under review by the committee and
that in due course the government would'give
consideration to the broad aspect of additional medical and social services for the
Indians. I do not doubt that for one moment;
but we all know that great bodies, especially
great government bodies, move slowly. In the
interval between now and -the time which the
minister described as "in due course"-whenever that may be-a lot of people are going to
suffer, blind people in particular.
I know something about the conditions of
the blind Indians in the reserves in my district, where the Canadian 'National Insti-tute
for the Blind is giving them assistance in the
way of food, clothing and medical supplies.
But for that assistance they would be in very
straitened circumstances indeed. I personally
am very much disappointed .that the government could not see its way clear to extend the
one clause pertaining to the blind to include
the Indians. In answer to a question in the
other bouse the Minister of National Health
and Welfare stated that the number of white
people eligible for pensions under this new
act would be 9,000. I took the trouble
to look up the figures. So, on the basis of
population, the number of blind Indians who
would have become eligible could not have
exceeded 100. Surely it would not have been

639

a very great strain upon the national treasury
of Canada or upon any taxpayers to have
granted to these 100 blind Indians the relief
which could have been afforded them, but it
would have meant a great deal in the lives of
these few individuals. It would have been
an act of justice and mercy at the same time.
But as that was not done, the committee
recommended, in section 26 of this report, that
some statutory provision be made for the
adequate care of aged, infirm or blind Indians.
That is one reason why I personally would
much dislike to see this matter left over until
another session. The other bouse bas already
adopted this report, and we had hoped that if
the Senate would also do so the government
might take some action with regard to persons
who are suff ering and who might have 'to continue suffering for a long time if we begin
next session to review this question all over
again.
For these -reasons I would ask the concurrence of the house in this report.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, I am sure we are all much indebted to
the honourable senator from Peterborough
(Hon. Mrs. Fallis), for the valuable information she has given us in exp:lanation of the
committee's report. I think that what she
bas said indlicates the need for careful study
of this report, item by item, and the advisability of adopting some other method of
procedure for consideration of reports from
important committees. The joint committee
bas done a lot of work in the course of its
careful examination of the Indian Act. Likewise, the Standing Committee on Immigration
and Labour, the resumed consideration of
whose report is the next item on today's
order paper, has done much work during the
past two sessions, in reviewing the immigration question. The work of important committees like these should not be donc in vain.
Their reports should receive unusually careful consideration by the Senate as a whole,
and I doubt if a motion for concurrence is
the procedure best adapted to attain this
end.
I am not raising a question of order, but
I would suggest that if a motion for concurrence is the proper procedure for bringing
a valuable report like this before the house
for consideration, it would be well to refer
the report to the Committee of the Whole,
where honourable members would, have an
opportunity to discuss it item by item. Then
after a lengthy discussion, which would be
of interest. to the public at large and would
be recorded in Hansard, the recommendations
would have greater weight than a simple
concurrence in a report.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. VIEN: I was referring to the
social, religious, educational and other services
to which some groups of the Indian population
seemed to take exception. I agree entirely
with the honourable senator from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Falilis) that blind and
infirm Indians should be included in our
social service programme. The Indian who is
blind, or infirm is entrusted to our care and
even on purely humanitarian grounds, should
receive the same treatment as is meted. out to
other people living in Canada.
Honourable senators, I suggest that at the
beginning of the next session this whole matter
be referred back to enable the committee to
complete its study; and when the report is
presented-which I hope will be early in the
session-it should then be referred, to committee of the whole, where it should receive

before us represents a goodi deal of hard work
which should not be regarded as "love's
labour's lost".

It is not possible for everyone to be familiar
with the details of thissubject,butlIagreewith
the honourable gentleman from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Vien) that the best way te deal
with the report is to refer it to a committee of
the whole house. In that way it could be fully
discussed, by such honourable gentlemen as
the Senate chairman of the committee (Hon.
Mr. Taylor) and the honourable senator
(Hon. Mr.
Saskatchewan
from Central
Johnston), after which each recommendation
would be a-ccepted or rejected. A year or
two ago the report of the Special Committee
on Income Tax was referred to committee
of the whole, and, the debate on the report
attracted so much public attention that pressure was brought to bear on the government.
with the result that it adopted almost all of
the recommendations made in the report.
We are now so near the end of the session
that in the time left to us it is not practicable
to discuss this important measure fully. I
understand, however, that the other house has
adopted the report, and I for one will vote for
its adoption here. If time permitted consideration of the report in committee of the whole,
I would favour following the suggestion of my
honourable friend from De Lorimier (Hon.
Mr. Vien); but as the recommendations in
the report are unanimous and the session close
to an end, I must ask the members on this
side to vote in favour of the motion for
concurrence.
The administration of the Indian Act is a
very important matter, and no doubt the
government will bring down new legislation
concerning it. The work of this committee
has been carried on at considerable expenseI am not complaining about that-and I think
we should assist the government all we can
by passing this report.
I can appreciate the attitude taken by the
honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar), but I am hoping that after he has
had an opportunity to again review these
recommendations, he will agree to withdraw
his amendment.

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, when I was a member of the Manitoba
legislature, I had, some some experience in
handling matters of this kind. When the
resolution proposing the appointment of this
joint committee was presentedi, I was asked by
the leader of the government in this house
to name four members from this side to sit on
the committee. I had confidence in the ability
of those whom I selected, and I still have. I
am therefore now prepared te vote for the
report presented. by them.

Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I am of the opinion that the government has already taken some action in connection with the inquiry that has been conducted into the Indian Act. I have before me
a newspaper carrying an article under this
headline:
Indians' T.B. rate declared 50 times that of
whites.
I should like to read the article, which is
short, because I believe it is explanatory. We
read in the press recently of a boat that sailed

The remarks of the honourable lady senator from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis)
have been most interesting. They indicate
that there was a division of opinion not only
among the members of the committee but
among the Indians themselves. It is my
recollection that some of the surbmissions
made to the committee and the press by
some Indians who visited Ottawa indicated
that there were subversive currents of
influence among them. This is something
which should receive careful consideration.
Some of the Indians spoke rather lightly of
our present institutions and of our methods
of dealing with matters of interest to them.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Would the honourable
senator permit me to say a few words to keep
the record straight? I fear that perhaps I did
not make it clear that there was no division of
opinion as to the twenty-six sections of this
report. The division of opinion had to do
with matters which have not yet been determined and which are not before us. The report
is unanimous.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The newspaper is

The article is as follows:
A 15 per cent increase in expenditures by

that Indiana, with a tuberculosis death rate 50
f ires higher than the white man, "is a focus of
infection whicli is of concern to you and me."
So already, in my opinion, there have been
saime us;eful results of the extensive work of
the comrnittoe during the Iast two sessions
of parliament. This year the cornmi'ttee be]d
sixty-seven meetings, and as a resuit there
are now the twonty-six recommendafions
beforo us.

Hon. J. E. SINCLAIR: Honourable mem-

bers. I want t0 join the ot-her bonourable
senators who bave spoken a word of congratulation upon the intensive and good work
it has done in carrying on its investigation
with regard to our Indians. I think that the
coimmittee is to be commended for the
patience and industry it bas sbown, and
whicb is sa evident in its report.
But wben we corne t0 consider bow we
should deal witb a report of bhis kind, I cannet a.gree with somne of the statement;s whjch
bave been madLe.
Rule 87 of the Sonate
reada3 as follows:
Upon the presentation of a report no discussion takes place; -but the report may be
ordered to be printed, with the documents accompanying if; or it rnay be placed on the orders
of the day for future consideration, or laid on

earlier in the session to print several hundred

Copies; it bas appeared in the Minutes of
Proceedings and, as an appendix to Hansard.
If is available to every-body. Now we are
asked t0 coiieur in the recommendations, whick
number twenty-six.
In, one paragraph dis-.
approval is expressed of the fact that a recommendation wbich was made in an earlier report
bas not heen acted on. That gives us warning
to ho careful before we concur in these recornmendations, so that we ray be able to support
tbern when tbey corne back t0 us; or, if they
in-volve legisiation, this bouse may be free
to consider in a proper light the legisiation
wbich should- be based upon tbem.
I arn a little confused as to whether, under
clause 9 of tbe report it is intended to set up
a separate departrnent for Indian affairs, under
a minister, or t0 attach it, as at present, to ap
existing department; and as to wbat is meant
by the recommendation in clause 10 that tbe
director of the Indian affairs brancb be raised
to the statua of deputy rnister. ls it proposed that there shall be a separate departrnent
of Indian Affairs, under a minister, witb a
deputy and two assistants, or that witbin. the
existing departrnent, the director shall becorne
a deputy, autborized to deal directly with tbe
minister and nlot tbrougb the deputy bead of
the present departrnent?
I bave expressed rny view generally. I submit t.hat we sbould fol-low the rule tbat when
a comrnittee is not reporting on a bill, but
upon an investigation of matters wbicb bave
been referred fe if by this bouse, the proper
way t0 dieal witb the report is that wbicb bas
been suggested by the bonourable senator frorn
Churcbhi (Hon. *Mr. Crerar). In this caee tbe
cornmittee are fa be commended~ for the work
fbey bave. done; and in adbering te the rule
we do not detract frorn the value of the report
or tbe work of the comm.ittee. The subjectrnatter is available te tbe government, on
wbom falls the responsibility of initiafing any
legislation wbicb rnay arise from. fbis report;
and ail this material is available to the government exactly as fbough if bah been concurred

wben the timie cornes to consider legislation
wbicb rnay arise out of the report and will ho

iI therefore support the amendrnent made
by the bonourable senator from Cburchill

(Hon. Mr~. Crerar).

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

Oh, yes.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is what I unclerztood.
Hon. R. 13. HORNER: As a member of
the committee, I should like to say a word.
I do not entirely agree with the argument
of the bonourable senator frorn Qucen's (Hon.
Mr-. Sinclair). Lt bas been my eNpericnce tilat
reports have usually bean concurred in, and
I hardly agree that it would bamper us in
any way to pa-.s- legisiation hascd on recomEvery
mendations contained in reporte.
senwtor would stili ha able to deal with the
recommendations as hae saw fit. I agree with
t he bonourahie sena toc from Peterborough
(Hon. Mrs. Fallis), and I thîilk that hier
staternant is almost unanswerah1e. This report
lias been available for con-;ideration for aImost
a week, and I think it is proper procediîre
to conclu in it.
Hon. VINCENT DUPUIS: I do flot know
what the attitude of the bouse is with respect
te this repoct. I arn in favoeur of doing anytbing that 'sill balp any type of people in this
country. I foc one would flot block this report
or any Cther legislation if I chougbt it was
for the good of the people of Canada. On the
othec hand, I do net want the report to pass
until 1 have had an opportunity to study it.
I do not know whaethec at this lata stage in
the session it is proper to allow a report to
pass without due consideration. We are al
intercsted in the Indians of this country.
They dlaim tbat they are the masters of this
land and that wa are oniy immigrants.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Oh, oh!
Hon. Mc. DUPUIS: Tha honourable senator fcom Essex (Hon. Mr. Lacasse) is laughing. I am net joking. Ha is himsalf an immigrant to Ontario. The Indians have certain
righits and convictions, and thasa should be

respected. These people may have hean influanced hy certain ideas introduced by those
who today searn to want to control the world.
That I do not know. However, this is a demouflvtic country, and as the honourable sanator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) bias said,
thasa people aven have the right to be wrong.
I must confass that although I arn a mcmber of this committea I did net follow it as
I should lika to have done because I was
husy clsawhere. Perhaps it is for that reason
I think, wa should be cautiaus and net decide
this mattar tee lighitly. I amn mîîch in faveur
of religion, wbatever it may be, in this country. I am aise in faveur of people baing
taughit soinething when tbey are yeuing. I
have sean too much controlling of youth,
eithar for military er ideological purposas, and
I -%ould flot like uny part of our population
te ba contcollad in that way. Let the young
Indians of this ceuntry be free, and net controllcd hy any ana idaalism. I feel that the
Christian idaology should survive in this courttry. Why should it ha destroed hy these who
elaim te ha the first and only ewnars of this
couîntry and who regar'd us as immigrants?
In conclusion I wish te say that if wa concur
in this repart, aur action should net be
rcgacded as conclusiva evidence that wvc are
in faveur of the report as a whole. If any
legislation is passcd naxt session it sbould ha
well studi, d and then ha dcaftad according te
the wisdomn of thoe wbo know hast.
Hon. G. LACASSE: Honourahle senators,

that I rasent and wvill net stand for. If the
cemark w'as made in a jocular way, that

and in the meantime that rations to Indians

Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Wil'l the honourable
senator shiow me to ask a question? I do nlot
want to be misinterpreted. I ar nflt opposed
to concurrence in the report; 1 mercly reserve
my decision. Suppose this report was concurred in todey, would the legisiation to which

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I thought, the honourable senator from Rigaud (Hon. Mr.

made in this paragraph, but he has not donc
that. If he had donc so 1 would have askcd
him wby he did. not attend when, the report
wvas being studied by the com.mittee and make
the correction 'before the report was brought
here. Eviden'tly the honourable gentleman
agrees with what I take to be the necessary
implication of this paragraph, namiely, that the
infirm and blind Indians are not now receiving
adequate care, and that rations given to
Indians are not of sufficient quantity and
quahity.
I have referred to only one clause. There
are too many for me to discuss them ail, but
I wiIl not be a party te voting against a
bumanitarian document of this kind. I have
every confidence in the sincerity of the members cf thec committee, and I know the care

with whicb they have carried on their extensive investigations. Therefore I arn going to
vote for concurrence in the report.
Hoa. JACOB NICOL: Honourable senators,
I had the honour of being a member cf the
joint ccmmittee during the session preceding
this one, but I found the work se, exacting that
I could not give it the time that it required,
and I asked to be relieved. It was my privilege
to attend seine of the committee's sittings,
wherc I observed the thorough work that was
donc by my colleagues. They have carried on
their work te the present time and, made the
report that is before us. From lime to time
I received reports of the committee's proceedings. as I presume ail members of thîs
bouse did. Somnetimes I read those reports
and sumetimes I did net, but niy failure to
read any of them certainiy wil1 net justify a
vote on my part for non-concurrence in the
present report.
I think the memýbers of the ccmmittee have
donc a wonderfui job. I heard mirne of the
witnesses wbo appeared before the committee,
and they stressed the urgency for prompt
action. As we know, the committee bas sat
during the last two sessions. Lt secms to me
that to vote against concurrence in their report
wouid be equivalent to criticizing the committee for the splendid wo*rk it bas duone.
As I askedi Io be re.liex cd fromn membersbip
on the committee because of net having sufficient, time te give to the inquiry, I certainiy
could not do other than vote to have the
report cf my colleagues concurred in.
Hon. J. FREDERICK JOHNSTON: Honcurable senators, I think aIl who wcre privileged te serve on this joint committce did net
attend many of its sittings before coming te
the conclusion that we, as Canadians, had
ncgiected or wards, the ýIndians. To my
mmnd. the work that bas ibeen done by the
ccm-mitte during the past twe years should
have been undertaken years ago.
Some

Hon. Mr. JOH-NSTON: Those who have

something about the magnitude of the work
that was, undertaken. The report before us
bas been well thought out, by people capable
cf making a good repoit. Why shculd we move
now that it bu net concurred. in? What the

Hon. Mr. TAY,LOR: Honourable senators,
a., chairman of the Senate section of the joint
comrmittee during this past -session, I would
firzt like to pay my tribute to ail who have
spoken today in favour of the committee's
report. I find that meinhers who attended the
clommittee's sittings most regularly, and are
farniliar with the evidence that was submnitted, are wholehieartedly in agreement with
,lie report. I wishi to express my thanks to al
iliose members who were so faithful, and who
..încereiy did their best to find out from
Indians and other witncsses what, revîsions
s-houId be made to the act in ordcr to
inuprove the condition of the Indians and,
to help) the Indians help
incid:entally,
t hemselves.
I also wish to pay tributc to the former
chairman of the Senate section of thc coinriiittee (Hon. Mr. Jolinston), who bas just
,.poken. It bas beeni, I think. sorne thirtv
years since the last general revid4on of the
Indian Act, and I feel, as lie (oes, thiat a
gcneral revision is long overdiie.
As the report will indieate. -in the session
of 1946 the committee heard evidence from
dcpartmaental officials . After that session
ended, members of the committee wcre constituted a commission to visit Indian reserves
in the Maritimes and eastern Quebec, and
to take cvidence from the people theinselxes
as to w-bat revisions they felt ,.hould be made
in the set. The commission's report was tabled
in another place the other day, and some time
afterwards the report that we are now conz4dering was also tahled there.
I had, not expected it would be necessary
for me to speak on this report. As the members of the committee who attend its meetings
,and heard witnesses were unanimously in
favour of the report, I tbought it probab'ly
would be concurred in by the bouse without
much debate. It will be noticed that most of
the committee's recommendations are for
administration changes. It is hoped to bave a
revision of the act next year, basqed on the
evidLnce tbat. we collected; in the meantime
the administrative changes that we have recommended shoulil prove of some benefit to the
Indians.
I did not make a note of the points raised
by various speakers tbis afternoon, but I
recaîl that the hon-ourable gentleman from
Parkdiale (Hon. Mr. Murdýock) quoted a news-

paper report as to the prevalence of tuberculosis among Indians. I would point out that
clause 25 of the report recommends:
That the projeet of building a central governmental liospital in northern Indian agencies,
with nursing stations in f ar outl3 ing districts
be proceeded with at once.
The honourable gentleman from Queens
referred to a question that is covered by tbe
recommendration in -clause 9:
That the administration of ail aspects of
Indian Affairs should be under one ministerial
head.
The subjecl mentioned by the honourable
senator for Parkctale (Hon. Mr. Murdock)
cornes under a different minister. The Indian
Affaires branich receives assistance in respect
of health anid welfare, from the national
Departmnent of Health and Welfare. It is
important that the administration of the
Indian Act be under one ministerial bead.
Concerning old age pensions to Indians, the
committee î'ecom.mended in its third report
that the goverrent seriously consider such a
I believe it, was considered, but
measuire.
under the Old Age Pensions Act provision is
made for a contribution by the provinces
towards the benefit received by pensioners.
The provinces claimed that the dominion
should hear the fuîll cost of old age pensions
for Indians and, that the provinces bad no0
responsibility for it.
Sections il to 23 inclusive in the report are
for the most part recommendations, from the
Civil Service Commission, and have to do witb
improvements in the method. of making
appointments and the speeding up of matters
of administration.
With respect to concurieneýe, I irav say
that the report was presented to and concurred in by the other bouse.
The members *of the committee spent a
great, deal -of time in attendance at the 67
6ittings of tbe committee during this session
and after considering the evidence plaeed
before tbema they have suhmitted these recomnmendations. Every member of tbe committee
worked faithfully and was in entire accord
witb the report. Tbe government will decide
wbether or not to accept the recommendations;
but as cbairman of the committee I feel that
the report should be concurred in.

have found out more than once, that the
veterans' preference in the law runs directly
contrary to such a purpose. If provision is
to be made for this the necessary changes
must be made in the Indian Act itself.
There is a recommendation as to hospitalization. What is spoken of is "a central governmental hospital". Is it the recommendation of
the committee that one hospital be built "in
northern Indian agencies", that is in the
northern areas, to service all the country?
I may claim with all modesty that when I was
in the department we made a start with
several of these Indian hospitals. I do not
know just what is meant by the present proposal.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Will the honourable
senator permit me, with reference to his last
statement, to say that that matter was fully
discussed in committee, and it was recommended that one large up-to-date hospital be
established in a central point and that smaller
hospitals-one may call them feeders-would
operate in the outlying districts; the one large
hospital to have equipment net provided in
the smaller hospitals, to serve certain cases
whieh would be brought there for treatment.
Hon Mr. CRERAR: I am grateful to the
honourable senator froin Peterborough (Hon.
Mrs. Fallis), but I remain unconvinced as to
the wisdom of that step, although I would not
wish to take the time of the house in giving
my reasons-Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: -particularly when
we have so much work to do. But this matter
of hospitalization of Indians is one into which
I personally went somewhat actively ten years
ago, when we laid the foundation of tuberculosis treatment for the Indians. To create
a large central hospital and have feeders to
it, will be, I think, very expensive, and will
not micet the need. Moreover, iniless the
ie dieail
authorities of this cointry, who
advised us against such action less than ten
yecars ago. have changed their opinion, I doubt
if it would have their approval.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: May I advise the honourable member from Churehill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) tiat Dr. Moore, the head of the
branch, told the committee that through the
establishment of a properly supervised hospital
in that area. we probably could save two or
three years in the treatment of the tubercular
Indiin. He said that in hospitals which are
net adequately equipped, a course of treatment which under favourable conditions would
require only one or two years might take as
long as five ycars. The plan which was instituted ten years ago, to bring down Indians

from the north to the settledi areas and, give
them proper treatment in hospitals in southern Canada, is net satisfactory to the Indians,
and is net recommended by the government's
advisers.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: On that point, I do net
know whether the committee had before it any
of the authorities on tuberculosis, men who are
thoroughly experienced in the treatment of
this disease. At any rate, they are the type
of medical man whose adývice I took when I
was d.ealing with this question. Reimember
that there is a great deal more involved than
the mere building of a big central hospital.
Hoevrer, I tIo not wish to take up the time
of the Senate. I will conclude with a word or
two about No. 26. the care of aged. infirm and
blind Indians. On this subject we have ieard
from the ionourable senator from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallîs) and the ionourable senator fron Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck).
I do net quarrel with that proposal; in fact
a measure of care is now being given to these
people, unless there has been a change, and
I rIo not think there has been. But I would
point out tirt it is impossible to go fuirther
than the administration are doing todav except
througi the expenditure of more money. That
irmplies a stitutory provision. which you eautrot have this year, nor. in faci, tintil a new
Indian Act ias been adopted.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: These are recomrnendations to that end.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: That is allr ight. If

I apologize, Mr. Speaker, for having
spoken at sih great length. I had not the
slightest expectation. when I ioved that the
report be tabled-which simply me.ant that
final consideration of it would not be given
at this time-that I was going to stir up a
sort of hornet's nest of debate; and since the
house ias expressed itself pretty clearly,
there can be no particular hari in adopting

if we do so we will mierely be adopting something whicih. in the main, the administration

carried the responsibiiity of assisting the chairman in guiding the committee and arranging
for the appearance of witnosses.
As was indicated last evening in the remarks
made by the honourabie senator frorn TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), a groat deai of
evidonce was subrnitted to the cemmittee.
Unfortunatoly, in the arrangement of the
business of the house, it is unavoidable that
two or three committees sit at the same tirne,
and thereforo 1 did not have an opportunity
of attending ail sessions of the Cornrittee on
Immigration and Labour. However, I have
read practicaliy ail the evidence that I did not
hear, and 1 would suggest te honourable senators that they take the report home with themn
during the recess and read it if they have not
aiready dlone se. I should aise liko to-express
commendation te the govornmont for the
relaxation of the regulations, particuiarly since
our comrnittee terminated its labours a year
age.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Whether or net it was
because of the doliberations on the report of
the cemmittee a year ago that the government
was influenceri I cannot say, but I do feol
Othat the government is te be commonded, for
broadening the regulations and for what I
wouid doscribe as a more liberal interpretation
of tlicm.
I need net remind this houso of what I have
said on one or two previeus occasions with
regard te the epportunity this count.ry coeid
provide fer people who stili want te make
their independent way in the werld.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: There can ho ne
cavilling at that staternent. I arn persuaded
that thore is urgent need for more immigration
te this country for reasens which I shahl
briefly allude te. If we were te eliminate
what wo considor te ho the waste regiens of
Canada, the habitable area in this country
would probably ho one-third of the total area.
On that basis, on the habitable arca our
population, at the outside, would net ho more
than ton people for each square mile. Contrast that estimato with a country such as
India where the population is 1,250 people
te the square mile. Aise contrast that situation
te the one that exists in many European
countries where there are anywhere from 300
te 600 er 700 people per square mlile. 1 arn
among thoeýe who boliove that we cannot
permanently retain an estate of the value of
our Canadian estate if we seek te confine our
population te what mîght corne from natural

will accept our way of life and who will contribute to the production of our wealth. I
think it has been found that many people
from European countries are assimilable in
Canada.
I have spoken before of the
Ukrainians, Germans, Poles and other racial
stocks from EuropeHon.

Canada and who have made outstanding successes. Of course, honourable senators, I will
at once admit that the foundation to the
success that followed later was made by
Scotchmen, and if my honourable friend the
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) gets any
comfort out of that ie is quite entitled to it.
It is known from evidence we have heard
that in the displaced persons camps in the
American and British zones of Germany are
large numbers of people with special skills and
knowledge. They are not riffraff nor are they
useless people. We also know fron experience
that we have bad in Canada alrcadyv that these
people could make a useful contribution if
they were allowed to come 'to Canada. That if
why I welcome the relaxation that has been
apparent in recent months in the government's
immigration regulations.
There are two main reasons why a broad
policy in immigration is desirable. I am not
among those by any means who believe that no
immigrants should be brought to our shores
until we have a job ready for them. That
would narrow immigration altogether too
much, and it is contrary to the experience of
this country in the past. We have a moral
obligation in this matter, particularly to those
unfortunate but good, educated and law abiding people whose only crime in life is that
they would not submit their freedom to
nazism or communism. That was their only
crime, and I submit it is a solid basis for
a useful contribution ta Canada's development. I think that this country, with all its
vast resources, bas a moral obligation in this
respect.
Also, I think that Canada needs these people
for another reason. We hear a great deal
about taxation. and gross national production,
which we shall be discussing shortly under
another bill. We have seen our social services
expand greatly, and our debt grow to enormous
proportions, and we are conscious that the
economie obligations on the governments of
Canada are much greater today than anyone
ever dreamed of a fev years ago. If we are
to maintain our national production and

increase our wealth, it can only be by the
application of labour and capital to the natural
wealth of the country. In the last analysis
all wealth comes from old mother earth, and
it is the application of labour and capital to
old mother earth that produces wealth. The
production of additional wealth in this country
would tend to raise our gross national income
and lighten the burden of taxation upon every
Canadian.
Therefore from both a moral and an economic point of view we should give due consideration to this matter. Some people are
cancerned lest our standard of living be
reduced if we admit immigrants from European countries. Well, I should like to know
how a standard of living is to be defined. I
know that when the Ukrainians came to this
country fifty years ago they had a low
standard of living, but I am equally sure that
by their efforts, by the development of their
farms, they have added very substantially to
our yearly production and to our total
national wealth; and in so doing they have
contributed to raising the standard of living
throughout the country. Consequently, I am
not greatly worried about this thing called the
standard of living. After all. we have a really
high standard of living in this country. In my
judgment no country, not even the United
States, has a higher standard, if it is measured
by any of the indices ordinarily used as a basis
of comparison. But if we put too narrow a
construction on these regulations with regard
to standards of living and so forth, it may
imilitate strongly against our getting many
desirable immigrants.
I apologize to the house for having taken up
so much of its time.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I wish to say ontly a few words. First J congratulate the honourable gentlenan from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock). as the chairman of the committee which brought in this
report. I have only one complaint. to make
against him-that he persistently dogged the
members of the committee to attend its
sittings. Because of other duties I was able
to be present on only four oceasions, and the
number would have been le-s but for his constant pursuit of me. I also want in the rame
brcatli to congratulate the lionourable genrileman
from
Toronto-Trinity
(Hon.
Mr.
Roebuck) upon his un4iring work as a menber
of this committee. I regard the commitce's
report as ane of the two or tîhee hiliilts

to decide in their own minds what ought to
be dýonc about this important question of
immigration.
1 arn not going to mnake a speech on the
subject now. I say without hesitation that I
agree 100 per cent with the address just made
by the bonourable gentleman from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar). Certainly he expressed
the view of the part of Canada that we corne
from.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is the view of our
p)art of the country. We de not think that
immigrants will lower the. standard of living
or the opportunities for employment of the
rest of the people. On the contrary, we thin-k
that the more good immigrants we lot in the
higher our standard of living will go and the
greater will be the opportun-ity for employment. Tbosc of us who are getting a fcw
gray hairs and can remember back to ý1897 or
sa, recali. that the gov.ernment of that day
inaugurated an immigration policy wbich it
was prophesied would have dkire consequences.
But that policy Led to the great expansion of
a large part of Canada.
There is one point that was not mnade by my
honourable friend from Churchill. In the
present advanced stage of transportation and
intercommunicaion, I do flot believe that
twelve million people can very long bold the
richest land on earth from greedy people elsewherè. If we refuse to allow more immigrants
to settie bere and become part of our national
lufe we are only inviting trouble for ourselves.
We might as well face this thing realistically.
Wbether we like it or not, some countries of
the world today regard themselves as haveflot countries, and they consider that we are
one of the have countries. So considering the
thing on the lowest level, that of self interest,
we sbould do wbat we can to facilitate the
settiement in Canada of desirable people from
abroad. I can speak with a good deal of
authority as te Ukrainian and Polish people
who came to the West in years gone by. They
form a solid part of our population and contribute to every aspect of our life.
I have mucli pleasure in supporting the
motion for concurrence in the report.
Hon. RALPH B. HORNER: Honourable
senators, as a member of the committee I
should like to say a few words. One of the
committee's recommendations is that ail immigration be supervised by the gavernment. I
was wondering whether that was intended as
any criticism at ail of the Mr. Dionne, the
textile manufacturer in the province of Quebec
who brought some two hundred girls from displaced persons camps in Europe to work in
bis factory.
83168-42

649

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No, it was flot.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Possibly not. However, ta make myself clear, I want te say that
I have no criticism. whatever of Mr. Dionne's
action. I commend him warmly. To friends
wbose religious faith is different from that of
Mr. Dionne and who complained ta me about
what he did, my answer is, "Get busy and
ask for the same privilege." Criticism of the
wages paid the girls is, I tbink, not properly
founded. If they formerly were in need and
living in camps, surely now that they have
been brought over here and given good care
and nourishing food the question of their
wages for the next two years is a relatively
small one. By that time they may have
become valuable citizens. No doubt Mr.
Dionne will be highly commended by bis
churcli for making sure that the girls wbom
he employed were of the Roman Catholic
faith; but, after all, that is the faith of most
of the people in the community where they
are ta work. To persans of my own and other
religinus faiths who are inclined ta be critical
of Mr. Dionne I say, "Go and do likewise."
1 wisb ta join in congratulations ta the
chairman of the committee (Hon. Mr. Murdock) and the honourable gentleman from
Toronto-Trinity (-Hon. Mr. Roebuck) upon
the good work done by the committee and
the valuable report presented ta us. The
gavernment should be complimented upon
ligbtening the immigration restrictions, but
I must confess that wben I consider the few
concessions that bave been made I feel a
sense of frustration. The admission of a few
tbousands of people instead of some millions
indicates a mere nibbling at the whole question. Lt is true that tbe government bas an
opportunity now ta do far more.
I was pleased ta hear the bonourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) say that he hoped we would soon have
a peace treaty that would flot leave us under
the handicap of referring, ta certain people as
enemny aliens. This èclassification lias kept some
very gond immigrants out of this country.
Honourable senators may have noticed by a
press despatoli that some 30,000 Germans
recently stole away from the Russian occupied
zane ta avoid being taken ta Russia ais slave
labour. Surely those are displaced persans of
'the first order. I wauild strongly recommend
ta the goverament that Germans of that type
*be classified as displaced persans, and be permitted ta corne ta this country.
Some time ago I received a letter from a
22-year-old German lad in England whom 1
lied previously met at Regan, Ontario. At the
outbreak of tbe war he was a boy of fifteen,

with no political views. While in Canada he
gave entire satisfaction to the tarmers who
employed him in western Canada and to the
lumber camps in Ontario where lie worked.
He liked fari work and lumbering, and wanted
permission to come to this country. I could
guarantee work to several boys of that type,
and this country ought to give permission to

bring them here.
I agree entirely with the remarks of the
honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
For forty years I have lived in a
Crerar).
community settled entirely by Poles and
Ukrainians. They had no money to start with
but timber was available and they built their
own houses. Perhaps their first houses were
without floors, but today they have beautiful
homes and many of their descendants have
gone to universities. They have paid their
way one hundred per cent. The honour roll
of our country shows that many of the boys
rendered valiant service during the war.
May I point out that we have net today
the same privilege of training men and families that we had in days gone by. Opportunities are available, but development is retarded
by dependence on someone else. Today we
have the baby bonus, and of course my honourable friend suggests that we bring whole families here. In the days I speak of we depended
on a man's work, and did net think that the
government was -responsible for taking care of
him. We believed that the building of his
home and his general advancement depended
entirely on a man's own efforts. I know of men
today with three or four children who are sitting down spending the baby bonus instead of
getting out and hustling. I say that is a
handicap.
The Committee on Immigration had before
it a number of people who talked about the
standard of living and the country's capacity
to absorb immigrants. I asked several witnesses what they meant by standard of living,
and how they could force a man to maintain
a certain standard of living and still permit
him to retain his freedom? I was never able
to get a satisfactory answer to that question.
My own belief is that an indivi'dual in order
to maintain his freedom, must learn fron his
own mistakes and be rewarded by his own
industry.
I grew up under conditions that might have
got my parents into a lot of trouble. Perhaps
I should net have been allowed to go in my
bare feet, and that sort of thing. While talking recently with a successful and well-to-do
lawyer in western Canada he said that ha was
fron the Ottawa valley. He remarked how
nice it felt when the frost was on the ground

in the morning to jump frot spot to spot
where the cows had lain and warmed the
ground at night.
I submnit that the best people are not those
who have everything handed to them; they
are the people who must work to succeed. I
believe there are a million people who could
core here and make a living, and who would
add greatly te the wealth of this country.
Hon. CAIRINE R. WILSON: Honourable
senators, as yen all know, I have for many
years been struggling against rules which
prevent certain people coming to this country.
I am now gratified that some relaxation bas

I was pleased that the last speaker alluded
to the movement of displaced persans. Only
last week I read that there are now 12 million
of these expellees. people whose only fault was
that a little German blood. had been introduced into the veins of their ancestors seven
hundred years ago. For that reason they have
been forced to flee from Yugoslavia and other
countries rather than be deported for slave
labour.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
Honourable
senators, I would not be plnying fair if I did
not say that the report on immigration standing in my naine and now before this house is

largely the result of the careful thought and
work given it by the distinguished senator
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
More than anyone else, my honourable friend
is responsible for what the Immigration Committee was able to db both last year and this
year.
Some of us are convinced that already the
activities of that committee are showing
favourable results. I hope that we may continue the good work next year.
Hon. CYRILLE VAILLANCOURT: Honourable senators, the problem of immigration
is one not only of bringing people here, but
of assimilating them. I read the following
article in the Montreal
aStndard of June 12:
For instance, the United States government
reports that more than 18,000 nativeHborn Canadians crossed the border as immigrants between
July 1, 1945 and June 30, 1946.
Figures for the year just ended are not yet
available, but a recent United States government estimate said that more than 30,000 nativeborn Canadians would have emigrated to the
United States by June 30.
Moreover, native-born Canadians represent
only about 75 per cent of the people admitted
to the United States as immigrants from Canada. The rest are foreign-born residents of
Canada, many of whom have used this country
as a stopping-off place while awaiting their
chances to get into the United States under the
American quotas for their countries of origin.
And to top it off, these figures still do not include the thousands of people who enter the
United States from Canada illegally every year.
But just censider, for the moment, the emigration of native-born Canadians. From July 1,
1945, to June 30, 1947-just two years-48,000
went to the United States to live.
But in a period which was three months
longer,-from January 1, 1045, to March 31,
1947, just over 45,000 people, exclusive of war
brides and returning Canadians, came to Canada
from other nations of the world.
In other words, we lost 3,000 more people to
the United States alone than our total immigration from the rest of the world.
I think that indicates another matter which
our committee migh-t investigate next session.
Hon.
Mr. ROBERTSON:
Honourable

ated in the act. I also doubt that Lower Canada, now known as Quebec, would have come
under the articles of the union if it were not
for the provisions in the act.
One has only to read the history of those
times to realize what a problem it was to get
these four provinces to form a union. The
difficulties with regard to other provinces
joining the union were not so great. Prince
Edward Island, Manitoba, and British Columbia came into confederation a short time after
1867 and in 1905 the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta were incorporated into the
union.
The minute the Dominion Government
interferes with the fundamenýtal understanding
behind confederation, an inclination or trend
is started in our country, and there is no use
trying to avoid it.
Certain political parties have suggested that
the Senate be abolished. If that were donc
none of us here would be affected, because
whatever system was adopted we would be
taken care of individually. Therefore I think
we can speak on this matter without personal
interest. I cannot imagine the Maritime Provinces ever agreeing to the abolition of the
Senate. I say this because the Maritimes
have one-fourth of the representation in the
Senate, while in the House of Commons as it
is now constituted, they have very little over
a tenth-twenty-seven members out of a total
of 265. I cannot see how the people of that
part of Canada would ever agree to any
change. To a lesser extent the same argument
applies to the province of Quebec. I could
understand Ontario and Quebec combining if
they shared similar political views, because
they would then have a majority in the other
place and there would be little fear of their
ever losing that majority. I can also understand how Ontario and the Western Provinces
might combine and agree to the abolition of
the Senate, because then they might always
have a majority in the elected body. That
would certainly be a possibility because in the
other place there are some eighty Ontario
members and seventy odd members from
Western Canada, making a total of 150 representatives in a house of 255 members. That
is the fundamental issue that is involved in
this problem. When, owing to the "dark
thirties", the question of the Canadian standard of living came up for discussion, some
provincial gover'nments urged the federal government to appoint a commission to investigate the problem. As a result, the RowellSirois Commission was appointed, and this
commission subsequently submitted a report
to the effect that fiscal need should be the

653

basis of the part played by the dominion in
dealing with the provinces. At that time the
estimated fiscal need was $40,000,000.
The dominion government, quite properly,
called a meeting, and when three provinces
refused to co-operate, negotiations broke down.
Then the war came along and during that
period certain taxing powers principally with
respect to income and corporation taxes, were
transferred to the federal government.
Let me deal for a moment with the result
of that action. Under the wartime tax agreements the Dominion Government had to pay
to the provinces $117,000,000 in round figures.
That amount was paid in lieu of the taxing
powers that were taken over. The agreements
provide that the Dominion Government can
tax directly or indirectly as they sec fit. That
the Dominion Government can do that is
clear under the statute. But the provinces
themselves must have direct taxation, and
ever since confederation certain fields of taxation have been left to them. It has been said
-I heard it said when the committee was
meeting-that the Dominion Government did
not have to stay outside the smaller taxation
fields such as those of electricity, pari mutuels,
successin duties and so on. That is true, but
it has always been an unwritten law that the
federal government would leave those fields to
the provinces. However, owing to war emergency the Dominion Government entered into
those tax fields, and now they do not want to
get out.
During other sessions the Prime Minister has
said that the right of taxation should belong
to the people who spend the money. That
means that if some outside authority has to
tax to get the money, and Manitoba, for
instance, spends it, there will be an inclination
to spend the money much more freely. That
is human nature in the individual, and it is
human nature in municipal, provincial and
dominion governments. It has always been so.
I shall return now to the figures. Forty
million dollars was the estimate of the fiscal
need according to the Rowell-Sirois report.
During the war period the estimate was 117
million dollars, and, in 1945 the government
came forw.ard with new proposals under which
the estimate was 138 million dollars. Under
the 1946 proposals the government gave the
provinces 198 million dollars, and now this
new legislation contemplates payment of 228
million. I make the prophecy that if this
agreement is accepted by all the provinces,
228 million dollars will be the smallest sum
the Dominion Government will ever pay.
In fact, there are many within the sound of
my voice who will see that amount doubled.

Once somnebody starts to collect the money
and somebody else spends it, the spending is
veî'v fiee. That is the history of such an
upera tion.
The progressive figures show that tdie gevernmnent paid 40 million dollars under the
Rowell-Sirois report; 117 million under the'
wartime tax agreements; 138 million under
the 1945 proposaIs, and 198 million under the'
1946 proposais. Now it contemplates paying
228 million dollars.
It must be rcmenmbered that there has bee:i
practieaily no increase in the population of
this country and that thiere is now a demand
for a great reduction in taxation. Withi the'
exception of British Columbia, ne provincial
governmient in Canada could refuse te accept
tht' offer cf tht' dominion. I believe that by~
accepting that offer the province cf Manitoba
is $5,000,000 ahead of what it could get
by taxation at the same rates as those now
being collected by the dominion.
I think that under this agreement my province will get $5.000,000 more than, it couid

three times better off under this agreement
than it otherwise wouid be. British Columbia
is in a different position: it probably makes

that have entered into the agreement are
have-net provinces. I do net believe that any
system which taxes ont' part of tht' country
and turcs the money over te another part
can remain in existence long. It may bc good

province differs with me or not on that stand.
I -think that only through co-operation of ail
the provinces with the Dominion shall we be
able to carry out these agreements successfully.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? Does he still
adhere to the prophecy lie made the other day?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, I certainly do. And
this will be one of the issues.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I ask the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
a question? Does he consider that from the
points of view of geography and economies the
provinces of Ontario and Quebec are the real
beneficiaries of Confederation?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: They probably are. But,
you know, the farmer who lives a quarter-mile
from town thinks he should not pay higher
taxes then the man whose farm is five miles
away. Ontario benefits from its geographical
position, and so does Quebec. I presume my
honourable friend has in mind the fact that
but for protective tariffs, certain goods that
are manufactured in this country would be
brought in from the United States.
I may be quite wrong, but it is my
opinion that 147 members of parliament will
not give way to 108 members. It is said that
Ontario and Quebec are miles apart, but on
a question like this they are by no means
apart.
I have said that in my own province the
present proposals would be difficult to carry
out because they require the taxing of one
group of people to keep another group. The
Sirois report hit the nail on the head when it
said that the fiscal need should be the standard.
No other commission ever appointed served
Canada as well as that commission. A distinguished gentleman from my own city, who
has since passed on, gave most outstanding
service as one of its members.
The amount estimated by the commission
for the fiscal need was 40 million dollars. I

One of the most unfortunate features of
these agreements is that within a few years
they will inevitably lead to bidding campaigns by various provinces against one another. What happened while this deal was
being made? Manitoba came here and made
a bargain. Saskatchewan and Alberta did
the same. Then along came British Columbia,
which got better terms than the others did.
The original agreement with Manitoba provided for revision in case any other provinces
made better terms with the dominion, and so
there had to be further bargaining. That was
a form of bidd'ing by one province against
another. The bill provides that if OntariD
makes an agreement it will be entitled to a
minimum payment of $67,158,027; and if
Quebec makes an agreement it will get
$56,382,127. Well, if I were opposing a government supporter in Quebec I would say:
"Why should Ontario get 67 million, dollars,
when we get only 56 millions? Why should
these two great provinces not be treated on
the same basis? Why should Quebec be
discriminated against to the extent of 11
million dollars?"
Hon. Mr. NICOL: The payments are based
on population.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know that, but there are
other factors besides population that could be
considered. For instance, it could be contended
that the larger number of children per family
in Quebec makes it necessary to have more
money for educational purposes in that
province than in Ontario.
Ordinarily if I were running an election campaign in Manitoba and advoca-ted the doing
of certain things that would cost a lot of money
the people would ask me, "Where are you
going to get the money?" I would say, "If you
elect me I will tax you in order to get enough
money to do these things that I say should
be done." They might reply, "We do not want
you." But the whole situation is changed by
the agreement, and now a campaigner who
advocates large expenditures can say, "We are
going to tax those rich plutocrats who live in
the province of Quebec, particularly in the

Hon. Mr. HAIG: After a very exhaustive
examination the commission recommended that
the provinces be paid 40 million dollars. I
do not know what prompted it to make that
finding, but I could pa-s on a number of
reasons given by other people as to why the
recommendation should not be adopted. Even
the province of Nova Scotia, which accepted
the agreement, is now kicking about it.
As to succession diuties, I think it a terrible
thing that the Dominion Government should
step into that field. The dominion has ne
right as compared with the provinces to colleet
succession duties. I say candiddy that it is
done with a. view to catching income tax
evasions. In an applica.tion under the Succession Duties Act. the very first thing one is
confronted with is a question as to income.
I believe that estates arc naturally within
provincial jurisdiction.
In conclusion I wish to say that I heartily
support the demands-and I use the word
advisedly-of the Premier of Ontario and the
Premier of Quebec. that a conference should
be called again, and that it should continue
until some satisfactory arrangement is reached'.
I hope that the ills whieh I have attempted to
portray will not flow from an agreement
reached in that way.
Hon. JACOB NICOL: Honourable senators,
I hiad no thought that I would have anything
to say on this bill. For two years I have been
trying to familiarize myself with the fiscal
laws of this country, and with respect to the
bill now before us. It deals in figures of a
magnitude that no one would have dreamed
of a few years ago.
Canada became involved' in large figures
through her financing during the war years.
As to war expenses, J repeat wha.t I said te the
honourable Minister of Finance when he came
to Sherbrooke: "Since w-e are now raising
money for war purposes you may ask for any
amount you need." \We wanted to win the
war and we were prepared to pay the cost.
We paid the taxes then for war purposes, but
did net dream that after the war was over and
victory was won this country would continue
to be taxed as it was whten the war was on.
The budget figures for the dominion and the
provinces, showing the amount the people of
Canada are obliged te pay. are staggering.
As a student in Quebec I was secretary to
the Provincial Treasurer of those days, and I
well remember that the budget for 1902

reached the huge figure of five million dollars.
I well recall the treasurer calling me in and
saying: "Nicol, imagine the revenue of this
province being five million dollars." That was
the fi-st time it had reached that figure.
In 1921 it was my privilege to become Provincial Treasurer for Quebec, and I placed
my first budget before the house in 1922 in
the amount of $21 million dollars. That was
the highest figure reached up to that date, and
in that year the liquor commission brought in
five million dollars. The budget of my province
never exceeded 16 million dollars during the
term of office of Sir Lomer Gouin. and te was
regarded as a great premier who did wonderful things for the province. At the end of my
term of eight 3ears as Provincial Treasuîrer the
budget was 30 million dollars, with a surplus
in excess of five million dollars.
Does. anyone believe that the people of this
country have become so rich that they can
afford to pay such amounts as the federal and
provincial budgets require? Yet the <pe'nding
by the dominion and the provinces goe- on.
This year the budget for Quebec will be 150
million dollars and for Omaîrio i: will te more
than 200 million dollars. Have the people of
my province become so prosperous that in
1947 they can pay four times the amount of
taxes thev paid in 1930? I do nol believe
thev can.
in my opinion the cost for bloti federal amI
provincial administration. as it effects the welfare of th people. has reaetrd a danger point.
I believe that those in authority sho-uld make
an honest study of the situation and try to
bring some relief to the ordinary working
people, who after all have to pay the taxe-.
The honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) recently said, in spcaking
on another bill, that money was createl by
work and that no money was acquired except
by sacrifice; that for every dollar collected by
the federal and provincial authorities seinebody sweated and worked. If that principle
were kept in mind I think we would be more
careful when called upon to vote millions of
dollars of expenditures.
As to the bill now before us, my sympathies are somewhat divided. It was my
privilege to serve my province in the provincial house for over twenty--five years.- My
mentality has been tinged somewhat by the
provincial situation. It was myv privilege to
serve under such men as Sir Lomer Gouin,
who was well known as one who believed in
provincial rights. Later it was my privilege
te serve under the Honourable Mr. Taschereau, who, as everybody knows. believed in
the province of Quebec "sitting tight" on

JULY 16, 1947
the British North America Act and keeping
every privilege and right granted through
that Act to his province. Having served
under those men, and having maintained that
position, it is hard for me to come to the
conclusion that the country needs now what
we are asking the provinces to give. It is
hard for me, knowing the province of Quebec
as I do, to say that the province of Quebec
at this stage of the development of Canada

should put everything-its aspirations, its
hopes, its ambition-in the background, look
solely to the future of Canada and say, "We
sacrifice what we think is the welfare of the
province of Quebec to make a prosperous and
united Canada."
I am not ready yet to say that. It is my
belief that, but for war and the extension of
wartime taxation into times of peace, the
province of Quebec would have developed
into the richest and largest province of the

Dominion. The province of Quebec has been
endowed by nature with wealth which it bas
not been possible for it yet adequately to
develop, and now that the time has come
when by legislation it can carry on what
it had hoped to carry on, the central government says, "Stop, restrain your ambition for
a while, and come and help to develop the
provinces which the leader of the opposition
has mentioned, and which may be in need."

Do not forget that half the water powers
of this country lie in the province of Quebec.
Do not forget that what thus far has been

sornewhat of a handicap in the development
of the province-its north country. covered
with snow and with forests-has become

a

source of great wealth. The waters which
roll down from the north to the St. Lawrence
are rolling in July and August; there is no
dry season in that part of the province. And

now, when the wealth of this country consists
of "white power", electricity; when the industries of the world and of America in particular have to come to the province of

Quebec if they want to get cheap power; now,
when the coal resources are being exhausted
and other sources of energy are becoming
more and more limited, the province of
Quebec is asked to relinquish certain fields
of taxation, and to forgo certain revenues
which could have been used to help the
development

of

those

natural

resources.

Quebec, because of its great potential wealth
and the character of its people and its institutions is destined to become the richest and
most populous of all the Canadian provinces.
I do not like to pass a law which will make
the province of Quebec, as far as its revenues
are concerned, a subsidiary of another government.

. I am not opposing the bill. I have not the
vision to say whether this bill is absolutely
necessary. I would have liked to see it held
over. I would have preferred to have the
people of Quebec given more time to go into

this question, probably one of the most intricate and most difficult which has ever come
before the parliament of Canada.
As the leader of the opposition has pointed
:ut, confederation created much anxiety in
Canada. The arguments and discussions which
culminated in the act of confederation lasted
I
We found the solution.
several years.
believe that the present standing of Canada,
the present situation of the dominion, should
occasion in us more anxiety than our forefathers experienced when they brought about

confederation.

Let us make no mistake about

it, Canada is now facing a divided path.
Rightly or wrongly, certain provinces have
been given money. They want more. Only
two provinces can provide it. Others will
contribute as much as they can, but the main
burden will fall upon two provinces. Do

you not think that under those circumstances
it might be well to discuss the *subject fully
with these provinces, to bring them around a
table to hear arguments for and against, and
to proceed in a spirit of conciliation and
comprehension, because we know that they
cannot be forced into a deal if they believe it,
even wrongly, to be unfair, unjust, or
unnecessary.
I thought when this legislation was first
proposed that it might directly affect in a
financial way the province of Quebec. We

were told that Quebec would have to accept it
because it needed the 56 million dollars; but
even in the short time since these proposals
were made, events have proven that Quebec
does not need this money. It is now raising
more money than, in my belief, it is healthy
for the province to hav.e. If I had anything to
say regarding the administration of the province of Quebec, if I were a partisan of the
present Prime Minister, I would urge him
not to raise so large a revenue, for the province
does not need to spend 150 mil-lion dollars a
year. It is not fair to ask a taxpayer, even a
willing one, to contribute more than he should
to the treasury. The people of this country
have shown their patriotism. Quebec. which is
sometimes criticized, came forward and, did its
duty. We called upon the people to pay
money for a particular purpose, and from one
end of Canada to the other they have paid it.
We should now give them a respite. Do you
not think it might be well to take a rest and
say to these willing taxpayers, "You have done
your duty. Keep some of your money now"?
While I do not wish to criticize, I feel that I

bcause I w-as not called upon to do so, but
if I had I shouldi probably have said what I

not cover all the discussions that have taken

that the passing of this bill would give too
nuch money to the people of the province of

Quebec.

Hon. Mr. CRERAR:
The bill we are
considering is in my judgment one of the
most important measures that the house bas
had before it during the present session.
Eighty years ago the confederation of the
tlen existing Canadian provinces was brought
about, under conditions vastly different from
ihose of today. The main occupations of
Canadians at that tirne were fishing, lumbering and agriculture. The manufacturing industries which in later years have grown
to such large proportions were then insignificant, serving only the needs of local

communities. Eleven years after Confederation was achieved, a very important departure
was made in the trade policies of the
dominion. I am not here to criticize it or
to pass an opinion one way or another, but
there is no question that the introduction of
a protective tariff in our fiscal policies 'had
profound effects on the development of
Canada. The centres of population were then
largely in Ontario and Quebec, and one effect
of this new policy was to accentuate and increase a development which normally would
perhaps have occurred in some measure. I
think that the Maritime provinces rested under
a sense of grievance because of that policy,
and that certainly became apparent with the
development of the prairie provinces in the
late years of the last century and the early
years of the present one.
We passed through that period, with our
political battles ranging around tariff issues
and development policies such as that having
to do with the building of railways. We came
on down to the war of 1914-18 and we survived
very well the dislocations brought about by
that war. Following that, as almost always
happens after groat wars, there was what was
known as a boom. Values of almost everything went to high levels until, as also inevitably happens, the boom collapsed, bringing
about wide-spread unemployment. During the
depression years the count-ry suffered another
handicap through the worst drought in the
history of the prairie provinces. The great
burden of relief that had to be carried by those
provinces and the Maritime provinces as well
led to discussions as to whether or not it would
be possible to find a way of overcoming such
serious dislocations from depressions or at
any rate of greatly mitigating them.
With that objective in view, in August
1937, the government of the time set up what
was known first as the Rowell commission and
later, following the illness that overtook Mr.
Chief Justice Rowell during the course of the
inquirv, as the Sirois commission. The purpose the government had in mind in setting
up the commission was if possible to find a
better balance and a better equity as between
the various provinces. I can say with certainty
that it was no part of the commission's mandate to disturb the existing powers of the provinces and the federal authority as defined in
our constitution. After an extended inquiry
that covered all parts of the dominion, and
the receipt of representations from the various
proxvinces, boards of trade and other organizations right across Canada, the commission
brought in its report in 1940.

JULY 15, 1947
The commission found that under the existing econonic set-up in Canada wealth tended
inevitably to more to the central provinces.
It is not difficult to understand the reason
why this was so. Business concerns and
financial institutions, almost without exception,
have their head offices in either Ontario or
western Quebec. The great banks, with
branches scattered throughout the various
provinces, do business all over Canada; but
they have their h.ead offices in the East. Big
industrial concerns such as the implement
manufacturing companies and other manufacturing concerns invariably have their head
offices either in the city of Toronto or some
other Ontario city, or in Montreal or some
other Quebec city.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: Or in Sherbrooke.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The vast transportation companies also have their headquarters in eastern Canada, and the highly paid
officials of these corporations and banks are
located at their head offices.
The final result is that the provinces of
Ontario and Quebec have, in addition to the
corporations and companies, a large population
of income tax payers to draw upon. In that
way there has been a serious drain upon the
other provinces, which contributed very largely
to the business success of these financial institutions and manufacturing concerns but
receive little'from them in taxes.
The Sirois Commission found the situation
as I have stated it to be. It made suggestions
which, in the judgment of the commission,
would correct to some degree at least what
was regarded as a condition of unbalance and
inequity.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: My honourable
friend should include insurance companies.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Yes, of course. With
the exception of the head office of one large
insurance company in the city of Winnipeg,
nearly all have been located in Quebec or
Ontario.
The Sirois Commission in its report made
several recommendations. I am not going to
burden the house tonight with all of them,
but I wish to refer briefly to four: First-a
very important recommendation-that the
dominion should have exclusive authority to
raise revenue from income tax, corporation
tax and succession duties; second, that the
dominion should accept responsibility for the
relief of the employable unemployed; third,
that the dominion government assume the net
provincial debt charges; fourth-and this also
is important-that payments to be known
as national adjustment grants on the basis

659

of a fiscal need be fixed periodically by a
board on which the provinces would be represented. That simply meant that the dominion
government would assume the responsibility
for employable unemployed, thus ensuring
uniformity of treatment for this problem from
Halifax to Vancouver; that the giving of the
corporation tax, personal income tax and
succession duties to the federal government
would bring about a uniformity of the tax
burden across the country. The commission
found that we had varying scales of income
tax in the various provinces on both corporation profits and personal incomes. The same
was truc of succession duties.
These essential recommendations of tie
commission were widely approved in the press
throughout Canada; a good deal of discussion
took place, and the recommendations were
widely supported throughout the whole
dominion.
The work of the commission was then over.
It had done its job, and I venture to say that
in our eighty years of history there has been
no more important state paper than the report
of this commission. But what was to be made
of it? Were these recommendations to be
implemented, or were they to disappear into
the li'mbo of forgotten things?
The government of that time, of which I
was a member, thought that the report of the
commission was sound and constructive, and
in January 1941 a conference with the provinces was called, to take place in this city.
Honourable senators are familiar with the
results of that conference. I think it is fair to
say that six of the provinces were in general
agreement with the recommendations of the
commission; three-Ontario, British Columbia
and Alberta-would have nothing to do with
it. I have always felt that considerations which
were not disclosed may have entered into the
decision made by each of these three provinces. It was apparent that there was no hope
of reaching an agreement on the recommendations of the commission, and for the time
being the matter was dropped.
But in April, 1941, when the budget was
brought down to the House of Commons, it
contained a provision for bringing into effect
new agreements with the provinces for the
duration of the war and one year thereafter.
Under these agreements the federal government
was to have exclusive use of corporation and
personal income taxes and, also, as I recall,
succession duties.
Hon. M-r. HAIG: No.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I believe my honourable friend is right; succession duties were out.
In return, the provinces were to secure by way
of grants from the federal government practi-

cally the amount of revenue which each had
collected through these taxes in the year 1940
or the year 1941, I have forgotten which.
In 1945 the Dominion Government submitted new proposalis to the provinces. These
proposals were not based on the recommendations of the Si-rois report. Personally I have
always regretted that the Dominion Government at that time did not make at least one
more serions effort to have the Sirois Coinmission's recommendations adopted. However.
a different line wv'as taken, and the taking of
that line has led us to the position where we
are considering a bill to ratify the agreements which the dominion has made with all
but two of the provinces.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: May I be allowed a
question? I have always understood that in
the 1941 conference three provinces were for
the agreement, three were against, and three
did not commit themselves. I understood the
honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) to say that six provinces agreed.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Thre pro;vince disagreed. and there were six who, in varying
degrees, were in agreement with the recommendation of the commission. The nev proposals were deait with this afternoon by the
leader of the opposition, a.nd I do not need
to retrace the ground he has covered. Briefly.
as a result of varions conferences, and also of
the proposals made by the Minister of Finance
a year ago, a new arrangement lias been
reached.
But in the raking of this new
arrangement the principle of fisaal need of the
provinces as recommended by the Sirois
Commission bas been abandýoned; andi tod.ay,
if all the provinces were to accept the proposal, the amount of the grants to be paid
by the federal government on the basis of
national production this year. would be
approximately 228 million dollars. A feature
of the agreements is a fixed minimum of payments, amounting in the aggregate to 206
million d'ollars for all the provinces. The
formula of national production as relatedi to
population is then brought into ply; and on
the basis of our national production for 1947,
which figure I shall give in a moment, the
payments will reacl a total, as I have stated,
of 228 millions of dollars.
Speaking to this resolution in the House
of Conmmons the otlier day, the Minister of
Finance presented, I think, a rather too rosy
picture of the benefits which would flow to
'anada if all the provinces came into this
agreement. With your permission. I will read
a paragraph from his speech. He said:
The purpose of the dominion in preparing
these proposals was to endeavour to work out
with the provinces a co-ordinated programme by

which the dominion and provincial governments
eould most effectively work together to maintain
high and expanding levels of employment and
national income such as ha7d been attained in
wartime. to provide a wide neasure of economie
and social security, and finally to give the
Canadian people a less burdensome, more efficient tax system, which indeed was a prerequisite for attaining the other objectives.
Let me say at once that there is no question
of the advantage of having one taxation
authority so far as corporation taxes, personal
income taxes and succession duties are concerned. But I cannot agree that if the provinces-I mean all the provinces-accept this
proposal, all these other benefits will follow;
and I would like to discuss that point for a
moment or two. The total amount received
from these taxes by the provinces in the last year
they levied them was, according to the statement made by the leader of the opposition
this afternoon, 117 million dollars. I thought
it was a little more.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is what Mr. Abbott
said.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Under the guaranteed
minimum arrangement the federal government
pays 206 million. It must be borne in mind
that that amount is inclusive of the old statutory subsidies, which, as I recall, amounted
for all the provinces ta something like 17
million.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Just about that.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: In any case the dominion bas been very generous with the provinces
in the offer it bas made. I have no hesitation
in saying, for reasons which I shall elaborate
in a moment, that it bas been too generous.
The total tax burden of the Canadian people
today is enormous. The commitments we have
made for federal purposes, including the service
of our debt, family allowances, old age pensions. care for our soldiers, subsidies to the
provinces, defence expenditures-which, from
the present outlook over the world, I am afraid
we shall have to increase-and other obligations xwhich the federal government bas
undertaken, will impose on the people of
Canada taxation of at least 2,000 million
dollars a year. That, honourable gentlemen, is
a very heavy burden. Remembering that the
total taxes levied for federal purposes in the
year prior to the war was around 550, million
dollars, we can see what progress we have
made in the direction of imposing additional
taxes.
It is quite truc that heavy taxation was
essential during the war, and I say here that
the financial policy of the governiment at
that tinie was an outstanding success.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

JULY 15, 1947
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: There can be no dispute about that; it is generally conceded
everywhere. Almost from the beginning of
the war the policy laid down by the goverenment was ithat, as the war progressed,
Canada would pay as much of her cost as
possible. In the waging of the most costly
war that the world has ever seen, it was a
splendid accomplishment that, at least half of
,he expense incurred by this country was paid
out of the current revenue secured by the
government. Tha-t achievement will stand as
a landmark in the history of this country.
It is now peacetime, however, and we have
to take some stock of the means by which we
are going to carry these huge burdens in the
future. If we could mainitain a national produotion or national income similar -to what
we enjoy in this year of 1947, the burden
would still be heavy but not unmanageable.
But can we expect to do that?
I have here some figures on the gross
national production of Canada which I am
sure will be of interest to the house. In 1929,
a year that was rated et that time to be
pretty good, the gross national production of
Canada was approximately five billion 750
million. In 1933, due to widespread unemployment and drought conditions in Western
Canada. our gross national production had
dropped to three and a half billion. Coming
down to the year 1938, the gross national
production was five billion and 75 million. In
1939 it was five billion 495 million; in 1940,
six billion 628 million; in 1941, eig!ht biillion
335 million, and in 1942, ten billion 296 million. It will be observed that by this itime
Canada was getting into her stride in the
matter -of war production, and as a consequence employment was high all over the
country. In 1943 the gross production of
Canada had reached a total of eleven bill-ion
124 million; and in 1944, eleven billion 771
million, the highest poinit attained in the
period I have referred to. -In 1945 ithere was
a drop to eleven billion 478 million, and the
preliminary estimate given :for 1946 is eleven
billion 129 million.
The point I wish to make is that if we can
maintain a national production of, say,
between eleven and twelve billions of dollars, the burden of debt will not be beyond
our capacity to manage. However, when we
contemplate the possibility of maintaining
such a scale of national production I think
there are some things which will give us
cause for anxiety.
National production is the total of all wages
and earnings received by individual Canadians
for their labour. Agricultural production in

661

Canada last year, if I recall the figure correctly,
amounted to almost one billion 700 million.
Can we expect to maintain such a production
in the future? I do not think we can, because
inevitably, as bas happened time and time
again in the past, high prices for agricultural
products are bound to decline.
Europe, which is now struggling back to its
feet amid many difficulties, will become an
increasing factor in the production of her own
food; indeed, she is compelled to do so
because of her lack of ability to get foreign
exchange to buy food abroad. Much the
same situation exists with respect to base
metals such as copper, zinc, lead and nickelCanada is today enjoying higher prices for
those metals than she bas ever enjoyed in the
past. She is also enjoying higher wage scales
and higher prices for the products of her
manufacturing industries. There was a great
void to be filled in goods and services, and
the filling of that void bas created a sellers'
market.
But these conditions will not continue
indefinitely. Let us look at the matter in
another way. It is quite evident that the
huge dollar credits which Canada and the
United States wisely gave to Great Britain
and other European countries are running out.
By the middle of 1948 they will certainly have
been pretty well exhausted. Only recently we
have seen the steps taken by the British Government to curtail imports and to conserve
the American dollars which they require for
food and for other purposes. Someone may
say that we have the so-called Marshall plan.
I for one fervently hope that Europe can
suggest a way to get back on its feet. We must
realize, however, that there are many hurdles
to climb before the Marshall plan becomes a
success.
Honourable senators, the point is that we
are taking a chance on the future that we
would have been wiser to avoid. This all
boils down to the elementary principle that
governs the individual in bis private business:
if I spend lavishly and make no provision
against a rainy day I shall eventually be in
trouble. I think this same sprinciple applies
to governments; and if our national income
should drop to, say, eight billion dollars, we
would certainly be in difficulties.
I sincerely hope that I am wrong, but I
feel that in all these commitments we have
assumed an extremely heavy load; one which
not only will make future tax reductions
impossible, but may lead us into unbalanced
budgets and all the evils that inevitably
follow a departure from sound public fiscal

1 cuiue baek to the point I made. Theso

of federal generosity.
This afternoon the
honourable leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.

namely, that in practice it is unsound for one
authority to raise publie money by taxes and
pass it over to another to spend.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I interrupt my honauirable friend? 1 do not want him to credit

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I w'ant to make it ecar

Hon. Mr. CRERAIR: Well, you made tho

Hon. Mr. NICOL: And the Primo Ministor
was flot the flrst one who made it.
Hon. Mr. IROBERTSON: Ho was quoting
somebody else.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Ho xvas quoting Sir
Wilfrid Laurier, I believe.
Hon. Mr. CIRERAR: At any rate, I think
the provinces which have entered into these
agreements should walk warily. I believe that
the province of Manitoba will.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I agreo withi you.
Hon. Mir. CIRER AR: I wiil ho quite frank
ndsay Ido not believo the province o
Saskatchewan wjll.
Hon. M\r. HAIG: I agree with you again.
Hon. Mr. CIRERAIR: The last budget of
tlîat province wvas by a wide margin the
largest budget ever submitted to its people.
There is nothing for us to do but to ratify
the agreements. They have been made in
good faith by the provinces with the govornnient, but I do feel that the dominion has
been too generous in the terms that it allowed.

And no clcar cinderstanding lias been reached
with tlîe provinces as to how money cao be
spent w'isely for productive pîîrposes in this
coun try.
This afternoon wo were considering the
report of the Standing Committee on lirmigration and Labour. One way in which we
couild spend money wisoly is by bringing more
people into Canada. We have got groat
resolirces, w hieha the world needs, and the
(levelopment of some of them would add to
our national income. I will tako one illustration. WThat I arn about to say now is flot a
criticism of family allowances; far from it.
The amount that the foderal govornment will
spenu1 on family allowances in 1946 and 1947
will ho, when the cost of administration is
înciuded, 500 million dollars. Let us think
of it in another term. The expenditure of
that sui would hav e built 20.000 mniles of
gond hard-surface roads in Canada. at a cost
of $25.000 a mile, and woîîld hav e trebled
and quadrupled our- tourist bus.ines.s frorn tie
United States.; and the roads woulî have.
been a distinct asset to Canada. 1 use ihat
nmerely as an illustration. and 1 repeait ihat
it is flot any criticism of family allowances.
I do say this, that. there nover xvas a time
in thehistory of 'this country when the federal
government, and thîe goverroments of the
provinces and the municipalities needed to
wateli tlîeir expenditures so closely and to
be guided by the greatest possible wvisdom in
what they do with the money tlîey take from
tlîe taxpayers' pocke-ts.
Lot me say this again: I hope that I arn
wrong, but I amn afraid that in a few ycars'
time many thîings tlîat we are doing nowand these agreoments mav ho included imong
them-will haveo to ho reconsidered i0 the

JUiLY 15, 1947
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, I want to compliment the
honourable senator fromn Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) upon his excellent speech. I have
no intention of making extended remarks at
this time, but there are one or two observations which 1 think may be worth wbile. Each
one has his own slant on big problems of this
kind. 1 entirely agree with what was said
by 'the honourable leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) about the vicious system
of one jurisdiction raising taxes and anothcr
jurisdiction expending them. The 'honourable
gentleman says he was quoting a statement
made by the Prime Minister, Mr. King, but
it by no means origina.ted wî'th the Prime
Minister: it bas been stated frequently over
the years. Some years ago I myseif published
an article in wbich I said that we should let
every tub stand on its own bottom. I repeat
that sentiment now as being most applicable
to these agreements.
Hon. Mr. LESAGE: Was it after the war
tihat the Prime Minister made the statement?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: According to 'the
honourable leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) >the statement was first made by
'the Prime Minister in 1929; but, as Isay,
it bas been made at various times over
the years. It is in line witb one of the flrst
tboughts that would strike one's mind wben
a systemn such as underlies these agreements
is proposed. It is not se, mucb that the
systemn make-s for extravagance in the jurisdiction that spends, but it is bad in principle.
It is ahl wrong, it is cock-eyed, for onc jurisdiction to raise ýtaxes and another ta spend
thein, and that system is bound ta work badly
and bring about evil resuits.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: Do municipal sebool
boardis not follow that principle?
Han. Mr. NICOL: Not in Quebec.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: In Ontario thý
sebool boards assume the respansibility of
raising taxes froa the very people who vote
members of the board into office.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Do the boards
get a subsidy fram the province?
Hon. Mr. RiOEBUCK: Yes, and that may
be wrong.
Hon. Mr. LE.SAGE: Does your premier
follow the principle you are advocating? Has
he nit raised gasoline taxes lately?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The premier of
Ontario?
Hon. Mr. LESAGE: Yes.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Please do not cal
him, my premier.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I suppose it is very
difficuit to hew consistently to the line of
general principles. No doubt the raising of
money frein the province at large and givinr
it to local sehool boards ta expend is a system
that has its evil features. It probably would
be better if each board werc able to raise
enough money to carry on its awn work; but
of course we run inta the samne situation
among school boards that we do among provines: some boards could not raise enough
money to educate the children resident within
their localities, and in those cases it is necessary that contributions be made fromn other
sources. You cannot always hew strictly u)
the line, but nevertheless the principle standî
that, as 1 expressed it, it is wise to let everv
tub stand on its awn bottom.
But there is something more to this genera!
picture than just a broad statement of
general principle, and I should like to eaul
attention to two phases in particular. First,
there is the matter which the honourable
leader of the opposition (Han. Mr. Haig)
stressed. This business of raising money out
of the generai taxes of Canada and distr'buting it in varying amounts to different provinces means that one locality pays while
another locality spends; that each province
does not get just what it pays; and so some
provinces lean on others, and we have the
struggle wh-ich bas been described, and the
spectacle of one part of the country trying
to grab something fromn another.
The taxation methods employed by the
provinces are not the samne as those used by
the dominion. This difference is very important. At the time of Confederation it was
arranged that the provinces should raise

money for local purposes by direct taxation,
which meapt

such means

as the polI tax.

Income tax was flot considered; when the
legislators talked of direct taxation they had
in mind the raising of money fromn the natural

resources of the provinces.
taxation assigned ta municipalities was a levy
on real estate. This consisted of twa divisions:

first, a levy upon the bouse, which is constructed by human hands; and second, a levy

an the land valuation created by the coimmunity. Another source of public revenue
visualizcd by the Fathers of Canfederation
was the vast tracts of the then unappropriated
farming, mining and lumbering areas. They
saw this as a source of revenue sufficient ta.
enable the provinces to carry on with the ai

664

SENATE

of the smnall bonuses they were given at that
time. Indirect taxation had to do almost
entirely xvjth customs tariffs.
What has happened in the interval since
coiifedei-ation? In the first place, trade grew
and customs duties vastly increased, and the
revenue of the dominion from that source
exptanded. The dominion later adopted the
income tax method of raising millions of
dollars.
But what bas happened to the provinces
meanwhile? The goverrnents of the provinces, in return for patronage have given away
publie reu,,otre. in a magoificent manner. This
is nohing new. In Lord Durham's report we
find that the goveroment, of that day handed
out to its political favourites large sections
of the public clomain in return for the merest
trifles, and in addition almost entirely
exempted tbem from taxation. Since then the
samne system. though in not quite s0 extreme
a foi-n. las been carried on by ail the provines. Today the natural resources in the
baods of the provinces have been reduced to
a minimum, and almost the whole of Nature's
gifts are in the hands of private owners wbo
objeet strongly to handing over for public
purposes any part of the present value of
these gifts, regardlcss of whether that value
was created bv themselves or not. Rather
than have the uopopular direct levy of a tax
upon land values. tbey prefer to bave the
taxpayers subjected to indirect taxation by
the dominion, whicb plueks the fowl without
it knowiog that it is losing its feathers.
That is the realistic view of tbe situation
today. The pirovinces could raise the necessary revenues. by simply taking the value the
communitv lias created and applving direct
taxation. Tbev would then not need to come
to the dominion for band-outs. The talk of
the provinces being hankrupt is aIl tommyrot, for while an ' land values remain uoabsorbed into the publie treasiîry they cannot
be bankrupt.
I beliex e tha.t we should consider more trhan
anything else the incidence of taxation and
the effeet of the step,, we are taking. We are
saddling upo-n tîme Dominion of Canada to a
large extent the responsibility of supporting
hoth the federal and the provincial goveroment,, by means of indirect taxation, sucli as
arc coriploveil in tbe dominion jurisdicti on,
inc;ttad of taking advantage of the direct
foi'm- of taxation emploved in the provincial
j un-ýdiv tion.
Tue lîonouiiable member for Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) lîa -. id tlîat these arrangements,
a
which have been dcx ised with ail our skill,
will now have to be revised. I hope that in

providýing for taxation, its incidents and results,
succeedin-g generations will bave a good deal
more wisdoma than we have shown. I believe
that some wisdoma is seeping into the public
mind; but at the moment we in this house
can do nothing but pass the agreements. We
sbould analyse thema as beet we can, find out
the real truth about them, and wait for a
better day.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Perhaps I may say
a word on two in explanation of the amnendment anod the ptîrpose of it. Jo the committee's

JTJLY 15, 1947
report and in the bill are provisiQns to change
the Civil Service Act in the matter of age of
rctirernent of civil servants. In the past, comnpuisory retirement bas corne at the age of 70
and permissive retirempnt at the age of 65.
When a civil servant attains the age of 65
he is perrnitted, aithougb bis heaith may he
perfect, to retire on fuli pension. When he
arrives at the ae of 70 hae must retire,' unless
of course, for certain reasons and under
special circumstances, this requirement is set
aside by order in council, as happened frequently during the crisis of the war. The bill
which is bafore the house wiil reduce those
ages and permit the civil servant to retire at
60, if hae should so desire, and force him to
retire at the ae of 65.
My submission, honourable senators, is that
no good case bas been made out for this
change. I submit that a man of 60, in the
work done by the civil service, is in his
prime; ha is absolutely at the peak of his
powers; and it is unfair to the Dominion of
Canada, which bas given him the opportunity
ta gain his experience, and probably spent
rnoney in the process, to dispense with his
services at that age. I suppose that sorne of
those who are iistening to me have reached
the age of 60; at laast, as a friend ramarks, it
is impending; others are approaching it: and
if that is so, 1 arn sure you realize that your
powers today are greater than they ever were
before. Some of you may have gona further,
and if so I invite you to ask yourse]ves what
would have happened in your career if at the
age of 60 you bad retired; yes, or if at the age
of 65 you had been forced to retire. I say
it is flot fair to the public, wbich employs
these men to train them and give thern their
experience, aliow tbern to develop tbeir powers,
and then actually encourage tbcm to leave the
public service, it rnay be to engage in private
business on their own accotant, or to go fishing, at 60 years of age.
To me the mere thought of such a tbing is
outrageous. These men are at the beight of
their usefuiness, and it is flot in the public
intarest ta encourage thern to loaf. It is true
that any civil servant can leave at any tirne
by resigning; but in this legîslation we are
actually paying birn ta loaf; we give birn a
pension and encourage birn to step out of public service cither ta serve bis own interest or
to laze the rest of bis life.
As for carnpulsory retirernent at 65, I know
of notbing %ocruel as to take a man out of
an activity in wbich hie bas been engaged
practically ail bis life, and tell him, wbile be
is stili in excellent bealtb, "Fromn this tirne
forward your time ie of no value; you are

tbrougb; and ail you bave ta do now is ta
await the eall*of the underteker.".' I suppose
everyone can recali out of bis own experience
tha case of sorne person wbo bas been active
and bas then been retired: you have seen sncb
q one, as I bave, walking the streets, wondering wbat he is going to do witb bis time. I
pity the man in that situation. I bave sean
men who, having left farms wbere tbey worked
bard ail their lives, and getbered up a srnali
provision for thair maintenance, retired to
town, and died within two years. because no
longer bound to the judgment of long ago:
"In the sweat of tby face shall thon eat
bread." It is fia kindness to take a man
from bis iife's work. If I may risk another
quotation, I would rernind the bouse of the
words of the Preaeier: "Wberefore I parkive that there is nothing better. tban tbat

a man should rejoice in bis own works; for
that is bis portion."
But the subjeet is a vary serious -one. Tbe
cruellest .thing yon can do is to deprive a
man of the opportnnity of using bis ereative
ability; ta tel hi-m that, "From. nowv on you
are through."
And it is not necessary ta lower the retirement age frorn 70 ta 65. Tbe provision wbicb
fixes the ege at 70 bas been in existence for
many years, and in the interval medicai
science and. the knowladge of rigbt living
bave advanced. Today we kaow how ta maintain aur heaith better than did our fethers
and grandfathers, and the resuit is that men
are living longer and are retaining their
facuitias ta an older age.

Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mn~ ROEBUCK: Thank you. Wra,
should ha raising instead of lowering the age
at wbicb people are put on the sheif. 1 tbink
this meastire is inadvîsabie and 1 arn strongly
opposed to it. It is not in the public interest
ta lower the compulsory retirement age to
sixty-five, and it is a cruel tbing ta impose
retirernt upon people in the sixty-five ta
seventy-years class. In comrnittee it was said
that the retirernent of the old-er men made
possible promotion ail down the line; in other
words, that the young men would pusb tha
older men out of their jobs. That is absoiuteiy repugnant, to rny thinking. Moreover

how~ quickly time goes *by and how, in due

I speak, the words of Macbeth pass throughi
mvy mind, "This even-handed justice comrnends the ingredienýts of our poison'd chalice
to otîr lips". Those are words that youinger
men sbould take to heart when con-sidering
this measure. I arn opposed to it on ail
grounds, and if in their wisdom honourable
senators see fit to go into committee, I sýhall
move that we amend tlic bill so as to restore
the retiremnent ages to those now pros ided in
tlie statute. Under the presenit act the coinpulsory retirement age is seventy years; and
the pelînissiv e retirenient age is sixty-five.
The îiroposal is to lower ibese ages respeetivelv to sixty-five and sixty. I do not agree
with tbat.
Hon. WISHART
McL. ROBERTSON:
ilonourable senators, one of my greatest diffieculties in supporting government legislation
arises from the faet that from timie to time il
is subjected to attacks from eloquent opponents wvho seek to attach to the subject ani
importance wbich, on cooler reflection, would
seem entirely unnecessary or' quite in cxcess
of what, was warranted.
The present act empowers the Governor in
Council to grant a superannuation allowance
to a contributor who at the date of bis retirement bas attained the age of sixty-five years.
The proposed amendment will reduce this age
to sixîv years. This proposal is really nothinig
non. The lowering of the retirement age from
sixty-ffi'e to sixty was recommended by the
parliamentary comrnittee in 1939. It was also
recomrnended by the Royal Commission on
Administrative Classifications in the Public
Service, and by the Civil Service Superannuatien Cornmittee. It is believed that the option
of rctirement at age sixty will resoît in greater
,fficiecy in thic public service by enabling
departments to effeet needed reorganization
in some cases through rptirement of a contributor wvbo lias reached age 60, and the retirement
atf an earlier agýe of individuals who~e efficiency
andi intorest in their ernployment have declined.
Tîte goveroiment b, of the opinion that the
pt'opSoed change in the Act will result, in
gatrefficiency in tlie public service and
enahle certain deparîments to be reorganized.
Undor 'tbe bill if for one leasen or anotbcî a
"'an retires beforc sixty-five, wbether voluntraily or at the suiggestion of the department
for wbîcb lie mvorks, lie will net be tbroe n out,
as it were. with only bis contribution plus
accrued interest, and bace a considerable
arnoint of superannuation benefits that he
nould have receiv cd by remaining in service
-until sixty-five.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Might, I ask the honourable senator a question? I may have misunderstood the honourable senater from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), but I tbought he
said that this bill provides for compulsory
retirement at sixty-five as well as the voluntary retirement age of sixty.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: As I understand
the matter, under the present law if a person
retires before he reaches the age of sixty-five
lie will nlot receive aniy superannuation
henefits.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: This bill lowers
tbe permissive age from sixty-five teo sixty.
ln the matter of the compul.ory retirement
age, I assume the bonourable senator ftrm
is
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
Toronto-Trinity
right wbien ho savs that it is lowered frýom
seventy to sixty-fiî e. He bas painted a vivid
pictuýre of people beinýg thrown out of work,
against tbeir will while still et thic beiglit
of tbeir power. No one will dispute that there
is a marked differen-ce between people with
respect te efficiency and desire to stay on the
job. Generally speaking, the experience bas
been that there is ne great rush to retire voliîntarily, either at sixty-five years, as lias been
permissible in later years, or at sixtv. which I
understand Ivas the age of volunt.irv retirement seine considerablc timc ago. The rcason
is obvious. If a man retires at the carlier age
hoe suifera, under tbe best of circumistances. a
reductien of approxinuitelY tliictv per cent in
bis income. Wbien an enîpîcyee Ns, as my
bioneurable friend, (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) puIs it,
at the heigbt of bis intellect andI efficieney, and
desirous of staying on the job, 1 tbink tlîat in
practice tlie dopartmcent is anxi-ous te bave him
continue in his position. As 1 understand it,
aIl that the bill does is toe nable an indix idual
,who x oluntarîx* rtires; at an earlior age than
sixty-five te receix e bis fuîll superannuation,
boefits. and net merelv -wbit hoe lias contributed plus interest.
It is foIt that wlîile the proposed lowering of
the retiringl qge w-ould affect a relatix ely small
number of peii.ons it would miteriallh improve
tbe service and indoed hcocf great benefit te
such individuals a.s frei time te time become
elig-ible te avail themselx es cf it. Iu bas been
esuimated that. w itb a pavyroll of 60 million
dollars, the extra cost arising from tlie change
would ho abeut S10.000.
No doubt manv hionourable menibers are
botter infermoul on this subject thon I arn. but
1 repeat tbat this lowering of the' rcticing, age
lias been recemniended bY a parliamentary
cemmittre.e a royal commis.sion, and the Civil
Serv ice Superannuation Conmittee. The gev-

JUILY 15, 1947
ernment and the various departmnents feel that
it will work no injustice to anyone. but thiat
it will bene-fit some individuals and, in certain
cases, lay the basis for a departmental reorganization satisfactory to aIl parties concerned.
'rhere is a wide difference between sucli
information as 1 have and the picture painted
bY my honourable friend from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). So far as I arn
avware there has been no opposition by civil
servants to the proposed change. I should
think that in these circumstances we would
flot undertake to vary the relevant clause of
the bill without first calling witnesses before
a committee and making a careful survey of
the situation; and I submit that is altogether
impractical just now, with prorogation a pos8ibility for tomnorrow.
I oppose the amendment of the honourable
gentleman fromn Toronto-Trinity.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: Can the honourable
leader inform the house what attitude the
Civil Sei-vice Association has taken?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I arn unable to
answer that question.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators. to my mind the leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) and the senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) are
arguing on different points. So far as I personally amn concerned I amn willing to let*any
civil servant who se desires to retire when hie
or shie reaches the age of sixty. Let us be
clear about this. If that is aIl the bill does
in this regard, I amn not opposed to it, but I
amn afraid that the senator from TorontoTrinity is right and that the bill does more
than that. In the circurnstances I would ask
permission to adjourn ;ie debate until tomorrow morning se that I rnay have time to
study the legal meaning of the phraseology
used in the bill. As I see it new, it appears
that the bill v*ouId compel every civil servant
to retire at the age of sixty-five, and I object
to that.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
friend thinks that the bill reduces the coinpulsory retiring age frem seeventy to sixty-five?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON. I arn quite prepared to take the word of the honourable
senator fromn Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) on that.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is a feature 1 do
not hike. For some months the Board of
Transport Commissioners for Canada has
been having hearings into the application of

667

ail! Canadian railroads for an increase of 30
per cent in freight rates. No one would ever
charge our big railroad corporations with
engaging pink-tea artists to represent themi at
such important hearings, and I want the house
to know that the lawyer employed as chief
counsel for the railways has passed his
eight.ieth birthday.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: May 1 make an
interjection? Gladetone conducted flie Midlothian campaign aft.er he was eiglity.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: 1 knýow ithat, but let us
get back nearer hiome. The Board of Transport Commissioners has field hearings on this
important case ail ýover Canada and it has
now resumed tihern riglit here in Ottawa; and
the mnan who wi11appear again next Monday
as chief counsel for the railroad corporations
lias passed his eightieth birthday. And, believe
me, he is "some" counsel. If a man or woman
wants to retire fromn the civil service at sixty
years of age, I arn ail for it, 'but I amn opposed
to giving the government power to disrniss
people at sixty-five. Before we vote I want
to know what the bill does mean. The honourable leader thinks that retirement at sixtyfive would ha only permissive.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I did not say
that.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But you were not sure.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I draw attention of honourable senators to circumstances
wich might supersede the provisions of this
act or any obhier a.ct. It seems to me the
are -two points to, be kept in mind. The bill
provides for permissive retirement at sixty
and compulsory retirement fft sixty-five.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I arn afraid so.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: But what would
happen in the case of individual civil servants
who are indispensable .in their positions and
are specially requeqted by the goveraýment to
continue working afiter sixty-five?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: They would have to get
out at si3oty-five.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Do tlhey have to get
out at seventy now?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yoe.
H:on. Mr. LAMBERT: I know, as does rny
honourable friand, orf innumerable cases ivhere
civil servants have been retained beyond
seventy.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: Frein year to year.
Hon,. Mr. LAMBERT: Yes.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. MURDOCE: We shall have
before us tomorrow a bill to permit one of
the members of the Board of Transport Commissioners to continue in office although be
is now seventy-five.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I cen give a betiter
instance than that.* As we ail «know, in two
or tihree sessions after the former Chief
Justice of Canada bcd reacbed his seventyfifth year wve 'passed, a bill extending bis terrm
of office. He finally retired some years ago,
*ct the cge of seventy-eigbt, and be is stihl
going strong.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: Tliese are not typicai
cases.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: They are pretty typical.
I bave been in this house for quite c few
years now, and I kuow that soîne people
wbom 1 see bere tonight would not be present
if senators were compelled to retire ct
sixty-five.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is my bonourabl,.
friend looking ct me?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, I was not looking- et
my bonourable friend et cli. It is principclly
the younger members who are staying hemc
until the session ends; some of tHie older onr-ý
bave gone home.
I move cdjouinment of the debate until
tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: Before tbe motion
is put, 1 would like to ccca up a point mentioned by tbe bonourable leader on this side
(Hon. Mr. Haig). Under the present law tbe
compulsory retirement age for civil servants
is sixty-five, but tbirty days before any civil
servant recbes that cge the deputy minister
of tbe department mcy apply to tbe Governor
in Council for permission to retcin the
employee in the service.
The lion. tbe SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, there is a motion before the bousýe
for adjouroment of tbe debate.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: 1 cm perfectly
willing to postpone my remarks until tomorrow, but it would save time if I were permitted to make a brief statement to clear Up
tbe point raised by the bonourable leader on
this side (Hon. Mr. Haig). If there is any
objection, I will postpone my remarks until
tomorrow.
The Hon. tbe SPEAKER: Tbe honotîrable
senator may proceed witb the consent of the
Sena te.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: Under thris bill
eompulsory retirement will be et sixty-flve, but,
qin the case of a man wvlo is pbysically fit. and
whbo wislies to continue, the depiity' minister

of bis depcrtment may if be secs fit, befoce the
date of retirement, make application to the
Governor in Couneil to continue the man's
services, and that man may be kept on for a

Hon. Mi. MURDO'CK: Is that on a rompulsocy basis?

BROýADCASTING BILL

SECOND

READING

Hon. GRAY TURGEON (for Hon. Mc.
Robertson) moved tbe second reading of Bill
453, an .Xct to amend the Canadian Broad(a-ýting Act, 1936.
He ,.aid: Honourable ..cnators. this is a
simple bill, notwithstanding the fart that it
provoked ronýidecrable irrelevant di:sctision in
bhe othter lieuse witb i-epect to the relationship betw'een tbe Canadien Broadcasting
Corporation ind pri\ ete bioadcasting stations.
The bill does not solve env of those problems
Byý ibis
and it deus not aggravate tbern.
proposetl meastre tbe revenue of the Canaihian Broadcasting Corporation will be inThe corporation wvil1 rccone tbe
crea.,ed.
total arnount collected bY' wev of licence fees
foir privately owned radios. and licences to
private broadesting stations..
As bonourable senators know, under existing
lcgislation the Canadien Broadcasting Corporation rcecves radio licece fees le-a 35 cents
perc licencc. the cost of collection wbich is
re tained bv the Departmoent of Transport for
perforiuîg the collect ion servitee. ln future
thbs witl not bu charged agaio.4 the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation, but will be borne
in- the Dopartinent of Trans7port.
It was stated in the Hou-e of Gommons
thtat the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
in its operations for tlic current -,.ear faced
at deficit of $265.000. It is estimated that tbis
mca. uie will inrreasc the revenue of the corpot ation approximately $500.000.

JUILY 15, 1947
It is nlot necessary to refer in detail te the
general increase in cost of operation. I simply
lay beforje the bouse the proposed amendment
ta the act, and give the reamous for it.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, I do not propose to speak on the bll
itself, but may I say that this is one measure
that rhould have been introduced in this house
at the commencement of the session. We
could have investigated the whale dispute
between the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the private broadeasting stations.
I have no great knowledge of the subi ect of
radio broadcasting, but I have always feit
that one broadcasting body which is in competition with other stations shauld not be in
a position to control them. I do not propose
to raise that question now; but it is my belief
that at the beginning of the session this house
should have conducted an investigation in
that field. Whether the House of Commons
chose to listen ta us or not, we coud have
reported the true situation ta the people of
Canada. As it is, I defy anybody ta follow
intelligently the recent discussion in another
place.
I arn quite willing that the motion be carried
on division.
The motion was agreed ta, and the bill was
read the second time, on division.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, when shall the bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Now.

It is proposed tealnter the provision so that
a saldier, if bis diisability prevents him from
cantinuing bis military career, will bie eligible
for pension regard]ess of whether or not lie is
able ta support himself in some other occupation. The change will affect some thirty-ix
disabled soldiers who at present are unable
ta get their pensions. The scale of pension
remains uncbnnged, at the rate of one-fiftieth
af the soldier's average pay and allowances
over the previaus six years multiplied by the
number af years af bis service.
The motion was ngreed ta, and the bill was
:ead the second time.

He said: HanouraibIe senators, this subject

sO important that I believe I should offer a
few wordis of exphnn.stion. I do not think
that this is the proper tinte ta enter into any
de.tniled examination of the prabhems which
were referred ta aur joint committee; but it
was very ehear fromn the beginning that it wil
lie impassible for us at the present session ta
do mare than work af n purehy preparatory
nature. The members designated *hy the
Senate ta serve on the committee were
appointed on June 3. We have simply -laid the
faundation of a further study of these very
important questions, and aur practical conclusion is te recommend 1that early next ses-

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved second
reading of Bill 456, an act ta amend the
Militia 'Pension Act (Disablement Pension).
He said: HonourabIe senators, the purpose
of this 'bill is ta correct a drafting error in the
amend'ment made ta the Militin Pension Act
in 1946, and which discrirninated. against certain disabled soIdiers ini the matter of pension
riglits. As the net is at presei4t drnfted it provides that a soldier ta be eligible for pension
must have served for more than ten years,
and been a contributor ta the pension fund,
and he must bave been rendered incapable of
pursuing continuous gainful employment. This
provision bas not only been found impractical
fromn an administrative point of view, but is
regarded ns wrong in principle.

sion the committee be ýappointed again to
resume consideration of the *task contained, in
the terras of the order of reference.
Our inquiries shouli have covered tbree
points: first, oui obligations in the matter of
human rigbts and fundamental frcedoms under
the charter of the United Nations; second,
the legal and constitutional situation in
Canada witbi respect to suoli rights; third,
the steps which it migbt be advisable to take
for the purpose of preserving in this country
siîch rigbts and freed.omas.
Aýn officer from the Dcpartment of External
Affaiîs gave evidence before our committee
respecting our obligations as a member of the
UT nited Nations; the director of the division
of human rights, department of social affairs
of the United Nations, gave us information
concerning the activities of the United Nations
in tbis matter of humnan rights; and the
Dcputy Minister of Juistice wvas heard in
regard to the l-egal an(l constitutional position in Canada.
A very in teresting documentation was collected. Invitations were sent to the attorneysgeneral of the provinces, and also to the bead,,
of eachi of our iaw faculties, to express their
viewsv on the suhj ect of a federal bill of
rigb ts.
The work already donc wilI, I trust, be
usefiîl; but as I said. it wvas impossible to do
more in the present session.
I believe tuat ail of us have faith in ýhuman
righits and fondamental freecloms, and regard
this land of ours as essentially a land of
liberty. We are anxious to show the world
that we wvant te cooperate witb bumanity at

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of the fourth report of the Joint Committee

Hon. L. M. GOUIN rnoved concurrence in

He saidi: Honourable senators, I have only
a few words te add. Special reference wvas

It is entitled

CRIMINAL CODE BILL
CONCURRENCE IN CONFERENCE
AMENDMENTS

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Hanourable
senatars, a message lias been received from
the House of Coxnmons, in the fallowing
words:
That a message be sent ta the Senate ta acquaint Their Honours that tbe amendments
agreed to in the Free Conference with the Senate
ta Bill 364, An Act ta amend the Criminal Code,
have been agreed ta.

The aniendînents wcre read by the Clerk as
Jollows:
Amendments agreed ta in the free conference
of the managers of the Senate and tlie Hanse
of Commons in respect ta Bill 364, an Act ta
amend the Criminal Code:
1. Delete amsndment number two of tlie Senate and substitute the following tberefor:
"2. Delete ail tlie words in Section 2221B
after the word "ans", in line twenty-four, ta
and inclusive of the word "otherwise" in lins
twenty-eiglit and substitute tbe following:
"not being in a dwelling bouse, wbo causes a
disturbance in or near any street, road, higliway, restaurant, railway station, public library, tavero, billiard hall, theatre, sbap or
other place ta wbidh members of the public
are admitted, wliether as a matter of riglit or
otlierwise."
2. Delete amendment number fiffeen of the
Senate and substitute the following therefor:
"15. Delets paragrapli (d) of clause 7, on
page 3, lines twenty-four ta twenty-eigbt inclusive, and substitute the following:
" (d) if lie uses or lias upon bis persan
any weapon during or at the time of the
commission or attempted commission hy bim
of any of the affences in this section mentionsd or the fliglit of the offender upon
thie commission or attempted commission
thereof, and deatb ensues as a canequence
of its use."
Hon. ELIE BEAUREGARD moved concurrence in the amendments.
Hie said: Honourable senators, in asking
the house ta cancur in the amendments agreed
ta in the conference of the managers of the
Senate and the bouse of Commons in respect
to Bill 364, intituled, "An Act ta amend the
Criminal Code", 1 wish ta say a few words
in order ta acquaint the members of the
bouse witb tbe meaning of these amendments.
The amendments ta Bill 364 which were
submitted by the Senate Standing Cornmittee on Banking and Commerce may lie

found in the Minutes of the Proceedings of

the &enate of Canada, No. 54, of July 10. 0f
these amendments, thirty-two in number,
more than fifteen were of a very mincir nature.
However, the House of Commons did flot
and
fifteenth
the
second
agree
with
amendments.
I do flot need to say mucli about the
change in the Senate's second amendment,
because it leaves that amendment very much
as it was. The object of introducing the
words "dwelling house"ý-whieh was agreed ta
by the representative of the Department of
Justice-was ta make it clear that one who
sang or whistled in his house would flot lie
looked upon as a criminal nuisance. The chairman was of the opinion that this already was
the fact, and that the Senate merely wanted to
make it clear.
As to Senate amendment No. 15, which is
to lie found in the Minutes of the Proceedings
of July 10, the change is more important than
the first one. Section 7 of Bill 3M4 as presented ta the Senate, reads as follows:
Section two hundred and sixty of the said Act
is further amended by înserting immediately
after paragrapli (c) thereof, the fo]lowing:
"(d) if lie uses any weapon for the purpose
of facilitating the commission of any of the
offences in this section mentioned, or the flight
of the offender upon the commission or attsmpted
commission thereof, and death ensues as a consequence of such use."
The offences mentioned in section 260 are
murder, rape, forcible abiduction and so on.
The Senate committee recommended the
deletion of paragraph (d) of clause 7 and the
substitution of a new paragraph (d) which
reads:
(d) if hie uses or lias in his possession any
weapon and deatb ensues as a consequence of
its use.
The House of Commons would not agree ta
this amendment, and the Managers at the
Free Conference drafted an entirely new
paragraph which is a compromise betweeu the
original text and that offered by the Senate.
1 think the new paragraph is a change for the
better, because the words "has in his passession", in the Senate's amendment, miglit resuit
in the conviction of a persan who had a
weapon somewbere among bis belongings, but
not upon bis persan, at the time of the comnmission or attempted commission of an offence.
The proposed new paragrapli reads:
(d) if lie uses or bas upon bis persan any
weapon during or at the time of thes commission
or attsmpted commission by liim of any of the
offences in this section msntioned or the fliglit
of tlie offender upon the commission or attempted commission tliereof, and deatli ensues as
a consequence of its use.

SENATE
That definition covers, as we say, the four
corners of the offence. If death ensued as a
consequence of the use of a weapon, the
Crown would have to prove that the accused
used the weapon or had it upon his person
during or at the time of the commission or
attempted commission by him of an offence
under the section.
I may say that this amendment conforms
to a suggestion by the Attorney General of
Ontario. It appears that in that province
some accused person or persons escaped conviction, upon a charge of murder, because the
Crown was not able to prove that the weapon
that case it was a revolver-had been
-in
used by the accused. The house can understand -how difficult it might be in some cases
to prove the use of a weapon by an accused
person when onlv two persons were present at
the time of its uc and the death of one of
thern ensued as a consequence of its use.
Hon. JACOB NICOL: Honourable senators, I was present at the committee when
this clause was discussed and we were told
what the chairman of the committee (Hon.
Mr. Beauregard) has just stated, that the
amendment was intended to prevent the recurrence of a situation that arose in the criminal
courts of Ontario. It seems to me that the
amendment is therefore an attempt to make
a general law to provide for a particular case.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, no.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: That is a dangerous
thing to do. What improvement will there
be in the law if this proposed change is made?
The new clause makes it a crime for anyone to
have upon his person any wea.pon at the time
he committed or attempted to commit an
offence, but the idea is not followed up. The
words of the clause are:
-if he uses or has upon his person any weapon
during or at the time of the commission or
attempted commission by him of any of the
offences in this section mentioned or the flight
of the offender upon the commission or attempted commission thereof, and death ensues
as a consequence of its use.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: You have to look at the
other part of the section; the amendment has
to be considered with the section as it
originally stood.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: I do not think an offence
can be created that way, even if it is considered with the section of the code. My
understanding of the amendment is that if a
weapon is used and death ensues the accused
person would be tried for murder and could
be given the death penalty. Am I to understand that if a man takes part in a hold up or
robbery in which no weapon is used but in
which the victim is killed. that man is to be
tried for murder?

Hon. Mr. HAIG: The amendment does not
say that.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: If it does not mean that
why is it put in?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, may
I explain the purpose of the amendment in
this way: Let us suppose that I, having a gun
in my pocket, go into a corner grocery store
along witb the honourable. senator from
Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Beauregard) and the
honourable senator from Shelburne (Hon. Mr.
Robertson). and the proprietor resists; and
that when we go out the proprietor is deadHon. Mr. NICOL: Then you must have
used the gun.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: One of the three of us
must have used it, and under this amendment we may all be clarged with murder.
May I say that when the Managers on
behalf of the Senate met in conference with
inembers of the other bouse, it was quite
readily agreed that the amendments as suggested by the Senate were along the right
lines. It is true that the wording of amendment No. 2-which provides that if one causes
a row in his own house one shiall not be
charged with causing a disturbance-was
improved, and that amendment No. 2 was
redrafted by the Minister of Justice, the
Deputy Minister of Justice and the Law
Clerk of the Senate in the presence of the
Managers. We explained what we were trying
to accomplish. We said that if two, three or
six men went in to rob G grocery store-one
of theni having a gun in his pocket-and the
proprietor was dead when they left, that would
constitute the offence of murder. That is the
meaning of this amendment.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: But the gun had been
used.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Quite true. The grocer
would not have been killed if it had not been
used. The Crown does not have to prove that
the accused made use of the gun.
Hon. Mr. BISHOP: It
case of suicide.

may have been a

Hon. Mr. HAIG: How can the Crown prove
that an accused man used, a gun when the
victim is dead? We have to do something to
stop the epidemic of robberies in small stores.
Let me give an illustration of an incident that
occurred in the city of Winnipeg. About two
and a half years ago three young men entered
the North End Branch of the Canadian Bank
of Commerce. One of then had a gun in his
pocket. They said: "This is a hold-up! We
want the money." The accountant replied:
"Oh, no, there will be no hold-up here," and

JULY 16, 1947
he made a run for the men, whereupon one of
them pulled a gun and shot the accountant.
Under the new section those robbers, would be
charged with murder.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: It would be murder
under the act as it now stands.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, it was held to be
manslaughter.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Had the jury done its
duty it would have been murder.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The use of the gun was
not premeditated. The court sentenced those
young fellows to ten ycars each.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: That is a wrong verdict.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Why should a scalawag
be allowed to go around with a gun in his
pocket? He would not carry it unless he
intended to make use of it. Nothing could be
plainer than that. It is his intention to use
the gun if an emergency arises. In those
circumstances we say that the offence is no
longer manslaughter but murder. There are
a lot of old people running small stores, and
even in my city, where the people are very
well behaved, there are hold-ups every day
or so. The situation must be bad in the rest
of Canada when Winnipeg is so afflicted.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: The lionourable senator
should move from there.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The committee had very
fine cooperation from members of the House
of Commons: they appreciated our point of
view; and one of them, whose name I will
not mention, supported our am'endments even
more strongly than we did.
Hon. ARTHLTR W. ROEBUCK: In drawing amendments to the Criminal Code it is
sometimes dangerous to take advice from law
enforcement officers. It is the tendency of
these officials not to take any risks of a
criminal escaping, and they may lose sight
of the need, of protecting the innocent; their
attitude is that he must take his chances.
In matters of law enforcement the real
object to be aimed at is certainty of detection
rather than severity of punishment. There are
three conditions in this clause:- first, that the
accused has upon his person a weapon during
or at the time of the commission or attempted
commission by him of any of the offences
mentioned in this section, or the flight of the
offender; the second is, that at the time he
is captured he has in his possession-probably
in his pocket-a weapon, and somebody has
loest his life; and the third is, that the loss
of life is the consequence of the use of that
83168-43

weapon. This possibility occurs to me: three
men-I do not like to name the same ones
that my honourable friend djidHon. Mr. HAIG: At least, I joined them.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Oh, yes. The position in which the honourable senator put himself seemed to me a little incongruous. Three
men undertake a hold-up; one of them has a
revolver in his pocket; a man is shot and
killed; a flight takes place, and the man Who
originally had the revolver in his pocket and
who used it slips it into the pocket of one of
the other men. That other man would be
presumed guilty of murder.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: All of them are guilty.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That was the old
law-if that is what you are relying on-that
when men undertake to commit an offence,
and death ensues, it is murder. That is my
understand-ing of the Criminal Code as it
stands. I notice that two of my lawyer friends
nod their heads. If that be the case, if that
is the principle relied on, this amendment is
not necessary. But if reliance is to be put
on the principle set forth in 'the elause, there
is possibility of danger in its application,
because it is provided that if at any time
during the commission or attempted commission of a crime, or the flight, the weapon by
which a death was caused is found in the
possession of a person, he is to be held guilty
of murder. That is going a little far.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: May I add a
word, since it was L who gave the explanation
of this bill in the first place? Let us get back
to the basic principle of this section. As the
law stands-without giving effect to the
amendment-if a number of people embark on
armed robbery, and as a result a person is
killed, the Code defines that killing as murder.
That is, a person may be charged with murder.
But there is a perfectly good defence which
any person in that band of armed roblbers may
raise. He may say: "When I set out with
that group to commit that robbery I did not
intend to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the
victim who was killed." If he raises that as a
defence, the trial judge must, as a matter of
law, put that theory to the jury; and time
after time, though the circumstances were
such as deprived the plea of any merit, the
judge has put that contention of the defence
to the jury and the jury has found the accused
not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.
My personal views on this matter were
expressed here when I was explaining the bill
on second reading. I said that so far as I

REVISED
EDITION

674

SENATE

was concerned the law could nlot be made
too sovore in deaiing witlh cases of people
putting themselvcs in possession of deathdealing woapons and goinig out to commit a
robbery in the course of whicbi, for whatever
reason, an innocent victirn is killed as a
resuit of the use of one of these weapons.
Thiat sbould be the law; under those circumstances the kiIiing is murder, and the defence
should not be entitled to raise the question
of intent. In other wordr., they should nlot be
able to plead that thero was no intent to kili
the deceased, but that in the oxcitement of
trying to get away, or because of resistance
offered by the victirn, a gun was in some
fashion discharged. 1 say that a person who
engages in tbe business of defying tbe Iaw
should nlot be ableo b submit to a jury,
througli the medium of the judge, the question of bis motive and bis intont wben he
wvent out to do that job. The purpose of this
amcndmcnt is to ensure that the question of
intenit li
whichi 1 ruan intent to infliet
griev ous bodily biarm-is nt raised by an
accused person tinder the circumstances I
bave describod. I amn enphati ially in favour
of the amnendment.
Hon. Mr. DA\'IEý;: May 1 ask the honourable senator what meaning is attached to "the
flight of tbe offondor' thiat is as regards the
length of it. How long is a "flight"? Is it
assu-med to be a blo-ck, two blocks, or a mile?
Hon. Mr. IIAYDEN: If a man is carrying
a revolver in escaping from the scone of a
hoid-up, and is cbased by the victim, who hs
shot, tbe flight referred to wvould be in the
cournse of escape fromn possible capture.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: But is lot tbc expression rather ambiguous? A man migbt hoe captured a mile away. Ail sorts of things migbt

Hon. Mr. DAVIEýS: But he is flying from
the scene of the shooting, and the paragraph
provides tbat if ducing the fligbt 'ho is found

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: -No, no. Thore are
two conditions: flrst, that hoe uses or fias on
bis person a weapon, at a timo when he is
conimit-ting or attempting to commit one of
these offonces. or at the time of tbe fliglit
from the commission or the attempted comnmission; and second, that in the course oi the
commission of thie offonco or onf tihe attempt
to commit it, or in the effort to escape from
the consoquence nf it, death resulted to some

person from tbe use of that weapon. It does
not matter wbere tthat death resuited. If the
man sboots a police officer, of course it is
beid to be murder; but bere tbe application
of this principle is. I take it. to, tihe case of
the victim, who is at the scene of tbe
hold-up; ithore is some souffle, and the criminai's concern thon becomes thnt of gettinig
awa., rather than of going through with the
commission of tbe offenco.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: That is, while tbe man
is boing chased by an officer of Ilhe law or
somobody cIse?
Hon. Mi'. HAYDEN; No. If during the
period that ho is boing chased by an officci'

no question but that the act is, murder.

Mr. HAYDEN:

The wnrding

is.

-if ho uses oJr lias upun bis person any weapon

nifences in Ibis section mentioned or the flight nf
the offender upon the commission...
That is to sav, an offonco bas been conmiitted or attempted to ho committed b3 ' onc
ni' more porsons, nnd thon ýtho'e is an escape,
nd the.% ail rush in various directions. As
thle result of the use nf n guin, Wvhich the
ex idence establishes was in the possession
ni oneofn these porsons at tibe time the
hold-up wvas staged, the victim is dead. In
timese ùircumý4tances 'thoy are ail guiiîv ni
mnurder.
This provision, if il bocornes law.
is intendod to plug a loophlînl, so that herealler an accused person in sucli circums.tance.'
as have been described cannot insist that
thie jury be instructod that ho did not intend
to infliot any in.jury.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I predict that a great
many arguments wili arise in law courts over
the definition oi a flight.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCI(:
There is a distinction between a flight and a bot flight. but
no such distinction is shown in this bill. A
flight might extend ovor a period nf sevoral
years.

675

JULY 16, 1947
Another matter thEut bothers me is that a
flight may be made by a number of persons
ini various directions. That is to say, when
the party starts out one of its members may
be in possession of a gun; then when a
death ensues, the members of the party
separate and go in ail directions, and later
another member of 'the par.ty is found with
the gun in his possession. It may be that
once again the members of the party separate,
this time completely, and that after they have
done so the fellow who then has the gun
pulls it out and shoots somebody. Then the
man who was once in possession of -the gun,
but who was net even present at the scene
of the crime, would be guilty of murder.
There will certainly be some real arguments
over this.
The motion for concurrence was agreed to
REPRESENTATION BILL,
FIRST READING

A message was received fromn the House of
Commons with Bill 18, aný Act to readjust
the Representation in the House of Common..
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of the bill.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
before this bill is given second reading I wish
to say that it bas long heen the practice in this
house nlot to go into the details of a redistribution bill. For that reason I shall make no
comment, except that His Honour the Speaker
used, the wrong term, I think, when he called
this "an Act to readjust." He, might. well have
called it "an Act to gerrymander." The term
"gerrymander" is derived fromn Gerry, the
name of an American politicien who introduced a bil involving a practice that is stili
alive in this coutntry. Ever since that time this
praetice has been called gerrymandering.
Hon. THO MAS VIEN: I should like to
point out that the word was frequently heard
in parliamentary circles in this country between
1818 and 1896. I recall that when I was a
young member in another placee-unfortunateIy
it wàs years ago-I delighted in reading the
speeches delivered in the two bouses of
parliament, with respect to gerrymandering.
Some speakers supported the practice while
others s'trongly objette-d te it. If honourable
senators have some spare time d'uring the
recess they might, eni oy reading the debates of
thé House of Commons following the election
I would particuhlry refer themn to
tif IM0.
the speeches of Sir Charles Tupper, leader of

the opposition, who had developed the theory
that the Liberals had won a great number of

seats by a minority of the votes cast, and that
certain Liberal members would nlot have been
elected had the boundaries of their representative constituencies

flot been, altered.

Sir Wilfrid Laurier, then 'Prime Minister,
pointed out to Sir Charles that gerrymandering
had been strongly opposect by the Liberals in
previous sessions of parliament, andi that it
was a Conservative practice.
Sir Wilfrid
further stated that Sir Charles Tupper, as
leader of the opposition. had no right to
complain of gerrymandering haviag taken

place, hecause the redistribution had been
made by his own friends.
In 1917 also there were bitter complaints of
gerrymandering und-er the War-time Elections

Act. At that time the Rîght Honourable
Arthur Meighen, then Secretary of State, was
charged with having introduced that m-easure
in order to rearrange the boundaries of certain
constituencies iii such a way as to disfranchise certain Canadian citizens andi give the

right to vote to certain other people, sucb as
the wives, mothers, daughters and sîsters of
Poles, Serbs and othiers in the United States.
During that period Canada opened somne
eighty-th-ree vorting poils in the United States,
a fait unique in the electoral history of Canada. I hope it will remain unique because
giving people in a foreign country the 'right
to eleet members to the Canadýian parliament
is an extraordinary prineiple to be introduced
in our electorai legisiation.
Charges of gerrymandering were also made
in 1933 or 1934 when a bull similar to the one
now before us was introduced in the other
place. At that time the boundaries of certain
counties were chssmgedi, and ail the "wieked"
Liberals who were in, the immediate vicinity
were thrown into those counties to make thfem
absol-utely Liberai and to relieve the neighbouring counties of the Liberal vote. That also
was called, gerrymandering.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Honourable senatorsHon. Mr. VIEN: I shall be finished in a
few minutes. I know that my honourable
friend will repiy appropriateiy and with bis
customary vim. andi ingenuity. I had no intentien of speaking on this measure, because, as
the honourable leader of the opposition. (Hon.
M.r. Haig) liaes aid, it is nlot usual for this
houe to debate at any length a bill to
1âit the constituencies of honoura-ble membera of another place. But I want te point
ont that Vhe first use ini Canada of tte word
"ýgerrymnandering" was principally by Liberats
when complaining of acts of their political

676

SENATE

opponents.
In eider to keep the record
straiglît and pravent the drawing of a certain
inferonce from the remarks of the honeurable
leader of the opposition, I wish to say that
whether the word originat-ed in the 'nited
States or elsewhere I do flot knewHon. Mr. HIAIG: In the United States.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: -it was introduced to our
political vocabulary when the Libaral partv
hiad cause to complain that the Conservative
party in office was using its powers te rearrange the boundaries of constituencies te suit
its own purpose. 1 should add that it seldorn
profitcd from this action, becausa in most of
the gerrymiandercd constituencies the Conservatives ware defeated at the poils.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Does the honourable
senater offer that as a prophiecy or forecast
of what will hiappan frorn tbis gerrymanderîng?
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I arn net attampting to
ruake any forecast.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Froru bis great store
of political knowledge can the honourable
gentleman fell me wvith what regime the
phrase "hiving the Grits" originated?
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I balieva the phrase
"hiving the Grits" originated when it wvas
decided that in certain Conservativa ridings
there were too many Grits or prospective
Grits, and that thay should be transferred to
other constituancies whera it was concaded
that I lir, Liberals already had a majority
aiong the alecters. I feel sure that the
phrase will bî'ing many interasting racollections te the minds of our honourable friands
opposite.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My honourable
friand opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) startad this
discussion. He ought te have heard enough
n0w te hold biru for a while.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: May 1 ask the
lionourable senator froru De Lorimier (Hon.
c.Vian) if hae expects that this measure
wiîll hcîug about the saine result as tha 1934
-d istci bu tien?
Hon. Mr'. VIEN: I ain afraid that the
honeucable senators froru Petecborough (Hon.
Mrs. Fallis) and Blýaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner) are indulging in a littie wishfu]
thinking.
Se far as I can judge fromn the discussion
in another place, there wvas ne sinister motive
in the preparation of the 'bil now before us.
The last, decennial census showed that there
liad te ha a change in the numýber of electad
representativas from varieus provinces, and
this ruade necessary a change in the numbar

of constituencies. Saskatchewan, for instance,
which Ivas much to tia fore in the discussion
in another place, liad its members reduceil
irorn 21 te 20.
Clearly there had te ha
realignment of constituencies in that province.
The chips had te faîýl soruewhere. It lias beau
peintad out that the hioneucable inaruber of
anothar place who ruest violeutly protestad
.îgainst the committea's report had given is
wcitten assent te that report.
Quebec is
another province whose number of members
hiad te bc alianged; in this case thera wvas an
increase. Onýe electocal district might have a
population of onPl' thirteen, fifteen or sîxteen
thousand. while tlîat of anet ber mighit ha
sixty thousand. The disparity wvas due largely
te the 1934 redistribution . Advantage lias
been taken of the present oppertunity ta
correct tîa t situiation and to de-bruit constituencies in sucb a way as te bcing about
a more aven division of population ameng
the ridings. As I say, 1 de net believe that
there wvas any sinister motive bchind Ibis bill.
If the Liberals avec had a gerryruander in
i.d thav would have bean convinced of its
uselessýnass
by
the
experiance
o f their
opponaents.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I think you ara going
tee far now.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: The honourable senator saîd the chips had te faîl somewbere.
Dees ha net think it is a radher remarkable
eoîncidance that they faîl in the ridings of the
leader of the opposition and bis four ablest
lieutenants?
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Nobody regrets thaI more
tlîan wa do.
Hon. Mr. HORNEýR: They did net faîl in
Glangarry.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I ,incerely hope tha;t the
redistribution will net prevant the honeurable
leader of the opposition from continuing in
that office for many years to coma.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, I do not intend te indulge in
any historical perspective of this question of
redistribution. It seerus te me that we can do
vary little about this bill. I think it should
be pointed out, howaver, that the only justification for a redistribution measura is the
taking of a decennial census which records
the increasa or decrease in the population of
the varieus constituencies. It is true that
whera changes are made in the boundarias of
a constituency some inconveniance is caused
te the mamber who represents it.
In my opinion debate that bas taken place
on the subject in the House of Commons in
the past and just recently, was brought about

JULY 16, 1947
largely by a sense of inconvenience on the
part of the sitting member, wbo views with
some eoncern the necessity for adjusting bis
organization to the demanda of new conditions.
I tbink it is most natural that objections
should be fortbcoming.
I arn quite certain that an examination of
our history would show that redistribution in
the long run bas bad very littie effect upon
the outcome of the ensuing elections. I was
not sitting in parliament in 1934, but was very
closely in touch with wbat went on. May
I say, by way of illustration, tbat the party
to wbich I belong was then in the opposition,
and that tbe redistribution bill, particularly
as it affected the province of Quebec, met witb
a great deal of criticisin by members from tbat
province? As a matter of fact tbe Ieading
representative from that province, tbe late
Right Honourable Ernest Lapointe, was so,
critical of the measure that bie cballenged the
government to go to the people on it. AIl that
can be said is tbat wben the election of 1935
came along bis apprebiensions were shown to
have been entirely unfounded, because every
seat in the province of Quebec was returned
for his party.
As to the suggestions tbat have been made
about gerrymandering or the biving of one
group here and another there, I believe that
public opinion in this country is in sucb a
liquid state that the passing of this measure
will bave no effect at ail upon tbe outcome
of the next general election. People form
their views upon the issues of the day as they
are advanced by the various political parties
in wbat they believe to be the general interest
of the country. If opinions are turned in the
rigbt direction, my view is that the tecbnical
differences between tbe constituencies bas very
little bearing on the outcome of elections.
I conclude with the tbougbt that when we
revise the Election. Act something more can be
said about wbat goes on in the constituencies.
Hon. S. S. McKF.EN: Honourable senators,
it bas been said by the honourable leader
opposite that this bouse takes little part in
the discussion on redistribution. It occurs to
me that if a satisfactory redistribution bas
been arrived. at by a committee of the other
house and, a report bas been presen.ted, this
house should- stand by that report.
True, reddstribution is pureîy a matter of
compromise, and no one party sbould be
entirely satisfied with tbe results. It is a tase
of each one giving a littIe to satisfy the wbole.
I 1believe that agreement bas been reacbed
among at least a majority of the parties as to
the seats to be added. As for its effeet on
British Columbia, I was a littie disappointed
that the redistribution came so, long after the

taking of a census. If it were made on the figures
as shown by the ration board we would have
at least another two seats.
Since the Senate is flot particularly interested
in the redistribution of the seats of the House
of Commons, it might well consider the maniner
in which. the seats in the Senate are distributed.
That is a subject that sbould be examined into.
in tbis bouse. The Senate is intended; to give
numerical as well as geographical representation; therefore, more seats should go to some
of the larger provinces. British Columbia is
now larger than eitber Nova Scotia or New
Brunswick, botb of which bave ten senators
while British Columbia bas only six.
There is talk of bringing Newfoundland into
the confederation. Such a move would necessitate additional representation. It should flot
be forgotten that tbe other coast, west of the
Rockies, is stili part of Canada and sbould
bave at least two more seats in the Senate.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Honourable senators,
just to keep tbe record straigbt, in reply to
my honourable friend's statement tbat certain
members of tbe committee of the otber bouse
signed tbe report on redistribution, I sbould
like to say that accord-ing to the Commons
Hansard the report was signed on the understanding that tbe matter would be brought
up in the bouse. The members were flot agreeing to it, but were steam-rollered into signing it.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: A case of "on
division"
Tbe motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second tume, on division.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Wben sball the
bill be read, the third time?
Hlon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I move tbird

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG- Honourable senators, the bonourable member for De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Vien) referred only to tbe redistributions of 1896 and 1917.

voters in Ottawa gave a majority for the
Liberal party and tihose in Carleton gave a
majority against it.
My honourable friend did flot tell us that
the constituency of Muskoka-On'tario, whose
representative in the other house is a prominent member of one of the opposition parties,
has been divided up int a new combination.
What has happened in the province of Manitoba? The change in population in 'the
southern part of the province required thati the
seat to be lost should he froin that(lri.
The constituencies of Portage la Prairie amd
Neepawa were combined, whichi putthe leader
of the opposition in the ot'her bouse int a
new eonstittuency with a population 'of twice
tlie population of Glengarry. I objleet n-o-st to
the dividing of the old con.stituencyof Selkirk
into two parts. The riding of Norquay is
ideal for the present premier of Manitoba
to mun in-if lie can be induced 'f0 corne to
Ot-tawa.
That riding is a rneandering onev.
It starts on the sou'th side of Winnipeg and
rneanders northward, then ca-st to
Winnipeg,
takes in sorne areas adjacent to tîme soutlî
centre of -the city, and leaves a section to
the north ou'tside of Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. HORNER:

It is like a dog's

Hon. Mr. HAIG:
Unless you have a
compass you are likely tri get, lest iii tr-ving
,to trace the boundaries of that constitucncy.
The effect may not bc so bad, becausc the
population in that area i-s fairly cornopolitan.
I know Manitoba pretty well, and I arn
inclined to think the changes will not hiax
any political consequences. The only nernher
who may be hurt in this "jambhoree" is the
C.C.F. member for Selkirk; north of the town
of Selkirk the constituency is divided cas!
and west. If I were a friend of bis, I think
I would be fearing his defeat in tlîe next
election.
The really serins -criticisma of this bill relates to the ridinýg of Lake Centre.
The
alteratien proposed is an outrage.
If my
honourable friend had flot insiulged in references to t-his matter 1 would have kept quiet,
but, I think what, lias been said calîs for a few
remarks. The you-ng man who represents
Lake Centre is one of the ablest men in the
parliamentary life of this country, as able a
member as the buse of Commnons lias seen
in this generation. He is a worker; he is a
veteran of the first world war. Hc cornes
down here at a great sacrifice, because not
only is he a successful lawyer inhis own province but his talent is snch thiat lie could
attain high distinction and a lucrative practice in Montreal or Toronto, or in any other

Canadian city in whicli lie chose t0 establish
himself. But he prefers to stay in the West,
where lie is recognized as a leading counsel.
N'ow tîme committee readjust bis riding in
order f0 defeat him, while they relieve the
Minister of Agriculture of a district which in
tue main voýted for the C.C.F. candidate at
the last election. Three townships are taken
from the soutb haîf of Humboldt and added
to Lakc Centre because in that district the
vote was 550 for tlîe C.C.F., 210 for the Liberal
aind 13 for thîe Conservative. Then, as if that
iverie not enougli, part of the city of Regina
lias been added Ite constituency of Moose
Jaw, with wlmicli if, has no cennection, solely
to deprix e tîme Conservative mernher of tue
9,000 inaj oritv lie received in tlîat part of bis
constituency af [lie last election. If that is
not a gerryrnanîler whieh (ries f0 lîigh hicaven
for public iirotest, I do not know of any.
1 arn not worrîeîl about tlîe situation in
eithier British Colunîbia or Manitoba. It is

fealure is the manipulation of Lake Centre
constit.ueney to emeate a potential adversýe
inajority of 5,000 against the :itting mýember.
Iii tie committee, as tlîe result of repeated
protests the transfer of voters was limited,
but the sitfing memýber is thlreat-ned with
2,700 more opposition votes than were polled

where lie could not lielp liimnself.

JIYLY 16, 1947
Hon. Mr. HA'IG: That was the nature of
bis protest. I would flot like to run against
ar opponent supported by 5,000 new votes.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT. My honourable
friend is not giving a correct interpretation of
the document Mr. Tucker read in the other
place, and which was signed by Mr.
Diefenbaker.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Mr. Diefenbaker gave me
an explanation. The original draft proposai
involved 5,000 adverse votes. The revised
arrangement leaves 1,700. 1 do not believe
there is any dispute at ail about these figures.
The point is that this redistribution is made
at Mr. Diefenbaker's expense. Three of the
constituencies in soutbern Saskatchewan are
to be represented by two members; their
total population is small, and ail are represented by members of the C.C.F. Nobody will
be harmed. But so far as Lake Centre is coneerned the oniy purpose of re-drawing the
bouindaries is to eliminate Diefenbaker from
the House of Commons. I do not think it
can he done; I do flot believe the people of
Saskatchewan will permit it.
With regard to one observation of my
honourable friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert), I venture to suggest that if the
Conservatives had to do their redistribution
work of 1933 over again, there wouid be no
interference at ail with the constituency,
because they wcre aiways advi3ed to leave
it alone.
Now let me recount a littie incident whîch
occurred in 1923. At that time the Liberal
party were in power in this country. One of
the members of the redistribution committee
was an M.P. from, Manitoba with whom, I
went to university. He did. not know much
about rural Manitoba; I knew quite a bit
about it. H1e said. "Jack, how shall I' divide
this province?" I believe that Manitoba was
then getting three or perhaps four extra seats.
He asked me how I wouid <livide the city of
Winnipeg, to which one more seat was to be
allotted. I said, "I would run the division east
and west". He said, "Would that heip your
party, or mine?" "Well", I said, "I'm blessed
if I know". My idea about it was much the
same as that expressed by the honourabie
senator firom Ottawa. I said: "My experience
is that if a fair redistribution is made the
party whieh makes it gets the benefit; whereas
the party which makes a bad redistribution
gets kicked in the face for doing so". H1e ran
the line east and west. A revision was made in
1933 under a Conservatîve government; the
same hine was retained. Subsequently there
was a revision under a Liberal government;
stili the same line was adhered to. It bas

679

remained in effeet ever since. In 1925 the
Conservatives, carried Vwo seats and- the
Lilberals two scats. In. 1930 the Conservatives
carried two, the C.C.F. one, and the Liberals
one. In 1935 the Liberals carried two and the
C.C.F. ca.rried two. I think we have there a
perfect illustration of a reasonable plan of
redistribution, which ultimately benefited
those whomade it. If it were my business to
re-draw constituency uines in Winnipeg, I
couid do it in a manner which would give the
Conserva tive party at ieast a chance in the
next. figlit, and I could make it very difficuit
for the C.C.F. to get more than one smat.
I have nothing Vo add; but I thought that
a reference to some examples of redistribution
made hy Conservatives, but neyer mentioned
by Liberals, would help to correct some misapprehensions. I -also wanted the house to
understand that, the re-drawing of this bill
was not a Sunday afternoon piïcnic.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: I had not intended
to speak at ail, but the honourable lea&-r of
the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) bas brought
me to my feet by hie references Vo "gerrymandering" and the implication which was
obvious fram bis words. Neither had I the
intention of being exhaustive in the few
remarks which I made; that is why I did not
go into aîl the details which the honourable
gentleman bas now deveioped in bis argument
on the third reading.
I entireiy agree with w'hat ha has stid about
the gentleman who now represents Lake
Centre. He is extremneiy gifted; he is a dear
personal friend, of mine; and I sincerely hope
that for a long time to corne he will ho
returned to act as *an opposition critie.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: 1 know you are genuine
in that-I a.m not speaking cynieally.
Hon. Mr. VIEN. Just as genuine as my
friond was when he came down here in. 1934Hon. Mr. Haig: 1924.
Hon. Mr. VIEN -in 1924, and suggested a
certain division in the city of Win-nipeg. One
would have ihad to be more than humxan not to
do so. The honourable senator suggested a
division favourable to hie friende. I do not
biame iiim, for that.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: You m:isunderstoýod. The
friend was a member of the commaittee and
a Liberai inember for Manitoba.
Hon. Mr, VIEN: Yes, but I cannot convince myseîf that when the: honourabie
senator suggested a certain division of the
city of Winnipeg he intended -to help the
Liberais. I may be wrong but I amn con-

680

SENATE

vinced that what he had in mind was to retain
at Ieast one seat in the Jandside of the Conservative pýarty.
As regards what tihe honýourable senatorHon. Mr. HAIG: I do not want to be misunýderstood, I .stated t1hat, in 1937 the line
was Ieft as it was-and in 1947 it is stilil the
saine.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: 0f course it is, because
whatever the intention at the tirne may have
heen. ià lias proven te be reasonably correct.
With respect to the discussion in another
place. 1 would simply point out ithat tihe work
was divided among sub-cornmittees.
Each
sub-cornmittee looked after the redistrtibution
of one particular province, and a reasenable
propo-al was reached.. Aithougli there was no-t
pcrfeet agreement tihere was reasonable agre~emont, the proposai was accepted as being the
hest possible .for*each province.
Honourable senators, I think iýt is proper for
us to approve whiat lias been donc, and to pass
tîjis bill without any amend-men.t.
Hon. JAMES GRAY TURGEON: Honourable senators, until 1 Iistened to the debate
this afternoon 1 had flot the slightest intention of speaking on this motion. Now I wish
te beave witlî the house three thoughts that
carne to rny mmnd whule the bill was under
discussion in another place.
The first lias to do with our international
relations. Honourable senators know that one
of the complaints of most western countries
is that the eastern countries do flot hold free
elections. If I were the representative in
Ottawa of one of those castern countries
wliose systern of election is se, often criticized
by western countries, and I read the charges
that have been made here, in another place,
and in our newspapers, with respect to the
redistribution bill and its cifeet upon the
corning elections, and then read the countercharges made against ether redistributions, I
wondcr wliat would be the nature of my
dispatch te my government.
A measure of this nature should be given
careful thouglit. I have little knowledge of the
seats under discussion; I know nothing of the
Saskatchewan riding of Lake Centre, except,
as others have said, that the mnember from that
district is a fine man and a hard-working
member of parliament.
I do, however, know something about Cariboo and Karnloops. For many years praeticaliy ail the western portion of the Kamloops riding, including the town of Kamloops,
was part of the Caribun federal constituency.
It wvas taken out of that constituency by a
redistribution previous to the election of

1935, whien I first became the member for
Cariboo. Most of that part of the Cariboo
riding which is now going into Kamnloops is
in the Lillooet provincial constituency, whose
member is a Conservative. He was eiected in
1941 and re-elected at the last election. For
two terms prior to 1941 he was not in the
legislaturo, but lie liad been there formeriy.
In the 1935 election I was the candidate and
I did not carry that portion of the present
Cariboo riding. I did carry it in 1940 and
again in 1945, but in the provincial election
of 1941 it went Conservative, as it did again
in 1945. That is flot ail. I think a bit of the
present constituency north of that is going
into Kamloops. Since 1933 it lias been Liberal,
althougli for many years it had been Conservative. I think Mr. Fulton will have just as
goed an opportunity in tlie proposed new
rîding as ho bas had in the one he now
represents.
The censtituency of Glengarry has been
mentioned. I do not know anything about it,
but frorn what was said in another place I
understand that the Prime Minister lias confirmcd the statement that lie lias ne intention
of running in that riding. Therefore, anything
donc with respect te that constituency could
not have been donc with an oye te the
Prime Ministor's chances in the coming edcctien. I arn toid by people within the sacred
precincts of this building that in order te perpetuate the historical tradition wbich for so
many years lias permitted a man of Scotch
descent te represent the constituency, ne
change is being made. 1 arn told aise that if
the constituency is eniarged it will probably
have a French speaking majority. Thore is net
mucli Scotch blood in me, but if the reasen
given is the reai reason for net changing Glengarry, I think it is a geod one. We should keep
in mind the traditional part of Canadian bistory, especially in old-settled parts like the
Ottawa valley. If anything can ho donc te keep
a member of Scotch descent in the seat of
Glengarry, I think it shouid ho dene.
I have ne desire te argue, but I do think
that in vicw of the present world situation it
is disastrous for us, in discussing what is taking
place now te lic liarking back te what took
place in elections inany ycars ago. I say this
hecause many representatives of the United
States, Great Britain, Canada and other
counitries
bave
complaincd
that
certain
castorn European countries in their electiens
de net permit a froc choice of candidates or
free expression of opinion by the people, and
that there is-if I may use a terni that lias
been used here-gerrymandering in one form
or another.

JU-LY,16, 1947
I hope honourable senators will excuse me
for having risen on this occasion.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, I join with -the honourable
gentleman in deploring the use of extravagant
.terme in -bhis discussion. 1 know very little
about the redistribution in other provinces,
but I know that in Onitarjo as little change as
possible was made. Northern Ontario has
grown rapidly since the last distribution, and
centres such as Nipissing have achieved a
population of over 100,000 people. The district
of Cochrane bas a population of seventy or
eighty thousand. There was a bona fide
necessity of shif'ting some of the representation from southern Ontario up to northern
Ontarioe.
I also know thait the riding of MuskokaOn'tario, te which the honourable leader of
the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) referred, was
one which in the nature of 'things had te go.
-t was a e;Lrauge constituency at best, over
100 miles in length, running fromn ithe lake
sheoTe up to Parry Sound and having a population of about 30,000. Anybody who looks
a!t the map fairly- will see why it has been
decided to distribute that sprawlinýg constituency among three nithers. The northern
secitien, which. is a natural portion of the
Parry Sound riding, was put in that riding.
The honourable gentleman who was successful
in the Muskoka-Ontario censtituency at the
last eleiction is very angry about tbhe change.
I can appreciate that, because hie will be
somnewhait, though only slightly, inconvenienced. He looks upon what has been
done as a special attack upon 'lirimself; hie
credits hiniself wït$h being se, important that
the Liberal parity would like to eliminate
bim. That is not so at alI. The truLth is
simply that fie was unfortunate in having
selected front 'is residence in Toronto a
constituency which was tagged for elimination
ini any decent or fair redistribution.
It is not proper that we should discus alI
the details of this measure. I bave flot gathered
figures for this debate, as 1 did flot think there
would be such a debate here. From personal
knowledge I cari say with perfect sincerity that
in the province of Ontario the approach to this
problem of redistribution was bona fidie, and
that there was ne maliciaus intent or overreaching desire to, injure anybody, much less
our Conservative friends.
Hon. -GUSTAVE LACASSE: Honourable
senaters, I agree with the statement of my
honourable friend fromn Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) that there is littie we cani do
about this bill, for it concerne principally the
eleeted members of another place. But vith

681

aIl due respect to those who have the responsibility of rcpresenting electoral constituencies,
I think we are justified, as citizens of Canada
if for no other reason, in taking an înterest
in the bill. I agree that, we should not consider
it from a partisan viewpoint.
My principal reason for rising is to voice my
regret, which I - admit is based on sentiment, at the disappearance from the electoral
map of Canada of the county of Two
Mountains. I shall refrain from alluding even
indirectly to one of the most vicious diseussions which took place elsewhere, but I wish
to point eut that in the whole of Canada there
are few ridings with such an important historical background as that of Two Mountains.
Everyýone here knows what I mean. In the
course of events some constituencies have
necessarily to be amalgamated, and in due
time their cames faîl into deep oblîvion of a
forgotten past. I sincerely trust that "Two
Mountains" will be an exceptinWn, ld th't thfisM
name will forever shine on our electoral map
as it shines on the pages of Canadian. history.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.

FIR'ST READING

A message was received from the House of

terni of office of a Transport Commissioner.
The bill was, read the first time.
SECOND

READING

Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON meved the second reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
bill in which 1 am interested not ondy as
government leader but as a representative of
the Maritime provinces. The Railway Act
provides that a meniber of the Board of
Transport Commissioners shall net hold
office after having reached the age of seventyfive years, and, the pur-pose of the bill is te
enable the Governor in Counicil te continue
for one year -the termi of office of Mr. Comnmissioner Stone, who became seventy-five on
June 30, 1947. In -bis capacity as a meinher
cf the board Commissioner Stone represents
labour and the Maritime provinces, and if 'le
were replaced at this time the new appointee
would be under the handicap of net having
attended the board?s 'hearings of the last few
mionths on the application of the raîlways for
a substantial increase in freight rates. The
Maritime provinces are especially interested
in this application, feeling t-hat the board's
decision may have an important effeet upen
their future, and they have urged the passing

682

SENATE

of legislation 'te make it possible for Mr.
Comimissionecr Stone to continue in office, as
hoe is willing to db, until the board makes its
report. Under the provisions of this bill he
could romain in office at the pleasure of the
Governor, in Counécil during a period nlot
excee(ling one year from the 30L-h of June,
1947, and it is expected that the report will
have been issued before that time.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Did 1 understand
the hionourable leader to say that Mr. Cornmisioner Stone is over 65?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: 11e is 75.
The motion was agrccd to, and the bill was

WITHDRAWN

On the Order:
Resumning the adjournied debate on the motion
for tbe third roading of Bill 415, an Act te
anlen(l the 'Civil Service Superannualion Act,
andi the motion in ameedment. eftIhe Hon. Senator Roebuck "That the Bill be net now read a
third time but that it be commilted to a Cernmiltee of tbe Whiole presently."
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honouraible senators, I propose to ask, tie bouse to, grant me
a special favour by allowing Ibis bill to go
te the committee of the whole. When Ibis
measure was before the bouse yosterday I was
opposed te it and, in faveur ef tbe amend'menl
proposed by the bonourable senator frem
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Reebuck). Since
tlien I bave heard some representatiens whicb
indicate to nie that, I may be wrong. Thorefore, I sbould like bonourable membors te
have an oppertunity of discussing tbe bil in
committco without cemmitting themsolvos te
any principle.
Hon. CHARLES L. BISHOP: Honourable
senators, some of the clear minds in the
Senate sern a bit confused over Cbis mneasure.

I tbink that botb the purpose of it anil tbe
wav in wvbicb thal purpose i.s te be carried eut
aile set forth in coxoplele clarity. The enaetment is motivýated by the best et intentions.
lui brief. the age for compulsory retirement,
which now is 70, is rodruced te 65. Howover.
if it is dcsired te 'retain the services ot anyone
up te 70 years et age tbis mey be done from
year te ye-ar by order in counceil.
I arn informed that ne wholesale retiroment
et governimont omployees is te be expecled,
unloss tho employeca tbemselves wanl te, retire.
Those wbo nie capable, efficient, and willing
te be kept on are net likely te be dispensed
witb. Wbile Ibis new provision permits a
civil servant te retire voluntaçrily aI age 60, the
governrnont aIse may retire anyone at. that
age if il dieems; that there is sufficiont reason
for so doing; but when il is agreedi that the
efficiency ot miany persons of 60 is unimpairod,
I do net forosee any civil servent peesessing
sucb qualifications bcing forcod eut et the
service.
If anyone w-anIs te retire because et
impairod b.ealth, or for other roasons, lio will
find that the bill provides the necýessary facilities toeonýable bim te do se under tavourable
circumstances. As one moves eut one leaves
reom for somieone olse te movo up in the progression et promotion. Advancemont is the
natural ambition et the publie servant and' the
prospect et il is. or eugbt le, bo, an incentive
te, the bost endoavour.
If in the civil serv ice superannuation systcm
there is any measure et generosity on the part
et the public treasury, il is only in uine witb
the modemn trend in aIl demecratic countries
tovards social seeurity. A sense et security
is the solvont, et many wvoxries, and one et the
great contributions le peace et mind. If the
treatmon.-t provided for can be called generous,
let us remember that civil servants who are
cligible for its benefits bave earned the reward
by the lengtb, fidielity and acceptability et tlicir
service, and also by making substantiýal contributions year by yoar te the large fund whicb
sustains the systemn et superannuation.
One word more. I arn advised Ibat Ibis
ineasure is approved by the Civil Service
Federation ot Canadn, the Ottawa Civil Service Association, the Arnalgamated Civil
Ser-vice Organization, and, as the bonourable
leader bas said, by a parliamenlary cemmilcee
and a royal commission. The sanction et
sucb authentie bodies sbould go far le allay
the fears and dispel the glooma ot the bonourable senator frorn Toronto-Trinily (Hon. Mr.
Reebuck) or et any other members efthIis
bouse wbo may share bis views.

JULY -16, 1947
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, the leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) was
good enough to speak to me about this matter.
I have no objection to the blli being considered in committee of the whole, and to
facilitate matters I have taken the precaution of having in attendance officiais of the
department so that the honourable senator
from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin) or any
other honourable member may question them.
It should be understood that wben the bouse
goes into committee of the whole it need consider only those sections which the honourahle
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) wishes to be considered.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I would concur in that
suggestion.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourahie
senators, the motion before the bouse is for
third reading of the bill. Is it the wish of
honourable senators that the motion be withdrawn.
The motion for third reading was withdrawn.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Robertson the
Senate went into committee on the bill.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR in the Chair.
On section 1-Definitions:
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I move:
That subsection 4 of section 1 be amended by
striking out, in paragrapli (ji) the word "sixty"
and substituting the words "sixty,-five".
The paragraph would then read:
(jj) "retirement age" means sixty-five years
of age.
I suppose there is no need of rppeating what
was said in the debate of yesterday. I more
or less agree that ail these amendments bang
on the firJt one, and that if you do not agree
to change this paragraph by striking out the
word "six>oty" and substituting "sixty-five" you
wiil be apposed to similar changes ail the way
through. I shail make an added comment, but
it will be very shoîit.
When I was speaking yesterday, the classie
illustration with regard to this matter did
flot pass ithrough my mind, as it did a littie
later on. The outsîtanding case of this kind
in English literature is 'that of Charles Lamb
who wrote thbe "Tales of Shakespeare". Lamb
was an officiai of the India office where he
was given a job to support him while he wrote
bis stories and essays, because,, in those days
litterateursq were essteemed more highly than
'they are nowadays. He was a great letter
writer, and lie wrote ail over Englýand complaining of being chained to a desk, the slave
of the India office, while 'bis heart was breaking.

Finally be was superannuated, and he addressed
letiters to frîends ail over England indicaiting
bis bappiness at baving escaped at laot from
shavery. This mood lasted abou-t tbree weeks,
wben lie began another series of letters, the
burden of which, was tbat -be was again the
most miserable man in ail England, because
lie bad noitbing to do. Men who, though
advancing in years, are not ohd men should
not give up -their work and retire. Wbat
Charles Lamb needed was a holiday, net to
abandon bis work, bis habits of regularity, and
the necessity of keeping time by the dlock.
That lesson applies in ample measuire in the
present case. Before leaving it, I cannot
resist the tem.ptation of repeating a little
witticism of Charles Lamb wbile lie was in
government employ-ment. At one time somebody complained or called bi'm to task for
getting down so late in 'the morning: 'le
answered, "Yes, but see bow early I leave
in (the af.ternoon".
Gentlemen, I am opposed to tbis business
of lowering the age of retirement, and I offer
the amendment for your favourable consideration.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: Did I understand the
honourable senator from. Toronto-Trini'ty
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) to say yesterday that
retirement could lie applied for at the age
of sixty but could not bie imposed. Is not
that the law now?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is the law.
As I understand it, retirement can lie given
at almost any time if the circumstances
warrant it.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: At aixty-five?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: At sixty-five, yes;
but compulsory retirement does not take place
now until the age of 70. It is the lowering
of the age limit from 65 to 60 to which I
strongly object. Under the clause now before
us, "ýretirement age" means sixty years of age,
and I urge that we strike out "sixty" and substitute "sixty-five". If this amendment is
carried, when an employee reaches 65 lie may
retire on full pension; but under the bull as
drafted lie may leave at sixty and go fishing, or
engage in business of some kind to serve bis
own interests.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: Yes, if lie asks to le
retîred.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is so, but why
should we give him tbat right? Why should
we change the rule we bave followed in thepast, and allow a man who is in the very prime
of life, with ahi bis faculties, bis healtb and the
experience be bas gathered in the public service, to leave it oa full pension?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BISHOP: If he is a very valuable
and- efficient servant, probably the government
would not Jet him go.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: If the bill passes in
its present form it wiii be his right to go, and
lie cannot be held against his will. Under the
act as now constituted he can be retained. But
if this bill goes through Le can retire no matter
how valuable Le may be, or how healthy and
strong. I do not think such a provision is in
the public interest.
Hon. Mr. BISHOP: If he shouild retire at
sixty he would receive a much smaller superannuation allowance than he would get if le
rcimained until sixty-five.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No. As I understand
the bill, the full pension will be payable at the
age of sixty.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: Not necessarily.
The
maximum is obtainable only after thirty-five
vears of service.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Weli. if the civil servant has completed his thirty-five years le can
retire on full pension at sixtv, aithoigh Le mav
be perfectly healthy and in the prime of life.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: Honourable senators, J
think it is important to understand the act as
is is in order to realize the effect of the changes
which iwe are discussing. and which consýist in
lowering the retirement age-the so-called
voluntary retirement age-from sixty-five to
sixty, and lowering the compulsory retiring
age from seventy to sixty-five.
There are tiwo pha-ses to be considered.
First there is :the automatic phase. When a
civil servant reaches the age of seventy, under
this bill Le cannot be continued in office
except as provided for in paragraph (2) of
section 8 of the bill. It reads as follows:
(2) Nothing contained in subsection one of
this section shall be deemed to require any contributor to be retired from the Civil Service 'by
reason of having attained the age of seventy
years. until at least two years have elapsed
after the coming into force of the said subsection.
Under section 8 of the bill no contributor
shall be retained in the civil service bevond
sixty-five years of age, but annual extensiens may be granted to him until le reaches
the age of seventy.
The finst remark which I wish to make is
in reply to a question put yesterday by the
honourable senator from Pembroke (Hon.
Mr. White). He enquired as to the attitude
of the civil servant concerning the lowering of
the retirement age. With leave of the Senate
I wish to read a resolution dated July 7,
1917. from the National Joint Council of

the Public Service. T'hat is an association
which includes representatives of certain civil
service organizations as well as representatives
o,f the government. The resolution reads as
follows:
The National Joint Council of the Public
Service, having examined the provisions of the
bill to amend the Civil Service Superannuation
Act,
(1) endorses the provisions of the bill:
(2) expresses its appreciation of the action
of the Minister of Finance in facilitating its
consideration of the bill;
(3) expresses its appreciation of the work of
the Superannuation Advisory Committee, the
Departnent of Finance, the Minister of Finance
and the Government in connection with the Bill;
and
(4) expresses the hope that the Bill will be
passed at the present session of Parliament.
I also wish ,to present to the Senate a letter
addressed to the honourable leader of the
goverment here (Hon. Mr. Robertson) dated
July 15. This letter is signed by Mr. T. R.
Mont.gomery, Acting Presidenit, Civil Service
Federation of Canada. That is one of the
organiza.tions I have already mentioned, and
forms part of the National Joint Council of
The letter reads as
the Public Service.
follows:
Dear Sir.-

The Bill No. 415, An Act to amend the Civil
Service Superannuation Act, now before the
Senate for consideration, is, in the opinion of
the Civil Service Federation of Canada, one of
the most important bills affecting Public Servitce Administration which has been brought forward in many years.
The Civil Service Federation, representing
civil servants all across Canada and in every
departuient of government Las strongly pressed,
over the years, for such an Act. We believe it
to be not only in the interest of the employee
but also very much in the public interest. The
increased efficiency brought about by a betterrment of morale consequent upon the increased
promotional opportunities opened up to members
of the service due to the lowering of the retirement age will be quickly apparent and most
beneficial.
The fact that promotion in the publie service
is relatively slow and promotional opportunities
for the nany thousands in the lower grades
comparatively few in comparison witlh their
numbers tends to make the Public Service less
attractive than it should be to many highly efficient well-trained Canadians.
It should also be recalled that recruitment to
the public service now involves many thousands
of young veterans who have a right to expect
along with others the opportunity for quicker
advanceient in the future than has been possible in the past.
The above are a few of the main reasons why
the Federation has approved of the Bill and is
most anxious that it be adopted at the current
ses.sion of parliament.

li sunmming up, the lowering of the retiring
age will do three things: first, it will increase

JULY 16, 1947
efficiency; second, it will increase promotional
opportunities, and, third, it will favour the
young veterans.
The question of the proper retirement age
for civil servants is flot a new one. It was
carefully considered in 1939 by a parliamentary
committee of the House of Commons which
recommended that the permissive retirement
age bc lowered to sixty, and the compulsory
retirement age to sixty-five. As honourable
senators know, a royal commission was
appointed in 1946 under the chairmanship of
Mr. W. L. Gordon. Their report of July 4,
1946, page 21, lino 7, suggested that:
The efficiency would be improved and public
money saved if earlier superannuation were
possible. We suggest that the Superannuation
Act should be amended so as to permit of superannuation in sueli cases at the option of the
overnment
f or women. at ago sixty for men and fifty-five

685

the new provisions will not require any contributor to be retired by reason of having attainod the age of seventy years until at least
two years after the coming into force of the
legislation. Provision is also made that effective August 1, 1957, additional retirement benefits may not; accrue after the age of sixty-five
years. This provision will strengthen the effective application of the compulsory retirement
age of sixty-five years. We believe that these
changes, while perhaps increasing shightly the
financial burden on the superannuation fund
itself, will nevertheless make for increased economy in the public service because of greater
effleiency and improved morale.
In the light of the statemont of the Minister
of Finance, and considering the recommenda'tion made by the parliamentary committee
in 1939, the royal commission on administrative classifications in the public serv.ice-4-ihe
so-called Gordon cominission-in 1946, and
the civil service superannuation committee,
and in view of the approval by the national
joie~ council of -the public service on behiaîf
of the organizations which it represents, and
the special approval given by the largest of
those organizations, the Civil Service Federation of Canada, wbich. I undorstand has a
memborship of 50,000, 1 do not share the
fears expressed by my hionourable colleague
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
-thait if this subsodtion becomos law the civil
service will suifer a great loss through tihe
retiremont of trainod mon who, after i-eaching
the ago of sixty will echoose to go flshing or
inÉto private business. Thore are exceptional
cases of professional mon of outstanding
abi'lity who render valuablo service even aflter
seventy, but this is flot the general rule. In
fact, 1 know of many instances wbere men o
about sixty are already showing well-characterized signs of inefficiency.
So long as our
systom does not permit of superannua'tion a-L
sixty 'the efficioncy of various branches of the
public service will bo diminished by the retention of employees who are no longer capable
of doing a good job. 1 might point out here
that in banks and other business institutions
sixty yoars is the normal retiring age, and
1 believe that is also true of the United Kingdom civil service.
Lot us consider the probable cours& of a
civil servant who upon -reachîng bis sixtieth
birthday bas the option of retiring on pension.
If he likes his work and. ie efficient and conscientious he wiil wish. to continue serving bis
country.
It will also be to bis pecuniary
interest to do so, because in. any event hie
salary will exceed wbat be could be paid. in
suporannuation benefits, and unls he bas
alIready been in the service tbirty-fivo years
he will by remaining after the age of sixty
increaso the amount of pension payable to

Suroly my honourable colleague from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) cannot
complain that this bill does flot go as far as
the recommendations of 'the so-called Gordon
Commission. The govornment bas decided not
to differontiate betweon men and womon.
There is also a recommendation fromn the
Superannuation Committoe of the Civil Service, an organization with representatives from
the civil servants as well a from the goverument. This recommondation is summarized
in the Commons Hansard of July 4, in the
remarks of Honourable Mr. Abbott:
llnder the law as it now stands the age for
voluntary retirement is sixty-five years and
the age for compulsory retirement seventy, subect to extension by order The 1939 for a
ifurther period of five years. in council parliamentary committee had recommended that these
ages be reduce-d to, sixty and aixty-:âve years
respectively, and the royal commission on administrative classifications in the public service
recommended that the ýSuperannuation Act
sliould be so amended as to permit of superannuation in certain cases at the option of the
goverilment at age sixty for men and at age
fifty-five for women. The superannuation comnmittee of the civil service has also recommended
earlier retirement ages than now prevaîl, feeling
that general earlier retirement would, iake for
greater efficiency in the publie service ".not
only by separating those whose efflciency may
have diminished, but by accelerating the rate
of promotions in the service which very frequently are much delayed in large portions of
the civil service in existing circumstances."
The goverment bas therefore decîded to reduce the voluntary retirement age to sixty for
both men and women, and the compulsory retirement age to sixty-five for both men and women,
subjeet to extension year by year for -a further
period of five years by order in council on the
recommendation of the head of the department
and the treasury board for reasons of peculiar
efflcioncy and fitness for the position. The bill
is so drafted as to implement this decision, but

himn when he becomes sixty-five. The amount
of the pension is the average of the salary for
the last ten years of service.
A civil servant wlho desires to retire at sixty
will come under section 4 of the bill, which
provides that the Governor in Council may
grant him a superannuation allowance. In
other words, retirement on pension at sixty is
permissive; it is within the discretion of
the Governor in Council. Of course. under the
Civil Service Act, chapter 22 of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1927, section 20, as
amended, appointments to the civil service are
in principle during pleasure. I submit that the
efficient civil servant will have every indiucement to continue in the service after sixty
years of age, and that, generally speaking, he
is unable to enter private business on a satisfactory footing at that time of life. I will
admit-for I want to state the whole case
fairly-that it might be to the advantage
of professional men to retire at sixty, and
enter into private practice but at that age the
average civil servant whose work is of a purely
clerical nature would, not leave the civil
service to take up -a new line of business.
We have had representations froi various
organizations of civil servants wbich indicate
that they believe it fair and reasonable to
adopt the new retirement age provided for
in this measure. Moreover, t1here are cases
where by reason of arduous work or exposure
to extreme climatic conditions sympathetic
consideration should be given to those now
approaching the age of 65 years but who
cannot be paid their pensions under the
present act unless they become physicaltly incapacitated. In 'these cases no discretion is
given for the granting of superannualtion at
an earlier age than 65.
May I refer to letter carriers, rural mail
clerks and immigration inspectors, who have
either to "pound the pavement" or stand on
their feet for long periods of time? The
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity protested strongly that -on humanitarian grounds
we should not kill the sexagenarian by allowing him to have nothing to do. I submit
that on humanitarian grounds also, we should
consider very seriously the position of the
letter carriers, mail clerks and others who
under present circumstances would retire if it
were not for the fact that they would receive
only a refund of the amount which they have
contributed. It is well known that in a large
city like Montreal there are letter carriers
who are deserving of consideration, and who
would greatly benefit by :the lowering of the
retirement age as proposed by this legislation.

In summing up I wish ·to say that under
this bill superannuation at 60 would be put
into effect in a limited number of cases and
that it would increase rather than impair,
the efficiency of the various departments.
Tha.t is apparent from the letters and resolu,tions whieh we have before us. I cannot
take upon myself the responsibility of ignoring
the recommendations and resolutions which
I have submitted to this bouse and I intend
to vote against the amendment.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: May I ask a question
of the honourable senator, or of the officials,
through him? Are there any figures available
which would indicate the approximate number of civil servants who at the age of 60
have completed thirty-five years of service
and would be eligible for the full pension?
Hon. 'Mr. GOUIN: I will at.tempt to obtain
that information at once.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Honourable senators,
while the answer to the honourable lady's
question is being looked up may I ask why
there is a jump of five years? That is a long
period aAt that stage of life. Why could we
nou have made the voluntary and compulsory ages 63 and 68 respedtively instead of
60 and 65?
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: The figures recommended by the parliamentary committee and
by the royal commission were 60 and 65.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: Honourable senators, first may I complement my friend from
De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin) on bis able
argument in favour of the bill. His closing
remarks appealed to me strongly.
'e use the words "voluntary retirement"
and "compulsory retirement," but where in the
bill do we find any reference to voluntary
retirement? You will find reference to the fact
that the government may offer retirement at
60. If the governnent may offer retirement at
60 under the bill, it will be able to do so under
the present amendment. A man is entitled
to superannuation at 60, but if be wishes to
do so, he may continue in the service to age
65. If the amendment put it that way I think
there would be little objection.
May I read a paragraph from a Jetter presented by my honourable friend from De
Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin), which is as
follows:
It should aiso be recalled that recruitment to
the public service now involves many thousands
of young veterans who have a right to expect
along with others the opportunity for quicker
advancement in the future than has been possible in the past.
It is the usual story of pushing the old man
aside, which is not quite fair.

JUILY 16, 1947
We are told ithat under this bill there will
be quieker adv.aneement in thbe civil service.
1 ask what is to prevent advancement as far
as salaries and grades are eoneerned at the
present time? There is notibing in the act
whicb prevenIts promotion.
In my opinion a man should have the right
-to apply for superannuation at 60 instead of
at 65. As 'far as rural mail carriers and those
who do arduous labour are concerned, 60
years is a fair rotirement age, but as rny honourable friend well knows, -for elerical work
the man bebween 65 and 70 has more ability
to grasp situations than bas the younger
,man. We have only to look around ýthis
chamber to realize ühat, -the old men,-I except
the lady members-continue to work through
the hot wceather while the young people are
away on holidays.
It seems to me that the, crucial point is
this: eliminate the provision for a man to be
superannuated at sixty if he. so desires, and
you eliminate ail criticisy&. You say he is
not obliged to retire.
Supposing nobody
wants to leave the service, whore will there
be any chances for the young men who are
expecting to see the old men pusbed aside, Vo
give them opportunities of ýadvancement?
I had a visit this morning from, Mr. Montgomery, who wrote the letter which bas been
referred to. We had quite an argument, but
we concluded by agreeing witb each other
when be understood what I badin mi. He
said, "Yes, the minute we are able to get our
superannuation at sixty there will be no
trouble". Change the word'ing of the bill in
this respect, and I wilI be with you, but if
it is not changcd I could noV. agree that the
provision for retirement as set out in the bill
means exact-ly what you say it means. You
advocate voluntary retirement, but it is not so
stated tbere. Make it so; then I shaîl approve
of it. If you do not, the matter is wholly one
of interpretation. Who is going to do the
interpreting? Under a section wbich et the
moment I cannot identify, the government
"gmay" offer this. If the government "may"
off er, then iVmay press superannuation upon a
mnan, and instead of giving bim, an opportunity
of choice. of making bis own election, pressuse
will be put on him and be will bave to retire.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: At this point I wisb to
try to answer my bonourable friend . First,
there was no bad faith on my part wben I
used the expression to whicb be bas referred.
The phrase "voluntary retirement" is always
used; and in fact I qualified it with tbe expression "so-called". I would prefer to use the
term "permissive retirement". Section 6 as
revised will read:83168-451

6n7

(1) The Governor in Council may grant (a)
to a contributor who bas served in the civil service for ten years or upwards and
(i) wbo has attained retiremnent age, an annua! superannuation allowance.
Then, if we refer to section 1, subsection 4,
paragraph (jj) wbicb my bonourable friend
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. ]Roebuck)
desires to amend, we find that when be reaches
the age of sixty a civil servant may apply for
superannuation. I say that that is permissive.
Even tbough the present bill were withdrawn,
as eacb civil servant is appointed during good
pleasure, be may reccive a "notice of dismissal"
-if it may be appropriately so called. I know
also that be may be oifered reVirement witb
the advantages of superannuation,; and sucb
offer he is obliged Vo accept. But wbat
prejudice will tbe majority of civil servants
suifer if that age limit of sixty-five la lowered
to sixty? I need, not repeat ail tbe arguments.
Under present circumstances letter-carriers
would noV receive any superannuation who
bave not reacbed 65; but through the amendment wbicb. is now before us t-hey will obtain
that bene6it. My bonourable friend asked
why it is, to be assumed that opportunities.
of promotion will be crcated. Well, it is not,
a matter of pushing out those who are
rather advanced on the road of life wben
they arc efficient, but wben they sbow a
certain degree of inefficiency. If tbey are
retired, under conditions wbich 1 submit are
fair and reasonable, places are made for others
and the efficiency of tbe civil service is thereby enhanced. I would not describe such a
process as cruel; it is in fact a natural and
reasonable one.
Now concerning tbe veteýrans. It is not my
contention that through these changes in the
statute, thousands upon Vliousands of veterans
would immediately find einployment. A!! I
Say is that they would bave a hetter chance
of obtaining a certain number of positions
which by this means will hecome vacant.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Regarding tbe
specific question whicb was asked by the
bonourable, senator from Peterborough (Hon.
Mrs. Fallis), I am advised, on the basis of
estimates made in 1931, that approximately 19
per cent of all civil servants enter the service
at ages wbîch would enable them Vo complete
Vhirty-flve years of service at sixty. I cannot
say whether the percentage lias cbanged materially between that time and the present. If
the average age of entrance is bigber Voday,
the percentage qualifying at sixty, would be
correspondingly lower; if the age of entrance
is now lower, the percentage would be higber.
Tbat is aIl the information I can give.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I want to compliment the honourable gentleman in wbose
hands the government's case bas been placed
on his defence of tihis bill. The administration
could flot have chosen a more capable counsel
to ropresent them; and I presume 'that undor
thoso circumstances evcrything which could
be said bas been said in favour of the 'measure
as it stands and in opposition ýto the amondmoents whicb I have suggested. I do flot
bolieve any argument lias been omittod. I wish
also to compliment the honourable senator
from De Salaberrýy (Hon. Mr. Gouin) on
placing in our bands a most valuable document, namoly t'he reasons which have aatuated
the Civil Service Association in making their
recommendations. 1 hold in my hand that
dlocument: it supports completely the arguments whicb 1 have advanced. It is signed
by Mr. T. R. Montgomery, Acting Presidenit,
That
Civil Service Federation of Canada.
gentleman is elected to his office by t.he votes
of civil servants, must of them youing people,
bocause as time gues on the numbers of those
of advanced ycars are gradually 'tbinned, and
those eligiblo for superannuation are but a
small percentage of the total number. So;
1 repeat, this gentleman represents electors
largely drawn from the younger element.
Why does the
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSO'N:
lionourable sonator say that?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Because the younger
elass is s0 much more numerous ithan the
older ones.
AIl of them
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
get old, though.
Ahl of them get
Honi. Mr. ROEBUCK:
old in time, but nt the presenit time the great
majority are the younger civil servants, not
older ones who are ait the point of ýretiroment;
these latter are comparatively few. 1 wilh
read fro'm the letter which bas beon put in
our hands by the gentleman who is in effeot,
if not in fact his counsel.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: 1 would not caîl mysoîf
bis counsel.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Well, the honourable gentleman is a counsel, and a very good
one, and suroly ho is making Mr. Montgomery's case. This is wbat he says:
The increased efficiency brought about by a
betterment of morale.
That is to say. the people who are left in
thcir jobs are going to be mucb botter satisfied.
-a bettercieut of morale consequent upon the
increased promotional uppurtunities opened up
to inembers of tlîe service due to the lowering
of the retirement age will ho quickly apparent
and most beneficial.

Soe the significance of that statement. The
morale of the younger mon who stay in their
jobs, after the older mon are pusbed out, is
going to be increased because they will be
promoted a little quicker. I read further:
The fact that promotion in tbe public service
is relatively slow and promotiona] opportunities
for the many thousands in the lower grades
comparatively few in comparisun with their
numbers tends te make the Public Service less
attractiv~e than it should be to many highly
efficient well-trained Canadians.
Certainly the promotion for these civil
servantsq is too slow to satisfy tbcm, and I
appreciato thoir dosiýre for advancement. We
have ahl beon cager for promotion and have
struggled for botter work. For these reasons
many of us left jobs that we beld and struck
out in some other direction. The old fellows
were abead of us, but we did not. propose that
tboy ho thrown out of their jobs su that wo
would ibe promoted more -rapidly.
1 read furtber:
It should also ho recalled that recruitment to
the public service rew involves many thousands
of young veterans who have a right to expect
along with others the opportunity for quicker
advancement in the fuiture than hias been possible in the past.
I ask you to observe the concluding sentence:
The above are a few of the main reasons why
the Federation hias approved of the iBill and is
most anxious that it 1)0 adopted at the current
session of parliamnt.
The reasons are not "a, few" in number;
there is only une reasun-the younger mon
want to pusb the old-er unes out. No other
roason is sbown in this letter.
My bonourable fricnd (Hon. Mr. Gouin)
bas said tbat ecdi mani may stay in bis, office
if an urder in counicil is passed on the recomnmendation of the bead of bis department. I
bave just as mucb confidence in tbe bieads of
departments of the civil service as bas anyone olso; I feel that we have a fine civil service
in Canada and I am proud, of it. I get along
well witb various departmental officiais, and
bave met witb nothing but cuurtesy from
them. My argument at the prescrnt moment
is ent.irely in tbeir intierest. I mnay not be
riglit, but 1 feel that I am strugghing for their
interests, because I w'ould not like tu sec
an.ybody hurt.
As I have said, my honourablo friond (Hon.
Mr. Gouin) bas stated that the older mon, if
officient. may romain in their jobs provided
that the heads of their diepartments s0
reommend. Tbat is ahI rigbt for the "teacher's
pet." Ho or she wihl stay on the job. 1 am
very glad tbougb tbat I am not a civil servant
approacbing the retirement age and that my
rigbt to continue in my occupation depends
upon the smile of the man just ahead of me.

JULY 16, 1947

1 amn well pleased that that is flot MY
position. It would be ail right if I drove him
arouud in my car andi took my hat off to hlm
as I came in, and told him what a fine fellow
he was.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: And gave him an
apple.
Hon. Mr. IROEBUCK: Yes, and gave him
the teachar's red apple. If I were the "teacher's
pet" I certainly wou]d be considered the most
efficient feliow around when lie made lis
report; but heaven help me if 1 orossed him
ini bis whims. I do flot want to atta ck the
heads of the departments. They are usualiy
fair, but they are also hum-an. I do not wish
to repeat the chit-chat of civil servants but
I kxaow that 1 wouid not be prepared to place
ail of tbemi in the hands of departmental
heads.
I have flot changed my mmnd at ail, even
after hearing the very able address in support
of this bill. This is just a case of pure, simple,
unaduiterated pushing out of the older men
s0 that the morale of the younger men may
ba improved.
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, I should like to say a
word or two on the point stressed by the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity ini
the latter which the
connection with
honourable senator from De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Gouin) presanted on behaif of the Civil
Service Federation of Canada. Last night the
seconder of the motion asked me what wus
the view of civil servants in regard to thi8
proposai and, as honourable senators wili
recail, I had to frankly admit that I did not
know. Ail I could say was that I lad received
no representation against it, and that if the
opportunity arose it would be oniy proper for
me to place before the bouse an intelligent
answer to that question. I therefore asked my
honourabie friend from De Salaberry to get
aIl the information he could on the subject.
As a resuit this letter was submitted for consideration. Whatever may be the motive of the
civil service is for thom to decide. We are only
seeking to supply the Senate with an answer
te, this question.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Will the honourable
sanator permit me to say that if le is under
the impression that my remarks were criticism
of either himsalf or tha honourable senator
from De Salaberry, I wish to correct that
impression.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I appreciate that.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: You not only did
thc proper thing, but you supplied the Senate
with valuable information.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think the hoourabie senator from De Saiaberry (Hon. Mr.
Gouin) pointad out that there were differences
of opinion as to what the permissive retire-ment age should ha. The report of the Gordon
Commission advocated one thing, fhe parliamentary committee had other ideas and the
advisory committea had stili further suggestions. My honourable friand (Hon. Mr.
Roabuok) bas takan a spacific paragraph
fromn a latter writtan by the Civil Service
Fadaration and lias suggested that the proposed lagislaf ion is based on it. That letter
was writtan only yesterday, and it is too
ridiculous for words that my honourabla friend
should- prasent sudh an argument. I hava
no doubt that this legislation was introduced
only after taking fIhe recommandation of
the p'arliamantary cominittea into considration, and, for my friand to suggest that what
is containcd in ths paragrapli was the motive,
is a ridiculous statement.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I do not think that
that word is exactiy .parliamentary.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I shall withdraw
it, and say that it saems to be an unreasonalte stafement.
I want to refer to another point. The
governniant balievas that this legisiation
would be advantagaous to the public service.
It would not resuit in a Ieavy drain upon
the superannuation fund, and would prasant
an opportunîty for retirement in instances
whera ratiremant is dasirabia from the point
of view of the service. I hardly think the
'honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity is
fair in pouring sucb scorn on fIhe ambitions
of Young people.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I did not pour
scorn on the ambitions of Young people.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think that
Young men in the service who dasire t0 ha
promotad and those outsida who would like
to ha appointed to the service bava a parfectiy legitimaf a ambition, and why it should
ha regardad as something unworthy of tlaim I
cannot understand. I fail to sea how tIe bill
would injure anyone, and I should think it
would ha likely to contribufa t0 tIe efficiancy
of the public service.
If saems te me, honourable senators, that
there are amîple reasons why the amandment
of the lionourabie senafor from TorontoTrinity should not ha adopted.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROEBUICK: I rise on a point of
order. Our leader bias surely departed from
the urbane and kindly attitude that hie usually
adopts in this bouse. Firstly, bie described
tbe position wbicb I take as ridiculous.
lion. Mr. ROBERTSON: I witbdrew tbat.
lion. Mr. ROEBUCK: Ail rigbt. Tben he
said I1poured scorn on tbe ambitions of young
mon. I did notbing of tbe kind. I approve of
the ambitions of you.ng mon, but I do flot
approve of their carrying out tbose ambitions
at the exponse of older mon. Wbat we are
<liscusng is wbetber we are in favour of
legisiation whicb, as it hias been said, would
make it possible to pusb old men out in order
to imiprove the morale of young men.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourablo senators, irrespectix e of the legitimate ambition
of any person to enter or be promoted in tbe
civil service, we bave to consider in connectien with this bill the question of public
interest. I suggest that at .ixty-five inany a
man is stili capable of serving the public well.
W'o nccd (u look no fartber afield than tbe
Senate and the House of Commons to find
not a few persons who bave rcachcd that ago
an(d are still me ntal]lv and phvsically alert.
Thr public interest requires that the departnients of governiment ho able to henefit, from
ilie exporienco of capable emtployecs of long
srvije.
There, lîav b<
,sS
\xhere the
efficieey of a brancli would be improved by
the retiremient of an employe of sixty-five,
and at pro-cnt it is wiîlin the discretion of
the Governor in Couneil as to wbctbor a civil
servant -hall ho continued in office beyond
that age.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I would like to ask my
honourable friend two questions. First, bias
be anv objection to tbe voluntary retirement
of a civil servant at sixty?
lion. Mr. VIEN: No; I bave no quarrel
withi that at ail.
lion. Mr. HIAIG: The second question is
this: what is wrong with the provisio 'n tbat tbe
Governor in Council may, if hoe sees fit, suiperannuate a civil servant wbo bias reaebed tbe
age of 'sixty?
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Tbere is notbing wrong
witb that. My only objection to tbe bill is
tbat it makes retirement compulsory at sixtyfivo. I would like tbe Governor in Council
to bave power to extýend tenure of office from
ye-ar to year aftcr sixty-five.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
bill.
lion. Mr. GOUIN:

Tbat is in tbe

Section 8, page 10.

lion. Mr. VIEN: If that is in the bill, I
was under a misconception and bave spoken
to ne puepose. I uýnderstood that after an
employoe reached sixty-five the Governor in
Council wiltl flot be able to extend bis tenure.
Hon. Mr. lIOEBUCK: Let us flot get at
cross purposes. Under tbe present law the
retirement age is seventy, but the Governor
in council can extend the tenure of office
annually for five years. Tbe power to grant
extensions bias not been widely used in tbe
past, except during tbe war. Tbis bill would
lower the retirement age to sixty-five and
give tbe Governor in Council disoretion to
extend the termi of employment annual!ly for
fivýe years.
lion. Mr. VIEN: I misunderstooýd the bill.
I cannot see any objection to vo;luntary retirement of a civil servant at sixty and compulsory retiremient at sixty-five, if tliere is prevision for an annual extension of service until
the employoe le sox cnty. If that je the puirpose of the bill I entircly agree witb it.
lion. Mr. BISHOP:
providos.

Tbat is what the bill

lion. Mr. HAIG: The honourabie gentleman froni De Lorimier (Ilon. -Mr. Vien) bas
expressed, iy view exaelvy. As I read the bill
ye.sterdaY I thought that civil servants would
ho compiisorily retired au sixty-five, and I
w'anted the govol niient to hav e the right to
retain eînployees, if it se wisbed, to the age of
sevenix-. This înorning 1 found eut that tho
govcrnuîoent ha:, that discretion under this bill.
I am in favour of the provision thiat a civil
serant who x oluntarily retires at sixty will
ho entitled te superannuation. As the act
eoxv stands, superannuation benefits are not
p)ayable t0 anyone whio retires before sixtyfive. I adjoureed the ulehate on the bill vesterday in order te look into ifs provisions, and I
am satisfied ýwithi them.
The Hon. tho CHAIRMAN: Is the coinmnittee ready for the question?
Sonie lion. SENATORS: Question.

APPROPRIATION BILL No. 5
]FIRST READING

A message was received from the Heuse of
Cemmons with Bihl 457, an Act for granting
te lis Majesty certain surnis of monoy for
the public service of the financiai year ending
the 3lst of March, 1948.
The baill was read the flrst tirne.

JULY 17, 1947
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, I think I
should make a brief statement with reference
to this bill. The total expenditure under the
main estimates, together with the two supplementary appropriations, is 82,199,049,33.74. 0f
this sum, statutory items amount to $932,429,733.18, leaving a balance of $1,26,619,620.56.
It will be recalled that the appropriation bills
numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4 which already have been
passed, aggregated $390,307,633.68, so that
there remains a total amount under main and
supplementary estimates of $876,311,986.88.
This amount is made up of, first, the balance
of the main and first supplementary estimates
of $761,322,767.72, and further supplementary
,estimates of $114,989,219.16.
I would point out to honourable members
that the statutory items, which it is not neceseary to vote, include carryîng charges on the
public debt, statutory outlays such as family
allowances and other provisions in respect of
the Department of National Health and
Weifare, and items such as indemnities and
salaries for judges.
I might also point out that, while the total
expenditures of over 82,000 million are mainly
on current account, they include items of
approximately 882,000,000 under soldiers' settlement plans, and are of a capital, not of a current, nature.
The general position in respect to expenditures and revenues as indýicated by the Minister
of Finance in the House of Commons is, that
his original estimate of revenues for the current
year was in the vicinity of two, billion, 450
million, before allawing for the tax reductions
which were subsequently made. The estimate
of expenditures at that tirne was about two
billion 100 million dollars, wh'ich would have
leîft a prospective surplus of 350 million. As
a resuit of tax reductions equivalent to 160
million, the estimated surplus is reduoed to
190 million dollars. Should aIl the provinces
comne in under the contemplated plan, that
190 million dollars would be reduced by
approximately 110 million, which would leave
a balance of 80 million. It is anticipated,
however, despite the increase of approximately
114 million dollars under the supplementary
estimates, that as a result of savings in the
main estimates, and possibly somne savings in
the supplementary estimates, the general
financial situation as far as the estimates are
concerned will not be materially changed.
Hon. G. V. WHITE: Honourable senators,
the figures just mentioned by the honourable leader of the government (Hon. Mr.

Robertson) are of such magnitude 1that it is
hardly within my power ta grasp, them. As at
this stage of the session no ueful purpose can
be served by a prolonged discussion on this
important measure, we on this aide of the
house are prepared ta facilitate the passage of
this bill through i various stages.Some Hon. SENATORS: Hlear, hear.
The motion was agreed to, and. the bill waa
read the second time.
TRJRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When ahail this
bill be read the third time?

After which the Honourable the Deputy of
the Governor General was pleased to close the
Third Session of lh Twentieth Parliament of
Canada with the following Speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
The restoration of peace and world recovery
have not proceeded as speedily as had been
hoped for. Failure to conclude peace settlements
with Germany and Austria bas complicated the
political and economic situation, not only in
Europe, but thriougliout the world. Several
countries, including Canada, have approved
treaties of peace with Italy. Roumania, Hungary and Finland.

In Europe, the delay in the re-establishrment
of industries bas continued to affect adversely
the balance of foreign trade and of international payment. The severe winter and the
shortage of necessities, particularly of food,
have added to human suffering, and aggravated
the problems of relief and reiabilitation.
Unsettled world conditions have been reflected
in many of the measures you have been called
upon to consider at the session now being
concluded.
On June 30, the United Nations Relief and
Rehabilitation Administration came to an end.
The need for relief, however, lias net ended. In
recognition of this need, parliament bas made
a substantial appropriation for the purchase of
food and other essentials of life required by
peoples of war-devastated lands. Parliament bas
also approved Canadiai ntembership in the
International Refugee Organization.
Canada iN participating fully in the activities
of the Econoînic and Social Council, the Atomic
Energy Commission, and other agencies of the
United Nations. Our cotuntry is also effectively
represented at the International Conference on
Trade and Employment at Geneva.
As a result of the deliberations of a special
session of the General Assembly of the tiited
Nations, a committre, on wiich Canada is represented. was created to prepare a report on
Palestine.
An important feature of the session bas been
the renoval, in an orderly manner, of the
majority of controls and restrictions in force
during and immediately after the war. To
guard against sudden and excessive increases in
the cost of living, and for other reasons, certain
energency orders and regulations have been
continued for a further transitional period.
Another important development has been the
action taken to encourage immigration. The
government's policy involves the careful selection of immigrants and adjustment of their
numbers te the absorptive capacity of the
country. Practical steps have also been taken
to relieve the lot of many displaced persons
and refugees.
Notwithstanding the unsettled conditions
abroad, employment and national income at
home have remained at high levels. The demand for the products of our primary industries
bas, in almost all cases, been sustained. Towards
stabilizing the incomes of those engaged in
agriculture, measures relating to the Canadian
Wheat Board, and te the sale and export of
certain other agricultural products have been
enacted. The Fisheries Prices Support Act is
being brought into operation. The maintenance
of our prosperity will increasingly depend upon
how conditions develop in other parts of the
world.
In the past few months, in most industries,
Canada bas fortunately enjoyed a relatively
wide measure of industrial peace. Preliminary
consiideration bas been given in parliament te
an important measure to provide more effective
machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes and the adjustment of differences between employers and employees.
A similar
measure will be introduced at the next session.
The government bas continued te give constant attention to meeting the need for housing.
To this end, substantial amendments have been
made te the National Housing Act.
A further measure of social security bas
been provided by important amendiments to the
Ol Age Pensions Act. Increases have been

JULY 17, 1947
made in the amount of pension, and also in
the amount of other income permitted te pensioners. In addition, the pensionable age for
blind persons has been lowered from forty te
twenty-one years.
The Civil Service Superannuation Act has
been amended to include additional categories
of public servants and te permit retirement
at an earlier age than heretofore. Comprehensive changes have also been made to increase
the security provided by the Act. Statutory
provision has been made for the veteran's
preference in appointments te the civil service,
and te permit of annual increases in remuneratien te temporary employees.
Steady progress has been made in placing the
defence forces on a peacetime basis. The
Department of National Defence Act has been
amended te provide for the consolidation of the
administration of the department, and for the
establishment of a Defence Research Board.
During the session, an important announcement of joint Canada-United States policy
respecting co-operation in defence was made at
Washington by the President and at Ottawa
by the Prime Minister.
Other important measures enacted during the
session include bills concerning a dominion coal
board, a maritime commission, the Canadian
of
Corporation, conservation
Broadcasting
natural resources, loan adjustments with certain
of the provinces, the Patent Act, penitentiaries
and the Criminal Code. A benevolent fund
from army canteen and other service funds has
been established.
The representation of the people in the
House of Commons has been readjusted on a
basis which will more effectively maintain the
historie principle of representation by population.
The question of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the manner in which those
obligations, accepted by all members of the
United Nations, may best be implemented, has
been given preliminary consideration by a
special joint committee of the Senate and the
House of Commons. It is the intention of my

699

ministers te recomm'end the reappointment of
this committee at the next session of parliament.
Members of the House of Commons:
I thank you for the provision you have made
for all essential services.
A most gratifying achievement of the session
now concluding has been the substantial reductien in the level of taxation on personal incomes, which became effective on the first of
July, and which was made possible by the
drastic reduction of public expenditures. At
the end of the year, the tax on excess profits
will be removed.
Authority te conclude tax agreements with
the provinces has been vested in the government. Seven of the nine provinces have signified
their intention to conclude such agreements.
A bill te revise the income tax law was
introduced in order te permit of study and
consideration of its provisions between now and
the next session.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
The recent visit of the President of the
United States te Ottawa was deeply appreciated
by the citizens of Canada. The visit afforded
renewed evidence of the close and cordial relations of our two countries.
My ministers have been pleased to welcome
a delegation from the National Convention of
Newfoundland. Members of the delegation are
exploring the possibility of finding a basis,
which would be mutually acceptable, for the
federal union of Newfoundland with Canada.
The people of Canada have learned with great
pleasure of the bethrothal of Her Royal Highness The Princess Elizabeth te Lieutenant
Philip Mountbatten. As Her Royal Highness
and Lieutenant Mountbatten continue te face
the future with its duties and responsibilities,
it will be the wish of all that health, happiness, and divine guidance may gladden their
path through life.
Amid the uncertainties and perils of these
troubled times, I pray that the guidance of
Almighty God may be vouchsafed te our country
and all the nations.
