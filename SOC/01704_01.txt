THE SENATE

SENATE
Members of the Bouse of Commons:
The public accounts for the last fiscal year
and the estimates for the coming year will be
submitted after Parliament has reassembled.
Tiese estimates vill reflect the continuance of
the policy of ny Ministers to exercise every
economy, compatible with the proper administration of the State, until more favourable
economie conditions shall have materially
augmented the current national revenues.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
While the economie situation still weighs
heavily upon all classes of the community, there
are at last definite signs that the acuteness of
the depression is passing. I rejoice that the
wisdom of your steadfast policy of retrenchment and constructive development, which ias
aneliorated the hardships of Canadians and
maintained the enviable financial position of
this country, is stilil more fully manifest with
approaching prosperity. The strength of our
financial structure, the resourcefulness of agrk
culture, and the integrity of industry have
enabled us te take quick and profitable
advantage of improved conditions. The ratification of Empire trade agreements and your
approval of the proposed economies and reforms
in railway transportation are means by whieh
Canada's favoured position will be more fully
secured among the nations of the world.
hlie unity, fortitude and capacity of the
Canadian people, without whicb all your labours
would have been in vain. shall be now the
foundation ispon which, with co-operation and
faith, we will build a Canada greater than we
have yet known. I pray that Divine Providence
msay guide you in your exalted task.

TIE LATE SENATORS WILLOUGHBY
BELCOURT

AND

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, before the Orders of the
Day are called, even though it may not be
in full accordance with the practice of this
House, it seems to me appropriate that the
occasion should be seized te make fitting
reference to two of our number who have
departed this life since we last met. Similar
occasions are all too frequent, their occurrence
amounting almost to regularity, but those
who have recently passed from us were two
of the foremost and most distinguished members of the Upper House. I refer to the late
Senator Willoughby and the late Senator
Belcourt.
Senator Willoughby occupied the high post
of Leader of this House, and had previously
held posts of great prominence in the public
life of his province and of the Dominion. His
early life, as we all know, was spent in the
Province of Ontario. His inheritance was the
usual lot of the country boy in this Dominion,
and from the humble circumstances of his
youth, by dint of native ability and concentrated effort, he marched steadily to posts of
distinction net only in the professional but
also in the industrial and the political life of
our land. For a long period of years he
occupied a high place at the Bar of the Province of Saskatchewan.
As a young man he essayed the political
arena by contesting the old county of Cardwell for the Dominion House, but in this he
was unsuccessful. He entered public life in
1912, when he was elected to the Legislature
of Saskatchewan from the .city of Moosejaw.

OCTOBER 12, 1932
His abilities at the Bar stood him in good
stead. H1e had been a sound lawyer, well
equipped for practice before the courts, and
his abilities developed in such a way that
within a short time af'ter his first election hie
became leader of the Conservative Party in
the Legislature, succeeding one who had been
Prime Minister of the territory for many
years, Sir Frederiak Haultain-who, we aIl
Tejaioe Vo know, is stili well etnd among us.
This position Senator Willoughby resigned in
1917, when hie was called ta the Senate. His
subsequent course of publie conduct is better
known to honourable memcbers of longer
9tanding in this Huse than to me. Suffice to
say that hie sa demonstrated his ability as ta
corne in no great length of tirne, first, ta the
leadership of his own party-if we may be said
ta have parties here-and ultimately ta the
leadership of the flouse itself.
Senator Willoughby was of a modest, quiet
and retiring tem~perament, and neyer could be
induced or goaded into any display of bitterness or rancour. Indeed, his entrance inta -the
field of debate aîways had a moderating and
softening tendency, no matter what pitch the
discussion had reached. bis saundness of
judgrnent rwas highly regarded in We.stern
Canada, and I arn sure that his reputation in
that re.9pect followed him. here as well.
H1e was a man im'bued with the Western
apirit, confident ta an extraordiinary degree of
Western development, and I do flot think I go
beyond the mark when I say that hie sa pledged
his faith in that country that hie became
perhaps the largest individual landowner in
aur Dominion. lis judgment may lie at the
moment under a severe challenge, but as we
look back we -are happy to pay aur tribute
of admiration ta a -man wlio showed the
courage cd his faith in the province of his
adoption as did Senator Willoughby.
During the trying weeks of last session,
whule the hand of deaVli was plainly iapon
him, we saw hirn exhibiting the same quiet
courage that had carried him tlirough life, and
we were aIl profoundly rnoved when at last
ihe enemy proveýd too strang sud he passedl
beyond aur ken.
Senator Willoughby had no farnily, but ta
his immediate relatives-bhis brothers and
sisters--I tender on behaîf od the flouse, I
know witli the approval. of ail, aur meed of
smncerest sympathy.
Senator Belcourt, whose demise occurred
just seven days after that of Senator Willoughby, entered the arena of Dominion
affairs much earlýier than his colleague, and for
a long tirne enjoyed even more prominence
and influence. I am not as competent as many

others in this bouse 'ta speak of the part
played rby Senator Belcourt, but I recaîl, as a
young man, his election in 1896, his re-election
in 1900 and 1904, and the fact that fie occupied
the post of Speaker of the 11ouse of Commons--First Commoner of the Dominionand occupied it acceptably, and indeed admrirably, for a periad of years. H1e was called
ta this bouse in 1907. Sa it ean lie truily said
bliat the late Senator Belcourt was a member
of Parliarnent from 1896 until the day of his
death.
Educated in the Province of Québec, Sena[or Belcourt was a graduate of St. Josephis
Serninary in Three Rivers. Oddly enougli, lie
wus boru in the city of Toronto and lived the
greater part of lis life, indeed ail bis active
years, in Mie Province of Ontario. The part
he played in aur public life was certainly a
strenuous one; and while in the sphere of
contention over racial riglits, which unh9appîly lias rbeen toa frequent, Senator Bel.court was slways prominent, I pay him the
tribute of1 saying that within the arena -in
which I came into contact with bisa lie was
always erninently fair.
Senator Belcourt rendered great service ta
the Dominion as a whole. Ris activity in an
a1mast inlinite variety of affairs was little
short of arnazing, and it is flot, at ail ta, le
wondered at that delicate healtli, which pursued hisa, finally rcsulted in bis death early
in August.
11e leaves a farnily of three boys and three
girls, ta ail of wliom, especially ta, lier wlio ws
associated with hirn in ail lie activities and

perfect honour, his passion for work, his great
legal abilities, his devotion to the wel'fare and
prosperity of Canada and the maintenance
among her people of justice and mutual understanding-to this Chamber I wish to declare
that even after his death I retain towards him
the same affection and loyalty.
I cannot recall without emotion that solemn
day when I entered this Chamber for the first
time and was introduced by my venerable
friend. From that time forward I looked upon
him as my natural leader. Having stood beside him as a feflow representative of the
French-speaking minority of Ontario in this
Senate of Canada, I deplore his loss more
deeply than prcbably any other senator.
Ris soft, kind and sympathetic voice is now
for ever silent. No more shall I bear his vise
counsel, encouraging, inspiring, at times even
moderating, my humble parliamentary efforts.
Senator Belcourt's life was one of unfailing
devotion to the causes he had at heart. Among
them it is sufficient to mention the survival
of his own people as a distinct racial group in
this vast British dominion. He has now passed
into history. Ris name will be hailed by future generations with all the respect that is
due to an earnest and brilliant legislator, a
distinguished oitizen, a valiant patriot, a true
Christian, and especially with all the veneraLion that is accorded to the memory of a man
who has spent himself in the service of the
great and noble cause of education. Among
his own people his finest title to honour will
be bis ecnstant and untiring zeal in defending
their rights, their language and their cultural
traditions. It is precisely for this reason that
I have desired to make these few remarks in
the language that he spent his life in defending, a language that has its origln in the finest
civilizations of the world, a language that is
free to be spoken in this Chamber and in
every nec-k and corner of this broad Canadian
land.
And now, peace to his ashes! Yes, may he
sleep in peace, our dear departed colleague, in
his native soil, to which he was always faithful and which to-day repays his faithfulness
by tenderly enfolding his mortal remains for
evermore. He is gone, but the remembrance
of his character and worth will endure; his
memory will remain as a noble inspirati-cn and
permanent example to those who come after
him, especially to those upon whose shoulders
rests the beavy responsibility of continuing
his work.
May I venture to entertain the hope that
whcever takes his place in this Chamber will
be, in heart and mind, in justice and faith,
like him for whom we mourn, and will be
devoted to the same causes that he held dear.

THE GOVERNOR

GENERAL'S SPEECH

ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of Ris Excellency the Governor Generai's
Speech at the opening of the session.
Hon. PASCAL POIRIER moved that an
Address be presented to His Excellency the
Governor General to offer the humble thanks
of this House to Ris Excellency for the
gracious Speech which he has been pleased
to make to both Houses of Parliament.
He said.: (Translation) Honourable members of the Sena;te, it is always a perilous
honour to propose the Address in reply to
the Speech from the Thrane. The task is
particularly formidable w'hen, as happens on
the present occasion, the measures on which
we shall have to legislate are indicated
rather than defined. Let us take first the
Imperial Conference. We know that a fiscal
agreement has been amrived at between
Great Bri.tain and Canada; but ve do not
know yet, at least in the Senate, the precise
nature of that agreemenrt.
As to the Conference itself, we are already
in a position to say that it has been a great
success. Ris Excellency notes this fact and
rejoices. We rejoice with him.
There are two ways of looking at the Conference-its economic results~for Canada and
other members of the British Empire, and
the lead it gives to the world in its march
towards a higher civilization and world peace.
As for the economic success, it can scarcely
be doubted: factories are opening up, railway
earnings are on the increase, business is resuming its normal course, optimism bas revived, prosperity is returning and is knocking
at our door. From that angle we have but
to congratulate ourselves.
But there is the fact of the Conference itself
to be examined.
A group of nations meets in an exclusive
conference and decides upon commercial advantages from which the rest of the world
is excluded. Is there not in this something
to arouse suspicion-even to alienate the rest
of the world?
"What does it matter?" the Jingoes will say.
"Are we not frec to act as we wish, and
powerful enough, when all united, to ignore
the rest of the world? The British Empire
covers nearly one-quarter of the area of the
globe; its population is 460,000,000 out of a
world total of less than 2,000,000,000; its trade,
import and export, is greatly. in excess of
that of any other country.
"The world, since its origin, has never witnessed anything equal in resources and power
to the British Empire, in the twentieth

SENATE
century. The conquests of Alexander, in comparison, fade almost into insignificance, and
the Roman Empire itself, even at the zenith
of its power, never reached the stature of
the British colossus. We are self-sufficient
and can do without the rest of the universe."
Is that quite truc? Besides, is it desirable
that we should form a separate group in the
world? That we should shut ourselves up, as
Joseph Chamberlain would say, in "splendid
isolation"?
I do net think so, and the Empire delegates
did net think su. The vae soli applies to
nations as well as to individuals. The man
who lives alone, and only for himself, is a
bear among men; the nation that isolates
itself is regarded with suspicion by other
nations.
This was perfectly well understood by the
delegates at the Ottawa Conference. Great
Britain and her daughter nations were united
net in a spirit of defiance or of provocation,
but, on the contrary, in a spirit of world
Not a word was uttered that
fraternity.
might give offence te anyone.
In the face of a world bristling with customs
barriers we desire simply te protect ourselves.
From a higher point of view, might net this
protection, however legitimate, have some
objectionable features? For in raising fiscal
barriers against some. and lowering them for
others. we are in the final instance but increasing the number of international barricades
crected throughout the world.
The Ottawa Conference aimed farther and
higher. It invited other nations to enlarge
the scope of the British Zollverein until it
should embrace the universe. We are isolating ourselves only temporarily, for five
years. It is an experiment we are making.
If it succeeds, other nations will have but te
follow our examýple. We shall gladly join
with thom and there will then be a real
idvance towards universal understanding.
Can you net sec what such an understanding
:ould accomplish for world peace?
We have, it is truc, the League of Nations.
But the League of Nations aims rather at
disarmament and the prevention or restriction of hostilities. It does not reach the
fundamental causes of war. Now, these causes,
or at least many of them, have changed since
the advent of world democracy. Formerly the
ambition of a sovereign prince, the glory of
conquest, the alteration of the Ems telegram,
the whim of a court favourite, sufficed te throw
nations into armed conflict.
It is said-and it seems true-that it was
because of a visit that the cunning Disraeli
had Queen Victoria pay te "her cousin" the
Empress Eugenie, newly placed on the imHon. Mr. POIRIER.

perial throne, that France joined with England
in the military expedition to the Crimea, with
which she had nothing to do.
Of the old causes of war there remain
scarcely more than one, the desire of territorial aggrandizement. Democracy has caused
most of the others te disappear. But it has
given rise te a new cause-commercial exchange. Capital to-day is the absolute monarch
of other days. Nations seek to enrich themselves at the expense of other nations. This
is the spirit which must be fought. The
ultimate result of the Imperial Economie Conference will be to combat such a spirit. When
the nations shall have reached an understanding with one another with regard to their
trade relations, the heigbt of the fiscal
bariers to he raised between them, and the
method of interchange, the most profound
cauSes of armed conflict will have disappeared.
The League of Nations will then no longer
have much reason te exist.
The Ottawa Conference is an invitation to
the rest of the world te work out a method of
commercial exchange applicable to all nations.
Here, perhaps, may be found the solution
of the great problem of universal peace.
Canada in that case-for it was upon the invitation of our Prime Minister that the British
nations assembled in Ottawa in August last
-Canada will have been a precursor.
What leads one to believe this is the fact
that sevcral nations have already awakened to
the idea of enlarging the cirele described at
Ottawa by the ropresentatives of the British
Empire-enlarging it, peacefully, until it em,races the world. There is soon to be a
universal conference in London. and there is
every reason to believe that our example will
he followed.
The speech of His Excellency alludes te
several other very important subjects to be
studied-the railways, redistribution of electoral districts, the banks, the St. Lawrence
Waterway. I will net touch upon those
subjects, feeling that I have already tried
your patience long enough. Besides, they will
net come before the two Houses of Parliament until after the resumption of the session
in the new year.
Honourable
Hon. J. A. MACDONALD:
members of the Senate, in rising te second
the Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne I would ask the indulgence of my
fellow senators while I make some reference
to matters contained in the Speech. Before
doing so, permit me to express my great
appreciation of being associated with the
His long political
mover of the Address.
service has been of great advantage te his

OCTOBER 12, 1932
country, and bis experience bas been such an
extensive one as has been had by few in
the public life of Canada. He entered this
Hlouse in 1885, at the early age of thirtythree, and has ever since been one of its
most active members. He is an outstanding
French Acadian, and among those of us who
were born and reared in French Acadian
communities his name is honoured and
respected. We have followed bis contributions to Acadian literature with great interest.
Always a staunch Conservative, hie has ever
been a disciple of his great chief tain, Sir
John A. Macdonald. I amn certain that the
Acadians of Nova Scotia will feel honoured
to-day by the presentation which hie has
made in'their native language.
(TroailaiEo)
Mr. Speaker aind honourable
colleagues, it is a great pleasure for me to be
able to compliment in bie own language the
honourable mover of tbis resolution. On ail
occasions bie shows himself to be a worthy
representative of the French of Acadia. The
English--speaking Acadians are just as proud of
him, and dlaim for the wbole of Acadia the
honour of possessing this noble ffon. An orator
admired by the public and in Parliament, bie
bas maintained bis high reputation in the
speech to which we have just listened. We
congratulate him and tban-k him.
(Texi) I tbink we can ail agree that the
Prime Minister deservies the gooidwill of ail
oixr people for successfully biringing &bout the
Imperial Economic Conference and obtaining results which wilI undoubtedly be of considerable benefit to rnany of the industries of
Canada. Two years ago, at the Imperial
Economic Conference in London, Mr. Bennett
invited the Empire delegates to rneet in
Ottawa. He went furtber than any other
important statesman at that time by rnaking
a definite offer of a furtber preference to
British goods, provided a business arrangement were made between the two countries.
The Conference met bere in July and was
probably the most important ever beld within
the Empire. It attracted world-wide attention, particularly in countries wbose trade
wîtb Great Britain or the Dominions was
tbreatened tbrougb any agreements that
rnight be made. For nearly four weeks the
delegates discussed matters of trade, not only
between thernselves and Great Britain, but
with one another, and freim that Conference
bave corne twelve different trade agreernents.
Four of these directly concern Canada, there
being one ea.cb witb Great Britain, Soutbern
Rbodesia, South Africa and the Irish Free
State. These agreernents are being placed
before Parliament to-day for ratification, and
wilI, no doubt, go into effect.

For the first tirne Canada has secured in the
British rnarket a decided preference on rnany
of hier products, particularly wheat, fruit,
bacon, canned fisb, copper; in fact, on ail
important products of Canada. It is expected
that these preferenees will secure a market
for Canada and will free this country from the
disastrous competition of sucb countries as
Russia in the British wbeat market. A tentative arrangement has also been reacbed to
provide a wider market for Canadian lumber
in Great Britain, and this will do mucb to
revive the lumber industry, wbich is so important to almost every province.
On the other band, Canada gives to Great
Britain greater preferences on more than two
bundred items, almost exclusively manufactured goods. It is believed that these preferences will not injure any Canadian industry,
but will increase the market for British goods.
In addition to the immediate benefit which
Canada will secure, it is believed that this
Imperial Economic Conference was but the
beginning of a movement to conserve Empire
trade for Empire people, and that Canada,
looking to the future, rnay be confident of
a steadily increasing trade with tbe Motherland.
One of the greatest problems that bave concernied governimente in Canada is railway
transportation. The large and continually increasing debt of the Canadian National Railways threatened the financial stability of the
country. The Bennett Government appointed
a Royal Commission, presided over by Mr.
Justice Duif, te inquire into our transportation systerns. In the meantime botb railways
were urged to practise the rnost rigid economies, and the Governinent is being conLeratulated that the cost o! operating the roads
has been brougbt witbin reasonable bounds.
The Commission bas reported to the Government, and the report is now before Parliament. The report recommends that the
identity of the two railroads be preserved, and
competition in transportation maîntained, but
it provides a court to eliminate unnecessary
and expensive competition and to see that
justice is done to each of the railways. It is
hoped that, througb the elimination of unnecessary competition and the increase in
business wbicb now appears, the railways may
regain some measure of prosperity. This year
the Government will bave to advance to the
Canadian National Railways $70,00O,000. It is
also hoped that this deficit will be reduced
very rapidly in the years to corne and that
the systemn will become self-sustaining.
Honourable senators, it is generally conceded that during the past two years, wben
there bas been a world-wide depression, Can-

SENATE
ada has come through in better shape than
any other country. There has been great
unemployment in this country, but it prevails to a lesser degree than in the United
States under similar conditions. One of the
chief causes of the depression bas been the
low price of farm commodities. I am sure we
all trust that there will be an increase in the
price of these commodities, which is necessary
in order that prosperity may be brought to
all parts of the country. It is a matter for
congratulation to Canada that during this
depression not a Canadian bank, trust company, mortgage company or insurance company lias failed. Up to the present time in
the United States 11,189 banks have failed,
with total deposits of nearly $600,000,000.
There has been no outbreak or disorder in this
country; our people have stood steady under
the depression, and in the main have carried
on in a way which shows that they are confident and hopeful of the future.
Immigrants have been barred, except Canadians returning from the United States. It is
believed that the Govermnent would be well
advised to discourage any further immigration
until our own people are placed in work at a
substantial wage. A movement is now being
carried on between the Dominion and provincial gov ernmuents to place a certain number
of unemîployel from our cities and towns on
the land. This, it is expected, will be continued, so that surplus labour will be put on
the farms and become self-sustaining.
it is felt that the wors-t of the depression is
past; that while the return to prosperity will
be slow, it will be steady, and that with the
increase in business there will corne more employment and a big reduction of the burden
on the governmments and on municipalities.
In the Speech from the Throne the Government takes a bright outlook as to the future.
It is preparing to assist the unemployed this
winter, or until general schemes can be put
into effect next spring for giving work and
wages to all. An enormous federal expenditure
has been incurred in providing employment
and relief, particularly in the four Western
provinces, where the financial condition of the
governments was acute. During the past three
years one of the provinces, namely Saskatchewian. bas suffered on account of a severe
drought. We are happy to say that to-day
its crops are abundant, and distress in that
area has been relieved.
The Government has made an agreement
with the United States for the development
of the St. Lawrence Waterways. There bas
been no critici-m that the agreement is not
fair to Canada as regards expenditure. Some
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD.

have criticized and thought that it meant a
dangerous procedure. The work on the St.
Lawrence Waterways will immediately have
an effect on employment throughout Canada.
When the project is completed it will give
a water route from Fort William to Halifax,
Sydney and all European seaports, and will
be a cheap trade artery for the exchange of
products between the Middle West and world
markets.
Honourable senators, I think we can safely
congratulate ourselves on the way in which
this country has come through the world-wide
depression, and that we can look to the future
with every confidence that we shall gain
prosperity more rapidly than any other country
in the world.
I have nuch pleasure in seconding the
motion for the Address in reply to the Speeceh
from the Throne.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
debate was adjourned.

THE PRICE 0F COAL
Before the Orders of the Day:
lion. R. LEMIEUX: Honourable senators,
bei are the Orders of the Day are called 1
should like to direct a matter ta the attention
of the right hanaurable leader, if I arn allowed
to do so. On the eve of a winter whîch will
possibly be very severe, especially for poor
people-and I think the mal ority of the people
are poor-I arn informed that there is a combine of coal merchants. The price af coal
somýe years ago was about haif what it is
to-day. It is surprising that a product that
oost, say, only $8 a ton a few years ago is now
selling at $14, $15 and even $16 a ton. Many
people would be grateful ta the Goverament
if the situation were investigated by the
Minister af Labour, and I would ask tbe
rigbt honourable gentleman kindly ta refer
the ma4ter ta tbe Minister and stress the
urgent necessity af relieving the public mind
of the impression under which it is at present
labouring.
Right Bon. ARTHUR MEIGREN: Honourable senators, the subi ect af an increase in
coal prices, or the allegation that an increase
bas been brought about by a violation of law,
bad not previously been drawn ta my attention. As a private citizen purchasing coal,
like other citizens, I have been very gratified
ta find in my awn bill a reduction from the
prîce af two and three years aga. However,
I do nat think the fact that any former Government may bave been delinquent should at
ail impede the present onc in doing its duty,
if there is a duty ta be done in tbe premises,
and I shall cail the attention af tbe Minister
af Labour ta the points made by the honourable gentleman tbis aiternoan.
CONVERSATION IN READING-ROOM
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honaurable senators,
1 desire ta call the attention af the Huse ta
a practice that I think is wrang, and anc that
is growiog; that is, the holding ai loud and
long conversations by some senators among
themselves and their iriends in the readingroom, a practice which makes it difficuit for
others ta read at the same time. This condition bas been existing for some years, but
it appears ta be worse this session than
formerly. If it ig against the rules it sbould
be stopped; if it is nat against the rules, I
tbink the mIles shauld be amended. Sbould I
be the only one who is inconvenienced and
who abjects, I will withdraw my abjection,
but I think I arn not the only one.
Hon. G. LYNCH-STAUNTON: If the honourable gentleman and other members would

speak Ioudly enough for everyane ta hear,
there would- nat be so much conversation
going on.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: The honourable gentleman's complaint was about conversation in the reading-room. I ar not able
ta be in there sufficiently either ta verify or
deny the accusation, but I shall bring the
matter ta the attention ai the apprapriate
committee of the House.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Wben a senator gets
up in the middle of the Chamber and looks
at the Speaker while making an address, it
is very difficult for the aider members sitting
back bere ta bear or understand what is
beiag said. I tbink that when a member is
addressing this House he should face the
opposite side, the Govemament or the Opposition, as the case may be.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Yeu get bad
habits in the Commons.
TUE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed fram yesterday consideration ai Bis Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the apening of the
session, and the motion af Bon. Mr. Poirier
for an Address in reply thereto.
HonourBon. RAOUL DANDURAND:.
able members ai the Senate, I desire ta convey ta the honourable gentleman from Acadie
(Hon. Mr. Poirier) and the honourable
gentilemazi frorn Richmondi-West Cape Btreton
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) my appreciatian of the
very intere.sting- addresses that we heard from
them yesterday. The honourabie gentleman
from Acadie bas been a solid pillar of this
temple since 1885. We all admire bis continuing youth, which we hope he mnay maintain for very many years ta camne, He delivered bis speech in excellent andi moqt appropa'iaite French; lie ýcould not do otherwise,
for be is a master in the language; and we
oaly hope that ha will continue bis activities
amang us for many years.
As ta, the honoutrable gentleman from
Richmoad-MWest -Cape Breton (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald), I hope that, enjaying as he
does the fine breezes ai the Atlantic, he will
follow in the footsteps ai aur bonourable
frienti from Acadie (Hon. Mr. Poirier) and
remain ta become ane af the pillars ai this
temple.
We bave just receiveti in this Chamber a

Rainville). From tbis aide af the Bouse I
desire ta welcome him. I do sa with all the

SENATE

greater pleasure because lie was a Iaw student
in my office, and I venture the opinion that
hesides learning law hie may have learned the
way to manage and win elections.
We are met here, heneurablo members of
the Senate, at this early heur of the autumn,
te discuss the trade agreements that were
laid before us last evening. It is necdless fer
me to state what has been the poiicy of the
Liberal Party in the matter of tarif enactments. We hav e aiways faveured a mederate
tariff, believ ing that it would help te reduice
the cest of living fer the peeple of the ceuntry.
Liberalism in ccenemics cxpands trade abread,
and threogh cempetitien at home reduces the
cest of living; and while I have net studied
the presenit agreements very miinutely up te
this moment, te the extent that they tend in
that directien 1 heartily give themn my
approval.
I have said that the Liherai policy has
always tended te have a mederating influence
in tariff matters. The preference granted te
Great Britain by the Laurier-Fielding Governmient had for its main ebjeet the implementing
ef the pregramme of the Liberal Party as decided upon at the Cenfcrcnce ef 1893. The
rettuction that we grantcd te British geeds
net enly hel]ped te reduce the rost of those
geeds te the consumer in Canada, but at the
sanie time heiped te reduce the price ef cemnmodities imperted frem ether ceuntries,
becausc it had te ceme dewn te a preper
level in order that such gonds might enter and
cempete in our market. We couid net at that
time think ef asking Great Britain fer any
preferential treatment. For many years Great
Britain maintained the pelicy ef the open
deer, and we had free entry inte that ceuntry.
At ail the Imperial Cenferences that feliewed,
however, Canada's stand was that if ever
Great Britain was dispesed te alter hier fiscal
policy we sheu*ld then have a preference in
hier market.
At the Conference ef 1902 Mr. Joseph
Chamberlaini stressed the advantages ef the
Deminions geing a littie further in the
preferences that they wcre giving te Great
Britain, and Mr. Fielding answered that
Canada weuld be disposed te do more if she
were given a preference by Great Britain. We
ail knoýw that during the South African War
an imrpost ef one shilling per quarter on wheat
and fleur was fixed by the Chancelier of the
Exchequer. At the Conference ef 1902 Sir
Wilýfrid Laurier asked that this duty should
be continued and extended te other farm
products, and stated that under such conditions Cinada would 'bie dispesed te mcrcease
ber preference te Britain. Net only was the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

request fer an extension of the duty refused,
but hardly had the Conference dissolved when
the shilling impnst was dropped.
In 1902 Mr. Joseph Chamberlain was starting on his campaign for fair trade, that is,
for senme duty which wouid pretect the British
market and at the sanie time give a preference
te the Dominions. In 1906 hie went te the
people of Great Britain on that very question: their answer ivas a decided negative. As
1 read the discussions that took place at the
varions conferences that feilowed, the matter
was breught up in cvery phase at evcry meeting- of represenitatives ef the Dominions and
et Great Britain. Then the War of 1914 intervened. The situation seemed te be altering
in a way that would be ag-reeable te the
Dominions. At the Conference of 1923 there
was n ray o.f hope that Great Britain would
do something tuwards granting them a preferonce. Mr. Baldwin was inclined te extend the
MeKenna duties. Our representatives at that
Confer-ence were the thon Prime Minister, the
Right Hon. Mr. Mackenzie King, my right
honeurable friend te my left (Right Hon.
Mr. Graham) and Sir Lomer Gouin. Tue
stand they teck is illustrated in the correspendence, which xvas published hy order of
Parliament in 1924 as Sessional Peper 111.
On Octobor 23, 1923, the Prime Minister, on
behiaif of the Canadien delegation, wrete te
Sir Philip Lloyd-Greame, President of the
Board of Trade, as follows:
My dear Sir Philip,-MIýy colleagues and 1
have been censidering withi care the proposais
as te preferentini duties put forward by the
Governuiient of Great Britain at the meeting of
the Conference on Octeber 9, and which 1
(lisenssel -with yen in our conversation at the
Boardi et Trade on Saturday morning.
These proposais, -which it e-as ebserved \vere
within the framework ef the existing fiscal
system et Great Britain, wvill, -we believe, be
reeeived in Canada with due iappreciation as
ef distinct value te Dominion preducers.
On two subsidiary phases of these proposais,
questions have been put fer consideratien by
the Dominion representatives:
(1) The duty on "other dried fruit" is propoed te be imposed on "such fruit, e.g., apples,
pears, and peaches, as the Dominion representatives may consider of interest te their
frade." The dried fruits suggested, in addition
te those already included, appear te comprise
those in w hicli our producers are chiefly
interested.
(2) As te tobacco, two alternative proposais
are made, stabilization et the existing duty
over a terni ef years, or an increase ot the
oreference from one-sixth to one-fourth. An
increase et the preference would, in our belief,
present most in the way of advantage te the
proclucers et tohacco in Canada. As to the
course which the British Government and
Parliamient should tolilow, we -would net venture
te express an opinion.
More important are the generai issues raised
in the statements made by yourself in your

OCTOBER 13, 1932
presentation of the present proposals, and by
the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I may quote
from the statement made by the Chancellor:
"We want you to tell us whether what we
have proposed is going to help you, whether
our proposals can in any way be improved, and
if so, in what direction. That does not bind
us to accept any suggestions that you make
to us, any more than you are bound to accept
any suggestions we may put to you as to what
we might desire by way of increasing our trade
with you; but it does give us the opportunity
at any rate of realizing what the position is,
and then it will be for us to say whether,
consistently with the interest of our own people
here, we can carry out what you have suggested to us."
In response to this welcome overture, I have
pleasure in giving you a brief statement of our
position.
Canada has been the pioneer in the modern
development of preferential trade within the
British Empire. She gave us the first preference to British goods in 1897-8, and took the
initiative in requesting the abrogation of
treaties which stood in the way of Imperial
This policy she has steadfastly
preference.
The Canadian preference now
maintained.
covers, in varying degrees, practically the whole
range of competitive British exports to the
Dominion. During the last session of Parliament, a ten per cent discount on existing duties,
constituting a further increase in the prevailing preference, was provided in the case of
British goods imported through a Canadian
port. Canada has given preference in ber own
interest as well -as in what she conceived to
be the interest of the rest of the Empire. It
bas never hitherte, .in the case of the United
Kingdom, been made conditional on the grant
of an equal preference in return. We have at
all times recognized the importance of conceding to each government concerned the right
to legislate as its own interests might demand,
on tariff matters, or, in other words, complete
control over its own fiscal policy. Should the
British peoples deoide at any time that it will
be in their own interests as well as what they
conceive to be the interests of the Empire to
make far-reaching changes in their present
fiscal policy, Canada will naturally expect that
in the establishment of a tariff, full and
adequate consideration would be given, through
preferential duties, to the interests of Canada's
producers and to the substantial preference
which Canada accords to British goods.
Coming specifically to the proposal of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer that we state what
preferential duties would be of most advantage
to our producers, and noting that the Chancellor quite properly observes it wilil be for the
British Government to consider whether such
duties would be in the interest of the British
people, I now outline some of the chief Canadian exports to Great Britain in which an
effective preference would be of most value.
The list, of course, is not exhaustive.
Wheat obviously comes first and easily foreIt is our most important article of
most.
export; the quality is unquestioned; the market
is now highly competitive; Canada's export
surplus is greaîter than the total British
import.
Next in export importance among the grains
comes barley, of which Canada normally produces sixty to seventy million bushels, and
exported to the United Kingdom last year about
ten million bushels.

il

Milling, particularly of wheat flour, ranks
high among Canadian industries. It is closely
and naturally connected with our agricultural
industry. The production of flour normally runs
about 15,000,000 barrels; last year our exports
reached nearly 7,500,000 barrels, of which
nearly 5,000,000 came to the United Kingdom.
The industry is capable of very great expansion
if greater markets are opened. Flour is, of
course, a commodity of which the production
and milling capacity in Great Britain is large.
The effect of a duty would, therefore, depend
very largely upon the extent to which the
Canadian miller was put in a less advantageous
position than the British miller; a duty which
was distinctly protectionist rather than preferential would not, in the long run, we believe,
be as advantageous to Canadian millers as the
existing situation.
Of the other agricultural products, excluding
those already covered, the most important are
fresh fruits, apples, peaches, pears, and plums,
all of which Canada produces in unexcelled
quality, and, especially in apples, in very large
quantities, with difficulty at present in finding
profitable markets; (for Canada, a preference
on fresh fruits is of much more importance
than on dried or preserved fruits); cheese,
butter and eggs, bacon and hams, canned vegetables. Of our fishery products, canned salmon,
which is faced with competition from the
United States, Japan, and Russia, would at
present be most helped by a preference.
Sir Philip Lloyd-Greame acknowledged the
letter, as also did Mr. Neville Chamberlain,
and declared that in the course of the week he
would continue the discussion with my right
honourable friend to my left (Right Hon. Mr.
Graham). This took place in October, 1923.
What followed is well known. Mr. Baldwin,
who had a majority of two or three hundred
in the House of Commons, submitted to the
people the issue of protection against foreign
goods, and in January, 1924, was overwhelmingly defeated on that issue.
This explains the situation that followed,
and up to 1931 the answer of Great Britain
to all requests for a preference was in the
negative. But economic nationalism gradually
closed most of the markets of the world and
increased Great Britain's difficulty in exporting goods. The British people were then
brought face to face with the necessity of
changing their traditional policy, and the
members elected at the last election felt that
this was an opportunity which up to that
time had been denied them, and that they
had a mandate authorizing them to impose a
duty upon foreign goods. The Right Hon.
Mr. Bennett in 1930 had encountered the
same cool temperature that his predecessor
had experienced, but 1931 brought a ray of
hope to the Dominions.
The recent agreements have just been disclosed to us, and I confess that I have not
been able to go minutely into their various
details. I will refer only to some matters
which seerm to call for comment, and perhaps

OCTOBER 13, 1932
I wonder if these are not mere words. The
protection to be granted to new industries is
a matter within the discretion of the Government and Parliament of Canada. I remember the time when a freer trade Government-I am referring to the Laurier Government-refused to give protection to a new
industry until its production reached twothirds of the quantity of such goods necessary
to supply the country's needs.
This Article 10 reminds me of the proposition made by Mr. Joseph Chamberlain in
1902 or 1903, in the course of a famous speech
in which he said that if preference on the
British market were granted to the Dominions
they would have to bind .themselves not to
develop new industries. His statement was
strongly criticized, and he eliminated it from
the speech as revised and published later on.
I saw a copy of the original speech and a
copy of the revised one in our Parliamentary
Library. Article 10 is very similar in principle to Mr. Joseph Chamberlain's proposition, and may have been inspired by his son,
Mr. Neville Chamberlain. This article need
not have been put into the treaty, because
it may be taken for granted that no government would think of granting protection to
any industry other than those indicated in
this undertaking. Of course there was an exception nade-and it may be said to prove
the rule-when we levied a duty on glass for
a few months. It was not practicable and was
soon withdrawn.
Article 11 reads:
His Majesty's Government in Canada undertake that during the currency of this Agreement the tariff shall be based on the principle
that protective duties shall not exceed such a
level as will give United Kingdom producers
full opportunity of reasonable competition on
the basis of the relative cost of economical and
efficient production, provided that in the application of such principle special consideration
shall be given to the case of industries not
fully established.
Article 12 binds the Government to do what
it is already obligated to do, that is, to establish a tariff board.
Article 13 says:
His Majesty's Government in Canada undertake that on the request of His Majesty's
Government in the United Kingdom they will
cause a review to be made by the Tariff Board
as soon as practicable of the duties charged on
any commodities specified in such request in
accordance with the principles laid down in
Article 11 hereof and that after the receipt of
the report of the Tariff Board thereon such
report shall be laid before Parliament and Parliament shall be invited to vary wherever necessary the Tariff on such commodities of United
Kingdom origin in such manner as to give effect
to such principles.

13

Article 14:
His Majesty's Government in Canada undertake that no existing duty shall be increased
on United Kingdom goods except after an
inquiry and the receipt of a report from the
Tariff Board, and in accordance with the facts
as found by that body.
And Article 15:
His Majesty's Government in Canada undertake that United Kingdom producers shall be
entitled to full rights of audience before the
Tariff Board when it has under consideration
matters arising under Articles 13 and 14
hereof.
Reverting to Article 11, providing that-- the tariff shall be based on the principle that
protective duties shall not exceed such a level
as will giv e United Kingdom producers full
opportunity of reasonable competition on the
basis of the relative cost of economical and
efficient productionit seems to me that this is a mere collection
of words, for under such terms high protection can be justified, and has constantly
been justified. It is the difference in cost of
production that has been the main reason
for increasing duties.
But more extraordinary still is the creation
of a tribunal before which the Government
of Canada may b cited as a defendant. His
Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom apparently would be the plaintiff, but we
all know that the complaint would be made
and the machinery set in motion by producers.
I cannot find in the treaty any reciprocal provision in favour of Canada, for the Government of Great Britain does not bind itself to
set up a tariff board in London. It seems
strange that we should set up a tribunal of appeal to call in question the action of our Government and our Parliament. One would have
thought that any question arising by reason of
our abiding by the terms of the convention
should not be decided in that way, but that
we should have some say in the matter.
Article 4 is of very great importance to
ranada, since under it, by a stroke of the
Den, we might lose the advantages that accrue
to us under one of the schedules. It reads:
It is agreed that the duty on either wheat
in grain, copper, zinc or lead as provided in
this Agreement may be removed if at any time
Empire producers of wheat in grain, copper,
une and lead respectively are unable or unwilling to offer these commodities on first sale in
the United Kingdom at prices not exceeding
the world prices and in quantities sufficient to
supply the requirements of the United Kingdom
consumers.
Article 4 gives the United Kingdom the right
to withdraw advantages that are accruing to
Canada under the agreement in respect to
grain, copper, zinc or lead. If my right honourable friend can find any extenuation for that
article I should be glad to hear of it.

14

SENATE

I sec that Article 7 says:
His Majesty's Government in the United
Kingdom will invite Parliament to pass legislation which will secure for a period of ten
years from the date hereof to tobacco, consigned from any part of the British Empire
and grown, produced or manufactured in
Canada, the existing margin of preference over
foreign tobacco, so long, however, as the duty
on foreign unimanufactured tobacco does not
fall below 2/0d. per lb.. in vhich event the
margin of preference shall be equal to the full
duty.
The article provides for legislation covering
ton years, but the convention is for five
years. I cannot reconcile the termination of
the convention with the retention of Article
7. Perhaps my right honourable friend will
explain what appears to be an anomaly or a
contradiction.
It seems to me that in the application of
those agreements there is no equality of
treatment in London and in Ottawa. Are we
not independent units, equal to one another
and entitled to equal and fair treatment?
What effect will these agreements have
when we meet the outside world in the
Economie Conference shortly to be held in
London? Will they stand as an example to
the outside world, as some assert, or will
they be an impediment, as others contend?
Although I have gone through the treaty
agreements but hastily since they came into
my hands last night, I notice that there are
increases in duties which will stand before
the World Conference, and which may be
deemed to be impediments in the way of a
general tariff reduction. We must not forget that at the World Conference of 1927
there was a unanimous resolution in favour
of reduced tariffs. Even our good friends on
the other side of the line joined in that
resolution, though lately, I hear, Mr. Hoover,
the outgoing President, has stood for higher
more
tariffs and promised the electors,
especially in the agricultural communities,
still higher tariffs on some commodities.
I think the Right Hon. the Prime Minister
will find that economic nationalism will not
be regarded as restoring prosperity throughout
the world. Under it our transportation by
land and sea has broken down. The best
excuse that has been formulated for a high
tariff is that it can be used as a negotiating
instrument. If se, it would be, at best, but a
transitory or provisional argument. I hope
that by means of the instrument forged by
the present Government it will be possible to
obtain throughout the world such advantages
as will help to make thait instrument unnecessary, because a high tariff, while it stands,
is a great hindrance to the farming comHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

munity. Equilibrium must be established between farm products and industrial products,
for only thon will the purchasing power of the
farming community be restored. During the
late days of last session, I think, I stated that
the Archbishop of Montreal in a very important pronouncement had said that the
farmer alone should not bear the burden, and
that if high wages were the cause of the high
cost of production those engaged in industry
should bear their portion of the load.
The railway problem will be before us when
the Government's policy on the subject is
known. Whether or not the legislation will
follow closely the terms of the report of the
Royal Commission or embody its conclusions
I cannot say, but it will be interesting te see
the result of the Governrnent's cogitations on
this matter.
As to the St. Lawrence Waterway Treaty, if
the Senate of Canada awaits the pleasure of
the Senate of the United States before acting,
and the United States Senate runs true to
form, it will be some years before a conclusion is reached.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEICHEN: Honourable members, all of us in this House are
proud of the long service and fascinating personality of the honourable senator from
Acadie (Hon. Mr. Poirier), and the fact that
he was chosen to perform the duty of moving
the Address at this session, and that he
accepted, has given us a pleasure which bas
been added to by the manner in which he
performed that duty. The honourable senator
from Richmond-West Cape Breton (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) is new among us, being the
youngest member of this House until to-day,
and in following the oldest member of this
House he has well and truly performed the
task of seconding the motion for an Address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne. I
extend my congratulations to both of them,
but to the honourable sonator from Acadie
I do so with the deference of a novice te a
professional.
I have listened with very keen interest and
great care to the speech delivered by the
honourable leader of the other side of the
House. The debate on the Address is, or
ought to be, the first great inquest of the
nation's representatives into its affairs. Certainly it should be made such by this House,
and should be conducted just as earnestly and
as thoroughly and universally-if the word is
not too strong-as in the Lower House. There
is no way in which we can perform our
duties botter than by making this the occasion of a searching enquiry, and we ought te
seek to conduct that enquiry with the businesslike efficiency of which we think we are en-

climate and the distances they have to travel
to get to the market place them under substantial hardships. Consequently, the benefit of that quota should be Canada's benefit,
in the main. Governments can only provide
opportunities, can only open the door. It
is for industries to take advantagc of the
opportunities and pass through the entrance
that is obtained.
In respect of the tobacco provisions of the
treaty, I have to admît frankly that I eannot make any satisfactory answer at the
moment to the questions put by the honourable senator who has just spoken; but I will
undertake that as good an answer as I ýcan
find shaîl be given at the appropriate time,
when the treaty itself is under review.
I should think that when tbe treaty expiresbut I am speaking only off-hand-all its provisions would expire, but probably the tenyear limit that is in the tobacco provisions
is one that obtains when the treaty goes on,
as it is contemplated that it will go on, past
the ordinary five years named in the provisions.
There bas been criticismn offered of certain
terms of these pacts that have to do with he
principles which Canada must follow, in comnpliance with the pacts themselves, in relation
to tariff policy. The only complaint is that
these are principles that no goverument
would think of violating. Possibly that :s
truc. But the difference between what is
going to exist under this treaty and what bas
existed will be this: under the treaty a
tribunal with the status of a court will be
established-it is already established, it is
truc, but it will be given functions under
this treaty-before which tribunal ail questions having to do with the application of
those principles will be dealt with. In a
word, the actual application of the principles
that we ail agree should he adhered to is
shifted from the political arena of gîve-andtake, fromn whiat is usually callcd log-rolling,
to a tribunal that will base its decisions upon
certain definite ideas and principles. Surely
that is an advance.
Itý is stated here, for example, that Great
Britain shahl have competitive conditions of
trade with this Dominion. That is to say,
if the level of wages is at a certain point in
0
bngland and at another point here, the tariff
pi liall be such ns will reasonahly atone for that
tC ifference in wages-and of course for differ-iences in other factors of production too. But
ý_1t shaîl not go beyond that; it shall fot reach
*qniy exclusive or prohibitive status at ail.
j3û

17

The level of competition shahl be maintained
so that the British prodilcer will have an equal
show, regard being had to the different costs
cdf production, with the producer in this
country. No one could describe the practice,
if it follows that principle, as being high or
prohibitive protection. It is only what is fair
-and, indeed, essential, if industry in this
country is to live. What 1 contend at the
moment is that it is infinitely better to have
the application of that principle in the hands
of an impartial tribunal, operating with the
status of a court of justice, before which al
interested parties can be heard-the final
decisions, of course, having to be with the
Parliamnent of Canada-it is infinitely better
to 'have the principle reviewed before such a
tribunal and to have that tribunal's report
bel ore us than it is to have things donc in
the rather haphazard and ccrtainly none too
successf'ul way in whicha tbey have been donc
in the ipast.
1 have not übserved in the treaty any terms
under which Canada can argue before a court
in Great Britain that Canadian producers of
grain or metals have been complying with provisions of the treaty to the effeet that they
must have the goods to sdil and be willing to
seli them at world prices on 'lhe British market
in order to get the prior entrance into that
market which the treaty provides. But I do
flot think we need worry very much on that
score about the grain producers, for we know
their trouble is that they have the goods and
want to seil them. That is their distinct
objective, their only objective. There is no
danger in the world about their flot being
ready to siapply the Britisb market with the
quantity of goods that market can consumeand indeed with double the quantity-at ahl
tîmes. And I do not think there is very much
danger that the producers of lead, zinc and
copper, who also get advantages by way of
priority under the treaty, are going to be in
default in that regard. If difficulties should
arise that could not *be settled by an interchange of views, there would be, I think, no
objection by any party to this treaty to our
being given the right to be heard cither
before a tribunal in Great Britain or before
the Government itself. The fact is that the
British Government felt that the principles set
ulp would 'be fair if they werc carried out,
and they were content to leave the carrying
out of themn to a judicial tribunal. In this
way- they are relieved from the uncertainty
that would follow if the execution of the
treaty were ledt to, thc varying vagaries of
succeeding governments in Canada.

REVISED EDITION

SENATE

I pass from such hurried remarks as I
have made on articles 10 to 14, which were
discussed by the honourable senator, to his
comment on the references to the Canadian
National Railways in the Speech from the
Throne. The Speech says that legislation will
be laid before both Houses of Parliament
looking to a correction of abuses, in the way
of extravagant management and of costly and
unnecessary competition, which have brought
the system to the pass in which it is to-day.
I have a great interest indeed in all matters
that pertain to the Canadian National Railways. They were brought into existence,
against a spirited opposition, just prior to the
beginning of the last decade, because of a
succession of more or less disastrous events
that followed the tremendous riot of railway
building in the early part of this century.
One after another of the projected systems
fell into liquidation-which simply meant that
it fell into the lap of the Government-and
more or less dragged other, more successful
roads into the same unfortunate morass. Efforts
were made year after year to help those systems by means of Joans, and when it became
impossible to pursue that course any longer
the Government of the time faced the alternative of allowing liquidation of the lines competing with the Canadian Pacifie and the
consequent passing of the best paying of those
lines into the hands of their competitor, leaving on the Government's hands a heterogeneous, disconnected mass of roads that could:
not possibly be made lio pay, or of colileotng
all the lines into one great whole and bringing
them necessarily-for there was nothing else
that could be done-under the control and
ownership of the people of Canada.
The latter alternative we accepted. We
accepted it, as far as I was concerned-and 1
think the same may be said for all concerned
-not because of any sentimental enthusiasm
for government ownership of industry as
such, or even of utilities as such, but
as the better alternative before us, under
the unfortunate conditions that had been
brought upon us by errors of times before. The roads were to be under the management of the man who chiefly had directed
through a very difficult period the line that
was then most national in character and the
most essential of all the elements of the new
aggregation.
The new system was run, so far as I know,
without error of policy, certainly without the
error of extravagance and without the error
of corruption.
It was run cleanly and, I

of office at the end of 1921, and for about
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

nine months thereafter. In that period of
time the gain in overtaking the deficits of
the past was the greatest in the history of the
system. Yet that was not a prosperous period;
on the contrary, it was the time of the first
depression following the War. Even in that
depression very gratifying results were obtained. The succeeding Government paid its
tribute to those responsible for those results,
which we all hoped would be continued. But
that Government, which came into office at
the end of 1921, decided that the whole slate
had to be cleaned. So far as I know, only
one member of the former Board, Mr. Ruel,
was retained.
The management was dismissed; the general manager was told to go.
The man in charge of the most vital of all
the functions of administration, finance, whose
record was unimpeachable, was told to pack
his kit and get out. Then there dawned
upon us the era of Sir Henry Thornton.
Sir Henry Thornton was entitled at the
hands of the people of Canada to every
opportunity to make a success of the National
Railways of this country, and I do not think
anyone will say he did not get that opportunity. I recall to the House certain basic
principles of the legislation which, against
great resistance, we succeeded in passing in
1919. The two greatest of those principles
were that the day-to-day operation of the
road, the management of its personnel and
property, should be in the hands of a board,
with a general manager at the head, uninterfered with by the Government, Parliament,
or political influence of any kind, but that
in the sphere of capital investment and finance
the Government, with Parliament at its back,
should be supreme.
It was never dreamt of, never should have
been dreamt of, that the policy of "Hands
off the C.N.R." would mean hands off control of the capital and finances of that system,
but such interpretation apparently was given
to it by the Government which came into
office in 1922. It was not long before there
were features of control of that system which
seemed to me to warrant attack. Attack at
that time was not well received by the
people of Canada, and much was the abuse
heaped on anyone who dared challenge the
judgment of those in control. The policy of
"Hands off the Canadian National " was
proclaimed from end to end of this country,
the changes were rung on " Hands off Sir
Henry Thornton," and our hands were certainly kept off him and off the system.
However, time works to cure most of the

luls of this world.

Now we have the result

OCTOBER 13, 1932
of that policy in all its significance-the
result depicted in the lurid pages of the
report of the Transportation Commission.
We have the result in a burden on the backs
of the people of this country, the heaviest
any young country ever bore with respect
to any single enterprise, a burden from under
which it is going ta be tremendously difficult
for us ta emerge, and it will take us a very
long time indeed. You can look anywhere
over the length of this Dominion, at either
coast, in any province, almost in any city,
and see blazing instances of extravagance,
an extravagance wholly at the expense of the
taxpayers, an extravagance which is the principal chain that ties the feet of Canada today. Because of the condition which we had
reached, because of the effect of that condition on world money markets, because of
the fear expressed in relation ta it, because
of the world-known rate of extravagance at
which the Canadian National was going,
something had ta be done, first, ta expose
the situation, and, next, ta suggest a cure.
The Duff Commission made a very, very
thorough inquiry. Now they have made their
report. At the moment I am not going ta
comment on that report. I am not sure that
in every regard it is what I should like. The
people of Canada are jealous of the National
System; even those who criticized the very
thought of government ownership in 1919,
even those who were elected ta the other
House because of their declared and eternal
enmity ta any such system, became adherents
of government ownership, became almost
idolaters of the then management. And
indeed, though in a way the travel has been
hard and though the errors have been blazing and terrible, I do not think government
ownership of utilities is to-day any more
unpopular than it was in 1919. I have no
doubt the members of the Transportation
Commission, in framing their report, kept
well in mind that the Canadian people are
still jealous of the Canadian National System.
If the National System is ta be continued
under separate management, then, in my
judgment, no very serious criticism can be
made of the report. Certainly there are
many features of it that are ta be highly
commended; there are some that involve
difficulty. An attempt will be made ta put
into effect all the recommendations if
possible, certainly all that are practicable.
That is the legislation which is referred to
in the Speech from the Throne, and which
in due course will be brought down for our
consideration.

I close my comments on the subject with
this statement, that certainly I have suffered
grief in previous years, knowing the end ta
which the National Railways were hurrying.
I do not know that there is anyone in this
country more keenly anxious for their success
than I, and I do earnestly trust that with
the approval of all something can now be
done ta restore conditions that will enable
them ta be run economically, as any business
enterprise ought ta be run, under principles
and through an organization that will be adhered to and supported by men of all parties
and by all classes of people in this country.
But if we again allow things ta go as they have
been going, then it will not imatter much
whether we are believers in government ownership or not; we shall have reached a stage
where it will not be possible for this country
ta pay its debts.
At this time I am not going ta make reference ta any other features of the Speech from
the Throne. There are certain of them of
very great importance, but not peculiarly
interesting ta the Upper House. The subject
of redistribution is of course one entirely for
the House of Commons. The subject of
waterways is not of very immediate interest
ta us now, inasmuch as there must be approval
first by the Senate of the United States before
anything is submitted ta this Parliament at
all. I do not pose as an authority on the
St. Lawrence Waterway, but if on a balance
sheet presentation something is ta be gained
for the benefit of this country by the construction of that work, then I think the terms
are such as are fair as between this Dominion
and the United States. However, this, along
with other features of the Speech from the
Throne, will come before us for more careful
treatment when they are in specific and
separate form. For the present I thank the
honourable senator for the fairness and
thoroughness of his criticism, and I trust that
the same fairness and the same thoroughness
will characterize the treatment of the Speech
from the Throne on the part of all other
honourable members of this House.
Hon. J. S. MoLENNAN: Honourable gentlemen, after the two brilliant speeches ta
which we have just listened with great interest,
I feel somewhat uncomfortable in speaking
on the various pointa dealt with in the Speech
from the Throne. In common with those
honourable senators-although I may not be
able ta express my sentiments in such apt
terms-I desire ta congratulate my friend from
Acadie (Hon. Mr. Poirier) on the graceful
manner in which he moved the Address in

20

reply to the Speech from the Throne. It is
always a pleasure to hear his felicitous
language, and naturally one regrets not to
have such a perfect knowledge of the French
tongue as would permit the fullest appreciation of his eloquent periods. I also congratulate mv fellow memxber from RichmondW'est Cape Breton (Hon. Mr. Macdonald),
who seconded the Address. It will give me
warm personal pleasure if ho becomes the
useful member of this House that those who
have known him in the past feel confident he
will be-ome.
I have no intention of dicussing in detail
the various subjects contained in the Speech
from the Throne, particularly those which
have been so adequately and so exhaustively
treated in the two speeches with which we
have been favoured this afternoon. But I
(1o desire to bring to the attention of this
House the St. Lawrence Waterway in its
possible relation to and effect on the Maritime
Provinces. It is generally adimitted that the
inclusion of the Maritime Provinces was
essential to the success of Confederation. One
can scarcely believe the present commercial
and industrial development of this Dominion
would have be
possible had we been deprived of ice-free ports on the Atlantie coast.
These were provided b' Nova Scotia and
New Brunswick.
But the economie forces
which came into play about ithat time very
seriously affected those provinces; their merchants were hampered b the competition of
the merchants of the older and richer and
more highly developed provinces, and their
great shipping indistry sadly declined. lu
spite of those adverse conditions the Maritimes
did their full share in providing money to
develop the West, to develop the canal system
of the Dominion and to build the railways,
which finally reached British Columbia and so
consolidated Confederation. The Maritimes
also helped to bring about that amazing development which has made Canada the preponderating factor among the wheat-prodicing
ctountries of the world. I am not passing any
opinion on whether this is the right time to
undertake completion of the St. Lawrence
Waterway, but I do desire to bring to the
attention of honourable senators the feeling
very generally held in the Maritime Provinces
that this development will be disadvantageous
to their coal mining industry, which is the
great ganglion of the economie life of those
provinces. They fear that a waterway whici
will carry the products of the world te the
head of the lakes will prejudicially affect the
coal trade of Nova Scotia. I am not saying
that that fear is well founded, but if there is
Ti

Mnr. Ml ENNAN.

even danger that the development of the St.
Lawrence Waterway for navigation and power
purposes may intensify competition in their
coal trade with the great central industrial
and manufacturing provinces, I hope that the
representatives of the other parts of the
Dominion will sec to it that the interests of
one of the original and most important sections of this great country are adequately safeguarded.
Those whvo have sat in this House for a
certain number of years are aware that on
more than one occasion we have had to make
momentous decisions. The right honourable
leader of the Hose, in the course of his speech
this afternoon, recalled one such momentous
decision with respect to what is now known
as the Canadian National Railways. At that
time some of us regretted to find ourselves
in opposition to the policy of the Governmaent,
but I venture to say that had our views prevailed then the Duff report would be sonewhat less unpleasant reading to our people
to-day and Parliament would net be called
upon to find a remedy for the present dtsperate
situation. In view of these ciroumstances I
feel that the St. Lawrence Waterway project
should receive very careful consideration. I
would recall to honourable members the report
of the Tanner Committee on this subject,
particularly the evidence given by Col. Dubuc,
Chief Engineer of the Department of Railways
and Canals. It seems to me to point to the
great advantages of the deep waterway and
the necessity of some enlargement year by
year of our waterways system.
Ir. Dubuc
had been speaking about the tonnage the
canals will carry and the mnmber of lockages
that can be made day by day, and the question was put to him:
Are those figures illuiminating? Do they ielp
the present and future problem?
Col. Dubuc: 'They help in this way. If it
has been proven to your satisfaction. froin
official records. what the present capacity of
the main canal system is at the weak points.
and vou assume future increases fro what has
actually bappened in the past, you may reasonablv deduct when the ultiniate capacity of those
canals will probably be reached.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
It was never
reached.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN:
No, but we are
getting nearer and nearer to that point. I
am quoting an expert; I am not giving my
own opinion.
You must equally not lose sight of the fact
that the deep waterway will not be utilizable
util eight to ten years after its construction
is started.
i

W th the last six or seven years as a guide,
t seems clear that even if you started the
construction of the deep waterway to-day, long

OCTIIBER 13, 1932
before you could complete it you would have
congestion in the canaIs, and the present
system would nlot he able to cope with the
traffic that should offer.
Then, in answer to the question, "And we
shall lose traffle?"ý Colonel Dubuc said:
Either it will be divertcd to American porte,
or else it may find its way down to the lower
end of Lake Ontario and then move by rail to
Montreal at whatever extra cost this may be.
It may equally be diverted by rail to Pacific
ports or by boat to Georgian Bay ports and
rail to the Eeaboard, or by the new Hudson
Bay route now under construction to Fort
Churchill.
There is other evidence of the saine kind.
Q. You have to have more canais to keep on
with anythiag like that increase in business?
Col. Dubuc: Exactly. You would later have
to rebuild your whole system.
Theii, later, 1 find the follow ing:
Q. The cost of the deep waterway has to he
increased hy the cost off these necessary
improvements?
Col. Duhuc: If yon. want to have your canal
system able to handie the traffie which is liable
to present itself in the next ensuing years.
Q. Your present capacity woulýd be quite
exhausted by-what did they tell us?-I think
1934?
Col. Dubuc: The traffie will depend on many
tliings.
I hope the traffic will not be absolutely
congested by 1934 and that we shaîl still bc
carrying on in a fairly satisfactory way, as
we have done in thc past. But my point is
that the possible exhaustion of our facilities
for transport is one of the things that should
determine us to weigh fully the advantagcs
off a still greater development for carrying the
trade off Canada so that the business and the
wcalth and the reputation off Canada may
go on increasing.
One frequently hears the statement that
the building of the ýSt. Lawrence Waterway
to enable ocean vessaIs to reach thc lakes is
going to hurt thc port of Montreal. I have
looked over the history of a considerable
number off the ports off the world and I have
nlot been able to find a single instance in which
a port with an established business bas not
almost immediately experienced a great increase in traffie when it has been bold in increasing jts facilities. I have made some notes
to which it will not take me long to refer.
For examaple, up to the year 1863 Antwerp
was under the disadvantage of having to pay
toîl on the Scheldt to Holland. In that year,
when Antwerp was opened to the business off
the outer world by the purchase of the Dutch
right to levy toil, its business amounted to
haif a million tons. In 1913 it had increased to

21

fourtccn million tons. Then came the unhappy interruption of the War. Step by step
port facilities were increased, but the incrcase
bas been justified, and in 1926 the business off
Antwerp amounted to twenty-two million
tons. Antwerp has now started to carry out
one of the largest schemes of port development
that have ever been undertaken, namely, to
provide dockage facilities of no less than 1,300
acres. Liverpool and similar ports have something like 300 or 400 acres.
We know something about Liverpool and
Manchester. With respect to traffle going by
an already established port, the situation off
Liverpool is the nearest parallel I know to
that off Montreai. Manchester, as you know,
is the centre of the most thîckly populated
industrial area in the world.
In the early
eighties it was in a grievous state. Iu 1881
there were eighteen thousand cmpty houses
in Manchester, trade was leaving it and milis
were moving to Liverpool, Glasgow, and other
places where cotton and other commodities
moving inward or outward would not have to
be towed such a great distance. A Manchester
man off no great importance at this time, a
Mr. Adamson, thought the situation intolerable. Ha got some people to join with him,
and together they devaloped the idea of the
Manchester Ship Canal. It took them three
years to get their Bill passed by Parliament.
Liverpool objected, and the railways objected,
but finally the Bill was passed in 18W. The
working people of Manchester wcre heart and
soul behind the project, and one history of
the development tells us that off the first £100,000 raised to carry on the work £60,000 were
in subseriptions of £10 each. The work was
begun in 1887, and the canal was opened in
1894. During the first year the canal carried
900,000 tons and earned £97,000. The first
dividend was paid in 1915. In 1927 six million tons entered the port off Manchester, and
the port authorities earned £1,567,000. One
would have thought that such a volume off
business going direct to Manchester would
have injured Liverpool, but the railways
lowered their rates and the port of Liverpool
continued to grow and to increase its facilities.
One off the ironies off fate is that Liverpool is
the chief market off the world for cotton, the
great standby off Manchester. I am sure that
what Liverpool or any other place has done
Montreal can do, and will do if occasion arises.
On motion off Hon. MT. Michener, the debate
was adi ourned.

IMPERIAL

ECONOMIC CONFERENCE
AGREEMENTS

On the motion te adjourn:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I may say
that we hope te finish the debate on the
Address to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: In reference to what
the right honourable leader of the Government lias just said, I should like to ask him
a question. Will the trade agreement come
before this House next week for consideratien? The idea that I have is this. Many
of the members, myself among the number,
do net feel that they are capable of discussing the trade agreement without having
had an opportunity to read it over and a few
days for consideration. The debate on the
Address affords a unique opportunity of discussing the agreement and every other subject mentioned in the Speech from the
Throne.
When the trade agreement has
passed the other House and is brought here,
everybody will be eager to go home, for Parliament will have nearly finished the work
for which the session was called, and the
agreement will net in my judgment receive
from this House the consideration it ought te
receive. Could we postpone discussion of the
Address until next week, so that some of the
members might have an opportunity te discuss the trade question then?
The leader of the Liberal Party in the
other House and several other members felt
that the trade agreement was so important
that further time should bo allowed for the
consideration of it, so that it might be discussed intelligently. This view was presented
to the Prime Minister, and he thought it
reasonable and postponed the discussion on
the trade agreement until next week.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As I understand it, the contention of the honourable
gentleman is that we in this House shall not
have a reasonable opportunity•to discuss these
trade agreements, because after they pass the
other House they will have completed their
fall business and will want to adjourn.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:

Yes.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Adjournment is as much the prerogative of the Senate
as of the House of Commons. I would also
call the attention of the honourable gentleman to the fact that it is net a trade agreement, but trade agreements.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN.

What is that?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They are in
the plural, net singular, and I feel certain that
they will pass one at a time, and will come
te us in that way. I speak subject te correction by anyone who knows the particulars
botter than I do. The honourable member
asks when the agreements will be likely to
come. I can only estimate how long the
opposition will take in the House of Commons. I have no such means of intimate

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: There is no

I certainly have made no effort to curtail it.
We shall meet to-morrow, and I am sure
we shall listen with great pleasure to the
speech of the honourable gentleman from
King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes). If we do net
finish the debate to-morrow night, we shall
adjourn it.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I wished to bring
that feature to the attention of the right
honourable leader of the House before temorrow. It is worthv of consideration. I know
there are some members who wish to speak,
but who are not prepared to speak this week.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
If this debate
could continue until next week, I should have
considerable to say in answer to the statemonts of the right honourable leader of the
Government; but it takes me some time to
prepare. I want te examine the whole of
the Duff report, and although I read as much
of it as I could last night, I got through only
about one-third. I should like te deal as
justly with this report as I did with the
Drayton-Acworth report. But, of course, if
the debate is te be finished to-morrow I
shall net be able to do that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have given
assurance that I am net urging the closing
of the debate to-morrow. If honourable
senators want to continue the debate, I have
no objection.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If it is net possible
to refer te the matter in this debate, there

ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, with leave of the House I move,
seconded bv the honourable senator from De
Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), that when
the House adjourns to-day it stand adjourned
until Thursday next, October 20, at 8 o'clock.
It dons not seem by any means certain that
there will not be business of an important
character before us by that time; therefore I
do not feel like taking the responsibility of
moving a longer adjourniment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The right honourable gentleman has mentioned my name as
seconder. It is an a;t of courtesy, although
it is as well an aet of policy on his part to do
so. However I do not object.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I do not abject to
the adjournment, if it is necessary, but I
should like the right honourable gentleman to
teill us whe.ther nothing can come over to us
from the other Bouse bafore Thursday next.
Is the Address to be debated over there until
then?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not anticipate it will be, though I am exceedingly
timorous about saying what may be done in
the other House. But that is the best estimate one can give of when there may be
business for this House.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I do not object, but
there are the public to be remembered.
The motion was agreed to.
GYPSUM QUEEN INVESTIGATION
Before the Orders of the Day:
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honouraile members, it is within the knowledge
of us all that since we met last a commission

appointed by royal authority has concluded its
investigations into certain transactions in connection with the sinking of a vessel known as
the Gypsum Queen, and that these investigations disclosed the fact that very substantial
sums of money were taken from the treasury.
According to the report, they were wrongfully
taken. In the, report of Mr. Chief Justice
Harvey, of Alberta, who was the Royal Commissioner, an honourable member of this
House, the senator for Cumberland (Hon. Mr.
Logan), is seriously refleated upon in connection with the receipt ad those moneys. The
Government, having received the report, had
to decide what should be its own course in the
premises. It becomes my duty to reveal to
the Senate the decision of the Government
and also to state what course, if any, I think
this House should pursue. I have had conversations with the honourable membeir, at his
request, and indeed but for an intimation from
him that he intended to make a statement
on the subject at the opetning I would have
stated the position of the Govenirnment then.
He has postponed making a statement, and I
feel, and have advised him accordingly, that
a pronouncement should not be delayed past
to-day.
On the receipt of the report it was referred
to the Department of Justice for an opinion
as to what would be the appropriate course,
regard being had to the law which surrounds
the whole natter; and following the report
a.f the.t depairtment it has been decided that
action should be taken for the recovery af the
moneys so paid out ofi the treasury of Canada,
from the parties who received them, in'cluding
the honourable senator from Cumberland.
These proceedings for the recovery of the
moneys are now under way.
Under the immediate circurnstances, I do not
think it is necessary for the Senate to take any
action in the premises.

Apart fromn the problemn of meeting the increasing demand for direct relief, there is the
problcmn of prex enting a lowering of the
morale of fthc unemployed who congregate in
vast numbers in our large centres and become
more or less a menace to law and order. If
the unempînyment were to continue for only
a yegr or two. doubtless direct relief would
lia the most economical way to tide over flie
period of distress. But what is the prospect?
Take for example the building trades: if is
generally believed thaf for saveral years no0

have found profitable employment in various
building lines, together with archifeets and

ernment do some prospecting for oil and
organize under competent geological men,
say, two or three crews for each of the Western Provinces?
According to the law of
averages they should at least discover two or
three major oil fields, which in time would
employ thousands of men and supply Canada
with her national needs in cil. If the $85,000,000 sent out for oil products to-day could be
spent in Canada in developing our own cil
production, this in itself would take up a great
number of the unemployed.
I read recently a bocik called "Oil Imperialism," by Louis Fisher. He shows the important part that oil has played in the affairs
of nations throughout the world, from the
days before the Great War until the present
time. For many years the great statesmen of
all countries have 'been aware of the importance of oil, and they have realized that the
nations that properly look after their oil resources are the nations that will have a place
in the sun. From every standpoint it seems
that the Government
should endeavour
to organize the development of the oil
industry in this country.
I would not recommend the Government to
undertake work in any industry in which
there is now overproduotion, such as the coal
industry. However, I do think that the rates
for transportation from Western Canada and
from the Maritimes could be made sufficiently
low to enable Canadian coaal to supply a much
larger part of central Canada's needs. The
late ex-Minister of Railways, Honourable Mr.
Reid, made a statement in the Senate some
years ago that as a result of inquiry into the
cost of carrying coal from Alberta to Ontario
lie was satisfied it need not exceed $5 per
ton. If that rate were put into effect it would
enable Western Canada to compete in the
Eastern coal market for the supplying of at
least 500,000 tons. On account of the soft
nature of Alberta coal it has been difficult
to develop a wider market in Ontario, but
there are areas which could provide semianthracite coal of a fixed carbon content of
over 80 per cent, which would compare in
every way with the Pennsylvania coal now
used in Ontario, and these areas might be
developed if encouraged by the freight rate
I have mentioned.
The Trade Commissioner of Alberta has supplied me with the following data, which I am
sure will be interesting to the honourable
members of this House. He says:

The position in regard to the matter, as I
understand it, is briefly this. Test shipments
of coal have been run for three or four years,
and, while not reaching a very large volume,
have been sufficient to demonstrate that a
market is available in Ontario, providing the
coal can be sold at a price competitive with
fuels which are now enjoying the market.
Dealers of course will not, nor could they be
expected to, bend their efforts in a sale of
Alberta coal unless by so doing they can enjoy
the saine measure of profit they now enjoy in
the sale of American and other fuels.
The recent hearing by the Railway Board
was for the purpose of determining if possible
to what extent the railways were out-of-pocket
in the movement on coal, without regard to
overhead and those other expenses which are
constant, whether the movement takes place or
not. The Board, I understand, have not yet
made their reports to the Government, and
when they do I think it is the official opinion
that it will be necessary to enact special legislation to make a rate of $5, which is all the
traffic will bear.
This memorandum is prepared with a view
to showing the amount of additional employment to labour that would result from the
movement of 500,000 tons of coal froa Alberta
to Ontario in a twelve-month period.
It should be realized that the total amount
of coal imported into Ontario from foreign
countries, for domestie use only, is two and a
half million tons. It would be a comparatively easy matter to secure for Alberta five
hundred thousand tons of this, providing a
freight rate were secured of $5 per ton.
With 500,000 tons of Alberta coal being
moved to Ontario it would provide employment to railway men alone as follows:
Each moving train load of coal will give
work to a crew of five, out of each of the 16
divisional points between Alberta and Ontario.
In other words, it will provide 80 days' work.
Allowing for each train to be made up of
sixty cars, each car holding 36 tons of coal,
we find that each train will transport 2,160
tons. On this basis, in order to transport
500,000 tons, 250 trains would be required. As
80 days' work is provided by one train, 250
trains would provide 20,000 days' work.
The yard movement on these 250 trains would
provide 8,000 additional days' work.
The car and locomotive repair work on the
250 trains would provide 3,000 additional days'
work.
The fuel used by the locomotives on these
250 trips would amount to 190 tons per trip,
a total of 47,500 tons. Alberta coal would be
used for 50 per cent of this haul, which would
mean an additional amount of Alberta coal
used, of 23,750 tons. As each three tons of coal
used provides work for one day for one man,
we have a further 7,916 days' work.
These cars that come down with coal from
Alberta have to be hauled westward again.
The railway companies' statistics show that the
expense of the return haul is 80 per cent of
the cost of hauling the fully loaded train eastward. If, therefore, employment of 38,900 days
was provided in the hauling of 500,000 tons of
coal eastward to Ontario, employment to the
amount of 31,120 days would be provided on
the westward haul. The transportation of the
500,000 tons eastward and the return of the
empty cars westward would, therefore, provide
70,020 days' work.

As has been stated before, the unemployment problema will be with us even after we
have a moderate return of prosperity. The
"iron man" has, through the application of
scientifie invention to industry, and even to
agriculture, displaced so rnany men that it
will be impossible to find work for everybody
for years to corne. Our vacant lands and our
great naturai resources must supply the opportunity for those who cannot be employed
otherwvise. Unless the Government takes the
responsibility of creating state enterprises, it
will encourage a degeneration of our citizens,
who, after ail, are our greatest assets. Canada
has ample lands and resources. The opportunity is here for the Government to lead the
way by constructively organizing different
national enterprises to enable the unemployed
to make thernselves useful citizens,' and at
the sarne tirne to bring rewards to the state
in increased production of gold, oul, f oodstuffs,
and, best of all, in restored rnanhood. In
short, the Government has the opportunity of
leading the nations of the world into economie
recovery.
BRon. JOHN LEWIS: Honourable senators,
I desire to join in the congratulations to the
mover and the seconder of the Address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne, and
if I do not add anything to what has been
said in this connection it is because I want
to borrow language far more felicitous than
Mny own.
1 agree with the honourable gentleman who
has just taken his seat that the question of
unernployment is by far the most important
one that is now before the country, and I
think we ought to acknowledge our indebtedness to him for the suggestions he has made,
whether ail of them may be workable or not.
I had intended to defer any remarks I had
to make on the Imperial Conference agreements until they were before us, but as it is
possible we rnay not have thema here unti
near the close- of the session, I have decided
it is better to speak now. I arn ail the more
willing to do so becausa I do not intend to
discuss the details or to make any predictions
as to the possible benefits to accrue from
those -agreements. I apologize for falling into
rny bad habit of reading, but on the whole I
think the House will get some relief in this
way, because it tends to brevitv.

summer of 1930.
I observe that the Montreal Gazette takes
a sober if not sombre view of the grain
preferences. It says:
The grain preferences rernain the outstanding gains so f ar as this country is concarned.
Western producers have expressed a curions
indifference teward this advantage, f ailing to
realize, apparantly, that what rnay ha of slight
banefit te them. under existing conditions rnay

That is putting the tirne a little further f orward than I should prefer.
I confine mysaif te. the general principles
whicb should gove-rn our relations with the
rest of the British Em~pire. Gen-erally speaking, I arn in favour of those provisions of the
agreement which, eniarge trade, and against
those which restriet ta'ade. In that respect,
I concur wit'h what wvas said by Mr. Baldwin
at the opening of the Conference:
Reverting now to Empire trade, we hope that
as a resuit of this Conferanca wa rnay ha able,
not only te maintain existing prafarencas, but
in addition to find ways of increasing them.
There are two ways in which increasad preferenca can ha given-aither by lowaring barriers
among oursalves or by raising tham against
others. The choîce betwaen these two must be
governed largely by local considerations, but

world. No nation or group of nations, however
wealthy and populeus, can maintain prosperity
in a world whera depression and imapovarishment reign. Let us therefore airn at the lowering rather than the raising of harriers, aven if
wa cannot f ully achieve our purpose now, and
let us rernember that any action we taka here
is bound te have its reactions elsawhere.
This is the principle underlying the Liberal
policy of Imperial preferential trade. The
first step in that movement was the Fielding budget of 1897. The measure was oe
wholly of reduction of duties. Mr. Fielding
expressly repudiated the idea of dernanding
that Great Britain should tax wheat or other

30

SENATE

foodstuffs as a condition of our lowering our
duties on British imports. And this was not
only because of good-will towards Great
Britain, but because he did not consider that
we were making any sacrifice or concession
for which we should be compensated. His
position was that Canada as well as Great
Britain would be benefited by the reductions.
He regarded trade not as a subject of war
or conflict, but a benefit to both parties. And
the results showed that he was right. Because,
in the decade 1901-1911-when the preference
under the Fielding Tariff was in force-the
product of the manufacturing industries of
Canada increased from 481 millions to 1,165
millions, more than twice as great an increase
as in the whole period from Confederation
to 1901.
The same happened during the King
administration when the British preference
was enlarged, and also reductions were made
in the general tarif. The produet of our
manufacturing industries rose in annual value
from $2,500,000,000 to $4,000,000,000, between
1921 and 1929. There was a fall in value in
1930, due of course to the world-wide depression, but even in that year it was nearly a
billion more than in 1921.
The same principle was observed in all the
trade agreements made by Liberal governments. They provided always for reductions
of duty, never for higher duties on the imports from countries not included in the
agreement. The same is truc, also, of the
Sir Wilfrid
submitted by
memorandum
Laurier to the British Government during the
Conference of 1902. The Canadian ministers
stated that if they could be assured that the
Imperial Government would accept the principle of preferential trade generally, and particularly grant to the food products of Canada in the United Kingdom exemption from
duties now levied, or hereafter imposed, they
-the Canadian ministers-would be prepared
to go further into the subject and endeavour
to give to the British manufacturer some
increased advantage over his foreign competitors in the markets of Canada.
This
memorandum has been quoted more than
once as an evidence
that Sir Wilfrid
Laurier set the
example of bargaining.
But you will observe that Sir Wilfrid made
no demand upon the British Government
to impose duties on food. He asked for a
reduction, not for an increase. He asked
simply that Canada should be exempted
from any duties then or thereafter imposed.
It will be remembered that a small duty of

to about three cents a bushel, was imposed

Then, instead of accepting Sir Wilfrid
Laurier's suggestion, the Imperial Government took the duty off altogether, and in a
subsequent election the proposal of preferential duties was rejected by the British
electors. After that, Sir Wilfrid apparently
dismissed the matter from his mind. He did
not withdraw the Canadian preferences. He
took no part in Sir Joseph Chamberlain's
campaign. He did not make taxation of food
for the benefit of Canada an issue in Old
Country polities, as it is to-day.
The letter from the Prime Minister of
Canada to the President of the British Board
of Trade, quoted by my leader yesterday,
is of the same tenor. It asks for a remission
of duties, not for an increase. I quote:
't-the Canadian preference on British importsbas never hitherto, in the case of the United
Kingdom, been made conditional on the grant
of an equal preference in return. We have at
all times recognized the importance of conceding to each government concerned the right to
legislate as its own interests might demand, on
tariff matters, or, in other words. complete
control over its own fiscal policy. Should the
British peoples decide at -any time that it will
be in their own interests as well as what they
conceive to be the interests of the Empire to
make far-reaching changes in their present fiscal
policy, Canada will naturally expect that in the
establishment of a tariff, full and 'adequate consideration would be given, through preferential
duties, to the interests of Canada's producers
and to the substantial preference which Canada
accords to British goods.
There is no demand there for taxation of
British food for our benefit.
There have been, outside of this Chamber,
expressions of opinion that because of the
extension of self-government at the Conference of 1926 the Empire was in danger of
disintegration, and that the old bonds being
gone, the Conference of 1932 was necessary
to forge new bonds of an economic kind.
From that view I entirely dissent.
The
declaration of equality of status made in 1926
was the completion of a process of growth in
self-government, which, so far from threatening the Empire with disintegration, was and
is the true basis of Imperial unity. Free
institutions, as was said in the paper containing the declaration of equality of status,
are the life blood of the British Empire;
free co-operation is its instrument. If there
was any tendency to separation-which I
deny--the process would surely not be
checked by the British Commonwealth meet-

OCTOBER 14, 1932
ing and bargaining like separate nations. And
while 1 do nlot believe that even that will
rasuit in separation, I very much doubt that
good relations will be improved by the bargaining process or by restrictîng the freedom
of the British Parliament, or our own, to
deal with tariffs. 1 shall be satisfied if they
are n0 worse.
I view with a good deal of misgiving the
intrusion of Canada into the party politics
of Great Britain. I believe that we should
refrain from interferance in political struggles
in Great Britain, as we expect her people to
refrain fromn interference in ours.
The breaking up of the National Government. which was hailed as the salvation of
Great Britain, seems to me to be a queer way
of saving the Empire, and that breaking Up,
now in process, is the direct resuit of the Conference agreements or at least bas 'been
bastened by tham. The Natioinal G.overnment will, ocf course, be able to ratify these
agreements, but it will lose its composite national character and become wholly Conservaive, and with that it will lose its present overwhel'ming mai ority in the House of Commons.
And remember that opposition will not come
from. free traders alone. Tbe free importalion of raw materjal is as mucb an article of
protection as of f ree trade doctrine. The
free importation of raw material from RLussia
-and raw matarial is what she chiefly seeks to
export-and the expcrt of British manufactures Vo Russia, wbich Russia is aager to obtain, are thorougbly in accord with protectionist principles. The trade would be highly
profitable to Great Britain, and there is proba'bly no more promising market in the world.
IV is surely in the interest of Great Britain, for
instance, to obtain timber from Ruasia, or any
other country, as cheap as possible, to be used
for building and for the manufacture of furniture, and Vo export her manufactures Vo
RLussia. It will noV conduce to good relations
within the Empire to have Canada standing
in the way of the development of these important British industries by pressing for an
embargo on Russian timiber. Il for one, abject
te the bargaining being carried so far as to
bring pressura to bear on Great Britain Vo
restrict ber trade with foreign countries, and
Vo have Canada projectad into the party
politics -cf the Old Country. I 'beliave in the
practice of voluntary, uneonditional preferences, leaving each mainber of the British
Empira abgolutely free to control its own
tariff.
I have referred to Mr. Baldwin's expression of
a desire that the aims of the Conference should
be sought by tbe lowering rather than the

31

increasing of tariffs. Without going into details,
I bave gained the impression that his wish has
been disragarded and that the restrictions imposed by the agreements far exceed the extensions -of trade. Furtharmore, thosa have been
disappointed who ex~pected that the Imperial
Confarence would set an example to the world
which would encourage the removal of those
barriers against trade aIl over the world, which
are genarally recognized as among the chief
causes of world-wide depression. The example
set is exactly of the opposite kind: increased
restrictions--encouragement for the raising
everywbere of those obstacles to trade which
stand in the way of a return Vo world-wide
prosperity, by which Canada would greatly
benefit.
Hon. ]RODOLPHIE LEMIEUX: Honourable members, I do noV intend to address the
buse at any length, but, having for a long
time represented a constîtuency in the Commons, and having been the dean of that
House for a certain number of years, I feel
that aven in the Senate I may speak for the
people of Canada.
I bave read the Speech from the Throne.
IV is a very interesting document, but I regret that no mention is made therein of the
all-important question of unemployment, for
the gravity of that question transcends that
of aIl others. 1 have occasion to travel in
the country districts and in the cities of the
Dominion. I go Vo Toronto, to Montreal, and
to Quebac, frequently I visit the rural districts
of the Province of Quebac, and I can testify to
the vary sarîous situation in which the people
find Vhemselvas at the present time. This
morning I received a latter from an elderly
gentleman in my old constituancy of Gaspé,
and this is the substance of what ha tells me:
People have no food.; they have no raiment;
they are breaking into their neighbours' barns
in order to procure f ood for their childran.
Some are going willingly to the jail at Percé,
in order to be fed by the Provincial Government.
I am not axaggerating. I think a similar picVura can 'be drawn off other -parts of Canada.
The other evaning, in Montreal, while going
from the University Club to the Ritz-Carlton
Hotel, I noticed a young man leaning against
the wall of ona of the palatial residences
on Sherbrooke Stree t. Addressing me, ha
muraibled somathing, and I thought ha was
under the influence of liquor. I said Vo a
gentleman near-by: "IV is Voo bad that those
who ora obliged Vo seek assistance from
passersby should ba intoxicated." Then I
noti-ced the young man faîl down. I want
over Vo h-im, but could not detect the smell

SENATE
of liquor. He said to me: "Sir, I have not
caten since yesterday." Here, in Ottawa, from
the Parliament Buildings to my residence,
every day I meet young men and old asking
for charity. I hope that some day the present
depression will give place to some degree of
prosperity, but these years of acute adversity
will, I fear, croate in the ninds of hundreds,
indeed of thousands, of people the idea that
they can rely on the publie for food and
clothing, and with the progressive maechanization of industry I an wondering what will
become of them.
Now what is the Govern'ment doing te solve
kneow the
i
the problrite o unmplovcment?
Governmxent i eompo-ed of men who, in
wxth us, have the deepuest sympathy
ciorcmmo
for our poverty-stricken unempiloyed; but is
the Government formuating any conrstructive
measures to take care of these unfortunate
people? The winter will soon be upon us;
indleed. we fecl the pinch of winter every
morning. Yeoterday I brought to the aittention of the House the question of the price
of coal. Many pceople who are still wageearners have said to me: "It is impossible
for us at its present price te use coal in our
hoe-s." Only this morning a gentlrman told
me that be w as going to burn wood this
wintc.r. Well, it iN not a bad substitute for
cea ;-I like to hear the crackle of a wood
fire. But the price cf coal to-dav terrifies
me. Not mnanv yoars ago coad wa-s sold at $6,
$7, and at most $8 a ton. To-day, by virtue of
the agrecment with Great Britain, we are
assured of an ample supplv of Welsh coal. I
am told that that coal delivered on the wharf
at Montreal does not ccst more th:an $8, or
at most $9 a ton; but here it is selling at $17.
Now, whbat be-comes o-f the spread between
Monitreal and Ottawa prices? I ask my right
honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
-whose wonderful ability is ad'mitited by allte endeavour to get the Labour Department
to institute at once an investigation of this
matter in order te dispel or confirm the suspicion that the public arc the victims of a
combine. I make no accusation that there
is such a combine; I have no evidence to
that effeet; but -this is being repeatedly said
on the sitreet and in the home. Remember
that riots and indeed revolutions are brought
about by suspicions.
As regards unemployment, I say it is the
paramount issue of the day. Let os not lose
sight of that fact. There convened in Ottawa
this summer a great Conference, and at that
Conference Canada did her part magnificently.
The delegates were entertained royally-and
deservedly so, because they were our guests.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX.

But let us net labour under the illusion that
the agreements reached at that Conference
constitute the paramount issue in Canada today. No. There is but one problem te which
the Government is expected te find a, solution,
and that is the problem presented by unemploeii nt and the prevailing arute adversity.
My right honourable friend will say-I think
he has it in his mind now-that the agrcenwnts were drafted with a view to bringing
back prosperity to Canada. Well, I beg te
differ with hiu on that. Like Cato of ,old,
who kept repe.ating, "Delenda est Cairthago,"
T keep repeaiting, "Delenda est advecrsits."
That is the first duty of the Government.
As regards tariff making for the future, let
me say in all sincerity to my right honourable
friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) and to my
colleagues of the Senate that I have been
brought up in a school which believes that
the name of Canada is writ large on the map
of the world. The tariff of Canada, therefore, should be made by Canada and nct by
the various Dominions which constitute the
British Empire.
When the Conference was summoned, I
read in one of the British newspapers that a
family gathering very often meant a fanily
quarrel. At the conclusion of the Confcrence,
Mr. Baldwin, whom everybody trusts because
ho is a great statesman, as much as said that
there had been storms and tempests, but that
happily calm had finally prevailed. Family
gatherings mean family quarrels, especially
when material interests are at stake. How
can you expect Rhodesia, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Great Britain, net te mention Ireland, to agree for ever,
or even for a number of years, on a conmon
tariff? How can those countries which are
free and independent, situated as they are in
various climes and having divergent interests
at stake, be expected tc agree for long on
complicated tariff policies?
Preferences fron England to ber colonies
are as old as the hills, but history teaches us
a lesson that we ought nct to forget. In the
middle of the last century, say from 1825
until 1849, when Canada was a colony-a
large and ancient colony-our fathers received
preferences from Great Britain on grain,
fleur, timber and meat. It was during those
days that the old city of Quebec became so
famous for her trains of tiuber. Those who
pass the city of Quebec by daylight can
see the various coves te which the trains
came from the Ottawa River and other parts
of Canada through the St. Lawrence. Our
logs were exported to Britain and te various
other parts of the Empire, which benefited by
the preference given us 'by Britain. If you

OCTOBER 14, 1932
pass through aid villages along the St. Lawrence, like L'Assomption, you can stili see
the large stores with iron shutters where grain
and foeur were kept awaiting the opening of
navigation in the spring, when they were exported te England under the preference which
existed. Our canais were opened during that
period, and many Americans came and settled
in Canada, especially in the Ottawa district,
in order to take advantage of the preferences.
Then Cana~da expe'rienoed the, danger that
lies in suah prefceenýtia.l poli-ciee. AlI of a
audden the leader of the paa'ty then in power ini
Engiand, and favourable to those preferenoes,
moved by the acute situation which existed in
the rural parts and in the industrial towns of
that country, decided to change from the
policy of protection to the policy of free

than
a century had replenishect the treasury of
Great Britain and made her the most prosperous nation of the worl.d. Sir Robert Peel
becamne a Lib-eral and a free trader. What happencd in Canada? The people who had settled
here, the business men, the farmers and the
xnillers who, relying on the British preference,
had invested their moncy in Canada, protested
ioudly. Let me refer my right honourable
friend ta the documents published by Shortt
and Doughty some years aga. There he will
read the annexation manifeste signed by the
hest names in Canada, names such as Sir
John Abbott, Sir Antoine Dorion, and a host
of others, declaring that because of the wiping
out of the preferences Canada was «ruined,
investments were braught ta naught, and that
Canadians had decided ta look ta their neighbours ta the south for a market. That meant
annexation pure and simple.
Right Hon. Mr. MFdGHEN: What year was
that?
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: That was in 1849.
Lord Elgin, a good and sturdy Scotchman,
wvas then the Governor of Canada. It was he
who had rallied the forces of sensible
Canadians and made possible responsibie government. He wrate ta his father-in-law, Lord
Grey, who was then Prime Minister of England, requesting him ta give his immediate
attention ta the probi-ems that had suddenly
arisen in Canada. I speak whereof 1 know. My
fa4hSo before me, and my gramdfakher, cifcten
tald me af the agitation af 1837, af the
annexatian mavement af 1849, and af the
Confederatian af 1867. There was at that
time, as there is ta-day, extreme distress in the
larger centres. Lard Elgin in his letter ta
Lard Grey said: "If nathing is done yeu wilI
lose Canada. The people are not happy,

because they are not prosperous. You must
restore prosperity ta Canada." And what did
Lord Elgin recommend ta the British Gavernment? He recommended going ta Washington and negotiating a tre&ty of recipt'acity with our neighbouvs 4o the souçth. He
spent six months in Washington-there is na
question as ta which flag b-e wa.9 labouring
under-and he brought back what is known in
history as the Elgin-Marcy Treaty. That treaty
was in effect--only in regard ta natural prodiuots, if I remnember oorreotly-from 1854 until
1866. Again 1 know whereof I speak, because
my 'father was a very humble merchant on the
south side of the St. Lawrence, in the county
of Napiervilie, and he often told me that that
was the golden era for the farmers of Canada.
They made smaîl fortunes selling their cattIe
and other farm produets ta the Americans.
The treaty would have been renewed in 1866
had nat the attitude of the Canadian people
been contrary ta the Northerners during the
Civil War.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The attitude of
some of -the Canadian people.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Most of them.
Ribght Han. Mr. MEIGIIEN: To the Northerners?
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Perhaps my honourable friend thinks the opposition came chiefly
from Toronto.
The best friend of the
Northerners ivas George Brown of the Globe
of Toronto, who in his awn city stood up for
the liberty-loving Northerners. I am sarry
ta say that even in Montreal, French Canadians af the highest repute stoad by the St.
Albans raiders and protected them before the
courts. Those who have read the memoirs af
Sir John A. Macdonald will remember a letter
addressed ta Sir George Cartier:
That fellow Coursol-he was the police magistrate in the extradi-.
tion case-mill cost the country haîf a million dallars,
if not a little war with the United States,
because of his judgment in favaur of the
raiders.
Now, if I remind my right honourable friend
af this Reciprocity Treaty episode it is hacause I want him ta make use of his ability
an behaîf of Canada. He has a remarkably
clear mind and is wonderfully able. I do net
say that just ta compliment him. We al
knaw that he is nat here for ever; same day
we shahl hase hlm. He may enter another
sphere of action, and passibly may head the
Gavernment of Canada. We ail wish him well,
but he must rid his mind of any narraw ideaà

about the United States. I do not say that
he harbours such sentiments, but in 1891 and
in 1911, I think, he joined in the hue and cry
of those who said, "No truck nor trade with
the Yankees." I may tell him this: The agreements that we shall pass may be of some value
for the present time, but in my judgment
they do not make for the peace of the world,
because they are based on a very materialistic
and narrow principle. We all know that the
statesmen of the world to-day are praying for
the lowering of tariff barriers in order to create
new channels of trade and exchange between
the war-stricken peoples of the world. We
know that high tariffs pave the way to war,
net to peace.
Some day a new adrninistration will come
into office at Washington. Nobody believes,
I suppose, that Mr. Hoover will be the next

President of the United States. I am far
from having anything against Mr. Hoover;
he is a good Quaker and therefore a peaceful
man; but no President of the United States
bas ever passed through the crucible that Mr.
Hoover has passed through and emerged
triumphant att the polls. The State of Maine
the other day gave a warning to the powers
that be in W.ashington that the Democratic
candidate, a gentleman who bears the great
and noble name of an ancient fanily, will, as
surely as I sec His Honour the Speaker in
the Chair, be the next President. Mr. Roosevelt is outspoken. The other day, in the State
of Massachusetts, he delivered a speech the
text of which I have upstair--I am sorry I
have not brought it here-in which he plainîy
said that one of the causes of the distress in
the United States, where there are to-day
eleven million unemployed, was their tariff,
which, he said, was as high as Haman's gallows. He said that when the Democrats take
office they will change that itariff, and that
they will deal fairly, especially with their
neighbours and best customers, the Canadians.
" I will not hesitate," he said, " to enter into
negotiations with Canada." Never, honourable gentlemen, since the days of Mr. Taft
and Mr. Wilson, has a public man in the
United States spoken so plaindy regarding the
relations that sheuld exist between the two
great nations of the North American continent.
I feel very sbrongly on this matter. because
I believe that we are, as we say in French,
cherchant midi à quatorze heures. We are looking only to Great Britain, which affords us an
excellent market. Under the preference given
to Great Britain by Sir Wilfrid Laurier and
the late Mr. Fielding, without the exaction of
any return, Canada prospered. My right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) was

then a budding young lawyer in the West,
and he knows that from the moment the
preference 'of 1897 was granted the British
consumer looked towards Canada and began
buying butter, cheese, fruits, hay, grain and
timber from this country. You will not develop trade by exacting preferences from the
other feillow to the same extent that you are
willing to grant them to him. The broader
yau are in your dealings with the other fellow,
the more braadly you will be treated by him.

Or would

lie think of leaving it to thern to say what
they would do?
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Oh, no. I would
do what Sir John A. Macdonald did. The
Reciprocity Treaty of 1854-66 continued, after
its abolition, to agitate public opinion in the
United States and in this country. Sir John
A. Macdonald realized what the people felt
and until 1879 lie was in favour of the
renewal of the treaty. I was net then twentyI
one, but I could understand politics.
remember that when he introduced his resolutions for the National Policy in 1879 ho
madeHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: A standing offer.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: -a standing offer of
reciprocity covering exactly the same articles
of the old Reciprocity Treaty. My right
honourable friend bas only to look at the
Statutes of 1879 to find the truth of what I am
saying. That offer remained on the Statute
Book for many years.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: My honourable friend has missed my point. I understood him to argue in faveur of a bargaining treaty with the United States, such as
was made by his Government in 1911.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:
England.

I was speaking of

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The question is: why is it perfectly safe to make
such a treaty with the United States, but
a very dangerous thing to make one with
England?

OCTOBER 14, 1932
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: 1 do flot say it is
a very dangerous thing, but I think that
public opinion may change in England as
it changed in 1849.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It may
change in the United States as it changed in
1866.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: When you bave a
signed agreement with' the United States it
stands for a definite number of years.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: It does with
any countiry.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I wilI put a question to my right bonourable friend. Let us
say that we adopt this agreement. Does
hie really believe that a man like Lord
Sinowden, or Sir Herbert Samuel, or even
Lloyd George-although 1 do not expect that
hie will ever again be Premier-would keep
such an agreement intact?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Lord Snowden kept the McKenna duties intact long
after hie had threatened to throw them out.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: But hie explained
that they represented only a passing event.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They were
a long time in passing.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: And they were not
so important as this agreement. They provided a mild measure of protection at a time
when England was emergîng from the War
and feared that she *might be mulcted by
other nations. But let my right honourable
friend not be misled into thinking that,' when
conditions become more nearly normal than
they are just now, the old sentiment of freedom which, made England, such a powerful
country in trade and otherwise will not revive.
It is reviving at the present moment. Does
hoe believe that if Lord 'Snowden weoe Chancel1lor of the Exchequer this agreement would
remain on the Statute Book? For my part, I
do not believe it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Will the
honourable gentleman permit me to interrupt
him? I should think the return of the Republican Party in the IUnited States after a
Democratic regime would be much more
likely than the return of Lord Snowden to
office in England.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: 'I am not such a
good j udge of politics in the United States as
I am of politics in the United Kingdom, hecause I am a Britisher.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He has been

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: May I say to the
right honourable gentleman that the people
of the United States have learned a lessoin
during the Iast ten years. Republicans, as
well as Democrats, realize to-day that the
time is gone when the nation can be throttled
with a tarifl as high as the present one.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: it is not long since
the United States raised a few of their tariff
barriers.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: These treaties
reduce tariffs.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Last April I sat
in the Congressional gallery for a few hours
and I was very much interested in the debates. I can assure honourable members that
the unemployment situation was the chief
topic of discussion and if the American Government has raised duties and taxes it has
been by way of trying to meet heavy deficits.
I heard the opinions of representatives of both
sides, Republicans and Democrats, and I
know that they were critical of high tariffs.
And if honourable members will read the
American press to-day they will find that
the people of the United States are expecting
a drastic reduction in their tarifae. There
is a strong public opinion in that country to
the effect that not only are the people overtaxed, but high duties have been the cause
of their acute unemployment situation, and,
in addition, have made the people of other
countries unfriendly or indifferent to them.
My right honoureble friend follows the
activities of the League of Nations and knowa
that for the last four or five years the League
bas passed resolutions urging the reduction of
tariffs in ahI countries, because it was felt that
these trade barriers are a cause of international trouble. And only the other day saine
small nations--Belgium, DenmarkHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Holland.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX:
-and Holland,
agreed among themselves to lower their tariffs.
I am not going to discuss the agreement with
the United Kingdom now, for I have barely
had time to absorb it. 1 hope to have the
opportunity ocfspeaking when it comes before
us for consideration. I shahl not oppose it,
as it represents the fiscal polîcy of the Goverament.
I amn here to pass judgment quietly
on proposed legislation. But I have had
eome little experience ini public affairs, and
if I speak with some heat about any of
the agreements that were made at the Conference, it is because I feel that there is no
salvation from the economic ilse from which
our people are suffering except tbrough a reduction in tariffs. Take our farmers, our

Hon. Mr. TANNER: My honourable friend
migbt bie glad to make such a treaty, hie is s0
infatuated with those Washington agreements
since 1854-that is a long time back-when
we used to pay the farmer ten cents a pound
for butter, fifteen cents for a bushel of
potatoes, twenty cents for a barrel of turnips.
Those were the golden days for our farmers.
My honourahle friend apparently would like
to bring back those golden days by negotiating
anotber reciproeity treaty.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Those are the prices
that aur farmers in Gaspé get to-day.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: We will let my hionaurable friend have ail that satisfaction. But
I would remind bim that hie is not in accord
with his present leader at all, for in 1930
Mr. King-I presumne lie is still the leader of
the Liberal Party-over bis own signature
publicly notified the United States that lie
was not gaing to try ta negotiate any further
reciprocity agreements with them, because
they were nat willing ta make a fair arrangemient. 1 think my honourable friend was
assisting Mr. King in the general election of
1930 and must have read that formal public
statement. I have no doubt that lie supparted
bis leader on that occasion; I have no doulit
that lie alsa supported the Dunning budget,
which raised aur tariff walls against tbe United
States, and 1 have no doulit that lie ca-aperated witb tbe honourable leader an tlie athc'r
sida of the House, who annouaced during that
election that by the iDunning budget we were
repayiag the United States Gavernment for their
harali treatment ai us by taking $200,000,000
worth af trade away from tbem. Did my
honourable friend approve ai that line of
paliey-high tariffs, reiusing reciprocity, shutting aurselves off from tbe United States?
1 recail that tbrouglbout the electian ai 1930
lie was one ai tbe mast diligent memnbers af
bis party in supporting the very policy wbici
naw lie tells us is ail wrang. Now, can we
place any confidence in a public man wha
is sa inconsistent in bis views? It is impossible. There rnust be some consistency in
publie lufe. Tbat was only twa years aga; but
here is my honourable friend to-day born
again! Wby? Because lie is in opposition
naw and would like ta see Mr. King get back
into office. There is the whole story. That
is tbe kind af statesman that my hanaurable
friqnd appears to be. 1 did nat intend ta
make this digression, and if we are ta go
into aur political history since 1854 it will
take longer than the limited tirne tbat 1 have
at rny disposal this aiternoan. However, I
shahl be very glad ta discuss the matter fully
with my honourable friend an some future
occasion. I eau assure him, from what I have

3-1

read and seen of bis pahitical career, that lie
will have a great deal af difficulty in keeping
an a straiglit une.
Han. Mr. LEMIEUX: I arn a teetotaler.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Yesterday my honourable iriend irom Sydney (Hon. Mr. MeLennan) mentianed the subjeet ai the St.
Lawrence Waterway. I arn not going ta discuss it at tbe moment, but I agree with him
tbat it is a great and important subject whîcli
we sbauld ahl be eonsidering and studying. I
can say that the repart ai the Senate Committee of 1928, ta whicb lie reierred, contains
an enormous amaunt oi useful information an
thie St. Lawrence Watcrway-iniarmatian which
in rnaay respects cannot lie found in any other
available publication. 1 second bis recammendation that bonourable members ai this House
and the public in general sbould devote considerable ai tbeir time ta a tharougli study ai
tbe subjeet.
I wauld point out ane or twa iacts in addition ta tbose stated by my lionourable ifriend.
We are apt ta think ai tbe St. Lawrence as
if it were wbally a Canadian river. It is true
we are fortunately situated in liaving aIl that
part oi the St. Lawrence irom Lake St.
Francis out ta the Gulf in Canadian territory.
But 1 desirc ta put on record a iact whicb we
sbauld nat overlaak. Of the 1,215 miles ai
lake ani river navigation courses down ta
Montreal therc arc on the Unite'd State's
side ai the boundary linc 675 miles. only 477
miles on ýthe -Canadicai side, and only 63 miles
on the boundary line itself. I point this out
in arder ta let the Huse and the country
know tbat while we have savereignty, yet
there is the boundary line winding down
througb fliese lakes and tlirough the river, and
on this sie and on that the respective proportions of navigable water whicb I have
mentioneri. It will also lie iound by consulting the report that a greaýt deal ai work
lias been done 'by the United States Garernmenit, not oinly on i'ts own side -ai the
boundary lie, but also on the Canadian side, with aur consent. On this work
it bas expend-ed very large sums of money.
At Sault Ste. Marie it will lie found
that the great bulk, ai aur ireiglit goes
through the United States canal, because it
is ai greater capacity than tbe Canadian canal.
That is ail I desire ta say on the subject at
this time, merely ta put honaurable members
on inquiry 50 they may study the subjeet.
We have beard a good deal this aiternoon
about unemployment. Nobody will belittle
the question; undoubtedly it is ai grave importance. We have been asked by my lionourable iriend fromn Rougemont (Hon. Mr.

OCTOBER 14, 1932
of Sir Wil-frid Laurier was quite voluntary;that at that time his Government did not
think -of asking the Imperial Goverument for
a preference in return. That is true in part
only, because, white t.he Government of Sir
Wilfrid Laurier did not directly approach the
British Governinent and ask for a return preferenoe, it is dîstinctly on record in the proceedings of this Parliament that it was Sir
Wilfrid's, objective to get a return preference.
As Mr. Fielding expressed it in 1902, we believed that by giving that preference in 1897 we
should create a friendly sentiment that would
result in the Britishi Government giving us a
preference in return. Sir Wilfrid Laurier said
the saine t.hing in 1902, and in 1902 Sir Wilfrid
Laurier and Mr. Fielding, and of course their
colleagues in the Government, were quite confident that the time had corne for which they
haed, hoped, and that when they went to the
conference that year they would find the Goverument of the United Kingdom, ready to give
Canada preferential treatment. I do flot want
to take up time in reading. I can give the
House in a moment the reference to the page
of thc Debates of 1902 where Mr. Fielding
distinctly makes that statement. Sir Wilfrid
Laurier also made similar statements. But,
as my honourable friend who leads the other
side lias said, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman
got busy and started a tremendous agitation
Vo revive the creed of free trade in England,
and in 1906, after the elections, free trade was
stili' a factor.
When Sir Wilfrid Laurier went over to the
Ixnperial Conference in 1902 lie found that the
door was l-ocked and barred against him so far
as Imperial preferences were concernied, but
in view of what my honourable friend <Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) lias said, I want to place on
record in a few words the policy of Sir Wilfrid
Laurier in that year-and of course iV muet
have been the policy of my honouraible friend
himself at that time. Sir Wilfrid Laurier was
then Prime Minister of the colony of Canada.
He and the prime ministers representing the
other colonies *were agreed on a policy of
Empire preferences, and at the conference of
1902 what Canada and the other colonies were
ready to do was very distinctly put on record.
If my honourable friend studies the official report of that conference lie will find that what
I arn about to read is contained, in the documents. This is wliat Sir Wilfrid Laurier and
the other colcnial prime ministers submitted
to the Britisli Goyverment:
The representatives of tlie colonies are prePared te recommend te their respective parliaments preferential treatment of Britishi goode
on the f ollowing lines:
Canada-The existing preference of 331 per
cent and an additionil preference on liste of

selected articles; (a) by further reducing the
duties in favour of the United Kingdom; (b)
by raising the duties against foreign goods.
Think of that I "By raising the duties against
foreign goods."
(c) impoig duties on certain foreign
b
importe now on ~e free list.
There is the record of the Laurier Government in 1902, when it said to England: "Give
us a preference. We will increase your preferenoe, we will raise the duties that now
exist against foreigu goods, and wc will impose tariff duties on foreign goods that now
corne in free." That does flot look very much
like cutting down tariffs, and yet, I have no
doubt, my honourable friend opposite declared time and again that that was a sound
and magnificent policy for Canada. If lie
did not, I should lie very mucli surprised.
Sir Wilfrid Laurier did not stop there. As
we have heard a great deal charging arbitrary
characteristics to the present Prime Minister,
and relsaing to wlieb le eaad when he went to
England, I want to read to the House what
Sir Wilfrid Laurier said to the British Government in 1902. He was not wholly satisfied
with being on record with the other prime
ministers in the statement which I have just
read; so before he left London he put on
record a statement pointing out how much the
preference of 1897 had done for Great Britain,
and concluding in the following language:
If after using every effort te briniz about
such a readjustment of the fi"es poUcy of the.
Empire the Canadian Government should find
that the principle of preferential trade is nlot
acceptable to the colonies generally, or to the
Mother Country, then Canada should be free
to take such action as might be deemed necessary in the presence of such conditions.
That to my mind was a very direct and positive threat-shall I say?-to Great Britain
that if she did not choose to agrce to the
policy of Imperial preferences Canada was
going to lie free to do just as she liked in
regard to tariffs and trade. The present
Prime Mînister while in London neyer made
as strong a statement as that made by Sir
Wilfrid Laurier in 1902. Again I have no
doubt that the honourable gentleman who
leads the other aide of the House (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand), and my honourable friend who
spoke a few moments ago (Hon. Mr.
Lemieux), acclaimed ini vigorous language the
attitude of Sir Wilfrid Laurier at that time.
Now, I want to hir-ry on. As we know,
nothing important iii the way of Imperial
preferences haippened froan 1002 till 19M0.
Then we corne to the Dunning budget. What

attitude played a very large part in the events
that followed. By an overwlielming vote
Great Britain wiped out tlie dogma of free
trade and brought into office a National Government wliich. adopted the policy of protection
for Britisli industry and of preferences ta the
Dominions. I say that that change, unprecedented in any country, was liastened very
matesially by the poeit-imc taken by the Prime
Mi.ndstem of tlie Dominions in the London
Conference of 1930, and I want ta point out
tliat tlie man who coudemons the Prime Minist-er of Cainftd& condemne tlie Prime Ministers
becaïuse Austra lia,
of the utilier Dominli,
Newfaundland, New Zealand, Rhodesia, Irelarid-all the Dominions that were represented
by 'their Prime Ministens et the Conferenoe of
1930-spoke in the same tenor as did the
Prime Minister of Canada.
Bonourable members opposite have lad a
great change of heart. Up ta thie time of the
elections of 1930 tley were fervent Empire
preference men, but now tley have nothing
but questions and doubts as ta wletlier Empire
preference is or is not a good thing. The
honourable gentleman wlio leads the other
side of the Bouse said yesterday that if we
are ta have trade within the Empire ta the
prejudice of aur trade witl foreign countries,
then we have not accomplisled much good,
but have done something that will not lie
acceptable ta aur people. Yet in 1930 he
boasted that we were going ta transfer
$200,000,000 worth of trade from the United
States, our near neiglibour, ta Great Britain.
Bis two positions are not consistent.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I cited yesterday thirteen countries witli which we have
been doing business, but there is no mention
of the United States in that list.
Bon. Mr. TANNER- My honourable friend
cannot get away from what le said yesterday.
Bis meaning is very clear. This is what lie
said:
Honourable members, we are now attempting
ta bring about the importation from countries
in the British Commonwealth of goods that we
formerly have been importing from other countries. If we could accomplish nothing more
than that it would not go very far towards
inereasing aur prosperity, but we are lioping
for a larger exehange of goods.
In 1930, wlien thc lionouralile gentleman
boasted that it would lie a good thing for us
ta transfer 8200,000,000 worth of trade from
the United States ta England, lie was wholehearted. To-day he is only half-learted. He
did not see any danger ahead then because
Mr. King was Prime Minister. To-day lie
sees a great deal of danger because Mr.
Bennett is Prime Minister and lias made agree-

41

ments with different parts of the Empire. It
makes a lot of difference wlio is Prime Minister.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Does my honourable
friend really believe that anybody in this
country envies the position of the Prime
Minister?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: It is flot merely a
half-hearted change that is needed by the
honourable gentleman who lias just spoken;
lie needs a wbolly new heart. The old one and
&Il the tendons connected witli it should be
eut out, and then lie may be ail right, but
until that is done tliere is no hope.
The honourable leader on the other side
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) declares that under
the agreement with Great Britain aur fiscal
independence may be invaded. The leader
of the Opposition in another place declares
the same thling. My lionourable friend says
that we are binding ourselves for five years,
and lie fears we are beixng placed in a
dangerous position. Well, it is only a question of degree, because lie and his colleagues
in the late Government made treaty after
treaty, and brought them down liere and said:
"There they are; you cannot change an item
in them; you have to accept thcmn or throw
themn out." And those treaties fixed the
tariff, just as these Conference agreements
do, though perhaps for a shorter time. My
hionourable friend's Gavernment made an
agreement with the West Indies without consulting people who knew what was required.
We were tied up to the building of slips and
to the running of themn for, I think, ten
years, and at the present time we are losingc
at the rate of about $900,000 to $1,000,000 a
year on those vessels. Tlie Government of
the day planked that agreement on the tables
of bath Bouses of Parliament and said:
"Take it. You cannot change it."
If that sort of thing was all right, what is
wrong about the making of agreements with
Great Britain and our sister Dominions for
five years? I see fia objection, for if I
understand the matter correctly it is of the
utmost importance that stability should underlie any such agreement. If wveare ta build
new avenues of trade and commerce, if we
are ta divert aur trade from the United
States and other foreign countries ta England.
we must make sure that there is some degree
of stability ta the changed conditions. There
is no use in starting a streamn of commerce
and not making provisions ta, ensure that it
shaîl not be dammed shortly afterwards. Five
years is a short enough period of time ta be
set for the operation of agreements of the

42

SENATE

kjnd that we have made, if the ncw business
is to have the necessary stability. So I
think that Parliament can safely hold up
both hands in support of that feature of
the agreements.
There is only -one other point on which
I wish to touch. We have heard in this debate
a great deal about our right ýo govern ourselves. That is conceded. No one disputes
that we have the right to muake our own
tariffs. But as a constituent part of the Empire or Commonwealth we have some rights
in settling Empire or Commonwealth matters.
As I remarked a little while ago, Sir Wilfrid
Laurier did flot hesitate to tell the British
Governmenýt in 1902 that if 'they did flot
change their fiscal system so as to give preferences to the Dominions and Colonies, the
Dominions and Colonies woul do as they
liked with their own tariffs. In the last ten
years, we have been given to understand, an
entire change bas takený place in the status of
the Dominions. We have been told that,
and we believe it.
Whereas in 1902 the premiers of the outiyring parts of the Empire assembled in London as premiers of colonies, in 1930 they assemhled ithere as the prime ministers of independent, seif-overning nations, enach with
as many nationali rights as the other and of
equal status with the Mother Country. This
summer these nations,;-not colenies--met in
Oittawa. To do what? To settle their common 'business andl to engage in conferences
for the purpose of developing trade with one
another. -New Zealand carne here for New
Zealand first and the Empire next; Australia
came for Australia first and the Empire next;
England came for England first and the Empire next. That waýs the attitude of thorm all,
and rîghtly so. Canada was for Canada first
andl the Empire next.
But we are told there should flot be anything likc that; that there should nlot be auy
such hargaining as was done. Such an aittitude might have been aIl right in the old
days when the pres4ent Dominions were
colonies, but now that the Dominions have
reached the stature of manhood, in a national
sense, we talk te, one another like men. We
say, ",Youi give us this and we wvjll give you
that." What is wrong about it? How are
you going to, confer about trade if you do flot
have bargaining, especially when you are ail
sitting arouina a table and are aill of equal
status?
Mr. Mackenzie King says there will neyer
be such a conference held again, because if
there wcre it would disrupt the Empire.
Now, honourable members, 1 do flot need to
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

dweil on that. We are ail devoted te, the
English Crown, to English. traditions, and to
the component parts of our Empire. But as
nations we have grown to man's estate. Who
can tell what will be the stature of this Canada of ours fifty years hence? If we are not
able to flnd something in common in the way
of business and commerce within the Empire,
sentiment may not play a very large part. If
we found it more profitable to make trade arrangements and to trade with the United
States and with European and other foreigni
countries open to trade with us, the result
might be very disastrous to the Empire.
Having brought us to the stature of nations,
honourable members on the other side of the
buse should be the last to say that we should
not iive up to that stature as nations, holding
our own interests first, and the interests of the
Empire next after our own. If I wanted to
take up time I could quote what was said by
leading Liberals like Mr. Rinfret, Mr. Denis,
Mr. Cardin and Mr. Mitchell, who went about
the country in 1930 ey~paining their policies.
"We are ail for Canada first," Mr. Cardin said.
But Mr. Bennett must not say anything like
that. Thc6e words are ahl right when uttered
by Mr. Rinfret, Mr. Cardin and honourable
members opposite, but ail wrong when uttered
by a Conservative.
We ail know who started the campaign
for Empire preference.
It was Joseph
Chamberlain, and 1 think that he knew as
much as Mr. King does about Empire statesmanship. Bonar Law, a great Canadian, was
a strong supporter of Josephi Chamberlains
policy of Empire preference. In the Life of
Bonar Law it is related that one day, in the
course of a conversation, Joseph Chamberlain
explained to him the real reason why he had
introduced the policy of Empire preference.
"I have taken the step," Chamberlain said,
"because 1 believe it is the only way by which
it is possible for us to secure the real union of
the British Empire." I arn content, honourable
members, to leave that against the statement
of Mr. Mackenzie King that we are on the
way to disruption of the Empire.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES moved the adjournment of the debate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEI'GHEN: I am consenting, though I should much prefer that
we should sit this evening and close the
debate. I understand that certain members
who desire to speak feel that they are not
in a position to do so at present. In agreeing
to the motion I want to say that shouid there
be other 'business that the Government considers of sufficient importance to take priority

OCTOBER 14, 1932
when we meet again next week, that business,

Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: Hear, hear.

There is this advantage in adj ourning the
debate at present, that when we meet again,
if there is no other important business, the

The motion of Hon. Mr. Hughes for the
adjournment of the debate was agreed to.

THE GOVERNOR

GENERAL'S SPEECH

ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from Friday, October
14, consideration of Hie Excellency the Governor General's Speech at the opening of the
session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Poirier
for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators,
we are now considering the speech with which
Hie Exceliency the Governor General opened
Parliament, and while that speech promises
legislation on many important questions, I
doubt whether the Government fulIy apprehiends how sesious axoe the troubles that
beset. us and how momientous is9 the world
evolution which ounrousids us, and tihaough
which I hope we are passing. My observation
in regard to the misapprehension of the Govemment is, I think, justified, because while
public opinion the world over je coming to
regard high tarifes as the major cause of the
world's distrese, this Government proceeds on
the assumption that high tarifes are a remedy
for every economic ill. Even facte will not
convince it to, the contrary. "Ephraim is
joined to bis idole."
This autumn session of Parliament has been
specially called to consider and ratify the
agreements entered into by the representa-

43

tives of the Empire at the Conference held
in this city last summer. In dealing with
the agreement made between the United
Kingdomn and Canada I shall analyse Article
il only. This will be fair, because the other
articles are not incompatible, I think, with
that article. It reads as follows:
His Majeety'e Government in Canada undertake that during the currency of this Agreement the tariff @hall be based on the principle
that protective duties ehaîl not exceed such a
leveI au wili give United Kingdomn producers
f ull opportunity Of Teasonable competition on
the bac-ie of thse relative coot of economical
and efficient production, provided that in the
application of ouch principle special consideration shall be given to the case of industries not
fully ectabiished.
That is to say, the customs duty on goods
from Great Britain shall not exceed the
difference in the coet of producing euch goode
in the United Kingdomn and in Canada,
except that in the case of eome industries
in Canada needing special coneideration the
duty might be a little bigher, and in the
case of aîl foreign goode the duties would be
higher still. In other words, as prices depend
upon costs of production, our tariff wouid
have for its object the equalization of prices
of ail goode produced in Great Britain and
the sîster Dominions, wben imported into
Canada, and if goode were to be imported
from foreign countries the price would be
even higher than that of similar goode produced at home. I think I am stating the case
fairly, and I feel pretty sure that the Prime
Minister himself would not object to my
understanding of it. Now, where does this
principle lead? It sounde plausible, but it
je fundamentally unsound, and, if carried out
in its entirety, wouid inevitably lead to the
total destruction of international trade and
the trade among the component parts of the
Empire.
Ail profit in trade, national and international, je made by taking thinge fromn where
they are comparatively cheap to where they
are comparatively dear. If you wipe out by
legielation ail profits on the exchange of goode
between nations you destroy sucb exchange,
because no human being will engage in trade
unless there is a profit in it. The difference
in the prices of goids and services in different countries ie tbe reason for taking goode
fromn one country to, another. This is calied
trade, and trade je wbat largely differentiates the civilized man from the savage.
I know, of course, that protective tarifes
are not intended to, and do not, destroy
national trade; but their object is to injure,
and if possible to destroy, aIl international

44

SENATE

trade.
This would include practicaily al
ocean-borne commerce. I nced nlot try bo
fell intelligent men and women wihat Ibat
would mean. No wonder that the thouhitfui opinion of the world is coming to regard
protective tariffs as tbe major cause of ail our
econumie troubles.
T11 e United Stades of
America, wilh ail the advanlages in the
world, tried proteelive tariffs, and where have
lhey led lier? They have led to colossal
fortunes in the hands cf the few and bo
nakedness and hunger for thxe millions.
The proposais of the laIe Jcscpb Chamberlain, if I und.crstand tbem, were the establisliment of a Zollverein amcng ail tbe componient
parts cf the Empire, with tariffs againîst the
out'.ide wcrld. Those proposais were rejercd
by flic electorate cf Britain, and would, I
thinký, b.- vcry uniwisc, but tiîey xxouid bo
muni be fter than the proscrnt proposais, wbieb
give us frco Irade in cnfy a limited number
cf articles between ourselves and the Motherland-and te the extent th-ait they permit cf

If we examine the scedulos cf tbe present

nearly every other commodity that the farmer,
the fisherman or the lumberman produces.
Most of us know or believe that fiat money,
if used to extremes, would wipe out the
creditor class, also the professional and the
sa]aried classes; but the gold standard and
the sanctity of contracts appear to be wiping
out the debtors, both nations and individuals,
and whatever destroys the debtors destroys,
in the end, the creditors. And have we flot
fiat money now? Is flot the Government
circulation that goes beyond the gold reserves
fiat money? And will anybody say that At
is flot performing a useful and even necessary
service? The fundamental truth seems to
he that man is his brother's keeper, and
whatever injures one man or one nation
injures ail men or ail nations, and whatever benefits one man or one nation benefits
ai! men or ail nations. I think it was Sir
Josiah Stamp who said, "Beware of the contract that gives the other fellow ail the
losses.",
That the Prime Minister clearly apprehends
the terrible load the debtor class is carrying
is evidenced by what hie said during the
Conference before the Committee on Monetary and Financial Questions:
Interest charges represent the moet important
of the fixed or &emni-rigid elements in our cost

Now, there is a striking difference of
opinion between the Prime Minister of Canada and the Prime Minister of Australia in
regard ta the value of the goid standard and
the monetary system generally. The Prime
Minister of Canada stated on the lOth of
this month, at page 57 of the Commons
Hansard:

to the creditor of 40~ to 48 per cent i n general
purchising power above what he contracted for
appears to be a grave injustice.
But the Conference adjourned without talcing any action on this most important question. It would surely be interesting to know
wby, because, while the British pound is at
a discount in Canada and at a, premniuma in
t he countries which compete with us in the
British market, the preferences we obtain in
that market by this agreement will be more
than wiped out. Tlie British pound is at a
premium in Denmark; therefore we cannot
compete with that country in bacon and ham
and hog produets. The British pound is at
a premium in New Zeaiand and Australia;
therefore we cannot think of competing with
these nations in dairy produets, wheat, meat
and whatever else they have to seil. The
British pound is at a premium in the Argentine, and 1 think in other South American
countries; we cannot therefore compete with
these countries in wheat, meat and whatever
else they have ta seil in the British market.
Sa wherever there might be a value ini this

capitalistie system 'breaks down altogether the
capitalists themnselves will have been its executioners. I will now turn to another phase.
World distresses and disasters are not new
things in the history of mankind. The Bible

structure. If prices remain on their present
level, such charges wili con6titute an iîvtolerable
or almoé;t intolerable burden in manly cases.
Even if it can be borne, the fortuitoue gain

agreemet it

is hiwgey,

if not a1toether,

nuilified by the monetary situation.

When England went off the gold standard
this country was etruck the greatest blow it lias

ever experienced, the force of which we have

neyer been able to measure.
The Prime Minister of Australia at the Im-

perial Economîc Conference stated-page 57
of the proceeding-that conditions in his
countrywere improving ail the time and said:
Great Britain has helped substantially, partly
by suspending interest and sinking fund paymente on the War Debt, and partdy by her departure from the gold standard.
Strange that what would help Australia would
dca! such a staggering blow to Canada-and
they are aIl honouraible men. But there is

more than that. The Prime Minister of
Canada stated on the lOth of this month, at
page 60 of Commons Hansard, that Australian five per cent bonds sold on the New
York market at haif of par, or fifty per cent.
I looked through the Wall Stre2t Journal
and the New York Times and found that
Australian five per cent bonds sold reeently in
New York at 84 and 85. Apparently somebody
made a mistake. Su much for that phase of
the question. I will only add that if the

is filled with exampies of the punishments
which

man brought

upon

himself

by

his

transgressions of the divine law, and many
are the examples od the alleviations which
folloywed repentance and amendmient.

Many

thoughtful persons are convinced that the
present depression is not entirely due to false
economics; that our transgressions against
the divine las' are a large factor in the case.
The head of the Catholie Church is clearly of
that belief, for hie has issued letter after letter
pointîng out that gross materialism, selfishness, greed, the accumulation af enormous
wealth in the hands of the few, the mad
pursuit of pleasure on the part of many, our
forgetfuiness cd the fact that we are 'but the
stewards of everything we possese--in a word,
our forgetfuiness of thie divine law, which
makes every man in the world aur neigbbour,
is the chief cause of ail aur troubles. Many,
very many, of the best men and wamen in al

There arc three great moral and social evils
in the world, narnely, drunkcnness, gambling
and divorce. The first twe injure the family,
sornetimes dcstroy it; divorce always dcstreys

Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

Leadership means unsclfishness and sacrifices.
But if it be God's will, and we correspond
with that wiil, He wilI help us to carry the
burden; and the rcward rnay be very great,
for nations, like individuals, do nlot live by
bread alone. And here cornes a thoughit that,

flot whoily bad, because it is an effort to
recogýnize the inherent rights of man. Neyerthcless, it is as certain to fail as that the
earth will continue te turn on its axis; it is
as certain to fail as that God is in His
Hleaven, because it is atheistie and God has
said, "Without Me yeu can do notliing."
I arn old-fashioncd cnough to believe these
things as firmiy as I believe in my ewn existence. Perhaps out of it ail the spirit of
Christian socialisrn and the brotherhood of

nations, which selfishncss had been developing
for four or five hundred ycars, pcrhaps fer a
thousand years. If it were the work of God,
the dcvii would certainiy do what hie couid
te dcstroy it; and his intelligence and power
far exceed those of man.
Some of the nations say they will net
surrender their honour-in other words, their
pride-or any of their sovereign rights te the
League. If they do net surrender some of
these sovcreign rights for the good of mankind, they may have te acccpt sovereign
wrongs, and perhaps annihilation; for, after
ail, the swerd is a poor dependence, as Germany knows te ber cost.
The United States of America is rich and
powerful. She has tbe power te prevent the
proper functioning of the League of Nations.
She has been exercising that power muub,
I tbink, te ber own undoing and that of the
rest of the world.
There arc great movements operating. We
are, 1 think, on the eve of tremendeus
changes. I arn net without hope.
When the Prime Minister submitted the
agreements under discussion te Parliament he
ciosed his speech with the foliowing declaratien, or invocation:
Wider still and wider
Shall thy bounds he set.

Make thee mightier yet.
I shahl paraphrase this declaration by
saying:

Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Honourable senators,
I wish to add to what has already been said
my words of congratulation to the mover and
the seconder of the Address. It is very fitting
that the honourable dean of this Chamber
(Hon. Mr. Poirier) should be chosen for the
honour of moving the Address on this
occasion. He, I understand, is the only remaining member of this Chamber appointed
by the late Sir John A. Macdonald. He
therefore constitutes a link that binds the
early years of the Dominion with the present
time. I did not understand the language in
which he spoke, but I am looking forward to
the time when the translation will appear, for
I am sure I shall read his speech with profit
and pleasure.
I wish also to extend my congratulations
to the seconder of the Address (Hon. J. A.
Macdonald). Both he and I were born in
Cape Breton. The only criticism that I have
to make of his remarks is that instead of
speaking in French for a short time, as he
did, lie should have made use of his mother
tongue and spoken in Gaelic. I think I might
have been the only one in this Chamber
who would have understood him had he
done so.
I was glad that the honourable gentleman
who has just taken his seat (Hon. Mr. Hughes)
concluded his remiarks with his usual little
sermon. His speech would have been very dry
had it not been for that fact. After quoting
many dry figures he melilowed his remarks
with a few religious lessons for us ail. He
is a past master in that field, and we all
appreciate what lie said in that connection.
I am going to refer to onily one or two
matters which have been dealt with in the
Speech from the Throne. With regard to the
railway situation I shall go back to its conparatively early 'history. In 1001 and 1902 we
had an exceptionally good crop in the Prairie
Provinces, and we had only one line of railway to 'the 'lead of the lakes. In con.sequence
of that fact there was what might be called
a grain blockade. Farmers had to find storage for their grain as best they could, and
many of them were compelled to bold it for
a long time. This situation, of course, turned
out to be a blessing in disguise, for those
who were compelled te hold their grain
seoured a higher price for it later on, and
there was no glutting of the market, as there
would have been if there had been railway
facilities. The thought of the benefit to be
gained in' this way was the idea behind the
organization of the pools in the Western

47

Provinces. They intended to feed the market
slowly, avoid glutting it, and so te secure
better prices.
Unfortunately, they were
foolish enough to hald a large quantity of
grain for too long a time, and as a result
lost a great deal of money, and the provinces
had to cene to their rescue in order that
they mnight be able to continue business.
The blockade to which I have referred
caused considerable agitation, and we started
in on a new era of railway building. The
Oanadian Northern Railway, which had a
number of branch lines in Manitoba, proceeded to extend them both east and west.
This was done by means of Government guarantees. In addition to that we lad in 1903
the wonderful scheme of a transcontinentai
railway, extending from ocean to ocean, and
the Grand Trunk Pacific was buiIV. The
country was told at that time that it would
not cost any more than $13,000,000, but we
find that the suim of thirteen millions was
only a drop in the bucket of its cost. The
Canadian Pacifie Railway double-tracked its
line from the prairies to Fort William. So
we had the Canadian Pacifie, the Canadian
Northern, and the Grand Trunk Pacifie, whereas two Unes would have been ample for our
need. Furthermore, the Government of the
day failed to consider the possibility of a
great deal of our grain being shipped to the
Pacifie oeast. I think I am safe in saying that
at the present time at least one-quarter of
the grain produced in the Prairie Provinces
is shipped to Pacifie coast ports.
Now, in addition to those railways, we have
the Hudson Bay Railway, and whi'le some
things have happened in reference to it which
may not please us very well, I am convinced
that eventually it will be of great value to
the people of Canada.
Hon. Mr. MARTIN:

They do not think

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I am speaking of the
West.
We have had three periods of railway
building in Canada, and the Royal Commission on Transportation has stated that owing
to the insane policy of building too many
lines, which was carried on under the Laurier
Government, more than 4,000 miles of railway
that we did not require were constructed.
I do not wish to enter into the details of
this matter, but I want to draw the attention
of the House to a statement made by the
leader of the Liberal Party dn this country
during the recent by-election in South Huron.
The Right Hon. Mackenzie King, speaking at Seaforth on September 29, is reported in
the Toronto Globe as follows:

48

SENATE

In 1921 virtually everything pertaining to the
Government-owned railway was in a state of
bankruptcy and demoralization. Chaos reigned,
properties for the most part, as respects roadbed. rolling stock and equipment were either
out of date or ont of repair, no co-ordination,
practically no co-operation among the several
systens. unification nowhere, duplication everywhere, traffic lessening and costs mounting.
Wby did he not mention certain other
things? Why did he not mention the fact
that this country to-day is under obligation
to the extent of two and one-half billion
dollars by reason of expenditures on the
Canadian National Railway System? Why
d'id he not tell the electors of South Huron
that the yearly interest bill is $56,000,000that every week the taxpayers of Canada
have to pay $1,077,000 in interest alone in
connection with this huge undertaking? Why
did he not tell them that from 1923 to 1931
the sum of $22,000,000 was spent in building
hotels, golf courses and other things of that
kind? Why did he not tell them that with
one exception none of those hotels or summer
resorts were able to pay operating expenses?
Why did he not tell them that not one of
them ever paid a cent towards interest on
tihe money expended on their construction?
Why did he not tell them that more than
$16,000,000 were spent in purchasing branch
railways that are to-day, and have been for
a number of years, nothing more nor less
than white elephants from which we need
never hiope to receive any revenue? And
why did ho not tell South Huron that his
Government and the Laurier Government
were responsible for all that expenditure and
stupendous liability?
When Sir Henry Thornton was placed in
charge of this wonderful scheme he was given
a free hand. No restrictions of any kind were
placed upon him, and he certainly took full
advantage of his opportunities. What has ho
to say? I have read to you the statement
made by the Right Hon. Mackenzie King in
We have to compare that
South Huron.
with the statement contained in the first report of Sir Henry Thornton, presented to
Parliament in 1922. Though lie may have had
his faults, we have to admit that Sir Henry
Thornton is a railroad man. Railroading has
been bis life-work, and I imagine that lie is as
weIl qualified to make a report in regard to a
svstem under bis charge as any man in the
country. I do not approve of certain of his
actions or of bis extravagances in connection
with this road, but we must admit, I think,
that anything he says in this regard should
be taken as coming from a man of experience.
Here is the report made by Sir Henry ThornHon. Mr. GILLIS.

ton in 1922. I shall read just a paragraph or
two to show that his statement is not in
accord with the statement of the Right Hon.
Mackenzie King. On page 10 of the report I
find the following:
On bebalf of the Board, I would like to
state that after inspectionYou must remember that he inspected the
road from one end to the other.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What report is that?
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: The Annual Report of
the Canadian National Railways for the year
1922.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to
state that alter inspection of the main arteries
of the system, we find that the work undertaken has been well performed, and that the
expenditures have been well applied. While
the demands for capital expenditure on a
system of such extent in a growing country, as
the former Board stated, are never ending, yet
it may cnow be said that the three groups of
lines, until recently the Canadian National
Railways, enter the consolidation in excellent
physical condition and operating at a high
mark of efliciency as regards actual performance
or movement of traffic and other factors controllable by the management.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Sir Henry went on to
say:
Apart from certain well known cases of
duplication the lines are well located and in
exceptional position to successfully perform the
transportation demands of the country. The
problem, as far as the lines covered by the
report is concerned, is how sufficient traffic may
be developed to carry the overhead and maintenance expenses.
As I have said, this is the stateennt of Sir
Henry Thornton, made after a careful examination of the entire system from one end to
the other. On the other hand we have the
statement of the Right Hon. Mackenzie King,
who is not a railway man and does not pretend to be. Did he ever get off a car at a
divisional point to examine the condition of
Whatever

knowledge he had of railway conditions was
gained while riding in a Pullman car or in a
private car of the Government.
Now I desire te make one or two remarks
with regard to unemployment. It is unfortunate that conditions in this country are such
as we have to-day, but as a matter of fact
we are not worse off than most of the other
civilized countries of the world; on the contrary, we are, I think, better off than most
of them. If the buge sum of money that I
reiferred to a while ago had been saved to
the peopile of Canada they would be much
better able to assist those who need relief

to-day.

OCTOBER 20, 1932
Responsibility for existing conditions is laid
at the door of -the Federal Government. But,
amthe honourable meoenber f(rom Pictou (Hon.
Mr. Tanner) poin'ted out, it is the duty of
everv legisiature, of every municipal organization, of the people of Canada, to corne to the
rescue. This -is not a matter for the Fédéral
Government alone. It bas been doing everything in its power, and I arn sure tèhat, if we
ail get togetheT and do wbat we can -to hedip,
conditions will imjprove in a vexy short time.
The other day 1 was ini the city of Hamilton,
wvhere a t.hree-day comrnunity campaign was
being carried on to heIp -those in need. I
presume the ame kind of thing will take
place in almost every centre in Canada. We
must 'look after the needy. Prosperity is
liound to return eventually. I believe thaýt it
wilI *not be long delayed, and that again we
shail experience m.any prosperous yea-rs in this
Dominion of Canada.
Hon. G. LACASSE: Honourable members,
1 had not intended to speak on the Addrees
in reply to the Speech from the Throne, but I
feel that in a mild way I have been more or
less provoked to do so.
I wish to join in complimentdng the mover
.and the seconder of the Address. I désire
particularly to pay my respects to the venerable representative fromn Acadie (Hon. Mr.
Poirier). We always listen to his pronouncements in this Chamnber with the greatest
interest. My honourable friend, and 'brother
in the medical profession, who seconded the
Address (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), gave a good
account of bimself, especially in bis recognition -cf the right of both the languages of this
,country to be used in this Chamber.
I wish aiso to pay my compliments to another honouraible meniber, but not in exactly
the saine way. I listened with attention and
some surprise to the speech deldvered by my
hionourable friand frein Pictau (Hon. Mr.
Tanner). I venture to say that ha always
livas up to his naina, becausa he doas not
seem to be abla to resist a sanguinary inclination to go after somobody's hide,--and if we
remeaier welI what took place a few months
ago we know that he should ba wall trained
in that work. If I may maka a furthar remark
.n this connection 1 would say that he should
be complimentad upon bis great proficiency in
that work, unless that inclination is more or
less congénital.
To judga by his remarks, it would seem
that tha greatest problem now facing our
country is not unemployment, nor transportation, nor anything but the question
wbether our honouraible colleague from

49

Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lamieux) is sufficiently weIl versed in the doings of the past
to give us an historical lecture. Ona would
think that was the outstanding issue in
Canada to-day. 1 wish it were, and I am
sure if it were we should learn a great deal
from the intelligent statements of the sanator
from Rougemont. But I decline to follow
my honourable friend from Pictou on the field
of partizanship, and I also decline to follow
on tha saine ground my good friend from
Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Gillis). With reference to South Huron, 1 would say tbat the
people of that constituency would proba)bly
have been much more enlightened and in a
bettar position to f orm definite and clear
opinions for thamsalvas if my honourabla
friend had gone thara himself and lecturad
tham.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: They would have been
told tha truth.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Howevar, they were
visited by a number of representatives froin
his party, but the resuIt of the election indicates that after listening to them the people
stili tbought the situation was most dasparata.
I share the viaw of my honourable friend
from Red Dear (Hon. Mr. Michenar), and
wish to say that I was extremely disappointed
to sce that one of tha main problams facing
Canada to-day was deliberately and systeinatîcally ignored in the Speech from the Throne.
I refer to the great issue of unemployment.
That is an issue about which I do know
somathing. In 1930 our good people of Essax
were told that thair dinner pails would be full
aftar three weeks of Tory administration, but
after two and a haîf years of that administration the pails need not have any bottoms,
for thera is nothing in tham. Unemployment
remains our greateat problam. Yat, as I say,
it was deliberataly ignorad in the Speech from
the Throna. One thing that might have been
mentioned in that speech, that might have
been appropriately mentioned in almost avery
paragraph of it, is the dole, for that is the
chief polîcy of the administration in office
to-day. Tha Governmant is becoming a tnaster
in administering the dole and in giving it
différent naines in an attampt to keep on
fooling the people.
One of tha chiaf causes of the axisting distrase in Canada is the persistent and wild
raîsing of tariff barriers. In eaying this 1

cation of high protection. We are getting
the results now, and these are much worse
because of a situation that is universal. I
will repeat here what has been said by a
great economist who happens to come from
France, a country which during the last cam-

paign was often said to be one of the most
prosperous in the world because it bad a
high tariff policy. That great economist is
now giving lectures in Montreal, and he said
that the first important step necessary for the
relief of the present world-wide depression
and the elimination of international mistrust
is a move on the part of one of the major
nations towards lowering tariff barriers. I
should like it to be clearly understood that
that great economist comes from a country
that has one of the highest tariffs in the
world.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD:

What is his name?

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Mr. Romier. I say
that although I recognize that the remedies
necessary for solving our present problems
are as numerous and as complex as the causes
underlying those problems.
I think also that there should be a very
deliberate effort made towards the extension

west had suffered a great deal of misery
because of difficulties in getting rid of their
wheat. They held back for higher prices
that never were obtained. Well, if the Wheat
Pool and the farmers of the Northwest wish
to defy creation, they must take the consequences. If, forsooth, they had reached their
goal, which was $2 a bushel, the result would
have been the greatest misfortune that could
have happened to them, because every
country in the world would have started the
cultivation of wheat. That would have been
a disaster for our grain growers, and it was
the act of a merciful Providence that they
did not get the $2. I am perfectly in earnest
when I say that.
According to the report of the Royal Commission on Railways-I suppose we may refer
to it briefly as the Duff report-the surn of
$512,000,000 was expended prior to 1917 for
the Intercolonial Railway, the Prince Edward
Island Railway, the Hudson Bay Railway, and
the National Transcontinental, and I was
going to ask the honourable senator from
Saskatchewan whether that figure was included
in the two and a half billions to which he
referred. But perhaps his right honourable
leader (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) is better
prepared to give an answer. I am not asking the question as a joke, for I have gone
through the report carefully and cannot find
an answer to this question. Two and one-half

forgive him, for if I were asked to point
out who was the guilty person, who was
responsible for putting the hurden of the
National Railways on the Canadian people,
I am afraid I should have to point out the
right honourable gentleman, because of what
he did ini another place. He handled the
matter with great ability, and Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, who liked to have a worthy foe in
front of him, saîd that at last the Conservative Party had found a man. Our right
honourable friend did the trick. He landed
upon us the responsihility for what is to-day
two and a haîf billions.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Was not the time that
the responsibility was landed upon the country the time that the bonds were guaranteed
by the Canadian Government?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I will answer that
afterwards. At the present moment I do not
see anything apropos in that question.
The report begins with a sort of history
of transportation in Canada, but there is a
gap. I do not want to speak disparagingly
of the report, for I think it was prepared
with great care. The members of the Commission were very able men, who spent ten
months in studying our railway problems.
They were assisted by alI the experts they
required, and they had every facility for
carrying on their work, including the very
best means of transportation from one end
of the country to the other. But there is one
thing that worries me more than anything
else, and that is why they left that gap. The
Drayton report, which was a very good one
-I have made use of it several times-dealt
with the situation up to 1917. The Duif
report starts wîth 1923. Now, why is that?
Did nothing take place during those six
years?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN:- Nothing
much. worthy of criticism.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Why ignore those
That question has
six years like that?
puzzled me and kept me awake, because
there must have been some qucer goings-on
during those six years. Yet, as I say, there
is not a word said about them. Why did
the Commission pick out 1923? That leaves
only nine years up to 1931. They might have
rounded the thing out and made it cover ten
years anyway.
I should like Vo know, and shaîl insist upon
knowing, what the receipts and expenditures
of those railways were from 1917 to 1923. The
report gives the figures for the years 1923 to
1931, but why is there that blank period of
53721-4 j

51

six years? Might the explanation be that
some of the gentlemen who were on the Commission did flot care to, have that period
investigated? I do flot know, but surely we
should have some light on that. We shouki
know what took place.
I reinember, perhaps better than most
honourable members, what ha.ppened iii 1917,
because with ail the strength and vigour that
I had then-and I had more than I have today-I opposed the taking over of the Canadian National Railway by the Goverament. I
spoke for four and a half hours, giving some
good reasons for my contentions. The other
day the right honourable gentleman said there
was nothing else that could be done. I tell
hlm right now that he could have done something else, and nobody knows it better than
he himself: he could have appointed a receiver. I have before me Hansard containing
the letter of protest against the Government
buying the Canadlian Northern, prepared by
Mr. C. S. Camnpbell, the greatest commercial
lawyer of -cur time. He was the son of Sir
Alexander Camnpbell, who at one time was
leader of the Government in this House and
Minister of Justice in Sir John A. Macdonald's
Cabinet. That letter was signed by the principal people of Montreal, including the honourable gentleman who was introduced this evening. It is very pleasant for me Vo be able to
welcome him so soon. Mr. A. J. Brown, K.C.,
a director of the Royal Bank and of many
large commercial enterprises, and who is considered to be a great commercial lawyer and
the confidentiai adviser of so-me of our biggest
men-he signed that letter of protest. I did
not think it would fit into my remarks so well.
Now, I ýmay warn honourable ne4mbers that
I shail have to deal with this subjeet e.t considerable length, but if I oa.nnot retiaîn their
attention I can m, least, rely on His Honour
the Speaker, the Oierk of the House, the
Sergeant at Arms, and the two leaders remaining in their seats.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: You will need
the reporters-, too.
Hon. Mr. CAiSORAIN: 0f course, they are
the principal people. 'Me other day the right
honourable gentleman spoke of -the "Vtreinendous riot ocdrailway building " at the commenement of the preSeat oentury. I do not
blame him for this statiement, because it bas
become a legend not only among Consrvatives, but aloo among Liberals, that Sir Wilrrid Laurier and bis administration built too
many railrwys. Well, I purpose to give the

aze in the Dr-ayton-Aý,cwortli report so often
that, 1 can quote it almost word for word.
In that report it is stated that whien Sir WVilfrid Laurier cname into power there were
18,000l miles of railway in the country, or,
1
rough-ly speaking-, a mile of railway to every
300 person,. WhIen 'he lft. office at the end

Iihat, and surelv hoe cannot be blamed for the
lîuilding, of tlîree transcontinental railways
e-len hie was so strongly opposed to the

I hope the right lionourable gentleman will
not gainsay the Drayton-Acworth report. At

passage:

nîfileage lîad increased by 40 per cent to
25.400 miles; a mile of railway to cvery 284

This means that diiring those fifteen years
the flow of immigration was sufficient to maintain practically the same relation of population to railway mileage. Fifteen years bofore
we had 300 pcrsons per mile of railway, and
at the end of that period we had 284 persons
per mile of railway-a reduction of only 16
poisons. Surely this does net warrant the
right honourable gentleman's "tremendous riot
of railwav building."
Now, the railway mileage contracted for
woiild nover have been constructed had it not
been that seibsidies were granted by the administratiun that took office in 1911. To make
matters worse. oui' ponulation wvas practically
at a standstill. The Drayton-Acworth report

have quoted the Drayton-Acwýorth report
showving the increase of railway mileage froim
2.5,000 te 40,000 in six short years. Was the
"tremendous riot of railway buildinig" ýbefore
or after 1911? 1 always like to empbasize
this faot, hecause, as I have said, it bas unfortunately hecome a legend that Sir Wilfrid
Laurier and bais administration built too many
railways. Well, when hoe went eut of office
in 1911 we had 24,000 miles of railway; and
I think that if the mileage bad been left at
fat figure the country could have got aleng
without any groat incenvenience.
But even under the present administration,
during the
past year, 774 miles have
been added te our railway mileage. I
should like te knowv the reason for this additional -mileage. Per bcad of population we
bave nearly twice as much railway mileage as
the United States. They have 400 people te
every mile of railway; taking the last census,
wvehave 232 people te each mile. Yet we are
still building. At the present time we have
under construction seme 700 miles of railway. Wlii'n is this "tremendous neot of railway building" going te stop? Now is the
time te caîl a halt.

remedies that doctors give to pcople who are
very sick; they may ho poisanous, and if the
dose is ton strong they may bo fatal. Sir
John A. Macdonald made the dose ton strong,
and he noarly killeil the country. In 1888 and
1889, as a land surveor I was ongaged in
making a cadastral survey in the townships
of Comnpton, Whitton and Clifton, in the
county af Compton. The dimensions of aur
townships are ten miles by ten miles, sa that
I had ta caver threc hundrod square miles
in the three townships. In making this kind
of survey the surveyor has ta find the awner
of every parcel af land in every township, and
no matter how small the parcel may ho, a
cadastral number, whieh is recagnized hy the
Government, must be given ta it. It is an
excellent system, anc that I have often

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

The Curran Bridge spans the Lachine Canal
-it is there yet-and is made af stone and
iran, and is 220 foot long. It is almost incredible, but there is the evidence af a Rayal
Commissian ta show that 3,600,000 foot of
lumber were supposed ta go inta that bridge.
1 will tell you how it was dane. A load af
lumber wauld ho taken around the block,
and a choque would hc- issued foar it, and thon
it wauld ho taken around the block again, and
again. If the quantity af lumber that was
said ta have gono inta the bridge had been
piled up on the site of the canal thero wauld
have been no rooma in it for the watcr.
Same Han. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: It wauld have taken
360 cars, or a train two miles and a quarter
long, nat including the space for the locomotives, ta carry such a quantity of lumber.
This took place just prier to 1896. Later there
wa.s a change of gavernment and Sir Wilfrid
Laurier came inta power.
But ta came back ta the right hanourablo

Sir James Lougbeedsaid: "Keep quiet. Probably that fellow is right. Let us vote." If
the railroad bad gone inta the hands of a
receiver everyone would bave had to prove
bis claim, and there would bave been priorities.
Naw, an page 14 of this repart I sec the
sum of two and a haîf billion mentioned, and
I want ta give a few figures. There are these
items: investment in Government railways,
deficit, 352,000,000; warking
$390,000,000;
capital, $15,000,000; cash subsidies, $44,000,000;
cash boans, $639,000,000; deficît on Eastern
lines-the Maritime Provinces-26,000,000;
acquisition of Canadian Northern stock, $10,000,000. And for what? Stock that was nat
worth a cent. Ta that yau must add W4,000,000 for the Hiidson's Bay Railway, and outstanding liabilities, making a total of $2,536,000,000. And we are still building railwaysI
If yau add ta this total the $512,000,000 that
I have already referred ta, it will mnake a
grand total of $3,000,000,000.
On page 15 there is a comparative statement of tbe earnings of the Canadian National and the Canadian Pacifie rail*ways. We
find that for tbe period from 1923 ta 1931 the
Canadian National Railways earned from
freight $1,714,000,000, and from passengers
$321,000,000. On the other hand, we find that
the carnings of the C.P.R. were from freight
$1,278,000,00, and from passengers $303,000,000.
If you look at these figures at yaur leisure yau
will observe that out of every $5 earned 'by
the Goverument railways $4 was fram freight
and $1 from passengers, wbereas in the case
of the C. P. R., out of every $4 earned $3 was
f rom freight and 31 fromn passengers. In other
words, only twenty per cent of the receîpts of
thbe aId Grand Trunk or the Canadian National came from passenger earnings, wbile
in the case of the Canadian Pacifie Railway
tbey constituted twenty-fivc per cent.
1For earrying mnail the Canadian National
Railways receivcd $33,000,000; the C. P. R.
33M,000,000. Can anyone tell me how it was

55

that the C. P. R. got 334,000,000 for this
service when the Government s'oad was meeting the Empresses at Quebee? The express
earnings of the C. N. R. ainaunted to $124,000,000, and those of the C. P. R. to $97,000,000. If you take into consideration the fact
that the mileage of the C.N.R. is seven thousand miles greater than that of the C.P.R.
you will realize that these figures are nlot -out
of proportion. To me the marvel of it ail is
that under publie ownership the Canadian National Rai'lways should have done sa well.
Fancy the energy and the work that mnust
have been neeessary ta bring in $2,337,000,000
in nine years. The old I. C. R., which has
been running naw for n'early sixty years, neyer
macle so much mon-ey in al:l its existence.
However, it cannat be denied that Sir Henry
Thornton bad the knack of keeping ail the
employees in bis service right on their toes,
looking for business, from marning ta night.
If they heard that anyone intended ta go on
a trip they were at his office to seil him un
ordinary ticket, plus a Pullman chair, or a
sleeping-car ticket, or whatever was required.
0f course, the kind of service that they had
cost money. But they got the business. In
short, the way in which the entire systemn was
rehabilitated was something marvelous.
The upshat of the thing was that the Canadian National Railways netted $281 ,000,000
ta the gaod, and the Canadian Pacific Railway
$412,000,000. But of course we must remember that the Canadian Pacific was anc institution, aneceompany that operated as a unit,
wbilst the other eomprised roads that were
built ta compete with anc another.
I tbink that the service given by the Canadian National was tao luxuriaus, tao gaod,
and I do not approve of the immense sumn
of money that was spent in providing that
service. But I ask-in the presence of a
director of the Canadian Pacifie-if the Canadian National was wrong in spending sa much
money that way, why should the Canadian
Pacifie have tried ta imi.tate it? If the
Canadian National gat a luxurious train with
a solarium at the end of it, the Canadian
Pacifie gat anc toa. If the Canadian National
came ta Parliament and received autharity
ta build railway lines inta seime part of the
Rocky Mountains where fruit is grawn, but
very few people live, then the Canadian
Pacifie did the same thing, although there
may not have heen enough business available
in the new district ta kecp one line gaing.
Every time that one company made a demand here tbe other fallowed suit. Wc ahl
remember that in anc session the Canadian
National asked for autharity ta byuild noa

press, I had net beard ai the disturbance te
which reicrence is new made, theugh I
hiad, ai course, heard af the one that occurred

OCTOBER 21, 1932
some days ago. I could not add to what
was said in another place as to the first disturbance, and I can say nothing about this.
I shall, however, be prepared to make a statement at the next sitting of this House.
THE PRICE OF COAL
Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. CAIRINE WILSON: Honourable
senators, I should like to call attention to an
articile that appeared in the Toronto Mail and
Empire of October 8 concerning an alleged
combine in respect to British anthracite. This
article states that the matter had already been
referred to the branch of the Department of
Labour that looks after the administration of
the Combines Act, and that was before the
matter was brought to the attention of this
House by the honourable senator from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux).
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I intended to
refer to-day te the statement made some days
ago by the honourable senator from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Lemieux). The only thing I
can add to what I said at that time is this:
I have taken the matter up with the Minister
of Labour, referring to him the allegation of
the honourable senator, and he advises me that
the Dominion Fuel Board keeps constantly
in toucha wi-th costs and prices, not only of
Welsh anthracite, but of all fuels under consunption in Canada, that the Board is giving
special attention to the matter now, in view of
the request of the honourable senator, and
that at a later date some informative and
useful data will probably be supplied to the
House. I think, from what information I can
get, that all fears are not quite justified.
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX: Honourable senators, may I say to the right honourable gent'leman that the Labour Council of
Ottaw, passed a resolution yesterday praying
the Government to start an investigation in
this matter. There is great excitement prevailing. I do not say this because I believe
there is a combine, but it is the geneml impression that there is. I made some inquiries
in Montreal respecting British anthracite and
was informed by a man who ocoupies a high
position in the Government service that the
cost of coal landed on the Harbour Commission's wharf in Montreal is $5.30. Of course
I realize that some charges for screening the
coal and delivering it to operators and to customers have to be added to this cost, but the
public cannot understand the reaon for the
large apread between, 'let us say, 88 or $9 and
$16 or $17. As the Minister knows very well,
we have on the Statute Book a Combines Act,

under which the Registrar, on the initiative
of the Government, or, better, cf the Minister
of Labour, can institute an inquiry. That is
all that the publie want, an inquiry to ascertain whether or net it is true that there is an
arrangement among the coal operators with
a view to keeping up the price of coal.
I repeat what I sa.id the other day, that
personally I have no evidence. I am simply
giving to the House the impression that exists
among the public, and I think it is the duty
of the Government to dispel that impres-ion
if it is a false one.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Act to
which the honourable senator refers is the
Combines Investigation Act. Certain steps
are open to any person who desires to invoke
that Act in this or any other case, and I have
not the least doubt that if the necessary steps
were taken the Act would be invoked in this
instance, as in any other. In the meantime.
the thought has occurred to me that as we
are not too busy in this House in the early
part of the session, we might add to our usefulness by doing a little of this work oursedlves,
if we are at al alarmed or curious.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I would offer
no objection at ail; in fact, I would welcome
a move along that line by those who are
especially interested in the subject. I could
take steps myself, but a move on my part
might take the glory froin someone else, and,
besides, might indioate that I shared in the
general fea-r. Had I reason to move I certainly wouild, but so far I have had no reason
to do so. I wish merely to intimate now that
instead of expecting others to more without
the necessary steps being taken under the
statute, we might move a little ourseIres.
ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Possibly it
would be of help to honourable senators that
I should now make a motion which ordinarily
would be made later in the day. The motion
is:

That when the House adjourns to-day it
stands adjourned until Thursday next at eight
o'clock in the evening.
The progress of legislation in the other House
does not seem to be very rapid, and it is
impossible for myself or anyone else to estimate when legislation may be in a position to
be transmitted to this House. There may
be some by next Thursday. It is also hoped
that at that time very important legislation
may be initiated here. Hence the selection

58

SENATE

of the date. I wish I could speak more positively as to both elements in the decision, but
I cannot go further.
The motion was agreed to.
THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Poirier for an
Address in reply thereto.
Honourable
Hon. J. P. B. CASO3RAIN:
members, I crave the indulgence of the House
once more, and may I suggest to my honourable colleagues that while we are waiting for
the other House to send us legislation we
may just as well save time by considering
matters that are likely to come before us.
If I am rightly informed, a Railway Bill based
on the report of the Royal Commission te
inquire into Railways and Transportation in
Canada--which report, for the sake of brevity,
I have called the Duff report-will be introduced by the right honourable leader of the
House when we reassemble next week. Well,
I promise honourable members that when
that Bill is presented for our consideration I
will not repeat anything that I may have to
say now in discussing the Duff report. Therefore I think we shall employ our time well
if to this extent we get in advance even of
the progressive Government that we have
to-day.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hear, hear.

ion. Mr. CASGRAIN: I have been asked
by some of my collcagues to explain the
letter of protest to which I referred last
night. They said I spoke so quickly and
jumped from one subject to another so
abruptly that they could not follow me. So
I think they are really entitled to some explanation. I should like to call the right
honourable gentleman's special attention to
the fact that this letter is not of my making
at aIl, but was drafted by that distinguished
lawyer Mr. C. S. Campbell, who, as I stated
last night, was the son of Sir Alexander
Campbell, at one time leader of the Government in this House and Minister of Justice
under Sir John A. Macdonald.
I intend to read only short extracts from
the letter of protest.
The purchase of a defined piece of railway
property is one thing. The buying of stock in
a company with unascertained assets and
unknown liabilities is another.
Right

Hon. Mr.

MEIGHEN.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Would the
honourable member not read the whole letter?
The author, Mr. Campbell, is not here to-day;
so he cannot be humiliated.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
read the whole letter.

I should like to

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There may
be some of it that time has destroyed.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Very well.
The Government Bill to authorize the purchase by it of the capital stock of the Canadian
Northern railway is half-way through the
House of Commons and will shortly be in the

Senate.

If it becomes law, it will impose on

Canada, at a time when the country is under
an unprecedented strain-

That was during the War, in 1917.
-- a burden of unknown magnitude, one certainly greater than any ever before imposed
upon this country, with the exception of the
war debt.
The purchase of a defined piece of railway
property is one thing.
The buying of stock
in a company with unascertained assets and
unknown liabilities is another. Once the Governient becomes the principal owner of the
comamon stock, it must provide out of loans or
taxes for ail the debts of the railway due or

to becone due and for ail future losses in
operating. ''he estimates of expenditure still
necessary to bo made run into enormous figures.
That is prophetic. That was written in 1917.
No one knows what the real extent of its
obligations are. The railway bas bonds outstanding and debts unpaid; so have its subsidiaries. There are guarantees given by it to
other comipanies, unpaid balances on contracts
and upon accounts, but to what extent is
unknown.
What its assets are is equally unknown. It
operates and is interested in railway companies,
land companies, telegraph companies, tunnel
companies, lumber companies and hotel companies. But no one knows how far it owns
them, what their assets or liabilities are, nor
to what extent the railway company is responsible for their liabilities.
No other railway company nor any other
group of business men would consider such an
acquisition except after elaborate examination
and reports from accountants and appraisers
on the assets and liabilities, and then only
subject to a solvent guarantee that ail supposed
assets would he dolivered and that no undisclosed debts or obligations would appear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Does the
honourable gentleman say that that is true,
that the assets and liabilities were not known?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
true, but I believe it is.

I do not say it is

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They were
not cnly definitely and completely known, but
definitely and completely revealed, and time
has shown the revelation to be correct.

OCTOBER 21, 1932
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Very good. The
right honouraible gentleman asked me to read
the letter.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I wanted to
say something.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
To find out these things, where such examinations and guarantee cannot be had, the
usual course in the United States bas been ta
place the road in the hands of a receiver,
whose staff can ascertain them and place before
those interested an accurate and clear statement.
I do not think that was done.
Rig-ht Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Absolutely.
I made a long
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
speech on tiat, and those who were in the
House at the time will remember that Sir
James Lougheed admitted that people here
were investigating books that were in Winnipeg.
Systems quite as large, notably the Union
Pacific, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe and
the Rock Island, have in the United States
been through this process and have emerged
from it with capital written down te correspond to the actual values in a solvent condition and able ta perform their duties as public
servants.
The only examination se far had into the
affairs of the Canadian Northern bas resulted
in the opinion of two of three railway experts
that the stock proposed to be purchased was
worth nothing. That means that whatever its
nominal value may be, the unsecured debts are
more than enough to prevent its being sold to
any reasonably prudent purchaser. In view of
the fact that no money was paid ta the company
for the stock and that the company has never
been able ta earn anything upon it, there was
and is no reason to expect any other result
from examination.
No agreement or obligation ta purchase is
produced.
I think the rigiht honourable gentleman will
admit that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Obligation?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
No agreement or obligation ta purchase is
In fact, nothing bas transpired

except verbally, and then between members of
the Government not named and persons whose
names are not disclosed. In fact what is ta
be paid, who is ta get paid for it, what the
cost and the attendant obligations are, no one
knows. The smallest transaction in common
life could net be concluded in such a way, and
any attempt ta do it by trustees responsible
ta a court would unquestionably be a breach of
trust, and this is the largest and most onerous
undertaking ever contemplated by any Canadian
Government, and the most risky. It is safe ta
say that no road capitalized above its earning
power can ever be a useful publie servant, nor
can any road bought by a Government for more
than its worth ever be anything but a continuous drain on the taxpayer.

The Canadian Northern railway was built
as a private speculation. Its bonds were sold
to financiers at a discount. No money was
received into its treasury for its stock. Nothing has been made public which would justify
the taxing df other citizens of this country for
the purpose of giving fictitious value ta these
bonds and stocks.
I suppose I may dispense with that part of
the letter which alludes to borrowing money
in New York at a very high rate. I pass that
and read the conclusion:
The undersigned, all of whom, as investors,
have a stake in the prosperity of this country,
desire to call the attention of their fellowcountrymen to the grave risk they all are
running of having their own earnings diverted
for the purpose of securing profits to bondholders and stockholders of a concern, the equity
in whose enterprise has been declared by the
only people at all in a position to form an
opinion, to be of no value. It is also urged
that the strongest possible protests be made
before it is too late to all senators and members
of Parliament.
The names follow. I need not give them;
anybody can see them in the Senate Hansard
of 1917. I think the list included the naines
of the directors of every bank in Montreal
except the Bank of Commerce.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The honourable gentleman ought to put them on record
for the future.
Hon. Mr. CASGAIN: They are already on
record. Of course, if one makes a bad speech
it goes on record in Hansard and he never
hears the end of it; but if he makes a decent
speech it is embalmed in Hansard, and it is as
dead as the oldest Egyptian mummy. However, we will try to resurrect the mummy.
First is F. W. Molson, a director of Molsons
Bank, a director of the City and District
Savings Bank, and a very prominent man in
Montreal. The next is Huntley R. Drummond,
a director of the Bank of Montreal, president
of the Canada Sugar Company, and a son of
the late Sir George A. Drummond, for many
years one of the strongest Conservatives in this
Iouse. When there are Conservative gatherings
in Montreal he is always the first to be there;
nevertheless be saw fit to send this protest ta
the Government.
My right honourable friend did not heed it.
These big business men do not put their names
on paper before the public unless they think
there is a big emergency. The next namç is
Zeph. Hébert, President of the Board of Trade
of the City of Montreal, President of Hébert
& Company, one of the largest wholesale houses
in this country, which bas a turnover in excese
of $3,000,000 a year. Next is Mr. A. J. Brown,
K.C., director of the Royal Bank and of many
large commercial enterprises, a man who is
supposed to be a great commercial lawyer and
the confidential adviser of some of our biggest
men in Montreal.
Some of you may guess who these men are.

60

SENATE

I h we kniown men of very great importance
w ho have said that iniless A. J. Brown put his
initials to a documtent it would not do.
In passing, let me say that I think tiat the
honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Brown) is
an acquisition to the Senate, and tiat the
Government should be commended for making
sich a good appoint ment. He i. one of a ciass
of men who are specially fitted for service
bore, and I informed him that because he bas
taken the oath he -cannot refuse to give us
legal advice free of charge. I walked across
the floor to remind 1im of that, so that ho
would not forget it.
The next is H. A. Ekers, who was mayor of
Moitreal by acclamation, a very popular man
im Montreal, twice Conservative candidate in
that city, and even at the risk of displeasing
his party--and I am sure he would not like to
do that under the present circunmstances-he put
his name to this letter.

I may say that he was thon trying to get an
appointment as a senator, and it must have
been a very difficult thing for him to blame
the Government under those circumstances.
Next is Mr. Charles Chaput, President of
Charles Chapuît & Co. Then there is Mr.
Charles Meredith, President of Meredith & Co.,
the leading bond house in Montreal. To show
you the importance of this company, I may say
that its vice-president is Sir Charles B. Cordon,
vice-president of the Bank of Montreai, who
was singled out for honours bynHis Majesty for
services rendered during this war. '[he next is
C. S. Camjbell, K.C., the great commercial
lawyer. a son of Sir Alexander Campbell, who
at one 1im1e was leader of the Goveriiment in

this House, and Minister of Justice under Sir
John Macdonald. Then there is W. R. Miller,
w-ho was last year president of the Board Of
Trade of Montreal, and president of the
Edw ardsbuîrg Starch Company. Then there is
George Caverhili, a director of the Montreal
Light. Heat and Power Company, president of
Caverhill, Learmont & Company. the largest
and oldest hardware company in the district.
Mark you, all these men are good Conservatives. There is not a Grit among them;
not one of them was ever known to give any
but a Tory vote.
The next name is that of William McMaster,
wiho is a very important man, a director of the
Bank of Montreal and president of the Canada
Explosives Company, a man who is doing business with this Government and with the Munitions Board; still he did not hesitate to tell
the Government what he thought. The next
name is H. W. Blackwell, vice-president of the
Merchants Bank and vice-president of the Steel
Foundries.
Then Sir James Lougheed asked:
Are there any ordinary, every-day citizens
on the list?

Hon Mr. CASGRAIN.

I replied:
No; I think they avoided getting any but
the mos t prominent names. Next is Andrew J.
Dawes, a director of the Merchants Bank and
president of the National Breweries.
Senator McMeans then inquired:
'ire there any prominent men outside of
M3ontreai?
To wbich I replied:
There is may honourable friend from Winnipeg
(Hou. Mr. McMeans.)
The next nane on the
list is Robert Hampson, president of Hampson
& Sons. F. Howard Wilson, director of the
Merchants Bank and the Montreal Tramways.
laines Morgan, president of Henry Morgan &
Company, a company which occupies a position
in Montreal somewhat similar to that occupied
by Eatons in Toronto. George E. Drunmond,
a director of the Molsons Bank. I have named
the activities of these gentlemen fron nemory.
They are all good Conservatives, with the
exception perhaps of one. I venture to say that
iot more than one of these men, if they voted,
voted for Sir Wilfrid Laurier at the last election.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hon. Mr. CASCRAIN: Evidently. That
was one time when the Conservative Party
was not with the interests. It ouglt to be
noted.
Now, shall I proceed witi the readin
of
the letter?
Hon. Mr. MARTIN:

A waste of tint.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
All right; but I
have been asked by your leader to read it. I
am quite willing to give up.
Soie Hon. SENATORS:

Go on.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
No agreenment or obligation to purchase is
produced.
In fact, nothing has transpired
except verbaily, and then between members of
the Government not named and persons whose
names

are not disclosed.

I think that these explanations are sufficient,
and that my colleagues who asked for information about the purchasing of the Canadian Northern Railway's stock have got all
the information they want.
Reverting now to the report, I shall continue from where I left off last night. On
page 19 of the report is a statement of capital expenditures for the period 1923-1931, as
follows:

It will be seen that for rail and inland water
lines the total capital expenditure of the
Canadian National was almost $200,000,000
greater than that of the Canadian Pacifie;
and the grand total shows that the Canadian
Nationals outlay was the larger by aibout
$158,000,000. But, as I have said Ïbefore, the
Canadian National has a mileage of 7,000
greater than the Canadian Pacifie, and, besides, the National had to be rehahilitated
from start te finish.

I have looked in vain for any reference
te Lucerne.
If I understand correctly, the
Canadian Pacifie is interested in Lucerne, but
there is not a word about it in the report.
I do net know what the faets are, but surely
the cemmissioners, who weru working for ten
months, must have been aware that Lucerne
is in the picture. I amn told that the investment there is over $7,000,000; and I do net
think much of that investment.

SENATE

Considering that the Canadian National
hotels are run at tha public expense, it is
surprising that the commissioners did flot go
into the whole situation more daaply. Take
the Chateau here: some people are setting a
very bad example by paying too little for a
big suite of rooms. The statement of revenues
and expenses of the Canadian National hotels
shows that the loss was a small one, considering the fact that the hotels are under Govarnmant ownership. The revenues of the
Canadian Pacifie hotels for the period froma
1923 to 1931 were $63,112,829, and the expanses ware $55,644,002, showing an operativa

expenses, whila they include taxes, do not
include interest on capital investment, which
interest at 5 per cent would amount to about
threa and a haîf million dollars a year for
nine years, or a total of approximately
If that figure wera taken into
$31,000,000.
consideration the loss to the Canadian Pacifie
on the hotel business would be something like
$24,000,000 for the period. And surely 5 per
cent interest would not bae ton bigh for an
investmant of that kind.
The report next deals with increases in
assats and liabilities. The Canadian National
increased its total assets between January 1,
1923, and December 31, 1931, by $452,325,052,
and ils total liabiliýties by $922,430,755. That
is, the increase in total liabilities was greater
by about $470,000,000 than the increase in
assets; and, dividing that figure by nine, we
sac that every year the growth of the liabilitias
exceeded the growth of the assets by about
$52,000,000. Those who favour public ownership might well consider that enormous annual
increase of liabilities, $52,000,000, at the rate
of $1,000,000 a week. Nothing like that could
have happened under private ownership.
Nowv I ýcorne to the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company. During the nine yeýars denît
with it increased its total assets by $253,447,In
438, and its liabilities by $266,819,039.
other words, the increase in its liabilities exceeded by $13,371.601 the increase in ite assets.
Dealing with the gro.wth o-f the burden of
taxation, tha report contains a paragraph
which to my minc shows a littla partýiality.
I refer to 'paragraph 89:
When Canada entered the Great War there
existed a federal debt of $336,000,000, entailing
an annual charge of approximately $20,000.000.
MWar expenditures added about $1,700,000,000 to
the debt of the Dominion. In the post-war
period, while there were years when the debt
was reduced, the result on the whole bas been

and, in the
I think it would have been onjly fair on the
part of the Commission to state that
Hon. Mr. CASG11AIN.

the debt had been re'duced by a former administration to the extent of $245,O00,000, and
to give the period when the reduction
wvas effected.
Then the report discusseis thle field of railway operation, and after giving the total railway mileage of Canada as at December 31,
1930, it proceeds:
The increase over the preceding year was
774 miles. In addition, there was under constructionThat is, at the prescrnt timie.
-713 miles, chiefiy in the Prairie Provinces.
Now, since everyono adroits that we have f00
mnuch railway mileage, vwhy continue adding
to it? The report does flot say whetber the
Canadian National or the Canadian Pacific
is engaged in building thjs additional mileage.
Paragraphi 97 contains a table showinig the
steain rai'iway milcoge by provinces, the pýopulation, aad the miles of railwvay per capita as
of 1930. This is said to, be the latest year for
which. comp-lete data are availaible. The table
shows that in QuWbec the population per mile
of railway is 559, while in Saskatchewan there
is a mile of railway for only 108 persons. How
oan a population od 108 per mile of railway
support its, railway system when even in Quebec, withi a population of 559 to every mile
of railway, we have had railway deficits since
the War? It is evident that Que'bec has not
got its proper share of railway facilities, for
according, to this table Saskiatchewan bas five
times ouýr railway mileage par capita.
Now as to mileage. The re.port shows that
in Canada the Claniadian National System bas
21,981 miles of rail'way, and the Canadian
Pacific 16,886-a total Canadian milcage of
38,867. In the United States the Canadian
National owns 1,899 miles of railway, and the
Canadian Pacifie is said to icontrol lines there
-this control, I presume, means ownershipwith a mileage of 5,160. One would t'hink t.hat
the United States could provide their own
raiiway service, e.specially as we are d.oing i.t
at. a loss; but of course there is a redeming
feature with respect to this, and I shahi deal
with it later. Taking t ha mileage of the two
systems in Canada and in the United States,
we have a grand total of 45,926 miles of railway. That is only 2,000 miles short of cjrcl.ing
the world twice at the equator. Yet the rig.ht
honourable gentlemrnan oppos3ite speaks of " the
tremendous riot of railiway building " at the
beg.inning of the century. Wheýn Sir Wilfrid
Laurier laft ýoffice wýe used to baast that there
wera enough railways in Canada to go once
around the world. Well, since that "tremendons riot of rail<way building" our railway
mileage bas been added to at suýcl a rate that,

OCTOBER 21, 1932
as 1 have said, it is now elimost sufficient to
circle the world twice.
There is no doubt that the party now in
opposition had not very many friends on the
Transportation Commission, for in speaking
of the transaction that took place with Sir
liugh Allan and his associates i 1872-of
course, ail rememiber thàt famous Pacifie
Scandai, even after the lapse of so many
years-the report dismisses it in this charming way:
Before these arrangements could be put into
effect, however, the ministry resigned, part>'
because of its relations with the syndicate,
which then voiuntarily gave up its charter.
If the Pacific Scandai had been perpetrated
by others than those who were directiy implicated, perhaps the Commission would have
been more severe, or at least more explâcit.
But 1 will let it go at that.
I have spoken of our operation of railway
lines in the United States having one redeeming feature. 'It is this: of every dollar
the old Grand Trunk Railway earned, its Uine
to Chicago, known as the Grand Trunk Western, produced sixty-three cents. In fact its
earnings from that line kept the system alive.
We should also take into account its valuable Dearborn Street terminais in Chicago.
These were acquircd by the Grand Trunk at
a time when Chicago was a comparatively
smaîl place, they cover a large area. right in
the centre of the City, and obviously they
are worth many million dollars to-day. I find
nothing- in t-his report giving the Grand Trunk
System. any credit for having acquired that
valuable property. On the otiier hand, the
Central Vermont Railway has been run at a
ioss. Why we should give this unprofitable
transporta-tion service to our wealthy neighbours in that state I do not know. The
increasing operating deficits on the line would
warrant a suspension of the service.
What government aid did the Canadian
Pacific Railway Company get? My purpose
in a.skin-g the question is Vo. point out that if
the Grand Trunk Pacific had received an>'thing like the generous terms accorded to the
Canadian Pacifia it might have pulled through.
To my mind the great mistake the Laurier
Government made was to drive too hard a
bargain with the old Grand Trunk Railway
Compan>', which company at that time had
assets of over 3487,000,000. The agreement
with the Cana dian Pacific Railway Comipany'
was signed on the 21st of October, 1880, and
it was ratîfied in Decem-ber of the same year.
Now, under that agreement what was given
to the Canadian Pacifie? In the first place,
the compan>' was given the 710 miles of rail-

63

way which the Government had constructed
up to that time at a cost exceeding 837,000,000.
As honourahie members are aware, after the
Pacifia Scandai the Mackenzie Government
failed to interest priv'ate capital in the projeat.
and Alexander Mackenze-a good Scotahman
-decided to build certain sections of the line
to conneat what we then called the water
stretches, so that these could he utilized during the summer. 0f course, once winter set
in transportation was at a standstill, and the
people served b>' this rail-and-water route had
to get in their supplies during the summner
inonths. I was engaged on that surve>', and I
think the iea was a good one. In addition
to this gift of 710 miles of completed railway,
the Canadian Pacifia Company got the benefit of the surveys that had tbeen made over a
period cf seven years. The Government, prior
to entering into the agreement, sent eut surveyors, who made very thorough surveys, and
it was these surveys that enabled the Canadian Pacifia engineers to carry through the
undertaking in five years in place of the ten
speaified in the agreement. Then the comnpany was suhsidized on, a very generous scale
by a gift of $25,000,000 in cash-a pretty large
sum in those days-and 25,000,000 acres o
selected land. You would think the Government had been sufficiently liberal towards the
conipan>' and that that was enough. Not at
all. The compan>' was granted exemption
fromn payment of dut>' on alI materials imported for the construction of the railway, and
nearly aIl these came from. the United States.
But that was not ail. It was relieved from
taxation on its lands for a period of twenty
years after issue of the patents, and on stock
and other .property fer ever. And as if these
concessions were not enough, the company was
empowered to charge any freight rates it chose
until its revenues enabied it to pay a ten per
cent dividend. Weil, you might think that
was the earth with a fence around it. But
no; over and above ail these gifts and concessions the compan>' enjoyed an absolute transportation monopoly for some twenty-five years.
Later, when the Company' was hard up, the
Government paid it over 810,000,000 for upwards of 6,700,000 acres of land that it relinquished, and guaranteed its securities to an
amnounit of $15,000,000. However, the conpany paid the guaranteed bonds upon
maturit>'.
But how different>' the Government treated
the 'Grand Trunk Railway Company with
regard to its Grand Trunk Pacifia undertaking. The administration of Sir Wilfrid
Laurier refused to grant one acre of land by
way of suhsidy, though it did give the
Company its right of way. Now, would the

SENATE

64

Dominion have been hurt if the Government
had given the Grand Trunk Pacifie a subsidy
of a certain number of acres per mile of road
constructed? That would have helped the conpany materially and would have encouraged it
to bring in settlers and sell them homesteads,
iist as the Canadian Pacifie Railway has been
doing. J ani not antagonistic to the Canadian
Pacific Railhay; indeed, in this House I have
been called a C.P.R. man because I have

1S850 and 1860 it expended $30,000.000 on railway construction, on which capital its shareholers have never been paid a cent by way
of interest or dividend. I think those shareholders have been treated very shabbily indeed
bv the Goverernent of this country, whether
Lil eral or Conservative.
Not many honourable members may be
awar that the site of the pleasant lawn now
fronting thtse buildings was at one time a
maîi-s of rock.

This rock was blasted and re-

tmed te he other side of the canal, to what
at that time was called. I think, Mackenzie
Park. When the Grand Trink wanted to biild
the Chateau Laurier Sir Wilfrid Laurier in-citd on payment of $160,000 for the site,
aind besides that made it a term of the sale
that the company remove the fine old trees
on the property and replant them on Nepean
Point. The company had to engage the Bell
T'elephone Company to handle those trees.
I îlo not think a single tree survived: you
iannot transplant old trees.
This illustrates the miserly way in which
hn administration of pSir Wilfrid Laurier
deait with the Grand Trunk. All that administration gave the Grand Trunk Pacifie was
Sir
i giarantee. A guarantee of what?
Collingwood Schreiber, then Deputy Minister
oi Raihvays and Canals, estimated the cost of
construction from Winnipeg to a point to be
fixed 125 miles west of Edmonton at $17,333
guaranteed
The Government
mile.
per
cper cent of the cost; it did not
isentv-fiv
giv e the railway company a cash subsidy.
Aktually the railway cost over $40,000 a mile.
How could you expeot any railway to be built
inder such conditions? I ani familiar with
tlis matter because I was selected to answer
the then leadcr of the Opposition when the
railway legislation was introduced in 1903, and
tain in 1904. when some amendments to that
IrLilation were brough down, and yet again in
1909, when it was found that the cost of conHon. Mi. CASGRAIN.

struction was very much more than the estimated cost, especially in the Rocky Mountains,
where in some sections the construction cost
per mile was three times 830,000.
As a further instance of the miserly way
in which the administration then treated the
Grand Trunk Railway Co mpany, I may niention that one day Mr. Wainwright-whom
many of us knew very well-came here and
said to me: "For goodness sake stop talking
about the bargain the Laurier Government
made! They made such a bard bargain that
Mr. Hays is having a difficult enough time
in London to get his shareholders to accept
it." Naturally I eased off in order not to
hurt the enterprise and not to embarrass
Mr. Hays in London.
Then the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway
Company actually agreed to pay three per
cent interest on the cost of the National
Transcontinental Railway, no matter what
it might be. That was a very risky thing to
do. In fact the construction cost much more
than was estimated in the first place. When
the Grand Trunk became bankrupt because it
had guaranteed the debts of the Grand
Trunk Pacifie, the Government exercised its
right under the guarantee and took in the
Grand Trunk to "sweeten" the Grand Trunk
Pacifie, and that is how the Grank Trunk
shareholders came to be left high and dry.
To show you how the road was being built
I may say that en the way to a political
meeting with Sir Wilfrid Laurier I said to
him: "Do you know that 667 miles of railway from Winnipeg to Wainright are actually
in operation to-day, and have not cost the
taxpayers of this country one cent of money
or one acre of land?" The old gentleman
did not pay very much attention to my statement at the time, but during the meeting
I noticed that he made the most of it.
Now I have finished. I have to stop,
because there is a gap between 1917 and
1923. I sincerely hope that when the Bill
based on the Duff report comes down we shall
have some information regarding those six
years. Here is the Drayton report covering
the period up to 1917, and here is the Duff
report covering from 1923 on. Why the gap
between those years? I do not know. I
leave honourable members of this lieuse to
surmise.
I thank honourable members very much
for their kind attention. T-hat I have said
I shall net have to say again when the Bill
comes before us.
The Address was adopted.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Honourable members, since the calling of the Orders
of the Day I have been able to read of the

an effort to procure some further information
for the House, because I think the matter
of sufficient importance to warrant an early
disclosure of anything that may he disclosed
in relation to the riots. I was in hopes of
being able to give the information within
a very short time, but if the House is to

CANADIAN NATIONAL-CANADIAN
PACIFIC BILL
FIRST READING

Righit Hon. ARTHUR MEIGIIEN introduced Bil] A, an Act respecting the Canadian
National Pax1ways and to provide fer ce-eperation with the Canadian Pacifie Railway
System, and for other purpeses.
The Bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shahI this
Bill ha read a second time?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: To-morrow.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: With the leave
of the Senate.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAI4IM: Honourable
members, I do not want to retard the business
of the flouse, but this is a very, very important measure. Although I have not yet
seen a copy of the Bill, I have no objection
to its second reading being moved to-morrow,
pr ovided that the debate be adjourned until
next week in order that ail those who may
wish to discuss the Bill may he given an
opportunity to do so, and that the leader on
this side of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
may be present.
Right Hon. Mr, MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, the suggestion of the right honourable leader of the other side of the House

65

(Right Hlon. Mr. Graham) is quite reasonable. I should have said that the motion
for the second reading of the Bill will not
be pressed to a vote te-merrow should there
be any present a-t the sitting who desire the
motion to be earried over to next week, or
any absentees who may ha desirous of
speaking.
I apprehend that aIl honourahie members
of this body are pleased to, sec the Bill
corne before us for consideration at this
period of the session, when, hecause of
slow progress in the other House, our duties
are not onereus and we are therefore in the
best position te perform our function in the
machinery of gevernment. I arn sure that
I miay say on hehaîf of honourable members
from ail camps of polities that we will give
this measure calm, deliberate and unbiased
consideration, and that ail who are especially
intereqted in it will have the right to corne
before the appropriate committee of this
flouse and ha heard.
It is not usual on the introduction of a
measure in this flouse te enter into any
ehaborate statement of its provisions. On
this occasion, however, I think it but right
that I should -ive a little more detail than
usual, and endeaveur to make a little plainer
the purpose of the Bill. There have been a
numnber of very important phascs in the
evolution of railways in this country. The
first phase commcnced with the launching
of the great Canadian Pacific Railway venture back in the penultimate decade of the
last century; the second was the duplication
of that venture by a similar oe, in two parts,
in the early years of the present century;
and the third phase, a less happy one, was
the failure or collapse of some of our railway
systems and the consolidation of those collapsed portions in the Canadian National
Railways.
At the close of this third phase, we found
ourselves with twe great systems of railways,
eýach managed as a separate business entity,
the oe system ýowned hy the State and the
other by the saine private -body that owned
it at its inception. The plan inaugurated at
the beginning of this phase has had a fair
trial extending over many years, and as a
resuît of encountering the very drastic depression through which the world has passed
in the last three years, it bas now reached a
stage where we must attempt a fourth maj or
move and possibly initiate a fourth great
phase in our railway development. This Bill,
therefore, as it affects the pe ople of our
conuntry, assumes a very considerable im-

port ance. As we ail know, a Commission was
appointed by thec prcsent administration,
soniewxat, ox er a ycar ago, to inquire into
the position into whichi our railwa3 s have
drifted during fthe past tel years, and to
make recommendations f owards an alleviation
cf the dificuities caused thex'eby. I do not
intend to utilize this occasion f0 offer any
lamentation over what I regard, andi what I
sought to describe in v ery moderate language
at a prex ious sitting, as the misfortunes of
these last few years. Sufice to say that tbey
are depicted in the pages of the Commision s
report.

a report was made, we cow have the benefit
of the judgment cf men of eminence in varinus
spheres, including railways, nt oniy in our
own country, but aiso in the ftvo principal
industrial countries of the world.
The report of the Commission, which is unanimous, bas now been in the banda of honourxable members for some days. The Bill now
presented is, 1 think I can say, the statutory
embodiment of tbe report in toto, sat e for
oniy one featxire, tvhich is not of major conOne of the recommendations of

board of directors there shouid bie a board of

Parl-iament should appoint auditors froin year

Consethe Govcrnment obviously wrong.
quently, in that respect, and in that respect
alone, the recommendation of the Commission
is flot irnplemenfed in the Bill, and Parliament in appointing the auditors is enfirely
unhampered by any circumiscription cf the
trustees.
Permit me tc say a wcrd as to the spirit in
which. this Bill is presented. 1 have already
said that it is the translation into statut ory

wa.nt it very clearly understood by honourable
members that the Government is net absolutely wedded te any particular clause cf this

measure. 1 is the cIesire of the Goverument

with thorough consideration, and just as full-,
as in the considered judgment cf bof h Houses
of Parliament is practicable. The Coveroment
has ne objeet cf its own te serve b', anN
v ariaition. It is true that aIl buis retl
to Parliament-Government measures a-S wr11
as others- are subject te amendment: but in
this case to an even greafrr degree than usual
it is rlesired that amiendmects shouid be freelv'
offered and suggestions openiy marie. and that
the representatives of the people shoxmld have
the utmost liberty cf discussion. M'hile th.
cf course, is a Gcvernment Bill, and will be
a Gocternment measuro as it emerges. iti
the earnest desire cf the admninistration tlh't
miemibers on bofh sides cf both Houses shomuld

we are certainly free te rejeet; what botb
Housesý cf Parliarnent believ e te, be improe ment we arc equaliy free te aceept.
The Bill, as the recommiendation of 11u,
Commission, is before us with this intrcrlucfien, and I kccw I spcak fer the chiairmain
and members cf the Raiiw'ay Commnittee of
this House when I say that tve infenci to

every phase, temperately, fully, fairiv, and

which recorcmendations have licen liet ec u>

It is a brief Bill. Lt covers cclv about
eight pages. I think ýthat as a, piece of draftmr.nship it is well done. I had nothiing te rie
witi the draf.t,.smanhip, se, perhaps it is suiprising that I consider it righit. That I have
enthusiasmn fer ahl ifs clauses it would cf courýe
be foehish tc, profess, but I do think tliat
the central purpese and spirit cf the measurc
is fuindamentaliy sound, and that if has beru
rendered casent ial by the position te which
things have come, and by the speciai circumsfances whîch at this time surreuind al
gcvernmects and impede the services they
wculd like te tender te their peeple. Thoc
circumstances are perhaps especially embarrassing in eur case because cf that preuliar
position at which our railway eveluf ion lias
arrived, a position more advanced, but one
inveiving more difficulties, than the raiiway
situation cf any other country.
If this Bull passes we shail stili hav e two
great systems, integral, separate, eacli coinpiete in itseif. There wiil bc no amalgamation. There will stili be competitien in

OCTOBER 27, 1932
service, and that is iii effect ail the campetitien we have had for many years, and al
that we can have, in the field of public
utilities. But there will be a certain mneasure
of unification, which is rendered necessary
if any objective is to be attained in the way
of prevention of that tremendously expensive
competition, especialiy in capital outlay, tbat
the last few years have witnessed.
The Bill provides, first oi al, that in arder
ta attain certain specified ends, more or less
generally described, the two roads shail cooperate by means of meetings of their representatives; that it shall be the duty of those
in charge of bath systems to attain those
ends; that in the event of the representatives
of the two systems failing to agree among
themselves as to the attainreent of any
specific object, eitber road may apply to the
Chief RaiIway Commissioner of Canada for
the establishment of a tribunal, of which bie
shaîl ha the head, and to wbich each of the
railways may appoint a representative, this
ta be an arbitral tribunal to determine how
the abject sought to bie attained by the
complaining road shal lie attained, and to
campai both systems ta abida by its judgment. In cases wbara either road tbinks
the matter is ai such major consequence
as to requira a larger tribunal, application
may be made ta the Presidant ai the
Exebequer Caurt for the appointment of two
more niembars, and in such cases an arbitral
tribunal of five, instaad af three, will exercise the powers repased in it by this Act.
The basic change, prabably cansidered by the
Commission ta ba its vital recommendation,
is this: Provision is ma~de for the appointnient, not af a board of direcbors, but of a
board ai trustees consisting of thrae mcmbers, the chairman ta ba appointed for
seven years and the othar two for varying
periods, their ternis expiring at different dates,
sa that a raappaintmant shall be nacassary
avery two or thrae years. Thesa shahl be removable on address oi bath Huses, but the
whola purposa and genius of the measura is
that thay shaîl lie free, not only fromt Parliament but iromn the Government, in the discharge of the onarous duties and respansibilities of their high affice.
The chairman ai the board of trustees is
given extraordinary pDwerê. No decision of
that baard is final unlesa hie coneurs in it.
And that board, necessarily wîth the concurrance al the chairman, appoints a general maniager with the tîtular rank Of president, whase
funotion it shaîl be ta supervise the actual
operatians of the system. The systece, by the
way, ineludes ailiad enterprises as defined by
the measure. This general manager is ta lie

given by the board oi trustees pawars, variable
fromn tima ta time, as set out by by-law or by
resolution; 'but in the discbarge of his dutias,
aven in the day ta day management ai the
road, hie is compellcd ta consuit with the board
ai trustees, and especialiy with the chairman,
whase ultimate suzeraînty over the whole systerr and over the general manager's judgment
is campleta and unhamperad during bis tenura
ai office.
Such is in essence the Cammission's recommendatian ta bath Hanses ai Parliament.
Therefore sucli in essence is this Bill. In that
spirit I present it ta yau.
Befare I sit down I should like ta say samething further, and I tbink it is due ta the
Minister ai Railways that it should be said.
I know that during the bey-day ai prasperity
ail managements were prane ta aptimism,
that many ai them indulged it ta a degree
that we now cail extravagance, and that the
Canadian National Railways management was
not alone in that feeling or in that practice;
but. 1 do think that the extent ta which it
indulgad the practiee-whatevar the feeling
was--is certainly nat exaggeratad or averpainted in the repart ai the Commissian.
Since the present Minister toak charge hae has
sougbt, within the circumierence ai the contrai that is reposed in the Governmant under
the original Act, ta bring about economies.
1 do not daubt that sucli an attampt wouid
bave bean made under any gavernment; I
shauid have haped it wouid ba made espaciaiiy
during these times. But lie lies succeeded in
vary substantially reducing the burdan, and
if this Bill meets with the pleasure af bath
Hausas it sbauld bie remembered that all ai
what may appear ta lie accomplished under
the naw régime cannot be attributed ta that
new régime. Figures presented ta me show
thaýt something approximating $10,000,000 per
year is naw being savad in the expenses ai
aperation. Applied ta tha soale ai operations
in effeet, say, in 1928, this waoild have amaunited
ta $19,000,000. On the present scale of operatiens, the ainount oi business being little
mare than half, necessarily the reduction in
expense6 is net so large. In the year juet
claseil we have suffèecd a reduotian in revenue,
if my memory is riglit, ai approximately
$24 000,000. It is customa-ry, ai course, in al
syltms, whether raiIway, industrial or cainmuercis1, rto have this scaiing down of operations accompanied by a scaling clown af
expenses; but it is rarely possible te have
thle anc balance the other, and if a rad-uction
is macle in expenses oi operation equivalent
to sixty or seventy per cent ai total incarne
reduction, it is considered a very creditahle

OCTOBER 27, 1932
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I arn in the
hands of the flouse. I try as best I can-the
task is often nlot easy-to meet the desires of
honourabie members on 'both sides with respect
to adjournments and to utilizing our time to
the utmost. Certainiy any honourable member may insist on the letter of the rule if he
wishes to do so; it is his respcnsibility. I
wouid simpiy point out that I have neyer
heard the word "railroading" applied to the
progress of a measure after a presentation
such as I have made to-night. We are in o
hurry whatever. We have now introduced the
Bill, we can start debate on the seccnd reading to-.morrow, and that debate can continue
without any prodding, or any requcst by us
for expedition. Every honourable member
will have the right under the ruies to talk as
long and as often as lie likes. We wiil not
ask for second reading until every.body is
through. Pro'babiy it would meet the consensus of the wishes of honourable members to
proceed on that understanding; but if honourable members are prepared to take the responsibility of postponing- until Saturday, or
some time next week, the motion for the
second reading, I arn not the one to oppose
sucli action.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I want to read the
Biii. It has not been distributed.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: A Bill is
neyer distrjbuted 'before its introduction. The
Bill is printed, and I 'believe the French translation is compieted. Undoubtedly copies wiii
be before us in the morning.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: But the Bill has
not been distributed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: A Bill neyer
is distributed on its introduction. We are
only introdueing the Bill.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Would it not be
well to postpone it until to-morrow?
Right Hon. Mr. METOHEN: Yes, I arn
quite ready.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: lis Honour the
Speaker put the motion for second reading.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not wish
that.
Right Hlon. Mr. GRAHAM: Wc shouid
have a better understanding before we go
any further. When wili this Bill be read a
second time? The right honourable leader of
the House has stated that he will make the
motion for the second reading, but 'that
motion wiil be interpreted to mean that the
discussion will lie proceeded with to-morrow
and be carried on into next week.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: I made it
very clear because 1 had arranged with the
right honourable member beforehand that the
discussion wouid bie carried on. We wiil flot
ask for a decision to-morrow, and I undertake
now that we wiil net ask for it whule any
honourabie member wishes to speak.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Could not the riglit
honourable gentleman move suspension of the
rule?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I arn not
moving the second reading.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I arn satisfied with
the riglit honourabie gentleman's explanation.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The Bill has
been read a first time.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHIEN: That is ail
I wish.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shahl it be
read a second time?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: To-morrow.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: With the icave

the Government whether any representations
have been or will be made to the British
Government suggesting such a change in those
ustoms regulations as would tend to direct
Sanadian traffic through Canadian channels

the application to Canadian goods shipped
to Great Britain under the preferential tariff,
of the same principle that now applies under
flie preference to British goods shipped from
Great Britain to Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I received

would be less delay in giving a statement. While I have some knowledge of this
subject and have myself had representations
thereon, I am sure I could not at the moment
give the complete and informative answer to

Therefore it would be better nýot to attempt
to deal with the question now. I shall be
able to give a reply at the next sitting.
DISTURBANCE AT PORTSMOUTH
PENITENTIARY
Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. LEWIS:
Honourable members,
before the Orders of the Day are called I
sbould like to draw the attention of the
Government to the situation at Portsmouth
Penitentiary. I understand that an inquiry
is now going on as to the direct causes of
the recent rising, but articles have appeared
in the newspapers alleging overcrowding,
dirty and unsanitary conditions, and cruel and
unusual punishments, which would seem to
indicate the necessity of an inquiry that
would go farther back. I do not, of course,
ask the Government to accept these stories
as absolutely truc, but I think it would be
wise not to disregard them. My suggestion
would be that the Government should undertake a full inquiry into the situation, and
possibly into conditions in all the penal institutions in Canada.
I know that anyone who proposes an
inquiry of this kind is subject to the reproach
that he is sentimental and wishes to see
prisoners coddled. I have no objection to
the strictest possible discipline in the administration of a penitentiary, but I do believe
that it should be directed towards reform as
well as punishment, and that the Government and the penal authorities should enH-on. W. E. FOSTER.

deavour to make men better instead of worse
when they leave the jail. In all these institutions, I may say, without going into the
detail of these charges, there is a tendency
to run into ruts and to carry on in an oldfashioned way, and I think an occasional
shaking-up is a good thing.
The present
Ontario Government felt that to be truc, and
appointed a commission, of which Dr. Ross
of this city was head, to make an inquiry
into all the charitable, corrective and philanthropic institutions of Ontario. That commission found many things to be remedied,
and the Government has appointed a Minister of Publie Welfare to attend to some of
those institutions, in addition to the Provincial Secretary, who has the principal jails
under his charge. I do not know that it
might not be well for our Government to
hand over the administration of penal institutions to a minister who has perhaps
fewer duties to attend to than bas the Minister of Justice. At all events, I call the
attention of the Government to this matter,
and urge it very seriously to consider the
appointment of a commission or the adoption
of some other method of inquiry.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am not
very clear as to the honourable member's
inquiry, or, indeed, as to the final effect of
his expression of views. If I understood himi
correctly, he expressed at the first the opinion
that there should be a public investigation
of the causes and merits or demerits of the
recent riots.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: That is going on now.
I meant that there should be something
going farther back.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is not
going on now. But I should like to ask
the honourable member whether, upon his
responsibility as a member of this House,
he would express the opinion that there
should be a public investigation into the
merits of the riots, as between the rioters
and the authorities.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: I was not tbinking of
that especially. I thought such an inquiry
was being carried on. At al events, I wanted
the inquiry to go farther than that. What
bas been stated indicates to me that there is
something wrong with the institution, possibly
not through any fault of the authorities, but
because this institution, like many others, has
got into a rut and needs to be investigated
and shaken up, possibly with a view to the
adoption of new methods.

OCTOBER 28, 1932
Right Hon. Mr. MLEIOHEN: 1 arn glad
the honourable gentleman has not taken the
responsibility.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: I was not shirking the
responsibility at ail. I do flot object to that
sort of inquiry.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is an
investigation going on as to the cause, in al
its phases, of the riots. The investigation is
being conducted according to the long-standing custom obtaining among the authorities
in our penal institutions. A public inquiry,
with those charged with riotîng on one side
and the authorities on the other, is not
tiking place. That such an inquiry is in
progress has been denied by the Minister of
Justice, and I should hope that none of those
who are seized of their responsibility as
guardians of law and order in Canada would
urge anything of that nature on the basis of
our present knowledge of these riots. In
times like these, with difficulties existdng such
as ]have neyer before been experienced in the
saine intensity, when the foundations of law
and order are certainly under challenge, it
surely behooves all who appreciate the situation to stand loyally by those who are
endeavouring f0 do their duty under the law.
It is ail very well to entertain a sentimental
sympathy for law-breakers while they are
undergoing punishment, or hefore, but there is
something tremendous at stake, and it is of
vital, paramount and eternal consequence that
authority be vindicated.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: Whetber riglit or wrong?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Authority
based on Iaw is right. If the law is wrong,
we are the ones responsible for it, and should
change it. The habit of fleeing at once to
the side of the law-breaker and endeavouring
fo raise sentiment against authority is, to My
mmid, altogether too prevalent, and at a time
like this exceedingly dangerous. I do not
fhink anything wili be Tevealed that will
indicate any necessity for wh'at is called a
public inquiry. Il hope the regular, routine
inquiry will prove sufficient. Certainly the
public will be entitled to the resuits of that
inquiry.
But the honourable memher (Hon. Mr.
Lewis) goes further. He thinks that our
penal institutions have got into a rut. I know
of no evidence to that effect. AIl that the evidence bas shown, so far as I can see, is that
authority in thse Portsmouth Penitentiary has
proved insufficient. That is ail we know at
present. When evidence is adduced to show
that we are conductîng our penal institutions
a long improper lines, then will be time enougli

71

to consider some liberal and enlighfened way
of bringing about reform. The mere fact of
a riot indicates no such thing, thougli it does
indicate, perhaps, an inefficiency or insufficiency on the part of those entrusted with the
maintenance of law and order. Our penitentiaries take care, flot of minor offenders, but
of those who are usually called major offenders--those wlscse cri-mes are deemed of sueli
a character that the punishment must extend beyond two years. Consequently, in
those institutions the sphere of authority and
flic necessity of punishment are greafer than
in the provincial institutions, where the
function of reform is naturally wider in scope
and of greater consequence. If there are those
who hold the view that the principles on
which our penal institutions are governed are
wrong, and they can produce evidence on the
subi oct, they are at liberty to move in either
House of Parliament for a change of those
principles. But the more fact that rioting
bas occurred at Kingston does not contribute
in the least to show that the principles are
wrong. It only shows, as I have already
stated, that authority bas been either inefficient or insufficient.
One statement made by the honourable
member is quite correct: there lias been overcrowding in tie Portsmouth Penitentiary.
Tiat is due to the simple fact that tie inmates are outgrowing thec boundaries of our
institutions. I understand that it would have
been better f0 extend the eapacity of Portsmouth. Better oare could then have been
given, greater precaution could have been
taken. But it seemed f0 serve the interests
of economy not f0 enlarge tic capacity af
the present fime. Consequenfly many inmates
were takzen care of there, not in individual
colis, but togetier in corridors, and possibly
thaf situation bas contribufed to the outbreak
against autiority. It may he tiat wrong
judgment was shown in nof spending more
money, even in these fimes. Tic incroase
in the number of inmates is largely caused
by fie femper that prevails, a temper f0
which we ccrtainly should not contribute.
The capacity of the institution is overtaxed,
but the reason is simply fiat economy bas
been exeroised, wiscly or unwisely.

that those lnes, are important feeders to the
parent systems in Canada. Watch our eastýbound freight trains and you wili sec that the

are not in a good position to judýge cf the
difficuities of operating railway limes in a country where the railway laws are altogether
different from our Railway Act. We may say
they sbouid not have donc this or that in connection with these lines. But what authority
have we to take that stand? Both the Canadian National and the Canadian Pacifie were
compelicd to carry icut 'betterments and improvements required by the laws of the states
served by their lines.
The various lines now ccmposing the Canadian National Railway Sy.stemn were taken
over, and, as 1 have said bcfore, 1 do mot tbink
any person can contradict my statement that
aithough millions of dollars had already been
spent on these railways, *mnany millions mcre
had to b2 spent ta put into good working order
what my rigbt honourable friend term.Ls "this
hctorogcneous mass."
When I succceded Mr. Kennedy as Minister
of Railways we started to operate the systemn
under a statute. Up to this time the Grand
Trunk and the Canadian Northern had 'been
operated by two separate 'boards of directors
appointcd by the Government.
Sir Josephi
Fiavelle was chairman of the Grand Trunk
Board, and Mr. D. B. Ilanna of the Canadian Northern. Lt was impossible to do amything else at the time, and I arn not criticizing that rnethod of c.peratiom, for the amalgamation and co-ordination of these two systems
were mot atail an easy task. Many things had
to lie donc, and, as wiii be readily understood,
the trust companies bciding the securities of
the varjous companies forming the two systems
-there were more than a hundred such companies--had something to say about everything
that was donc. 1 ar net absoiuteiy sure that
some cf tbose limes are mot stili tecbmically
outside the C.N.R. System.
But to rny mind the greatest task of ahl was
to amalgamate the Grand Trunk and the
Camadian Nortbern staffs.
Mr. Kemnedy's
policy to appoint as president of the Canadian National Railways one who had bcd
mo cQnnectiom with cither the Grand Trunk
or the Camadian Northern was based on his
judgrnent as a business man that if the
appointee were taken fromn either compamy
be wouid have a still more difficult teck
ta accornplish in co-ordinating the two
systems, and probably would flot suoceeýd. Mr.

73

Kennedy endeavoured to get several gentlemen to acccpt tbe
appointment, but without success.
Finaily Sir Henry Tborntom
accepted the position.
Objection bas been raised to the size of
the directorate of tbe Canadian National
Systern. Now, the size of the directorate is due
to the fact that public opinion, through its
representatives in Parlicanent, insisted that
there shouid be a d-irector from each province.
1 do mot say that this plan worked out so
successfuiiy as had be-en ex'pected by those
W~ho favoured it.
If it d'îd not, the
simple reason was that some of tbe directors who lived a long distance fromi Montreai attended tbe board meetings only
occasionaliy. Therefore, altbough tbe succeeding Goveroment did foilow this plan, I arn
not at ail averse to having a smailer board.
I wiii not commit myseif yet witb respect to
the proposed appointrnent of tbree trustees
to manage the system, for there may be corne
objections to the proposai, and I shail weit
for the cornrittce stage before discussing it.
But, as I have said, it was the opinion of
the public that eech province shouid have a
representetive on tbe board of directors.
Labour aiso wantcd a representative, and as
far as possible these views were considered in
the making of the appointments. I recognize
that there arc objections to so large a board,
and, I repeat, I arn not averse to reducing its
membersbip.
Now let me point out some of the difficuities in the way, and sorne of the reasons
for the actî ns, of tbe executives of these
railways, for, after eh, our railways are in
the same Position as neariy every othcr railway in the world. The report refers Vo hoteis,
and infercntially, I think, disapproves of the
raiiways conducting- a hotel business. There
are reasons, howevcr, wby tbey have buiit
boteis. Whether in the light of the depression
you Vhink thorn sufficient or not, tbey were
under normai conditions tbought to be good
reasouIs. The~ Canadian Pacifie followe~d thec
example of many of the iargest railwvays in
Europe in erectiing and conducting boteis in
connection witb its raiiwny. This may have
been overdone. But let me point out the
advantagc of hotels to the raiiways. They
were constructed, I believe, not witb the intentiýon of rnaking a direct iprofit, 'but for amothýer
purpose aitogether. I take the C.P.R. because
it bas the greater mumber of boteis. That
company, witb its steemship limes, can book a
passenger from Liverpool to Hong Kong, and
that-passenger meed neyer be out of the care
of C.P.R. officiais from the time of bis departurc until he reaches bis destination. As a

SENATE
consequence the railway secures a traffic that
companies which cannot make similar arrangements do not get, and thereby does a business
that it would not do but for the fact that it
is able to take care of the traffic from the point
of its origin to its destination. I know of no
railway system in the United States that cen
do that kind of business.
In discussing these railway expenditures we
must remember that our railroads have to
:ompete with United States rail'hoads for eastand-west traffie, and that if 'they do not keep
abreast of the United States railways in the
way of providing accommodation they will
not get the traffic. If you board a C.P.R.
train or a Canadian National train travelling
east or west, and go into the smoking room,
you will find that half the passengers are from
tlie United States. There would be a serious
loss to the Canadian railways, therefore, if
they were to fail to provide transportation of
a quality that enabled them to pick up this
irafic. The same argument applies to traffie
between Europe and the United States. A
great many Americans travel by Canadian
Ines from Europe to Canada, and thence to
the United States; or from the United States
to Canada, and thence to Europe. These are
good and sufficient reasons why, in normal
times, the Canadian railways should endeavour to look after their own traffic. They
haive to compete with lines in a country that
lias at least double the density of population
tliat we have in Canada. This is no easy
task, and any let-down in the standard of
setvice would be a mistake.
Take the iotel at St. Andrews-by-the-Sea.
That hotel bas a golf course. Hotels that intend to cater to tourist traffic liad better not
start unless they are going to provide a gcIf
course. 1 know that if my right honourable
friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) and I were
to arrive at any of these places to-morrow, the
porter would have to lug in our gIlf clubs
with our other baggage. St. Andrews-by-theSea is one of the best advertisements the

times a good business is donc as a result of it.
It is not the business done by the hotel itself
that counts; but if it were not for the hotel
the railway would not get the traffic that
comes to it because of the hotel. I am speaking of the building of hotels by the railwayssomething that seems to be rather outside their
sphere if we do not give the matter due consideration.
The Canadian Naticnal Railways also have
hotels. It must be reumembered, however, that
the Canadian National did not build them
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

all; some of them were legacies from other
companies that were taken over. As a matter
of history and experience I can tell you that
for at least two years I was almost afraid to
go to Toronto, because some of the men who
are now abusing the executives of the railways
for hotel building chased me from hotel to
hotel to insist that I should have the Canadian
National build a hotel in Toronto. To my
mind that would have been nothing but foolishness. Toronto now has more hotel accommodation than it cen use. The pressure on the
railways to build hotels here and there was
great. They wanted to be in a position, at
least so far as Canada was concerned, to take
care of traffic from the time it started till it
reached its destination.
Now let me refer to one or two instances
in which criticism was directed at the Canadian
National Railways for building hotels. One
was the building of a hotel in Prince Edward
Island. It is not a gorgeous affair-I saw it
whien it was under construction--but I believe
it is a nice, comfortable hotel. Prince Edward
Island is one of the micat picturesque and lovely
spots in Canada, and if the people of this part
of Canada only knew what it is like they
would go there in grea.tor numbers. It is only
of recent years that tourist traffic bas been
encouraged to go to Prince Edward Island.
The people there had the idea that automobiles should not run vey frequently, and no
man will go far from home nowadays, or stay for
any length of time, unless ha has an automobile. In addition to the expenditure on the
liotel, a large amount of money was spent in
widening the gauge cf the Prince Edward
Island Railway so that the agriculturists of
that province could ship their products to other
parts of Canada without broaking bulk. Furthermore, the Covernment that succeeded the
Government of which I was a member built
an up-to-date ferry so that railway cars of
standard gauge, and carrying either produce or
passengers, could be ferried to or from Prince
Edward Island. These things all cost money.
After the widening of the railway gauge in
Prince Edward Island it was contended by the
Prince Edward Islanders that if the railway
company wanted to bring traffic there, a hotel
should be built, and that if the railway company would not build it no rne could. It remains to be seen whether or not that botel will
pay its way.
Such are the reasons that induced the railways to follow the course adopted by the
up-to-date railways of Europe.
Another project very severely criticized was
the Vancouver hotel.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Thiat is right.

OCTOBER 28, 1932
tian as nearly every other railway in the
world, only many of its difficulties are brought
more prominently before the public because
Parliament has ta deal with them. ,I have
faith in the future of Canada. We shall have
normal conditions again. I do flot know
whether legislation will bring them about,
and I will not interjeet a suggestion of
something that I think would help, for it
might be considercd cantraversial and not
connected with the railway problem. I have
a strong faith that this country will prosper
again if we carry ourselves scdately and get
rid of the war mind that we have had for
so many years--that is, the attitude that if
an expenditure is thought necessary we should
get the maney, no ma tter where it cornes
from-and substitute for it a mind economieally attuned as a resuit of the experience
through whi*ch we are now passing. If we can
make such a substitution the experience will
not be without its beneficial effeet. We have
the resources in Canada and I think we
have the men ta deal with the existing
problems. I believe that my good friend
Hungerford is a splendid man for the position of head of the Canadian National Railways.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Hie is honesty
personificd, there is no question about that.
How he succeeds will depend, of course,
upon how he is supported, and that is anc
reason why I arn afraid of giving toa much
power ta any board of trustees.
I have faith in the Canadian Pacifie Railway, as a resuit of my faith in the country.
It is a splendidly managed road. While I
was Minister of Railways I had no financial
interest in it, but it may not be cansidered
too personal a reference if I say that only
a few months ago I bought a small lot of
C.P.R. stock with the sale abject of daing my
duty-for I do nat expeet any profits for
some time-and of showing with my money
that I had confidence in the future success
of the road. If we steer aur course wisely
and judiciausly, nat extravagantly, until
normal times came ta us, aur twa railway
systems will undaubtedly be restored ta a
prasperaus condition.
Our railway situation is not, ta my mind,
a pessimistie one, and we should not broadcast too muých pessimism about it. I behieve
in maintaining twa distinct lines of raihway.
The people of Canada would not stand for
any monopoly. I h-ope hanourable members
from. the Maritime Provinces wihl excuse me
for saying <that as Minister of RaiIways I
tried ta look after the ald Intercolonial, which

77

rcahly had ta a large extent a monopoly in
the Maritimes, and I came ta feel that a
government monopohy had not a bigger heart
than any private manopoly. One of the most
frequent camplaints had from the Maritimes
was this: "If we couhd get the Canadian
Pacifie ta corne inta aur territory thcre would
be competition and we shouhd get betîter
service; the Intecaloniah will nat give us
good service, 'because there is no competition."
I arn of the firm -opinion that a government
monopohy would he little, if any, better than
a privaýte monopoly. Under normal conditions, which we hope wilh soon return, there
is room in this country for bath railways if
they are conducted in an economical manner.
They can provide as efficient passenger and
freight service as is obtainable anywhere in
the world, and aur people will not accept
anything less
Now I want ta make some reference ta
the highways. [t is embarrassing sametimes
ta be so ohd that you have bcen connected
with ah'most every matter that has been a
public issue over a long periad of time. 1 was
a member of the Legishature of Ontario when
the first grant was made for the improvement
of highways in thet province. A million
dollars was voted, I think, as a start. 1 spoke
often and as foreibhy as I couhd af the
necessity for gaod highways between the producer and bis market, or point of shîpment.
It seemed ta me that these werc almost as
eszenitial as gaod ra'ilway facilities. But under
present conditions the carrying af freight by
trucks has undoubtedly brought about a reduction of income for the railways. My own
opinion naw is that perhaps it would have
been better if the railways had endeavoured
ta get contral of the highway traffie years ago.
Had any actual attempt been made-towards
that end, however, the railways might have
been charged wâth induhging in further extravagance. Neverntheless such a mave was
suggested, and if it had been fohhowed the
presen>t situation would pcrhaps have been
better than it is. The passenger bus is nat
s0 great a menace ta the railway hines as
is the freight carrying truck.
We could not do away with the systcm
of transportation by trucks even if we wanted
ta, for the simple reason that the peophe
have become accustomed ta it. If you want
ta send goods from. Ottawa ta Toronto, say,
a truck will back up ta your door, and will
deliver the parcel ta its destination. There is
no extra cartage charge at either end. But,
as the repart suggests, something might be
done with the co-operation of the provinces,
which. own the highways, ta bring this forma
of transportation under the jurisdietion of

SENATE
some authority that would establish rates not
ruinous to the railways, and would require
the trucks to operate under certain conditions
similar to those under which the railways
operate. This plan is in operation in some
of the provinces. If thait suggestion were
carried out, perhaps there would not be so
many trucks on the road, for the restrictions
might prove too onerous for some of them.
At the present time they are under no restrietions at all. A truck can take a parcel
from me and deliver it at a certain place for
a dollar, and give the same service to someone else for fifty cents. That would b
nobody else's business, but of course it is
demoralizing to the railways, which have to
operate upon schedules and under conditions
imposed by the Board of Railway Commissioners.
Before closing I want to emphasize two
things. First, that this is a serious situation
and that we ought te approach it seriously.
I think we shall. Perhaps I should not say
this, but it seems to me that in this House,
where we have business men who do not have
to listen to sectional cries, we are in a botter
position than the members in another placewhere even the electors' whims, be they right
or wrong, have to be considered-to deal with
this Bill thoughtfully and carefully. I believe
that the members of the Railway Committee
of this House can be depended upon to do
that, and as one member of that committee I
can say that I will do so.
Secondly, if the provision for the board of
trustees remains in the Bill, I hope the board,
in its endeavour to demonstrate its efficiency,
will not try to sweep too cleanly and thereby
engender fear of dismissal among the cmployees. I hope that every possible step will
be taken to re-establish normal conditions, so
that when a man leaves 'his family in the
morning te go to work he will feel confident
that se long as he performs his duty faithfully
his dinner pail will be full every day.

ADMINISTRATION OF PENITENTIARIES
INQUIRY

AND

DISCUSSION

Hon. JAS. D. TAYLOR rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he will call attention to the nmatter of
the administration of the Ticket of Leave Act
and will inquire whether in the case of one
Bagley, now a fugitive, any, and if so what,
steps were taken to secure his recommittal to
the British Columbia penitentiary while awaiting trial for a new offence calling for the
revocation of his licence.
He said: Honourable members, by the terms
of the notice standing in my name, I have
undertaken to speak of the administration of
the Ticket of Leave Act, as exemplified by
the case indicated, which involves an impropriety so grave as to constitute a public
scandal in the province from which I core.
I desire to avoid dealing now with the more
notorious affair of the hour, under the same
department, namely the attempt at a general
jail delivery at Portsmouth, now the subjeet
of departmental inquiry; but I may properly
refer to the timely suggestion made the other
day by the honouraible senator from Toronto
(Hon. J. Lewis), that perhaps the Department of Justice is not the branch of government best fitted for the administration of the
penitentiaries. I cheerfully adopt that as a
case to be made out from the evidence I have
to offer to-day.
Responsibility for the general administration of the penitentiaries rests with the Minister of Justice; but in the case of the Ticket
of Leave Act it is shared by some other
minister, designated by his colleagues.
Discussion or criticism of the operation of
this Act does not invade or trespass upon
the prerogative of mercy vested in the Crown,
which remains independent of local advice, or
of legislation. The Ticket of Leave Act wvas
passed in Canada about the beginning of this
century, and gave form to a plan whereby,
on the advice of the Minister of Justice, any
person serving in a penitentiary or other
public prison might receive gracious licence
from His Excellency the Governor General
to be at large in Canada during the remainder
of the period covered by his sentence. The
licences were to be conditional on good
behaviour, and contemplated that the holders
should resume their places as useful citizens
of the comrnunities from which they had been
withdrawn.
The duty of advising the Governor General
upon all matters regarding the administration
of the Act was assigned to the Minister of
Justice or such other member of the Gov-

NOVEMBER 3, 1932
erilment as might be designated by the
Governor in Council. The reason for this
provision, as stated at the time it was made,
was that the applications bad become so
numerous as to be beyond the capacity of
any single mînister to consider. Speaking
from memory, I thinj< the number even
then was said to be soxnetbing like four
thousand a year. Since that time the number
bas steadily grown.
It is admitted now to be part of tbe understanding in our penitentiaries tbat every convict, unless he be confined for a crime of
violence, or under special circumstances of
that nature, bas virtualIly the right to appdly, and
is expected to apply, for a ticket of leave when
he bas served about one-half of bis normal
sentence. It seems unnecessary to suggest to
Parliament tbat tbere is no authority whatever in law f or tbis understanding or practice on the part of the department and the
penitentiaries alike. As a resuit of this very
free interpretation of the Act, nlot only bas
tbere been a demand for tickets of leave from
ail tbe prisoners entitled to tbem, but the
granting of these tickets bas been extended
to prisoners to whom. even the Governor
General bas no rigbt, under the Act, to issue
them. The Act restriets him to the issuing
of licences tbat require tbe holders to live
somewbe-e in Canada. 1 bave the Act in
my band, but 1 will not bother reading the
terras in detail. I bave made a plain statement of one of the terms, and according to
that it is manifestly inîproper and irregular
to request a licence for a person for the purpose Of pasig bila out Of the country, as
press dispatches have told us bas been donc
recently.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Is the country not
well rid of eu-cb persons?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I arn discussing the
law as it now exists, and nlot contingencies.
The country may be well rid of them, but not
under the Ticket of Leave Act. Alilhough we
are assured tbat crimes of violence constitute
a bar to tbe issue of a ticket of leave, there
also have been cases where persons confined
for crimes of the utmost violence have been
let out under a ticket of leave. Very violent
crimes have been committed in Ontario by
men who were improperly released under the
Ticket of Leave AWt
1 amn not for tbe
moment interested in~ thexmi, for my chief desire now is to call attený1qIn~ h cs
i
tione4t i my notic~e, tke çase of one Baley.
Begley appearect oue day in a, bwnk a,
Naajo,, accoppnpnied by three or four
despeyaedoes, aUl aried. TIgey lined ap tIie
clerks of the bank in one place and the

79

customers in another, and they bad told off
their forces so tbat new customers who came
in were ordered wbere to go and were kept
under control. Tbe desperadoes kept possession of the bank for ten or lfifteen minutes.
They could not get into the vault, because
the manager, who AIone knew the combination,
was out. They waited for bis return so long
as they thouglit it was safe 'to do so, and
then they took aiýl the cash that was available
in the teller's cage-I suppose that was aIl tbey
could get tbeir bands on-and went away.
Tbey were caught and tried, and Bagley was
sentenced to ten years in the penitentiary.
ln the course of time, 1 suppose about five
years later, this desperado was released on a
ticket of leave. How he got it I do flot know.
nor do I know bow to find out. We are told
that the law prevents the Department of
Justice fromn givîng any information as to
tickets of leave, but tbere is no sucb provision
in tbe law. The Act distinctly recites that
information, as to conditions upon whicb
tickets of leave are iasued is to be given to
Parliament.
About four or five montbs af-ter bis release
Bagley and three or four other desperadoes, alI
armed, robbed tbe Harrison Rot Springs Hotel,
a resort in British Columbia about sixty miles
from Vancouver. They tied up the manager
and the niglit watchman, blew open tbe saf e
and leisurely took alI its contents. Then they
drove off in a car, and on tbeir way tbey
dynamitEd two bridges so that tbeir pursuers
would be delayed. Tbe dcsperadoes made
their entry into the UJnited States and were
caught by American officers, whose lives they
attempted to take, but without success.
Bagley was turned over to Canadian officers
who went for bim, but these officers apparently
were flot connected with the Department of
Justice, directly or indirectly, and Bagley
was not taken back to the penitentiary, as
be should have been. In tbis respect the
Ticket of Leave Act is quite clear. Having
forfeited his Ipave, lie sbould have heen taken,
witbout intervening proceedings, to tbe penitentiary, confined there, and later conducted
from there to the court for trial; but instead
of bei»g treated i tbis way lie remained
in the possession of the provincial police, in
the Oakalla jail. Froim there he escaped.
Somne fi've or six months later the police
were notified that he was at 'large in a ear in
Vancouver. One officer bravely, but incautiouely, fo4lowed the car, stopped it at a
curb and got Bagley out. Bagley 44d a
machine gun in hài b"jd and fired four bullets
into the .body of tke poUceman. 'Vortunately,
the policeman bas survived. This desperate

SENATE
eriminal made good his escape, but about a
uonth ago was caught in California, armed
nvith a machine gun and accompanied by
several confederates. He was recognized as
the leader of a band of twenty desperadoes
who had conimitted a series of a score or more
crimes in Oregon and California. He pleaded
guilty when arraigned, and bas now been
irntenced to fifeen years in the penitentiary.
J dr-ire to call attention to the hazards
imposed upon the guardians of the law in our
communities by the release from penitentiaries,
on ticket of leave, of prisoners of the Bagley
type, and of other types, which are perhaps
better known in Ontario than they are to me;
ilso bv the whoce;ale jail delivery resulting
rom the granting of a ticket of leave to every
prisoner who lias served one-half of his
sentence. These lapses from the observance
of the Act on the part of the Department
of Justice are serious, net only because they,
or at east some of them, indicate a studied
disregard of the statute, but also because they
have their counterpart in a ýpractice that the
Deairtiment of Justice is continuing. Portsnioth Penitentiary, if I may mention it, will
-eri e as an illitration. Hadl the Minister of
Juisti-c exercised the control given to him by
the Penilenfiary Act, perbaps we should not
have had the recent disorders at that institution, for there would have been on the job
e seasoned wardcn, a tried and trusted deputv
and a cbief keeper, instead of only "acting'o
officers in these most important positions.
I have beard it -aid, or iave read in the
prcss. that the Civil Service Commission is
to blaie for the delay in filling the vacancies,
but as to two of the three positions the considered recommendations of the Commission
had been before the Departimxent of Justice
for months, perhaps for years, and as to the
warden there was surely no necessity to force
his retirement months before a successor
could be appointed.
Examination of the records discloses that
the delay in appointing a warden arose from
a deliberate violation by the department of
the spirit and the letter of the Penitentiary
Act. Section 24 of the Act provides:
Wardens and deputy wardens shall be
appointed for the penitentiaries generally, and
any warden or deputy warden shall exercise

his powers and perfori his duties as such in

and for the particular penitentiary to which

lie is frou time to time assigned by direction
of the Minister.
In this case there was no attempt to appoint
a warden "for the penitentiaries generally."
On the contrary, on February 24, 1932, the
following advertisement was issued:
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR.

Applications are invited from Male Residents
of the Pirovince of Ontario qualified for the
Position of Warden (Grade 2), Portsmouth
Penitentiary-$4,500 per annum. Department
of Justice, Kingston, Ont.
The paragraph dealing with the qualifications required is in these terms:
Education equivalent to higb school graduation and preferably university training; five
years of experience in a suîpervisory capacity
on the staff of a penal institution or prison, or
experience of similar cliaracter and standard;
familiarity
with
criminology
and
prison
probleuis; administrative ability.
While a
definite age limit lias not been fixed for this
comupetition, age mîay be a deternining factor
in muaking a selection.
The provision as to the appointment of
wardens for the penitentiaries generally rather
than to a particular penitentiary bas, I think,
been a dead letter evcr since the last revision
of the Penitentiary Act. When the Bill was
before Parliament a few years ago it contained a provision that no one should be
appointed warden or deputy wirden unles
lie had served five years in the Penitentiary
Service. This House in its wisdom amended
the provision se as to leave these positions
open to the public, on the theory tiat the
tine night arrive when it would be necessary
to inject new blood into the Penitentiary
Senice, and if we made it a statutory provision that no one should be eligible flor
appointment wio had not served five years
in a penal institution we should have pcrhaps
to promte unfit officers and so allow the
service to become stale. But the Department
of Justice never abandoned its practice, and
so worded the qualifications required of applicants as to confine selection to men already
in the Penitentiary Service. The advertisement which I have quoted produced a large
number of applications frocs very worthy
gentlemen, but none of them iad had the
prescribed five years' penitentiary experience.
Thereupon the examining board reported
there were no qualified persons available, and
consequently the Civil Service Commission
could not make an appointment.
The public have been told that the Civil
Service Commision is responsible for the extraordinary delay in filling the vacancy.
No
doubt the Commission can protect itself, but
I have in my possession documentary evidence
showing that last May the Commission advised the Department of Justice of the report
of the examining board. This left it open for
the department, without regard to the Civil
Service Commission, to make the appointment
by way of promotion. But did the department
dd this? It did not, its violation of the Peni-

'way. I arn talking about the generally
accepted condition. If you turm over in your
mind the long list of Ministers of Justice, you
will, I think, agree with me when I say that
by common consent they avoided penitentiary
administration as they would a plague, and
that in this respect we have been without the
ministerial attention to which we are entitled, 1,ecause the responsibility has been
placed in the wrong department. A rnan who
is qualifled to act as Minister of Justice and
who, acting upon his qualifications, deals with
ail the grave questions that corne to him as
chief law officer of the Crown, has very littie
4ime to give to the grievan-ces of prisoners or
to applications for tickets of leave. This
condition reflects upon the minister, but, I
arn very sorry to say, it perhaps reflects also,
and first of all, upon Parliarnent, which imposes upon the minister an impossible task.
Other conditions arise from 'the same cause,
and will be cured, if any cure can be applied,
at the same time. For this reason 1 feel that
I may be excused for spending a few minutes

SENATE

I mention this defect with special confidence
at this time because I have in -my hand a
statement of the right honourable the Prime
Minister, who, on being appealed to in the
House of Commons on a matter of this kind,
made a very distinct pronouncement. He
eaid:
It is the old question that no man can be
dismissed from his enployment by the Crown
without having the opportunity to be heard,
as was held by the Privy Couneil in the Phipps
case. Sonetimes a narrow meaning is placed
upon the expression "removed for cause." It
is believed that this would cover chargcs of
misbehaviour, which of course he would have
an opportimity to meet, and he may be removed
for incapacity. Of course that is almost fundamental; if a man bas bad a mental breakdown
and is no longer able to carry on, it follows
that be should be removed from his position.
The other provisions, inability or failure to
perform his duties properly, come under incapacity; they cover the case if be becones
unfit for the position as it may have expanded,
or perhaps was not fit for it when appointed.
IL is perfectly clear, as I say, that the person
conîcerned niust have an opportunity to be
heard in his own defence, in any case.
In including these cases in my statement
as to the administration of the Ticket of
Leave Act I had in mind that if I were able
to obtain a consideration of the conditions
to which I have referred, some of these unfortunate men might secure money that they
have earned by long years of service.
Under these circumstances w-bat I desire
is that steps be taken to put an end to the
prevailing general jail delivery through abuse
of the Ticket of Leave Act; to cause the law
to prevail-the King's warrant to run-within
the Justice Department as well as within the
valls of our penitentiaries, and to put the
Ticket of Leave Act and the Penitentiary Act
under ministerial control. I suggest that a
committee of this Sonate miglit well bo appointed to ascertain, first, whether or net the
conditions that I have outlined to-day exist;
and, second, what steps should or can be
taken to improve or remove those conditions.
Riglit Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, the subject brought before
us by the honourable senator from New
Westminster (bon. Mr. Taylor) is undoubtedly one of great importance. It attains a
greater importance by being presented by
him; this for the reason that through twentyfive years of public life he has given concentrated attention to penitentiary administration. To-day, however, he deals with net
merely one phase of the administration, but
two. The first centres round the name of
one Bagley, who is referred to in the notice;
the second is of a more general character,
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR.

with particular reference to the conduct of
the Portsmouth Penitentiary, Kingston, and
the recent riots there.
Inasmucli as the
second phase was net included in the notice.
I am net specially prepared to deal with it.
and I hope the bonourable gentleman will
net consider me discourteous if I fail to <le
se.
I have no personal knowledge of the Bagley
case, for I am not a member of the staff
of the Justice Department, but I wish to
make some remarks on that case and also
on my honourable friend's interpretation of
the law. The Ticket of Leave Act lias been
in force for many years. It lias been administered by the Minister of Justice, who
necessarily bas assistants who do the actual
and more or less routine administrative work,
lie being responsible for the decisions. This,
at all events, was the system followed in my
time, and for some four years I was in effect
responsible, although I reported to the Govornor General through the minister of the day.
Apparently the Act lias been clianged so that
the reports to His Excellency the Governor
General may now be made direct from the
Solicitor Ceneral, rather than through the.
mediui
of the Attorney-General, or the
Minister of Justice.
In relation te the Bagley case it is coinplained, first, that the Act was violated by
a ticket of leave being granted, against the
terms of the statute, to a man who had been
convicted of a criminal offence involving
violence.
Secondly, it is complained that
there is in the department the more or le-s
routine practice of granting tickets of leave
to convicts who have served half their time.
Thirdly, it is asserted tîat there is no report
made, even upon inquiry je Parliament, as
to the reasons why tickets of leave liave been
granted; such a report, I understood the
honourable member to say, being called for
by the Act.
I do net think the honourable member is
right in giving to the House the impression
that there is a restriction in the application
of the ticket of leave provisions as among
offenders in our institutions. There is no
reference at all to special treatment for
persons guilty of crimes of violence. The
Ticket of Leave Act, a copy of which I
have just obtained, is absolutely general in
its application: it gives His Excellency power
to grant a licence to any convict as to whoi
lie may be advised by the Minister of Justice-or, now, the Solicitor Genral-that it
is in the interests of justice, of the convict
and of the public generally, to grant such a
licence. A reference to section 3 of the Act
will make this very clear:

NOVEMBER 3, 1932
The Governor General by an order in writing

under the hand and seal of the Secretary of
State may grant te any convitMark you, any convict.
-under sentence of imprisonmient in a penitentiary, gaol or ether public or reformatory
prison, a licence te, be at large in Canada, or
in sucli part thereof as in sucli licence shai
be rncntioned, during such portion of hie term
of irnprisonmient, and upen sudh conditions in

ail respecte as te the Governor General may
seem. fit.
Se the attack on the licence granted te
Bagley fails, in se far

as it resta on the

honeurable gentlemnan's contention.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Wou-Id the righttlhonourable, gentl4eman permit me te interrupt
him? What I said about that was net quite
as quoted. 1 arn famniliar with the Act. 1
said that there had been received from the
Departînent of Justice its interpretation of the
Act and a staternent of its practice, namely,
that the issue of licences is restricted to
persons net guilty of crimes of violence. I
said, not that the Act se providcd, but that
this wvas the practice.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I misundcerstood the honourable mernber, for I theught
bis point was that -the Act forbade the issue
te convicts guilty of crimes of violence. I
arn net aware of any staternent frorn the
Departmcnt of Justice te the cifecet that licences
are net grantcd te offenders of that type. I
ccrtainly knew that there was ne sucli rule
during the tirne I was personally concerned
in the administration of the Act. I doubt not
that in the case of a conviet whoe crime was
one of violence the vcry greatest care would
be taken before a licence would lie issued,
but there was neyer any practice that ferbade
the issue, and I arn certain that licences werc

issued te many prisoners

of the type in

question.

Thc honourabl:e member complains that it
is a mistake te fail te give reasons for the
issue of licences in individual cases, and intimates that the Act caîls for sucl reamons to
be given.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I dislike te interrupt
the rîglit honourable member, but that is net
what I said.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: 1 do not at
aIl object Vo an interruption, for 1 want te
understand the complaint correctly.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: The Act says that
there shail lie presented te Parliament each
year a return showing the conditions attached
te the issue of each licence, with the exception
of any conditions that are the saine as those
containeid in schedule A te the Act.
53721-6à

83

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is the
correction 1 was about to make. The impression 1 got from the honourable member's
address was not the sarne. There is nothing
at ail in the Act that f orbids the departmnent
or the minister to disclose to the public the
reasons for recornmending to His Excellency
that a ticket of leave be granted, but ever
since the Act has been in effect the Department of Justice bas followed the practice of
declining to give those reasons. The general
principles underlying that practice have often
been disclosed, and have been accepted by
Parliarnent as sound. Whenever an attack
lias been made by an Opposition-and I doulit
flot that attacks have been made by memibers
of ail Oppositions-the principles have been
explained. Parliarnent lias supported the ministcr in his explanationýs, and the practice lias
been continued. IL is quite cîcar that if in
these matters the minister made a practice of
disclosing the contents of confidential cointhey are ail necessarily
rnunications-and
confidential-the frcedom of the communications would be impaired, and, as a resuit, it would becorne impossible for the
minister te give to evcry case that intelligent
consideration which must lie given. H1e weuld
not be able to procure information as to the
very matters that affect his decision, if those
persons from whom that information mnust
be obtaincd knew that it would lie on caîl of
any membehr of the~ Senate or House of Coinmens for public disclosure.
I hope I did net misunderstand the hýonourable gentleman's third complaint, and I assure
him that I bave not intentionally misinterpreted him in the -other instances. 11e contends that there should net bic a practice of
granting licences on the expiration of haîf of
the terni of imýprisonmcnt. I would ask lionourable memibers te consider w'hether it is possible te administer this Act witbcut having
some such practice grow up. It may become
customary te grant a licence after a quarter, a
third. a haif or three-quarters of a terni bas
been served, but, wbatever fraction of tbe
terrni may lie decided upon, w&uld it be possible te administer the Act without some such
gencral rule witb respect te flrst effenders and
te those recorrmndcd for parole by tbe
warden and the trial judge? I do net sec
how it would be.
Applications for tickets of leave may coe
from priseners. their relatives, wardens, or
anyonc at ail, and tbey are treated with equal
care, ne matter who sends thern in. In my
time the number of those applications would
average about fourteen or fifteen a day. and
many of tbern would appertain to first

84

SENATE

offenders. Judges and wardens would rccommend parole, and perhaps three-quarters of
the recommendat ions would be virtually alike.
Necessarily, then, the department hias to adopt
seme general plan, frem which of cours.e thcre
'viii be some exceptions because of the particular characteristies of certain cases. And
the custom that has grown up, as noarly as it
-an bc defined, i's this. Where the warden
who has bcen responsible for the c'ire of a
prisoner advises thait parole would ho in the
interests of the public and of the prisoner, and
where parole is alse recommended by the trial
judge, who hiad the prisoner before him and
heard ail thc, evidence, then, in the absence
of special reasons advanced te the contrary,
such as scme particular knowledge brought to
the attention of the minister, parole is usually
granted on the expiration of hiaîf of the
prisonr's stntence, and this wholly irrespeetive
of xvhat the prisoner was before lie xvas convicted.
I do flot believe that under any Government favours were shown te anyone because,
for caýimple, of bis social standing prier te the
timeoef bis conviction. 1 know that wherever
1 hnd occasion te make cbservatien, if the
iprisone*'s social standing ivas uscd as an argument it was very likelv te militate against
him rather than te work in his faveur. To al
wvho have been attacking the administration
of justice on the part cf the minister, alleging
that it is especially favourable te persons gu ilty
of stealing a million, as the saying is, and who
were said te hiave been of high social status
before they entered a penitentiary, 1 would
point eut that such a charge will nct lie in
the case of Bagley, which has 'heon brought
te our notice this afterneon. Bagloy apparent]ywas just an erdinary creok, differing frem
the rot only in that hoe was werse.
As I have said, the Act dees net cail for
the granting of a ticket of leave after any
particular portion of a sentence bas been
sýerved, bu~t how would it be possible te, dispose of thou-ands of applications in a year
without having seine general principle, wbieh
would apply unless there were special causes
te the centrary?
The honourable memher complains that the
department has defied the law in net submitting te both Houses ef Parliament a list
of ail conditions attached te any special
licence; tbat is, ýwbere tbe conditions are
other thon these specified in scbedule A of
the Act. 1 should really ho surprised te find
that that allegation is welýl founded. I know
that since 1 came te tais Huse, at tbe
beginning- of last sesien, 1 have laid on the

bcause I have net taken special pains te inquire, 'but 1 shall inquire and shahl ho very
much surprised if 1 find that the department
bas net cemplied îvith the Act in this respect.
Hon. '-%r. TAYLOR: If I am permitted te
interrupt again, ;I would say that I teck the
pains te, raise that question in the proper
quarters, and I ivas assured that ne sucli return had been made.
Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I rememiber
presonting a return under the Ticket of Leave
Act. but whether it xvas cf the kind requircd
un1(ler the statutory provision te wbich the
hionourable mnember referred I arn net propared te say. Certainly tbis provision should
l)e complied with. But I wvould ask, honeurable members te, note that the provision is
sîînply this: that if te any licence thcre are
<annexed any conditions diffcrent from those
eont:îined in z;chodu]e A of the Act, a list of
ail such conditions shahl ho made and laid
before heth Bouses cf Parliament. If that
wore donc we hould know what special conc
ditions were fittachied te, any licences, but that
is ail the return would tell us. 1 cannet see
any
bee eh eved by this section

lie obeyed . Above ah, statutes3 applicable te

oee of those mon xvbe have net vindicated

makes bais ýcase a striking one is thiat hoe subsequently returned te Canada, committed a
gross and gbastly act of violence, and wbile
un-der arrest for that acet assaulted a police
offleer with rmirdeTous intent. and then escaýped. Ccî'tainly the wisdom. of the granting

NOVEMBER 3,1932
of a licence in this case has not been established by the subsequent conduct of the
prisoner. Now the department has applied
for his extradition to this country. He will,
of course, 'have to serve his time for an offence
that he commibted in the United States. He
still has to serve the remainder of his term in
this country, and, if conviicted on the charge
of the second crime of violence committed in
Canada, he will have to serve such sentence
as is imposed therefor.
I an not saying that mistakes are not made
under the present minister, or that none were
made under any of his predecessors, including
myself, in the exercise of the power to recommend the granting of tickets of leave. If such
a recommendation is to be considered a mistake in every case where the person released
fails to make good, indiotments will have to
be levelled very often. I think that such
failure does not prove that the minister's
judgment was not carefully exercised. It may
have been, nevertheless the subsequent events
may show that it was wrong. Certainly subsequent events proved it wrong in the present
case.
But in proportion to the number released on parole the numiber of those who
show that they merited release is very large
in'deed. I apprehend it would be smaller in
the case of persons guilty of crimes of violence
than in any other singile case.
Now, I do not intend to enter into a discussion of the reflections made by the honourable member with respect to the Portsmouth
Penitentiary. Suffice to say that where wholesale jail deliveries thoroughly and carefully
planned, as appears to have been the case at
Portsmouth, have been put upon the stage
of action in other countries, they have never
to my knowledge been taken care of by the
authorities with quite the same efficiency,
thoroughness and success that were demonstrated at Portsmouth. Not one man escaped
in an attempt on the part of more than four
hundred. And tihis resuit was effected without the death of a single convict, a single
officer of the law, or any other person. There
was slight injury to only one convict. At
least, it does not argue the total demoralization of the authority of law and order in
Canada.

Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: May I ask the

Hon. Mr. Meighen) if he will be good enough to
secure copies of the bluebook published when
the Canadian Northern Acquisition Bill was

that in about a couple of hundred pages were
contained all the details of the transaction,
including full particulars of the liabilities of
the system. When the Bill was before us, and
the late Sir James Lougheed was asked for
information with respect to any feature of the
transaction, he would refer us to the bluebook
at such and such a page for the particulars
desired. I have made very diligent search
for the bluebook in the Distribution Office,
the Library, and the Railway Department,
but I have found it imposible to secure a
copy. If the right honourable gentleman
would get one or two copiesRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Of what?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Copies of the
bluebook distributed to all the members of
the Senate and the House of Commons wher
the Bill was put through for the acquisition
of the Canadian Northern Railway. The
bluebook contained all the details of the
property that the Government was taking
over-every particular was given of all the
lines, their location, liabilities, assets, and so
on. It would be a very useful book to have
before us now, for it would enable us to
bridge the six years between 1917 and 1923.
The Duff report deals particularly with the
development of the Canadian National Railways from 1923 to 1931, and we should like to
see what took place in the preceding six years.

THE PRJCE 0F COAL
Before the, Ordexs of the Day:
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX: I wish te
cail the attention of the right hoïnourab-le
gentleman (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) to a
letter tihat I received yesterday frein the SecreVary of the, Centrai1 Coundil of Municipal
Associations of O}ttawa. It reade as follýows:
Ottawa, Ont., October 29, 1932.
The Honourable Senator Lemieux,
Senate Chamber,
I'ar]iament Buildings,
Ottawa, Ont.
Dear Sir:
The f ollowing reselution was passed at our
regular meeting and I was instructed te forward
sanie to you:
Whereas frein diligent inquiries made by your
Execîîtive Comimittee regarding the price of
Welsh coal laid down in Montreal aud the
price of same delivered to the Canadian consumner, ýve are of the opinion that the spread
is ont of ail proportion Vo what a reasonable
charge should be;
Therefore be it resolved that this Central
Couneil of Municipal Associations request the
Board of Control and the City Councîl to urge
the Governinent to direct the proper officiaIs
to inquire into the cause of the high price of
British coal, and to determine whetber it la
due to the existence of a combine of coal producera aud importers, or to existing legitimate
charge.
Yours sincerely,
Fred G. Halit,
Secretary.
1 arn aware, through the statement made
the other day by the righit honourable gentleman, that the Dominion Fuel Board is now
investigating the whole matter.
The only
objection I have Vo this investigation is that
iV is being conducted behind closed doors;
the publie are neot admitted. But I must say
that I have the fullest confidence in Dr.
Cainsell, the chairman, and the o-ther nierabers of the Board. Dr. Camnsell' is respected
Vhroughout the whole Dominion as a man of
unquestioned prebity and of outstanding' Vechnical ability. 'I would ask the riglit honourable leader of the Hanse Vo refer this resolution ta the Dominion Fuel Board, and aV

87

the sanie turne to ask the chairman te make
a report of the activities of the Board up
te the present turne; for the impression stili
prevails that the spread between Vhe price
of coal laid down at the wharf in Montreal
or Quebec and the retail price te the public
is entirely eut of proportion. As to this I
persenally know nothing, but under present
circuinstances, when there is snch widespread
misery, it is net well that the public should
be under a false impression-if it is a false
impression-and the seoner the Fuel Board
makes a report as te the actual state of affairs,
the better for the Governiment and for the
public.
I amn glad
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
te have tlie resolution read by the hononrable
senator. A copy reached my office this morning. An investigation such as requested by
the resolution has been under way for sanie
turne; it is the eue referred te by the honourable member himself. It is true that Vhis
is noV a public investigation. Nor has it ever
been the practice of the Fuel Board te make
such investigations public, se far as I know.
Honourable members of course realize that
a public investigation compels disclosure of
the relative costs of purchase and of handling,
and a comparison of the facilities of different
importers, dealers and retailers. The honourable senator himseîf knows how reluctant men
are te disclose the facts of their business to
their competitors. Conseqnently the members
of the Board, ne doubt, feel they can get
more thorongh, more accurate, more dependable information by their present method of
inquiry. As soon as they have any flnding
of sufficient importance they will undoubtedly
make iV known Vo the public.
In the meantime I would caîl the attention
of the honeurable member te the suggestion,
which really amounted to an invitation, that
I gave Vu lin on the lest occasion when he
brougit Vhs natter up-that if, having regard
te the wisdom of net making unnecessary disclosures, but of making any disclosures that
are i the public interest, lie feels that Vhis
Huse should appoint a comnittee of inquiry, there will certainly be ne objection
raised on my part to sucli an appointment.
As a natter of fact, Vhis bouse lias more tine
te do the work than any other body in the
public service, and if honourable members
feel iV ouglit Vo lie donc, I suggest Vo thena
that it niglit le a very good idea te Vake
the responsibility on thenselves.

In rny judgment the second main cause for
the raiixvay situation of to-day can ho summed
up in txve xx'rds, pelitical expodienoy. J arn
threwing ne bricks when I suggest Ibis, and
J amn just as ready te dodgo as any ailier honourable gentleman. And xvho te-day are the

NOVEMBER 3, 1932

greatest sufferers from this political expediency? They are the railroad men who, by
the thousands, are working part time or not
at all.
The third main cause of the railway situation in Canada to-day is irresponsible optimism
in spending other people's money. What I say
in this regard may, I think, be applied te members on 'both sides of both Houses of Parliament, without any personal reflection. Without
doubt it applies to others, who had under
their control thousands of railway operatives
in the years gone by.
Two or three weeks ago we received what
I regard as a splendidly comprebensive report,
made by the Royal Commission appointed to
inquire into transportation in Canada. That
report is more concise, I believe, than anyone
dreamed such a report could be. It has been
said that the report leans a little towards one
railroad. I do not know about that. I think
it can be taken as being generally fair. That
is a matter of opinion. In any event, that
report deals with many of the factors that
tended to bring about the present railway
crisis. The Commission, of course, did not
enumerate the reasons that are, in my opinion,
responsible for the present situation, but gave
what it regarded as causes contributing to the
railway problem. Number six of those causes
is as follows:

Contractual arrangements with labour organizations which set up a rigid wage scale and
inflexible labour practices generally.
That is a fair criticism, a criticism that I do
not intend to dodge or evade; but this
afternoon I should like to go into the question of how those contractual arrangements
and the so-called rigid wage scale came about.
Section 190 of the report states:
The wages and conditions of employment of
a large majority of the employees of both railways are fixed by agreements with the trade
unions concerned.

Section 191 comments

on the manner in

which those agreements were arranged.
One thing that I should like to do this
afternoon is, if possible, to disabuse the
minds of honourable members in respect to
certain beliefs that they hold.

One of these

is the belief that the wage-rates of railroad
employees were excessively high, and, as
some say, largely responsible for the present
conditions of the railways. About a year
ago I heard two honourable members of this
House speaking of railway wages. One of
them referred to the annual salary of a railroad
employee as $9,000; the other referred to a
$7,000 salary. There is no question that those
honourable gentlemen believed their statements were correct, but both were absolutely

absurd.

Those gentlemen thought that the

so-called McAdoo award had resulted in
exorbitant demands being made on behalf of
the railroad employees of Canada. So much
has been said about the McAdoo award
being responsible for the troubles of the
Canadian railways that I am going to ask the
indulgence of the House for a moment or two
while I show how that award came to be
effective here.
I hold in my hand a copy of P.C. 1768,
issued on the 16th day of July, 1918, and
approved by His Excellency the Governor
General. This Order in Council ought to
be good, for the right honourable the leader
of this House (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
and the distinguished senator who sits to his
right (Hon. Mr. Robertson) were both members of the Government that adopted it. It
was good, and it is good. I am sure that
both those honourable gentlemen believed
that it was equitable, fair and proper at that
time, and I doubt very much that they have
changed their minds since then to any very
great extent. The preamble of the Order in
Council says, among other things:
-and it further appears that the railway companies are of the view that the wages paid
railway employees in Canada ought to be the
sane as that adopted in corresponding terri-

tories in the United States, as the class of work
is the same in both countries. That there is a
large interchange of traffic, and that as a result,
mîany employees work in both countries; and
on the further grounds that different organizations are international in their scope, and that
heretofore the wage scales in both countries
have been relatively the same.
That in view of the increased cost of living,
wages in Canadian territory should be increased
as increased in American territory, by the
award commonly known as the "McAdoo"
award.

Then it is ordered:
That the scale of wages of railway employees
as fixed by the "MeAdoo" award in United
States territory, including any amendments or
extensions thereof, be applied in Canadian
territory in so far as ail lines of railway owned,
operated or controliled by the Government are
concerned.
That the wage scales of privately owned railway companies in Canada should be similarly
advanced.
I bring this to the attention of honourable
members because I have repeatedly heard the
statement that the application of the socalled McAdoo award to Canadian ra.ilway
men was a disastrous thing for Canada. May
I suggest that the situation has changedthat for a number of years the wages of railroad men in Canada have been 6j or 7 per cent
below the United States standard, and that
about a year ago, when a 10 per cent reduction in wages was negotiated through the

SENATE
efforts of a board appointed under the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act, the wages
of Canadian railroad men were still about 61
or 7 per cent below the wages of their fellows
in similar employment in the United States.
I ans quite sure that what I have said will
not convert certain honourable gentlemen w-ho
really think that Canadian railroad men have
been and are now getting too much money.
My impression has always been that these
honourable gentlemen have not analysed the
ituation or learned exactly what wages Canadian railroad men received. They have not
undertaken to find out why the McAdoo
award became effective in the United States,
and why it was consequently applied in Canada. I wonder if I may be permitted to
quote from whbat should be a reliable authority to show the necessity in 1918 of giving
effect to the McAdoo award in the United
States, and of later on, with the assistance
of our two good friends opposite, making it
effective in Canada. With your permission,
honourable gentlemen, I shall quote from a
G. McAdoo, entitled
book by William
I do not want te tire
"Crowded Years."
honourable members, but let us see what he
bas to say about it. He is talking about the
Railroad Wage Commission that be appointed,
and on page 489 of his book he gives a table
that shows some of the actual wage increases.
I want to quote this table, for I hope it may
lisabuse the minds of any who have thought
that railroad men were very mucb overpaid.
He said:
As I have said, the percentages of increase
dininished in the upper reaches of the scale.
Employees who received $150 a month got an
increase of 16.17 per cent; those at $200 a
month got an increase of 8-375 per cent; and
those at $250 got no increase. Here are some
of the actual increases in dollars:

I should like to make another quotation
from the autobiography of the very greatly
discussed and abused McAdoo, the author or
sponsor of the so-called McAdoo award. Here
is what ha says on page 490:
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

I havo never dons anything in my life that
gave me so much satisfaction as raising the
pay of the railroad employees. To have been
the means of providing a decent living wage
for two million men and women makes me feel
happier than to have been President of the
United States.
Yet there is nothing I ever did, in my entire
public career, that brought down so much criticism on my head. Not then; not when it
happened. At that time everybody was for it.
I do not recali even one objection to the raising of wages wien it occurred. Every railroad
executive with whon I discussed the matter
thought the subject should receive my immediate and most urgent attention.
After the war, however, there was a different
tone. Some commentators declared that I had
spoiled the whole body of railroad employees
by giving them more pay all around. Other
invidious crities said and wrote that I had a
political purpose in mind; in other words, I
had shrewdly schemed to raise wages so the
railroad men would help elect me President of
the United States. Professor Charles Seymour.
in his "Woodrow Wilson and the World War,"
says that I made "concessions to labour" and
imaplies that my so-called concessions put labour
on a high horse, with a consequent result of
general demoralization.
For the benefit of Professor Seymour and of
others like him, I say bere that when I became
Director-General the subject of raising wages
had passed completely out of the sphere of argument, and had become a long-standing national
disgrace. It was not a matter of concessions.
The real question was whether the roads could
be operated at all on starvation wages. I
solved it by giving the men and women of the
railroads at least enough to live on.
I trust that honourable members who have
heard so many things about the McAdoo
award, on the ground of its so-called inequity
to the Canadian publie and its advantages to
Canadian railroad men, will read that statement for themselves, for it was made by a
man who, I think it may be said, bas held
more very high positions than any other man
on the North American continent. Surely his
judgment is worth something.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Will my honourable
friend permit me te interrupt him? In connection with the table that he quoted a moment ago, will he state what were the relative
increases in the wages of the more highly paid
employees, such as the conductors?
The table shows
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
that the wagcs for freight conductors were
raised from $131.59 in 1915 to $158.95 in 1918.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: What about passenger conductors and engineers?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I think their increases were in about the same proportion.
And it should be remembered that the eaployees of all 'the classes referred to in the
taible were given increases because none of
them were near the $250 mark at that time.

NOVEMBER 3, 1932
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: 1 should like to ask the
honouraible gentlemnan a question. Is it flot
true that the main objection of the public,
with respect to the McAdoo a'ward, was not
,se much to the increase in the scale of wages
a.s- te the evils that arese out of certain rules
and- regulations cennected therewith, whereby
ridiculous rates for overtime were ailowed?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I have no doubt
that my honourable friend is righ't so f ar as
the publie are concerned. The eight-hour day
had been in effect since 1916, or two years
hefore these increases were made, and rules
aýpplying to overtime had been in general
effeet fer rnany years. It is true that the ruie
ef time and a haîf fer evertime was adapted
hero. Perhaps in somýe cases it appiied in an
exacting way, while in e'ther- instances it was
said to. have speeded up the service and saved
money for the companiles. You can take
whichever view you like, fer there is semething to be said on both aides. But there is
no doubt the public thought some of the rules
attached te the M-cAdoo award were unreasonable and unduly exaioting.
I should like te give a demonstraition of how
the rates werk eut in actua)l practice. One
year ago we were engaged in conference with
railroad officiais in Montreal, and we were
before. a bhoard oýf investigation dealing with
a proposai that the railroad men aheuld aocept
a reduction of ben per cent in -their pay
cheques from montii te month. A settiement
was madle which. brou.ght about that condition., but during the negetiations bof ore the
invetigating body both railroad cempanies
submitted statemenits known as "Railavay
Su'hmission No. 13.-a," and "Railway Suibmission No. 134)." Numiber l3-a is for the
Caniadia.n National Rail.ways, and 13-b is for
the Canadiara Pacifie Railway. These railway
statemnents give the narnes of ton employees
in each of varieus classifications, such as pas3enger engineers, firemen, conductors, brake.nen, baggagemen, freight enginPer.s, firemen,
conductors, brakemen, locomotive engineers
and freight -trainmien, in ecdi division over the
entire systems. With the permission of the
Hou-se, I sho.uld like ýte place these submissions
on Hanskard, se that they will bc available for
future reference. Henourable members who
have, thought tint railroad men were being
paid uvndu1y higli wages would do wedl te
analyese these figures. It will be seen that
the Canadian Pacifie statemnent, for exa«nple,
quetes tie wages of ten emnpoyees in tic

91

varieus classes in the districts of New Brunswick, Queibea, Ontario, Algoma, Manitoba,
Saskatcewan, Alberta and British Columbia,
and shows the nuniber of days worked, the
heurs attually on duty, the miles paid for and
the compensatiun. 1 do not think that hionourable morniers could obtain sudh a cernplete pioture in any otier way. 1 could not
expeet te have a general acoptance of rny
own statemnt, unsupperted by evidenc, that
the wago, rates are not. unduly oxiacting or
exorbitant, and I know that. honouralde members weuid liko te see the coinpanics' figures.
Thereform 1 ask permission te place Fhem on
record.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I arn oniy
tee glad ýte accede te the requcat, se far as
I arn cencerned. I think they should he
placed on the record. Will the honeurable
gentleman tell us how the ten employiees in
the varieus classes were seiected? Was tic
selection just by chance?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No. The railroad
cempanies made Vie selections. 1 would not
under any circumistances charge that they
selected the instances meat favourable te
thermscîves. I think, though, that since a
case was being presented against the employees, the companies would have been ratier
lax in their own interests if they did net pick
eut tic best instances that Vhey could find
in each division. We take ne exception te
tint. We are assuming-theugi 1 do net
state this as a fact-tiat Vie ten men in each
of those classes and divisions were the ten
most higily paid men in tiat cîs and
division in tie month of October, 1931.
1 would ask henourable memibers te please
bear in mi, when nnlysing tiese rates of
pay, that they are now sulbjeet te a ten
per cent reductien, which became effective
on Decembes' 1, 1931.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: May I ask if tie
unien made any objectien as te the accuracy
of these figures?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Oh, ne. We have
been doing business with Vhe officers ef the
railread eoxnpnnies for se long that we do
net make objection ef that kind te figures
that tiey present. We accept tie corepanies'
word. They said tiat thc statements were
taken frem their pay-rolls. We belîeved that,
and acccpted the statements as accuýrate.

NOVe.MBE1R 3, 1932
1Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I do flot want to
take up too mucli time, but I should like to
refer briefly teo a circular that 1 imagine was
received by every honourable member. One
came to me, and I notice it is dated at
Toronto, October 26, and addressed to the
Government and the honourable members of
the Senate and House of Commons of Canadýa., It is signed by six gentlemen from
varions parts of Ontario and Quebec.
Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND: It is signed. by
i.memployed persons.
Hlon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes, it is signed
by six gentlemen: one conductor at Lindsay,
one trainman at Toronto, one engineer at
Chapleau, one fireman at Rivière du Loup,
one engineer at Montreal, and one yardman
at Verdun, Quebec. It is written on behaîf
of unemployed railway men. A proposai of
the kind that it contains cannot fail to appeal
to any honourable member, or to any other
citizen Who is true to himself and lis country
just now. We ought at ail tirnes to listen
to an appeal frorn those who require help,
and in dealing with this proposai I have no
thouglit whatever of disparaging the efforts
of those who made it. I sympathize as fully
as anyone can with the gentlemen Who wrote
the letter. But in their submission No. 6
they state:
We ask only that the men now employed in
the running trades on Canadian railways be
limited to 2,600 miles per rnonth. One hundred
miles in freight service and its equivalent in
passenger service, is considered and has been
agreed upon by the Companies and the men, as
constituting a day's work.
Then they ask 'that regulariy assigned yard
fore men and yard helpers lie lirnited to forty
hours per week. 'If these suggestions could
lie carried out, their adoption might be a
splendid thing for the unemployed thousands
of railway men in Canada. The organization
to which I happen to helong lias for eighteen
months had in effect in Canada a mileage
limitation and other restrictions for our men,
such as 208 hours for a yardman and proportionate limitations for road men. But if we
undertook to divide evenly all the available
work among ahl the railroad men Who were
employed a short time ago, on somne divisions
there would not be enough. to provide more
than three or fi've days' work a month. I
have in mind one promotion division of some
three hundred or more mi-lès, where less than
ten years ago there were nearly two hundred
classified conductors. But since 1929 there
have been onIy thirty-one, and only about
twenty-five of those have been working regularly. If you divided up the regular work

109

on -that division among ail the men Who weré
on the seniority list and who stili hold riglits
on that list, but who have been unemployed
for months and years, there would not be
enougli to provide employment for ecdi man
of more than three or five days a
month.
Then may 1, for what it ia Worth, present
the viewpoint of the older men, the men
who maybe have spent twenty-five to fortyfive years in railroad service and are corning
close to the sixty-five-year margin. Both our
great transportation systems pension their
men at sixty-flve years, except that those who
are exceptionally fit are in some cases given
a year's extension. The pension allowance
is based on the annual earnings during the
last ten years, multiplied by the number of
years of service. Naturally the older men
desire to work as steadily as they can during
their. last ten years. Will any one blame
themn? That lias been the situation. But a
strong effort lias been made to divide the
work among the men so far as it could be
done. It was in this connection that I discussed
the circular, for I knew several honourable
gentlemen had read it and had been Wondering why something of the kind would not be
feasible. On some divisions it miglit help
eut; on others, as I ýsaid a littie while ago,
it would not give more than three or five
days' work a month to ail those who are
eligible for employment. What is the answer?
That here in Canada a greût number of our
younger raiiroad men will have to seek other
avenues of employment by reason of the
conditions now prevailing in railroading.
As I said a few moments ago, the report
of the Royal Commission on Railways and
Transportation in Canada and this Bihl impiementing the Commission's recemmendatiens have been looked forward to with
greater anxiety than possibly any other similar report or bill that lias ever corne before
the Parliament of Canada. In a word, tens
of thousands of railroad men want to know if
there is any protection for themn in thèse
documents. The Bull appears to contemplate
the turning loose frern their chosen calling of
maybe rnany more hundreds, if not thousands,
of rallroad men. In what way, you may ask.
I reply: by the proposed compulsory cooperation of the Canadian Pacifie and the
Canadian National and the resultant consolidation or co-ordination of their railway
terminaIs and other facilities. Ail railroad
men who understand what lias deveIoped in
the years gone by 'feel that in certain loealities, se far as many of the men are concerned,
possibly the worst is yet to come.
I arn wondering if in dealing wîth this Bill
it would net be fair te bring about some

SENATE

110

reasonable degree of conservation of the
human rights involved in this proposed legislation. As I have already said, these men
went into the railroad game a good many
years ago to carry forward a business instituted by the state. They were not conscripted; they took up railroading because they
believed it would provide them a reasonable
livelihood and afford them steady employment
during their working years. To-day many
thousands of them find they made a mistake
as a result of Parliament permitting the building of too many duplicating railroads.
This Bill is in the most concise form in
which I have ever seen any legislation drafted
to cover so broad a field. Section 28 is allembracing in that it takes into account every
!aw on our Statute Book. This general clause
is in these terms:
The provisions of this Act shah prevail over
those of all other Acts inconsistent herewith.
Do honourable members wonder that railroad men want to know what that means, and
what other Acts may be inconsistent with this
proposed legislation? What is involved? For
instance, the Railway Act provides that when
a terminal is abandoned the employees may,
under certain conditions to be laid down by
the Board of Railway Commissioners for
Canada, be entitled to compensation for any
financial loss caused to them by change of
residence necessitated thereby. Is that protection to be entirely lost? Or are the equities
under such circumstances to be determined
by the Chairman of the Board of Railway
Commissioners in his capacity as Chairman of
the Arbitral Tribunal?
Railroad men feel that possibly certain
points of view that should have been considered
in their behalf may have been overlooked,
and therefore I shall conclude my remarks by
putting on the record a statement that I think
should be dealt with before we adopt the
Bill. This is the statement:
Some Hopes and Fears of the Railway
Employees in connection with the Report of
the Royal Commission on Railways and Transportation in Canada and Bill A, now under
consideration:
1. Will it be possible to safeguard in some
measure the personal and family welfare of
many thousands of railroad employees who
will be crowded out of service as a result of
the application and intent of Bill A?
2. Will the generally satisfactory negotiating arrangements referred to in section 190
of the Royal Commission's report be encouraged and continued? The employees
stand ready to produce their share of continued satisfactory relations.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

3. If railway mileage in Canada is, as admitted, greatly in excess of Canada's present
requirements, and if uncalled for extravagances have been in evidence in the operation
of the railways, should the employees who
had no part in authorizing construction or
expenditures be now penalized, or should they
be in a measure protected against undue
hardship?
4. What measure of relief or compensation,
if any, is due to railway employees who, as the
result of co-ordinate operations at certain
points under the provisions of Bill A, lose
their work, their homes and their future
opportunity for employment in the service of
the railways?
5. The Royal Commission's report fails to
indicate that employees crowded out of service by co-ordination should be safeguarded.
Is that the attitude of the Government in the
passage of Bill A?
6. Section 191 of the Royal Commission's
report reads:
With the continuance of good relations
between the management and employees of
both systems, and a frank recognition of the
serious financial situation, much can be done
to case the position of the railways, without
imposing any undue hardship upon the
employees.
Does this imply further restrictions in railroad
men's earnings by agreement, if possible, and
by compulsion, if necessary, through the
Arbitral Board?
7. Railroad employees strongly commend the
proposal to 'maintain the identity of the two
railroad systems and trust this may be donc
without undue favouritism to either railroad.
8. Railway employees trust that some
amendment to Bill A may be inserted to provide protection in so far as possible for employees squeezed out in the application of
co-ordinated operation at certain railway
points in Canada.
9. If three trustees on the Canadian National Railways are to have complete and
final authority in determining all questions in
relation to the operation of that property, the
employees would generally hold that the viewpoint and the rights of the employees might
be entirely overlooked unless they were
directly represented. The employees would
feel more secure if the board of trustees
specified were enlarged so as to give the
workers a voice in the many matters that so
vitally concern them.
10. Railroad employees generally hold the
view that the Arbitral Tribunal proposed in
Bill A places too much authority in the hands
of one man, whose judgment, training and
experience may be of the highest quality, but

believe that honourable members of this
House can spend their time better in dealing
with the essentials of this Bill.
I have the greatest sympathy with the views
expressed by the honourable member for
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) in relation to
the thousands of employees of both our large
railway systems. I am sure that due consideration will be given to the views so
eloquently expressed by him this afternoon.
I might point out to the honourable gentleman, however, that the railways of Canada
are not the only business concerns that have
dispensed with the services of large numbers
of their employees. Thousands of former employees of other concerns are now walking
the streets owing to depression in the various
fields in which formerly they were active.
While the railway employees affected may be
more numerous than the employees in other
vocations, they are not suffering to any greater
degree.
Quite apart from the rail-way ernployees,
there is in Canada a class of people greatly
interested in what this House and the other
House and the Government are going to do
in this important matter. I refer to the taxpayers of Canada. Already they are groaning under the burden of taxation. The railway debt of Canada is as great as the public
debt, if not greater. Owing to the depression,
railwa.y revenues are falling, and the railway
debt, and likewise taxation, are increasing.
Therefore al. the people of Canada, particularly the taxpayers, I should say, are turning
their eyes towards Ottawa to see what Parliament is going to do about this tremendous
railway problen.
I have read this Bill many times. It certainly is concise, and, I think, well drawn.
There are four essentiall features that the
Senate and its Raýilway Committee will finally
have to pass upon. I refer te the trustees,
to the situation of the Canadian Pacifie Railway, to the arbitral tribunal, and to the auditors. From my exiperience in large covporations, and from watching their development,
I bellieve that the nearer we can get to oneman power the better. Greater efficiency is
abtained in that way. I think that the Royal
Commission, composed as it was of very able
men of England, the United States and Canada, deserves the commendation of this House
for having placed its suggestions and recommendations before us in so concise a manner.
As we ail know, there is to be a board of
three trustees, one member of which, the chairman, is to be appointed for seven years, and
the other two for a shorter period. These
trustees can be removed only on address of
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

both Houses of Parliament. If this Bill passes,
the problem confronting the Government will
be to get three men who are capable of discharging the tremendous task that lies ahead.
To my mind the Government will have to
go to the large corporations to secure the
services of men of executive ability, men of
wide experience in dealing with big problems.
It will then have to convince them that it is
their duty to serve their country, and in that
way induce them to become trustees. I fully
realize what a tremendously difftoult job it will
be to get the right men, but I think that is
a matter we can safely leave in the hands of
the Government.
Some twenty-five years ago I had the honour
to be appointed, with two other men, to the
Board of Harbour Commissioners of the City
of Montreal, and from my experience of the
way in which we were able to get along and
accomplish things, I should say that three
trustees are quite enough.
Many other features of the provisions relating to the trustees appeal to me. The trustees
will appoint the president of the Canadian
National Railways. Therefore the president
will no longer have to come to Ottawa, nor
will he have to worry about whether or not
he is pleasing this or that political friend. His
sole duty will be to look after the management
and operation of the railway system. Instead
of reporting to a large board composed of
directors from each province of this country,
he will report only te this small board of three
trustees. This feature of the Bill appeals to
me very strongly indeed. I have no doubt
that representations will be made to this
House, and possibly te the Railway Committee, urging that the board be enlarged, but
in view of the magnitude of the task that
lies ahead, and the responsibility involved, I
sincerely trust that the board will not be
increased.
Another feature that appeals te me is that
the budget will be made up by the trustees
and submitted to the Minister of Finance,
who in turn will submit it to the Governor
in Council, and then to Parliament. I think
that procedure is very wise.
So far as the trustees are concerned, I fully
endorse the suggestion of the Royal Commission.
Now I corne to the Canadian Pacific Railway, that vast and efficiently-managed private
system upon whose history for the past fifty
years every Canadian can look with pride.
The presidents of that railroad have been
men of distinction not only in Canada, but
throughout the Empire. I refer to men like
Lord Mount Stephen, Sir William Van Horne,
Lord Shaughnessy, and the very able gentle-

mnan who now directs the affairs of that company, Mr. E. W. Beatty. It is partly due
to the Canadian Pacifie Railway that Canada
occupies the proud and important position in
the world that she holds to-day. I have not
interviewed any of the Canadian Pacifie
Railway officiais, and I arn unacquainted with
their views, but if I were placed at the head
of the (Janadian Pacifie Railway to-day, whic~h
is unlikely, I certainly should not be much
enarnoured of the suggestions, contained in
this report, about co-operation with the
National Railways. So far as co-operation
goes, it is ail right; but if the railways disagree they must go before an arbitral tribunal.
If the Ganadian Pacifie Railway is opposed
to this, I have some sy.mpatby with its
views, but after giving very careful consideratien to the matter I do not see how any
other machinery could be provided for the
final settlement of any differences that might
arise between the two railroads. In order
to effect the economies that we hope are
gomng to be effected, there must be some
arbitral tribunal to give a final decision if
the two great systems cannot agree. That
tribunal is to be composed of the Chairman
of the Railway Commission, a representative
of the Canadian Pacifie Railway and a representative of the Canadian National Railways.
Under a provision con tained in the Bll, in
the event of disagreement in a major matter,
the President of the Exehequer Court may
appoint two additional members, and the
decision of the five memnbers of the tribunal
shaîl be final.
Economies must be effected. As we ahl
Icnow, Canada is in a very serious position
llnancially. Af ter all, a country, se far as the
cardinal factors which affect its financial position are concerned, is not se very different

moment ago, to falling revenues and increased taxation. In the very serious situation confronting us to-day a responsibility rests not only upon the mexbiers of
the Governrnent, but upon the members of
both sides of both Houses of Parliament.
I believe that this Bill, if passed, will do
rnuch to improve the financial. condition of
Canada, and therefore I give it my wholehearted support as it now stands. After
further debate and after it has been threshed
out in cornmittee, some amendments may be
suggested to improve it. Saving that, I think
the Bill is a commendable one, and I approve
of everything contained in it.

I the city from which I corne I arn constantly asked, "What is the Senate going to
do with the Railway Bull?" I have felt it
ineumbent upon me, therefore, to express
my opinion as I have done, though perhaps
inadequately, in regard to this very important
legislation.
There is only one other feature to which
I shaîl refer. I have long held the opinion
that there should be an independent audit
of the -Canadian National Railways' books,
and I amn very glad to see provision in this
Bill for the selection and appointment of
auditors by the Parliament of Canada. An
independent, continuous and reliable audit
wîll be a fine thing for the railways, for the
Government, and for the people of Canada.
That feature of the Bull bas my hearty
approval.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I have little
more to say. Long speeches could be -made,
of course, and one could go a long way back
over the political history of this country as
it pertains to railways, but, as the honourable
member frorn Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock)
has said, the throwing of bricks can serve no
good purpose. I had the honour of serving
in two Governrnents-the Borden Government and the Meighen Governrnent-and I do
not desire to shirk any responsibiity for
what wss donc by thern. I see no use, however, in goîng back and resurrecting what is
almost ancient history. The question before
the Senate of Canada to-day is whether or
not it approves of this Bill. After the Bill
cornes back to the House from committee a
final decision will have to be given, and
meanwhile I for one take very much pleasure
in supporting the Bill.
Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND: 'If the Senate is
not going to sit to-night, I move the adjournment of the debate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I arn in the
hands of the Hous in that matter. I should
like, so far as is consistent with w.hat I have
already said, to have the debate on the second
reading concluded to-morrow, but certainly
that is not going to be done in opposition to
any who desire to speak. If it is felt that we
can adjourn now and get through with the
second reading to-rnorrow, I arn quite content
that we should ad-journ.
Honi. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
whether or not there are anany speakers on
either side of the House. My remnarks will

standing with Canada wjth respect thereto,
because of the interest of our citizens in the
Newfound'land ore. I will cali the attention of
the Government te this matter and sec what
we can do with respect te it.

Honourable

members of the Senate, it is unnecessary for
me te stress the fact thart we are passing
through very strenuous times. The werld depression is stili with us. 1 have heard some
people suggcst that a Bill sucli as the one
before us might welI wait until the return of
normal times, because at present, swayed by
the wave of pcssimism that is swceping over
the country, we may feed cailed upon te
take somne action whicha later we miglit regret.
In response to that argument I desire te try
te ascertain whether the so-called abnormal
conditions now existing have flot for some
years past, been the normal conditions of our
Canadian railways.
Up te the time of the War everything
secmned to be moving aiong smoothly, and
we were in the midst of happy days. There
wcrc coming into the country every year
some three hundrcd theusand immigrants, and
our transportation systems were carrying these
ncw-comers te their future homes in the
West, wherc they were breaking the land, thus
hcipinýg te increase from year te year the
quantýity of Western produets te be transported te the East. In the auturon of 1911,
and aise, perhaps, in 1912, the crop in the
West was se bountiful that our raiiway
systeros scemed te be incapable of carrying it.
This gave the people of Canada the impression
that the deveiopment of our raiway systero
in the West was net proceeding tee rapidly.
I remnember very well a conversation that I
had with Mr. Charles M. Hays, the then
president of the Grand Trunk Raiiway
System, on the eve of his departure on a trip
te Europe-a jeurney from which lie neyer
rcturned. I had been asked by the Prime
Minister of Quebec whether the Grand Trunk
Railway, which was leasing the Transcontinental fine freom Winnipeg te the East Nould
have any objection te the Government ia the

company that wanted to buîld a line to James
Bay, so that the Hudson Bay might play

scanning the map from east to west,' Mr. Rays
inforrned me that I could tell the Prime
Minister that the proWeted railway miglit
well be built, because before long, even with
the development of our railways in the West,
our transportation systems would be inadequate to carry eastward all the produots
of the West. That was the opinion of a
man. at the head of one of our railway systems.
At that time hie was quite optimistic.
Unfortunately the War broke upon us in7
1914, and when the Canadian Northern came
and asked for help the outlook was not so rosy
as it had been. In 1917, when Parliament
saw fit to purchase the whole of the Canadian Northern Railway System, the situation
had not improved, and up to 1925 or 1926
there was little cause for optimism.
The last speech of Lord Shaughnessy that
I heard was delivered in the city of Montreal,
I believe, i the winter of 1922-23. I that
speech hie stated that after considiering the
whole problem hie had corne to the conclusion
that we could not maintain our two systems
of railway with any degree of prosperity until
we had brought three million more people
into the Northwest. 1 felt at that time,
therefore, that it would be some years before
a recovery would take place, inasmuch as
immigration was very slow. Under that
formula I could see no sign of recovery for
about ten years to, corne. Lord Shaughnessy
was not the only Canadjian of that opinion.
On aIl sides I heard the statement that if
the Canadian National System was to meet
its operating expenses population in the West
would have to, increase.
In 1925 this Chamber saw fit to, appoint a
Railway Committee to inquire into the whole
problem of railway transportation. Evidence
was given before that committee by most
of the heads of railways and of financial
institutions who appeared before the recent
Royal Commission. All were agreed that
what we lacked was population; that our
population i the West was too sparse to,
support our two railway systems. I confess
that the members of that committee, and
other persons who heard the evidence of the
men summoned before it, came away from
the inquiry somewhat despondent.
Yet 1926 was Vo give us a surprise. A
certain member of Parliament said i a facetious way, in 1925, that we should dispose
of our Canadian National Railway System
f or a dollar. At the time no one would
53721-8 j

115

have taken it for a dollar, because of the.
millions of dollars of deficits that were piled
up each year. Yet ini 1926 the financial report
of the Canadian National showed a surpluson operation of $41,000,000, which, being
reckoned as five per cent, meant an enhancement of about 880,000,000 i the value of the
property. 1 was one of those who felt that
if the railway could meet its obligations to,
the public to this extent at the outset, its
value would very soon pass the billion mark,
and there was considerable hope for the
future of the railway.
But we were lulled into a sense of security
that was bound to, result in disappointment.
In view of the resul.ts of 1926 and the prosperity thoet abounded in the land, we all were
disposed to give a free hand to the presidentand directors of the Canadian National in
their efforts to bring that system up to a
proper standard. We all knew that it was
emerging from the construction stage and
that voiling-gtock and other equipmen-t were
necessary if it was to be placed on a par
with the Canadian Pacific Railway. So
millions of dollars were pumped into the
system. But the results were quite discouraging, and we neyer again reached the 1926
receipts of $41,000,000 over operating expenses.
On the contrary, there was a gradual decrease until 1931, when the result was being
written in red ink.
1 wonder if these aibnormal condiitions
through which we are passing are flot more
or less chronic with our National Railway
Sysitem. Naturally we &Il hope for improvement, but we must not close our eyes to the
fact that for some years to, corne we shaîl
have very little immigration. Therefore the
growth of the raiIway receipts on aceount of
Western trafflc will not be as rapid as the
late Lord Shaughnessy thought it would when
hie reasoned that the two railway systems
could be saved if we gradually built up our
immigration figures to 300,000 a year until a
total of 3,000,000 new-comers had been
brought in. Furthermore, new modes of
transportation have appeared on the highways and are competing with the railways
for trafflc. These considerations impel me to
believe that we canncit hope for a very
marked improvement in the returns of the
Canadian National Railways within a short
period of time.
The Royal Commission which gave many
weeks to a study of the railway and transportation situation in this country has made
a very commendable report. I have read it
wi:th close attention and have no criliicism
to offer. The remedy the commissioners sug-

116

SENATE

gest undoubtedly points in the right direction; but it seems to me the first question to
be asked is whether the Canadian Pacific
Railway, a private company, is a willing party
to the conclusions embodied in the present
Bill. If it is not, we shall be confronted with
the question whether it is right or opportune
for Parliament to invade the charter rights
of that company. Under parts II and III
of the Bill the company's autonomy is to
a large extent invaded. J will not read the
whole of those parts, but only subsection 2
of section 16:
(2) Any such measures, plans or arrangements may, where deemed desirable, include or
ie effected by means of(a) New companies controled by stock
ownership, equitably apportioned between the
compames;
(b) Leases, entrusting agreements, or licences,
or agreements for the pooling and division of
earnings arising from the joint operation of
any part or parts of freight or passenger
traffic;
(c) Joint trackage, running rights, joint
ownership, or joint operating agreements,
depending upon the nature of the property or
services included in any co-operative plan;
(d) Joint or individual highway services, or
highway and railway services combined, in any
form.
Considering these clauses in relation to the
activities of a railway, one cannot help thinking that the two systems are to be as close
together as Siamese twins, despite the interesting way in which this subsection 2 ends:
But nothing herein shall he taken to authorize
any amalgamation of any National Company
with any Pacifie Company.
When the companies are forced into partnership in the many ways indicated in the clauses

I have read, I do net know what further steps
would be necessary before it could be said that
amalgamation was completed.
In the divergent interests of the two railway companies I see considerable difficulty
with respect to the agreements between them
that the Bill contemplates. We must not forget that even though the measure should
pass in its present form, competition would still
exist and both systems would continue to defend
to the utmost what they consider te be their
vital rights. We all know that competition is
the life of trade, but I am net ready to admit
that competition between our railways is net
a luxury, and as for the Canadian National
Railways, I believe it has been a ruinous
luxury.
I am somewhat doubtful that the scheme
embodied in this Bill will provide the complete remedy which we are seeking. Yet if we
decide to include the C.P.R. in this arrangement, or if that company is reconciled to itHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

perhaps out of sheer necessity-the experiment will be worth trying. The alternative
plan suggested by the Senate in 1925 was,
it seems te me, a more radical one.
The Royal Commission, after e:damining
various proposals made te it, came to the
foll-owing conclusion, which is set out at page
62 of the report:
The complete amalgamation of the two
systems has been suggested as a method, net
only for attaining a maximum of economy, but
also for the most effective use of the properties.
This raises the question whether it may be done
either by publie or private ownership. Whatever merits or demerits this proposal may have,
the time is not opportune for giving serious
consideration to this particular remedy; neither
complete public nor complete private ownership
is possible.
Then it says:
It bas also been suggested that the Canadian
National Railways should be leased to the Canadian Pacifie Railway, either in perpetuity or
for such a period as would afford an opportunity to effect substantial economies.
A lease in perpetuity presents certain difficulties. It would, whatever safeguards may be
adopted, result in the establishment of a
monopoly.
It will be seen that the commissioners make
no reference to what is known as co-operative
management, the principal method suggested
by this Chamber for the solution of the problem.
Co-operative management would involve neither complete public nor complete
private ownership, but a unification of the
principles underlying the two different forms
of ownership.
Sir Robert Borden, when moving the third
reading of the Canadian Northern Railway
Acquisition Bill, on the 29th of August, 1917,
said:
I said, in speaking of the problem that lies
before the people of Canada, then-and I desire
to repeat it to-night-that I think it will be
necessary for the railway companies and the
Government to get together in the immediate
future, and deal with the possibi'ity of having
a system of co-operative management of all the
railways in Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What date
was that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
On the 29th
of August, 1917, when Sir Robert was moving the third reading of the Canadian Northcrn Railway Acquisition Bill in the House of
Commons. Further on he says:
If the Canadian Pacifie Railway, by acquiring the Canadian Northern Railway, can save

itself $100,000,000 in construction, that, to my

mind, seems to indicate that there are facilities
upon the lines of the Canadian Northern which
are not employed, and which might be employed,
and used by the Canadian Pacifie Railway,
under some system of co-operative management,
so as to save that expenditure to the people of
this country.

NOVEMBER 4, 1932
And again:
I have gone into that question, as far as my
limited knowledge will permit, with soins of
the heads of great railway systems in Canada,
and I think tey are coming to the conclusion
that saine such system of co-operative management as I have mentioned might well be carried
out.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: May I ask the honourable gentleman if hie could give us the final
recommendation of the special committee that
was appointed by the Senate?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I amn coming ta
it. As I have said, 'the Senate committee
had beo re it the inost prominent railway
men who could throw light upon the problem
which 'was engrossing not only aur mind, but
that of the puiblic gencrally. Here are the
conclusions of the committee:
Ainung the different sehemes discussed by the

wvitnesses the mast important were:Canadian
the
bet,%een
(a) Co-operation
Pacifie Railway and the Canadian National
Railway systeme.
(b) The acquisition by the Governinent of the
Canadian Pacifie Railway.
(c) The sale or 'lease of the Canadian
National Railways ta the Canadian Pacifie
Raiiway.
(d) The transfer of the Canadian National
Railways ta a private campany, ta be owned
and operated by such company.
I draw particular attention ta the next
paragra4ph, hecause it cavers the seheme
selected by the comïmittee:
(e) The merging of the twa railway systeins
for purpases of administration and operation.
That bath the Canadian Pacifie Railway and
the Canadian National Railways should bie
placed under the management af a board of
fifteen directors, five to be named by the Canadian Pacifie Railway, five ta be namied by the
Governinent, and these ten ta choose five proven,
capable business men ta camplete the board;
these last five directors ta hold office for ten
years and ta be removed only for cause.
That a recapitalIization be made of the Canadian National Railways frein the point of view
of earning capaeity.
That the Canadian Pacifie Railway be
guaranteed an agreed dividend on its stock.
At that time the C.P.R. was earning its
dividend and scemed ta be in a position ta
earn it for a nuinher of years ta came.
In the event of the joint management produeing a surplus, a dividend at the saine rate as is
paid ta the Canadian Pacifie Railway be paid
ta the Government on the capitalization plaeed
on the Govermnent Railways. After the payment of these dividende any surplus earnings
available for distribution be divided between
the Canadian Pacifie Railway and the Canadian
National Railways, in proportion to the valuation of the two systems.
'lie report continues:
The seheme mentioned in sub-paragraph (e)
of paragraph 6 above le strongly recommended
ta the attention of the Governinent.

117

The merging of the two railway systems for
purposes of aperation and administration as
above will remove or dispense with duplication
in railway tracks and rolling-stock, in passenger
and freight services, in railway stations from
-the Atlantic to the Pacifie, in telegraph, express,
and other services, in offices, in accounting and
book-keeping, in numerous other special offices
and staffs, in administration boards, etc., etc.,
and thereby and otherwise save an enormous
amount of money to the country.
Under this scheme the two systems would
retain their separate entities. The purpose of
the suggested recapitalization of the Canadian
National Railways was ta place the systemn on
an equal basis with the Canadian Pacifie
Railway. This would have involveL placing
a very large sum ta profit and loss, ta be
treated as an unremunerative debt of Canada
until the country had developed ta such an
extent that the Canadian National Systemn
should earn interest on its securities.
It will be observed that it was proposed
ta guarantee the Canadian Pacifie Railway
an agreed dividend on its stock. To-day
the railway situation is such that 1 suppose
if present-day conditions had existcd at the
time the committee would not have made
this recommendation, but would have suggested that the C.P.R. link its fortunes with
those of the C.N.R., for better or for worse,
and that the two systems be placed on an
even plane.
Although 1 have not read the opinion of
Mr. Ruel, I have scen a memorandum. from
him ta the Royal Commission in which he
suggests joint management of the two railway systems.
The advantages sought *by the Royal Comnmission would have been obtained by the adoption of the Senate comsnittee's recommendation.
It would mean the elimination of costly campetition, of duplicate services, of useless fines, and
of political interference. It would also insure
reasonable protection of the public intcrest
through the presence of representatives of the
state on the board of directors, and the
presence of the private-ownership representatives would mean adherence ta rigid business
methode. The conflictîng interests of the two
systems would thus be harmonized.
Honourable members will have noticed that
the Royal Commission recommcnds, and the
Bill itself provides for, the pooling and
division of earnings of any part or parts of
Under the
freiglit and passenger traffie.
Senate committee's seheme ail traffie would
be pooled.
Mr. Beatty suggcsted that unification might
be effected by leasing the Canadian National
Railways ta the Canadian Pacifie Railway,
and the report makes reference ta this suggestion; but, as this would mean a railway

SENATE

118

monopoly under private ownership, I do not
suppose that the Parliament of to-day or
of to-morrow would be disposed to seek such
a solution of the railway problem.
I have called attention to the report of
the Senate committee because of the fact
that a number of honourable senators have
taken their seats since 1925, and I think
it ,would be weil for us to bear that report in
mind when dealing with this Bill in committee.
In view of the wide jurisdiction proposed to be
given the arbitral tribunal, I wonder if the
Canadian Pacifie Railway would not prefer
our committee's scheme of joint management.
Whatever scheme may be decided on by us
when the Bill is before the standing committee, I hope that the C.P.R. will agree to
it because of the resultant benefits. As for
myself, I shall go into the committee with
an absolutely unbiased, open mind.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members,
I suppose I have not spoken in this Chamber
for upwards of a year, and I would not take
part in the debate now but for the fact that
I consider we have before us a measure of
very great importance, and whatever disposition is made of it by the two Houses of Parliament will have far-reaching effects. What
I have to say I have committed to writing,
and I hope honourable members will pardon
me if I follow my notes fairly closely.
With respect to consideration of the Bill
itself, the Prime Minister in the other House
and the leader of the Government in this
have made two suggestions that to me appear
to be quite important. The first relates to
what I may call the freedom of members.
Elsewhere, as we know, members are not quite
so free as are the members in this Chamber.
I am speaking in the strict party sense. In
this case the Government expressly urges
that every member of Parliament should exercise the fullest freedom in giving ifrank and
fearless expression to his views, be those
views what they may, in order that when
the Bill finally emerges as a statute it may
represent the calm, mature, independent
judgment of the majority, regardless of any
political consideration whatsoever. The other
suggestion, which is very closely allied to the
first, is that every member of either Chamber
should olearly understand that the Government welcomes any and every proposal by
way of modification or amendment that may
be made to improve the Bill, one of the main
objects sought being to secure from Parliament as a whole its majority opinion as to
how best to deal with the existing railway
situation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

In introducing the Bill in its present form
the Government holds the view that it is
acting merely as a trustee. The Duff Commission having completed its work, the Government felt in duty bound to submit for the
consideration of Parliament a Bill embracing
practically all the Commission's recommendations. In some quarters objection has been
taken to the form of the Bill, but it has been
made quite clear elsewhere that the Government did not feel that it had a free hand in
drafting the measure. The Duff Commission,
appointed !by the Government, having completed its investigation and made its recommendations, the Government felt that it ought
to submit to Parliament a Bill that would
carry out those recommendations. The Government does not say that we should accept
the Bi-Il without amendment, but leaves Parliament to deal with the proposed measure in
whatever way it pleases.
The railway problem as it has existed for
some time is national in its scope. It is not
the problem of any political party. I think
all will agree that both parties are concerned.
It is not the problem of any one province or
of any single railway system. Its ramifications
affect seriously all our people, and particularly all shareholders in the privately-owned
railway. Without question the problem must
be solved, if solved it can be. If it cannot
be solved in its entirety, then at least Parliament should take such action as will mitigate the evils incident to the present situation.
There are buge expenditures that must be
stopped, there are holes that must be plugged
up, and just as quickly as possible, unless our
people are prepared to face what I may call
near-bankruptcy. The situation cannot be allowed to continue.
This problem should have been dealt with
before. I agree with the honourable leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
that it has existed not for only a short while,
but for a long while, and that Parliament
has been slow in taking the action it should
have taken. If honourable gentlemen agree
with that opinion-and I think they mustit follows that a very grave responsibility
rests upon this Chamber. The Senate has
been selected to give first consideration to
this measure, to the problem itself, and to
the proposals that have been made for its
solution. I have no doubt that this House
will do its duty in this respect carefully, ably
and well. As we know, we have in our midst
men of ripe and tried experience in the
business world, men who have had executive
and administrative experience in a large way,

NOVE&MBER 4, 1932
and if we naw apply aurselves ta this question as we should, we shail ahl feel when
the Bill leaves this House that the Senate,
at least, bas donc its duty.
At this turne 1I do nat intend ta discuss,
except in a very general way, any of the
varîu causes whîch have operated finally
ta bring about the conditions now existing.
1 have no doubt that many, if nat moat, of
these causes will be brought ta aur attention
in cormîittee, and that there we shaIl have
an opportunity of discussing them. Nor do
il intend ta refer ta a mass of figures and
statistics an this occasion, because I believe
they wauld be quite out of place. Ini the
committee 'we iay deal with them. ta aur
hearts' content.
Our cansideration of the probleni must of
necessity, I tbink, embrace bath aur great
railway systenis. We ahl know that the
National Systeni is, sa ta speak, a very sick
patient and that very drastic treatment must
be applied ta it if it is 'ta continue ta live
and function as a railway systern. Ta what
extent the C.P.R. suffers froni like ilîs I do
nat knaw. On the other hand, however, we
do know that the Duif Commission, after
rnaking an exhaustive înquiry, has unanirnausly
agreed ta a recommendatian that in effeet
com.pels us ta deal with bath railway systenis
if the goal is ta be inttained. Regardless of
whether the C.P.R. has suffered ta the sanie
extent as the Canadian National, and whe'ther
it bonis as large in this prablem, the Duif
Commission, composed of very able mentwa of them outstanding railway men-has
said ta the Parliament of Canada, "You cannat deal with this problern unless bath railway
systems are included in the solution." The
Commission may be right, or it may be
wrong. As ta that I do not knaw. In any
event we shah bhave an apportunity of considering that feature in cornrittee.
I arn now and have always been a warm
admirer of the C.P.R. For long years it bas
been aur greatest national asset in the world
of business. In the field of railways the C.P.R.
bas bad no peer, having been for years the
niast outstanding railway systeni in the entire
world. 1 have no doubt at all that shauld
the C.P.R. have difficulties ait the present
time, or have a share, sa ta speak, in this
probleni, it wauld, if left ta itself, do as it
has always donc in the past--it wauld cape
with the problern and salve it. But, as I say,
if we are ta f ollow the -repart of the Duif
Commission we cannaît leave the C.P.R. ta
itself, but must cansider it in connectian with
the problem, because, willingly or unwillingly,
the C.P.R. is a f actor in it. We cannot divide

119

the transportation problemn iuta two parts.
If we are to salve the maijor fcatures of the
probleni we must take the C.P.R. into, account.
At first 1 was inclined to agree with the
statement made the other day by the right
honourable senator from. Eganville (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham) that Parliament should
hesitate and meditaite before deciding ta take
away froni the shareholders and directors of
the C.P.R certain rights, powers and functians
now exclusively exercised by them under the
authority of their original charter of incorporation. Many years ago Parfiament conferred upon a graup of men, sharehoIders, exclusive .rights and powers with respect ta the
management of the C.P.R. As the right hanaurable gentleman ipointed out, it is suggested
in this Bill that *we dhould take away those
rights. Let us look at. this aspect of the Bull a
littie mare closely.
In the aid days there waù considerable campetitian between the Grand Trun-k and the
C.P.R. in certain territaries common ta bath.
Later on, with the advent of the MackenzieMann lines, first in the West, and then in the
East, tagether with the building of the Transcontinental Railway and the Grand Trunk
Pacific branch lines on the Prairies, competition grew keener and keener. Finally,
frani the collapse af the aid Grand Trunk
and the Canadian Nai'thern and its subsidiaries, there emerged a railway, the present
Canadian National Systeni, with -a mileage
greater than that of the C.P-R. Parliament
had created thîs huge systeni, sweeping into
it praotically everything that was nlot C.P.R.,
and we had this railroad system with a total
af some 23,000 miles af liue.
Eighteen
Right Hon. Mr. MEJO-HEN:
thousand miles.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I have forgatten the
exact mileage. It makes no difference. We
know that the Canadian National Railway
System bas a larger mileage than the C.P.R.
Wbat happened? Campetitian between the
two systems grew ke-ener anid keener. The
management of the Canadian National sat
up, 80 ta speak, and in the course of a very
short tàme the personnel, from top ta bottani,
became very ambitiaus. The ides, became prevalent that there was anly one thing ta do,
namely, ta "beat the aId C.P.R. ta it." The
Canadian National Railways already surpassed
the C.P.R. in mileage: why not surpass it in
train service-traffic service, if you like-in
equiipment, hatels and betterments of all
kinds? Parliament aided and abetted that
ambition that had grown up in Canadian National circles. I do iiot altogether blame the
Canadian National managem~ent for what it

120

SENATE

did-it acted humanly, that is all-but I do
blame Parliament for not having placed in the
statutes some check or checks that would
have prevented the growth of such a condition as we have to-day. Parliament handed
over the management of the railroad to a
president and a board, and from that time to
this both parties in Parliament have sat back
and said: "Now we will just leave them
alone. There must be no political interference." That meant that there must be no
interference at ail. The two parties in Parliament vied with each other in maintaining that
situation; and if the C.N.R. ran amuck, I
ask, whose fault was it? In a sense I do
not blame the management of the C.N.R. for
ail that has happened, because Parliament,
instead of imposing a check on the management, furnished it with millions to enable it
to do just what it. did. This Bill does what
should have been done in days past: it provides
brakes, and brakesmen as well. Conditions
in relation to the general management -of the
C.N.R. cannot continue as they have existed
in the past if this Bill is approved and its
provisions are given the effect of law.
Now, while the C.N.R. was doing ail those
things, what was happening to the C.P.R.?
We must remember that the traffic available
for the railways of Canada is limited. My
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) referred to that fact very pointedly. We have
not in Canada as a whole sufficient population
ta produce traffic enough to enable the existing
railways to pay dividends to their shareholders, or the interest that is owing to the
public on their bonds and so -forth. But here
were these two systems competing for business, the C.N.R. on the one hand and the
C.P.R. on the other. The CN.R. in the past
ten or fifteen years has spent millions upon
millions of dollars on branch lines and facilitics of all kinds-better equipment of all
classes, more trains and faster trains, more
luxurious cars, hotels, fine offices, radios, telephones-facilities of every character, in order
to secure traffic from somewhere. The Government was back of it ail the time, supplying the funds to enable it to do these things.
What were our C.P.R. friends to do? Were
they to sit down and do nothing? Were they
to lose part of the traffic that they so badly
needed? Were they to allow the C.N.R. to
surpass them in providing facilities and services
for the public? They could not submit to
that. I do not say that the Canadian Pacifie
Railway expended money foolishly. What I
desire to point out briefly is that the CP.R.
had to get into the race for supremacy, to
some extent at least; that it could not allow
the other railway to surpass it in every
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

direction; and if the C.P.R. is involved in this
phase of the problem it is because, in a sense,
it was more or less forced into it.
This brings me to the question how far and
in what fields of activity it is desirable to
apply checks on the management of either
or both of our great railway systems. In this
connection it seems to me that we should
always bear in mind the fact that aIl railways which are not operated for private use
are now commonly classed as public utilities.
While a railway may be owned and operated
by its shareholders, we must not forget that
it exists for one purpose, and one purpose
only-to provide transportation facilities for
the publie. Hence the public have, and really
should have, a paramount interest in it.
This is the view now held and acted upon in
all modern democracies, with the result that
the State, by statute, exercises varying degrees
of control over most of the privately-owned
utilities of this class. We are a long way
from the old theory about private interests.
In the case of publie uti.lities the world over,
the State has not hesitated to interfere for
the publie good.
I am not, of course, suggesting that the State
should interfere with vested rights-and by
vested rights I mean only those rights that
the State itself, with its eyes open, has given
to private interests. I am not suggesting that
the State should interfere with private rights
in such a way as to injure anybody, unless
at the same time it is prepared to make compensation for the injury done.
However, if there is any real opposition to
the principle of control as contained in the
Bill, every member of this Chamber will have
to look a little more closely into the situation and consider this question. I think that
if in connection with this Bill, or any Bill
of this character that might come before us,
it can be shown that parliamentary interference is in the interest of the public-of those
who use the utility-and that at the same
time it is not injurious to the company, then
without doubt Parliament should interfere.
In other words, if the conditions are as I have
stated, we should not stand simply on the
principle that there should be no interference
with private rights. So I submit that when
we come to deal with this Bill in committee,
unless it can be clearly shown that its provisions would be detrimental to the interest
of the great mass of our people, no honourable member should hesitate to put his stamp
of approval upon it. I am sure that every
honourable member will agree with me in
this respect.
As I see it, there are only two new principles in the Bill, two principles which if put

NOVEMBER 4, 1932
into effect will change the existing status of
hoth our railways. One of these principles
relates ta the management and control of
the Canadian National Railway System. We
ail know how it is managed at the present
time. Parliament provided for a president,
with very large powers, and a board of directors. We are familiar with the method of
appointment of those directors, and we are
aware what their duties and functions have
been. Weii, rightly or wrongly-personaly, I
do not know which-there is a prevailing
opinion in Canada that the various members
of the past boarids were not qualified for their
task. They were not railway men; many of
them were flot big business men. I dare say
that -they ail were estimable c4tizens and
successful in their respective spheres, but I
repeat, they were not railway men. 1 mean
that in the sense that they were not big
enough ta manage the affairs of one of the
largest, if not the iargest, of ail railway
systems in the world. Well, it is proposed
that Parliament shouid grapple with that
situation. I need not dweil upon it,' for I
arn sure there is not a member of this Chamnber who believes that we shouid not put an
end ta the present arrangement, which was
established by Parliament and has been maintained by ail governments in this country for
a number of years.
The Bill proposes that there ghall be consti.tuted a tribunal of three trustees in place
of the aid board. I feel almost inclined to
say that personally I should be in favour of
having only one trustee. It is impossible for
a large board *of ten, twelve or fifteen members ta manage properly the affairs of a railway system such as the Canadian National.
Big business the world aver is conducted by
small executive bodies, yet in this country
for years we have depended upon a large,
unqualified. board ta handie the biggest government business that we have. That business naturaiily 1failed, not on account of
the depression that bas lasted for some
years, but, in my opinion, because the system
was wrong. Sooner or later it was bound ta
fail. The board did not have the brains,
abiiity and contraI that shauid be possessed
by those managing a big business of the
character of the Canadian National. If the
tribunal is constituted as the Bill provides,
we ail, i think, shall hope that the present
and future governments will see that no person is appointed ta it on the ground of
political expediency, or on account of what
he bas done for bis party, but that, on the
oontrary, every appoinftinent is made solely
on the basis of fitness for the position.

121

We may find it difficuIt ta agree as ta the
nuinher of members that shauid be appointed
ta the board, and I -have no doubt there wili
be difficulty in this -respect in another place.
Up ta this time the provinces have been represented on the board. Are they going ta
lose their representation? Will there be demiands that the provincial representation
should be continued? Furthermore, labour is
now represented. Is -labour ta hase its representation? 1 understand that aliready a movement is under way ta make certain that no
matter what kind of manage-ment Parliament
finally deoides upon, labour shall have its
representation. There is, of course, nothing
in the Bill forbidding the representation of
labour. However, these are matters that can
veryj weil 'be considered when we have the
measure in comrnittee, where many proposaIs
wiii undoubtediy be made ta us.
The second new principile in the Bihl is the
one that relates ta co-aperation between the
campanies. To a certain extent that is not
new, for the two great railway campanies have
been co-aperating, with varying degrees of
success, for a num-ber of years. Apparentiy
they were forced ta do so tao sorne extent, by
the action taken by this House some years aga.
It will be recalled that they appeared before
us requesting authority ta buiid parallel lines
that would omrpete for trafflo in territory
where there was room for only one uine, and
in cotnmittee we said ta them, in effect, "You
people get together, talk things over and corne
ta a sensible conclusion." T-hat is what they
have done, and with respect ta many other activities besides those that were then under consideration. But their co-operation s0 far bas
been voIuntary. They have taken a course of
action ta which no one objects. Now this Bill
provides for compulsory co-operatian. In
effect it says ta the two companies: "You
have been running amuck these past few years.
It is quite true that you have been ca-operating in some things, but in other respects where
we should like you ta co-operate you have nat
done sa. You have had many disagreements.
Now we think the tirne bas arrived wben you
shouid taik things over and agree ta work tagether in certain activities. If you cannot
agiee we will compel you ta do so under the
means provided." In other words, if the Bill
in its preseat shape 'becomes law, the twa coinpanies must co-operate in the future with
respect ta the use of terminais, running rights,
the avoidance of duplication of certain services,
and variaus other things referred ta in thç
meaeure. That is going pretty far. Just how
strenuous wiii be the apposition ta that particular provision I do nat know.

SENATE

122

At the present time I am not going to express any opinion as to what our final decision
should be, nor would I ask any other honourable member to express an opinion at the
moment, for before we make up our minds we
must give very careful consideration to these
two new principles, the adoption of which is
proposed as essential to at least a partial
I
solution of our transportation problem.
frankly confess that I do not know what decision I shall finally reach, but I may say that
at present I am strongly inclined to agree to
both principles in their entirety. However, as
someone once remarked, "I am from Missouri,"
and I must be clearly shown the facts before
I commit myself. I think I have said all that
I should say at this time. As a matter of fact,
it was not necessary for me to say anything
at all about the Bill, because, as I understand,
we are not asked to approve its principles at
this time. The Bill, I presume, will simply be
given a pro forma second reading, and every
honourable member will be left free to take a
stand for or against any principle or detail.
As I said early in my remarks, I have no
doubt that if honourable members will bring
to the consideration of this problem their
great abilities and ripe experience, the Bill
when ready to be transmitted to another place
will be found to embody the very best united
judgment of this Chamber.
Honourable
lon. C. P. BEAUBIEN:
members, I have but a few brief observations
to offer in respect to this measure, unique in
certain of its provisions, and one of the most
important pieces of legislation ever submitted
to this Chamber.
May I congratulate the right honourable
leader of the House (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) on the atmosphere with which he
bas surrounded the consideration of the
subject-matter of the Bill, and also honourable members on the other side who have
participated in the debate on the care with
which they have sought to preserve that
atmosphere.
I commend the action of the Government.
A grave emergency confronted the country.
The Government rose to the occasion and
with unexampled promptitude implemented
the recommendations made by the Royal
Commission which it appointed to investiga'te
and report on the railway situation.
Probably it is time lost to dwell upon the
genesis of the present unhappy condition of
our railways, but I may be permitted to make
one remark, although it may seem to be at
variance with what I have just expressed as
to the line of conduct which should guide us
in our consideration of this Bill. Of course
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

there is no use in crying over spilt milk, but
perhaps some profit may be gained in the
future if we do not forget altogether the
lessons nf the past.
Honourable members, it is not so very long
ago that a campaign was started against the
Senate. A crusade was engaged in, and a
certain Prime Minister pledged himself to
obtain from newly-appointed senators an
undertaking that they would submit to his
dictation and support any measures that he
m'ight introduce to reform this House.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hear, hear.

I think I can
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
mention this fact without hurting the feelings
of any honourable gentlemen sitting on the
other side. Why? Because when no fewer
than twenty-three bills were presented to
this Chamber to extend unduly and without
justification the branch line mileage of the
Canadian National Railways, the Senate said
no. For taking this course, a course fully
justified by subsequent events, we were vilified
and condemned, and a promise was made to
the country to reform this Chamber. Honourable gentlemen on the other side-and
they were numerous-did not heed the
menace. The Senate stood firm. Will the
country now remember the national service
the Senate then rendered? Would it not be
wise, particularly for our good friends in the
West, to recall that the demands then made
were not in the best interest of the Dominion?
Have we not ample evidence of this to-day?
Who bas the temerity to contend that this
part of our railway history should be altogether forgotten?
But I am not going to dwell upon the
errors of the past, numerous though they
I think the condition in which those
were.
errors have placed both railway systems may
be stated in a very few words. There was
not sufficient traffic for the two railways.
Consequently they entered into a death
struggle to control the traffic.
However, the financial consequences of that
struggle were vitally different with respect to
each railway. Whereas in the case of the
C.N.R. the treasury had to pay the piper, in
the other case the C.P.R. shareholders had
to bear the cost. Therefore it seems to me
that in considering this measure as it affects
both railways, that vital difference between
the two great undertakings should be kept
always in view.
The prime purpose of the Bill is to impose co-operation. This in my opinion is
what makes the measure so exceptional in its
scope. In a word, super-sovereignty is to

NOVEMBER 4, 1932
be exercised over both systems. In the case
of the Canadian National, of course, Parliament, as representing the people, can do what
it likes with its own property; but to exercise
super-sovereignty over the C.P.,R. is something altogether different. I heard it said this
afternoon that present conditions had littie to
do with the submission of this Bill. I heg to
differ with that statement. My opinion is that
unless we were engage-d in a desperate struggle
with the depression now dominating the whole
world, neyer would we consider a law as
drastic as the present measure.
Honourable members may remember a speech
delivered in this House two years ago, flot
without fairly general approval if I rernember rightly. In the course of that speech an
honourable member stated that the then
president of the Canadian National Railways
was a "miracle man"ý-that he had performed
wonders. Well, I do not want to attack the
ex-president of the C.N.R. I think there is
a good deal to be said, if not in justification,
at least in extenuation of his management.
I believe many of my colleagues will admit
that if we were stili enjoying fairly prosperous times, or even if conditions were at
ail normal, legisiation of this kind, however
aecessary it might be, would neyer bave been
proposed, mucli less introduced for our consideration.
May I express to this bouse, in the termis
of the report of the Transportation Commission, the absolute necessity for some 'legislation
of this kind at the present time. In the final
paragraph of its conclusions, -the Commoission,
to my mind, gives to the country at large a
solemn warning which no one should ignore.
This is the paragraph:
We feel coxnpelled, as a matter of public
duty, to strike a serious note of warning to,
the people of Canada. Unlese the country is
prepared to adopt the plan we have proposed,
or some other equally effective measures, te
secure the efficient and economical working of
both railway systems, and thereby flot only
i'educe the burden on the federal treasury but
improve the financial position of the privatelyowned railway, then the onqy courses that would
be lef t would be either to effect savings in
national expenditure in other directions, or to,
add still further to the burdens under which
the industries of the country are sufferinq by
the imposition of yet further taxation. Failing
the adoption of one or other of these courses,
and there are obvious limits to their application, the very stability of the nation's finances-I eniphasize these words.
-the very stability of the nation'a finances and
the financial credit of the Canadian Pacific
Railway will be threatened, with serious consequences to the people of Canada and te those
who have inveffted their savings in that railway.
I have heard this paragraph discussed by
people in the best possible position to judge
its significance. It is difficuit in advance

123

fairly to gauge a danger of a general1 character,
such as an attack upon the financial credit of a
country. 1 remember very well being in
France in 1925 and 1926 when the franc was
falling one, two and three points a day, and
the panie that .prevailed. Why? Because
every man's assets represented by 'the franc
were rapidly melting away. A man worth
a 'million saw lus fortune dwindling by
ten thousand to fifty thousand francs every
day, and ultimately hie had left to his credit
not more than one-4fifth of his fortune. 1
rememiber being in the Ruhir in 1923, when
every iperson I met on the streets had a
basket on bis arm. W-hy? Simply because the
value of his money was vanishing so rapidly
that immediately hie received any payment
hie converted his cash into food. Everybody rwas looking for food. I saw at work
in the fields, digging potatoes, well dressed
men and women of apparently good standing
in the community. Of course, Canada is in
a privileged position; she has virtually unlimited natural wealth. But Canada is young;
she has not the accumulated wealth of the
older countries of Europe, and she cannot bear
the weîght of the Canadian National Railways
if that system is to continue to lean heavily
on the treasury. The warning contained in
this paragraph should strike home to all
Canadian citizens, -for it says to us: "Hark
ye! Whatever you hold to your name, represented by Canadian dollars, be careful." And
we must be careful. This is no time to
minimize the gravity of the situation. If it
were not so, would men of the stamp of the
mexnbers of the Royal Commission, after an
exhaustive investigation of our .railway problem, have sounded such a so'lemn warning as
to the impending disastrous effects which the
national credit would suifer should we fail
to take proper measures? Therefore I submit that this proposed legislation is of such
paramount importance in its far-reaching
consequences 'that it compels our most careful
consideration.
Without doubt this is a drastie Bill. If
we legislate unwisely with respect to the
Canadian National Railways Canada pays
the piper. If we legislate unwisely with respect to the Canadian Pacifie Railway, of
course, first and foremost its sharehoiders
will pay for our errors. But there is something
further involved, and I desire to submit it to
the consideration of honourable members. Not
s0 very many years ago people in the heart
of Europe knew practicaily nothing about Canada, but they wouId readily assert that they had
somne securities of the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company, and that none were better. Those
honourable members who have travelled in

124

SENATE

various European -countries during the last
twenty or thirty years will confirm my statement. Undoubtedly the Canadian Pacifie
Railway is the greatest transportation company
in the world. The welfare of the Canadian
Pacifie Railway is intimately bound up with
the welfare of Canada, and I do not think I
exaggerate when I say that if through this or
any other legislation we should cause serious
injury to the credit of the CP.R., without
doubt our national credit would be correspondingly affected. I do not think this proposition
can be contested for one moment by any one
familiar with the financial markets of the
world.
In closing, may I say that the extremely
grave situation in which we find ourselves
calls for drastic treatment. But let us be
careful. Let us not unwisely place on the
C.P.R. such a serious and unjust handicap
as may in the future prevent it from fairly
guiding its own destinies in its own interest
as well as in that of the Dominion. Financial
centres are extremely sensitive, and I have
already heard it said on very good authority
that the super-sovereignty which this legislation is intended to impose upon the C.P.R.
may very well prove to be a serious and
unjust handicap to its financing operations in
the future. I for one commend most highly
the policy of the Government in giving Parliament the fullest possible time and freedom
to examine and carefully weigh this Bill. It
seems to me that before pronouncing on the
principle involved, it would be wise for the
Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs
and Harbours to give those who are most
directly interested in the matter an opportunity
to appear and present their views. After all,
we cannot treat lightly the interests of the two
great railway systems. Both are tremendous
assets of Canada, and ulpon them largely depend the credit, the prosperity and the welfare
of this country.
Hon. J. S. McLENNAN: Honourable members, I had intended to address the House
at considerable length, but so much with
which I agree has been said by honourable
members on both sides of the House, and
said more forcibly and more convincingly
than I could express similar views, that I
shall be very brief.
This debate in some respects resembles a
debate on the Address, in which we congratulate the mover and the seconder. But
in this instance I must go further and commend all those honourable gentlemen who
have already spoken on the tone or temper of
their addresses. It augurs well for what shall
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

come from this House when we shall have
completed our examination of the Bill in
committee.
We have to thank the honourable member
for Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) for giving
us some extremely interesting information on
this subject. I should like, however, to relieve his mind of the fear that men will be
deprived of their income by reason of the
machinery that is to be set up in order to
bring about economies and make the railroads of Canada more effective. The men to
be appointed to the board of trustees or to
the arbitral tribunal under this Bill should
possess certain qualifications. Those qualifications should be ability, experience, and, I
believe, a sense of humanity; for no matter
how great a man's cold-hearted ability may
bo, it will never enable him to appreciate the
feelings -of those with whom he has to deal.
Sympathy is of the very essence of success
in dealings between man and his fellows.
I trust that the appointees under this Bill,
whoever they may be, will do all in their
power to lighten the burdens of those who
have been unfortunate enough to have as
their employer an over-staffed railroad. I
hope that this can be donc without minimizing the effect of the efforts to achieve a result
which is greatly desired and very necessary
to the country. I assure the honourable
gentleman that this feature will not be lost
sight of, for if it were, the success of the
efforts of all the members of this House
would be greatly diminished.
I come from the East, where the industry of
mining is, I might say, hereditary to such
an extent that the men engaged in it cannot
easily change to another occupation; where
steel-workers for many weeks have seen no
smoke issuing from the chimneys of the open
hearths; where the fishermen, although the
harvest of the sea has been most bountiful,
have been able to secure practically nothing
in return for their commodity. I come from
a province where in an hour or two a gale
swept away about seventy-five per cent of
its chief crop, which was nearing maturity.
Ujnfortunately there prevails throughout
Canada a condition whereby men and women
have been thrown out of employment, a condition for which, until the financial balance
of the world has been restored and established
on a sound basis, there is apparently no great
hope of improvement.
While I join in all that has been said about
the excellence of the Duff report, I should
have liked to sec in it something dealing
more fully with the question of the amal-

NOVEMBER 4, 1932
gamation and unification of our Vwo railroads,
because it is only by unification, 1 believe,
thbat the utmos't degree of effectiveness can
be attained. 1 should have liked to see a
fuller exposition of the variaus suggestions
that have been made in this regard from time
'to time, even though the board had said,
4
'We do not think that týhese are feas4ible at
the present mnoment." 1 arn voicing only
mny own opinions, but I hold thern very firinly.
I arn convinced that if the report had contained an earnest and sound exposition of
the subi ect of unification, those who say that
publie opinion is oppased to any such pl-an
would be very much surprised to find what
a large proportion of the people of Canada
would be converted to it.
Without desiring to raise a controversial
subjeot,-Jor it makes na dîfference to the
argument which party took one side and
which the other-may I allude to what I
regard as one of the most outstanding instances of the conversion of -the publie to, be
found in the pages of modem palitical history.
I refer to what oocurred in relation ta
reciprocity in 1911. No one can doubt th&t
if the Government of that day had gone to
the poils within five or six weeks of the
announcement of its platform it, would have
swept the country. But in the interval before
the elections the party in opposition plucked
up courage, if I may put it that way, and
went about the country telling the people
wbat would resuit; from such a policy, and,
aided by communications from Washington,
it succeeded in carrying the day.
It seems to me that the matter of unification is of sufficient importance ta be placed
fully before the people. Failing this, I should
like to see ià made the firat duty of the board
of 'trustees to immolate t'hemselves in an
endeavour to ascertain what the people think
of a solution which would be much better,
in my opinion, than any of the substitutes
for it that have becn suggested.
The honourable member for Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock) in his speech yesterday used
an expression whicb I thought was inaccurate.
Hle referred to "reckless optimism." Except
for one outburst within. recent years, I do
not think the people of Canada have ever
been optimistie or recless. The general
attitude of the people of Canada as I remember it-and I can go back a good many years
furtber than I care to state-has been one of
steadfast determination. Canada has taken
up one job after another, not because it s0
desired, but because it was the rigbit thing
ta do, and in spite of the fact that many
thoughtful people deemed it beyond ber

125

capacity, she bas always gone on to the
end. That attitude bas been demonstrated
aver and over again since the time wben a
proposal ta improve the navigation of the
St. Lawrence and ta build canais was considered revolutionary. It was demonstrated
during the War of 1812, ta go a long way back,
wben alien armies invaded the two provinces
of Old Canada, in the days wben privateers harried tbe sbipping of the Maritime Provinces. It was dàsplayed in the years
fallowing the Napoleonic Wars, and again
during the political and financial troubles of
1837. Once more, in the forties, when Canada received a set-back by the repeal of the
Corn Laws, the same spirit was manifested;
and it was apparent in 1850, when Lord Elgin
said that bis baving succeeded in securing
a reciprocity treaty had prevented dire resuits.
In 1867 we bad another illustration of it.
Apparently it was not until the first ten
years of this century that we enjoyed a
decade of uninterrupted prosperity. The
attitude of Canadians during aIl these times
bas been one not of recklessness or lightbeadedness, but rather of stubborn steadfastness and fixed resolve that, having put their
band ta the plough, they would go on ta the
end af the furrow.
I think that these same qualities will came
ta aur aid in the present crisis, but, no matter
how bîgb the spirit of the people of Canada
may be, it will avait us little uniess the
utmast care is exercised in dealing witb this
prablem. We bave made two or three false
starts in dealing with aur railways. We cannat afford ta make any mare. However, the
attitude manifested by this House s0 far inspires the hope that we shall arrive at some
conclusion that wil'l be greatly ta the benefit
of Canada in the future.
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX: Honourable members, I shaîl flot detain the House
at any great lengtb, but I tbink that as a
member of the old guard, and onýe wbo during bis tenure of office in the other Bouse hbas
.seen -the variaus railway transformations, I
sbou*ld say a word or two before this Bill passes.
I have listened with a great deal of inýterest ta
the discussion in this Bouse on this very important question. I must congratulate the
Government upon having first referred -the
Bull ta this Chamber. That action sbauld
create an excellent impression in the country.
The debate so far, witb tbe exception of
some words uttered by the very distîinguisbed
leader (Rigbt Hon. Mr. Meigben), about the
administration cf the C.N.R., bas been on a
bigh level.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.

SENATE

126

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I listened yesterday
with a great deal of attention to the speech
of my honourable friend from Alma (Hon.
I take exception to only
Mr. Ballantyne).
one phrase in his practical address. He said
that the dead past should bury its dead, and
that on this vexed question there was no need
for an exchange of brickbats between members
on the two sides of the House. He added that
he had served this country under two governments-the Borden Government and the
Meighen Government. That may have been
a slip of the tongue, for I remember very well
the time when he served under the Laurier
Government. I agree with him absolutely that
we should not waste our time blaming each
other for what bas occurred during the last
twenty years. We were all sanguine about the
future of Canada, all optimists, and with the
great wave of timmigration that was coming to
Western Canada, we anticipated that the
population of the country in the near future
would be sufficient to justify the building of
this huge railway system.
What I meant a moment ago, when referring to my right honourable friend the leader
of the House (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen),
was that I thought he had been unduly severe
upon Sir Henry Thornton. We all know the
old Latin proverb: Donec eris felix multos
numerabis amicos; tempora si fuerint nubila,
solus eris. During the prosperous years
extending from 1922 until recently Sir Henry
Thornton was a man who bulked large, a man
who, for the advertising he gave Canada
wherever he appeared, was well worthy of his
high salary. Opinions may differ as to that,
but those who are familiar with the circumstances will not be too severe in their judgment of Sir Henry Thornton's management.
As was stated by my honourable friend from
Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder), Parliament gave
to Sir Henry Thornton a free hand in the administration of the big property entrusted to
him. It is alleged that he has failed, but we
must remember that everything in Canada and
in the whole world is now at its lowest ebb.
Let us not be too critical. I am old enough
to remember the day when the epithets
"spendthrifts" and "poor 'business men" were
applied to the railway builders who in the
eighties had the vision to construct the Canadian Pacific Railway despite great financial
difficulties. We all are aware that there were
times when they did not know whether they
would be able to get enough money to carry
on their tremendous task. But success came
with the passage of the years, and then these
men were hailed as great Canadians and
nation-builders.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Before the
honourable gentleman goes further, would he
objeot if I asked him to please refer to the
language of mine which he considers was too
severe?
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I have not the
Senate Hansard before me, but I have a copy
of the Ottawa Citizen, which quotes the right
honourable gentleman as follows:
You can look anywhere over the length of
this Dominion, at either coast, in any province,
almost in any city, and see blazing instances
of extravagance, an extravagance which is the
principal chain that ties the feet of Canada
to-day.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That statement is made in other, but no less severe,
language in the report itself.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Possibly so, but it
is not more justifiable there.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is truc.
Hon.

Mr. LEMIEUX: Each of the two
has been in power at certain periods
the last twenty or twenty-five years,

are guilty.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I referred,
not to any party, but simply to the road.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: My right honourable friend has a nimble mind. He knows
that what he said there was directed at those
who sit to the left of Mr. Speaker in both
Houses, and at the man whose services had
been hired by the Government of Right Hon.
W. L. Mackenzie King.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is right.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Then hc contradicts
what his own friends and leaders have said.
I am not trying to interject political remarks
into this debate when I say that my right
honourable friend must accept his full share
of responsibility for this disastrous railway
situation. It is true that the way in which
he handled the enabling legislation built up
a reputation for him as a clear-minded and
forceful advocate, and a great orator. I was
present in another place when members of his
own party, and even the present leader of that
party, feared the exercise of his legal genius
in defending the measure which has now
brought us to such an unfortunate position.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It was not the
measure that did it.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: That is a matter of
interpretation. I would direct the right
honourable gentleman's attention to a state-

NOVEMBER 4, 1932

ment made in 1929 by Hon. Mr. Guthrie, the
present Minister of Justice, who 'was, flot s0
long ago, the leader of the Conservative Party
in the other House. Referring to the opposition of the Lihberal Party to the railway policy
so aihly propounded by my right honourable
friend when hie was a member of the Borden
Government, Mr. Guthrie said:
Nothing was left undone or unuaid by our
opponents. We were told that we were going
to bankrupt the Dominion of Canada. It was

claimed that those roads should be put into
liquidation, go through the Exchequer Court of
Canada and be put on the auction block. If
such a course had been followed there was only
one power in Canada to purchase them, and
that power would have been able to create the
greatest railway monopoly ever created in any
country in the world.
The Liberal opposition to the railway policy

advocated by my right honourable friend was
expressed in the session of 1917, and again
in 1919, *when the Bill finally creating the
Canadian National Railways was aclopted by
Parliament. In passing, I might mention that
Parliament was convened in 1919 for the
purpose of ratifying the Versailles Treaty.
I was leaving with my family for Europe and
I inquired of the then Speaker if I miglit

feel free to go. He said: "Certainly. Parliament has 'been called principally to ratify the
Versailles Treaty." Parliament met early in
the autumn, and I did not return to Canada
until April of the next year. In the meantime the right honourable gentleman had
very ahly prepared legislation that created
the Canadian National Railways. Ten years
later, in 1929, Hon. Mr. Guthrie made this

further statement, to which I hope my right
honourable friend will listen carefully:

Now, when this wonderful Canadian National
Rai]way System has more than justified itself;
nuw that it is rapid]y becoming in the nature
of a great nationaL .assetThat is not the language of my right honourable frîend, who referred to "can extravagance

which is the principal chain that ties the feet
of Canada to-day." Hon. Mr. Guthrie's remarks continue:
-now that we may look forward to a day, not
perhaps in niy lifetime, but in the lifetime of
some here, when this system. will start repaying
the Governnient of Canada a part at lest of
the money it owes to the Treasury, to the day
when it will have a edean sheet, sa it ultimately
will have, in regard to its bonded indebtedness
to the public; now that the system il, in this,
a thoroughly prosperous condition, this GovernmentThat is, the King Government.
-desres to treat it as its own creature.
Whereas in 1919 it tried -to cast it out as

base-born, now it wants to consider it as its
legitiniate offspring, and to profit by its
success.

And in referring to the Canadian National
Railways Hon. Mr. Guthrie also said, "We
on this side *of the House are ahl optimists."
Well, in 1929, and for some years before, we
aîl were optimists, we ail believed that the
Canadian National would 'be ultimately
successful.
Notwithstanding any great admiration for
the right honourable gentleman's legal
acumen, I voted against him in another place
when hie presented that legisiative child to
Canada. I thouglit hie was too optimistic
then, just as R believe hie is too pessimistic
now when hie throws the child back to the
party to which my honourable leader on this
side and I have belonged for so many years.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIýGHEN: I do not
throw the chuld hack; I simply complain of
the treatment it lias received.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: My right honourable friend has not a long memory.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
good.

It is pretty

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Does lie not remember what happened i 1917, when ahl Canada
was deeply concerned over the grave events
occurring on the other side of the Atlantic
ocean, and our soldiers were embarking
at Halifax, Saint John, Montreal and Quebec to j oin the Allied forces? What inspired my right honouirabie friend to bring
in a measure for conscription then? I
was not going to speak of that, but lie will
persist in throwing atones at the Liberal Party
when lie is dealîng with the railway situation.
I consid-er that the conscription issue was only
camouflage; that the real cobject in introducing it was, by divcrting attention, to secure
the passage by Parliament of the Canadilan
N*orthern Railway measure. In my mind's
eye I can still see Mackenzie and Mann, Sir
Clifford Sifton and those who were in partnership with him, and many others, surroundmng
the ministers and even members of the
opposition, begging themn to try to have the
if e of Parliament extcnded for another year.
Now, why was the if e of Parliament extended
by one ycar? And why has the debt of
Canada increased to sucli vast proportions?
My riglit. honourable friend knows the answer,
and it is contained in the Drayton-Acworth
report. He knows that the western provinces
and oné eastern province had guaranteed
hunge sums of money to the Canadian Northern, and that the time had come when these
guaran-tees had to he implemented if the road
was flot to be declared bankrupt. Now, was
the conscription issue not a camouflage used

SENATE
in order that the Canadian Northern measure
might be passed and the provinces relieved
of their burden?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is preposterous.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Shame! Shamel
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: This is not the
time to open up that question, but it will be
dealt with ult.imately, when the history of that
unfortunate period is written. Some of the
best friends of Sir Wilfrid Laurier went to
him in great trouble and said, "If this
measure does not pass, the Canadian Northern will not be taken over, Canada will not
assume the railway debts of our respective
provinces and they will be bankrupt." The
then Government of Nova Scotia had pledged
the credit of that province to Mackenzie &
Mann for almost $10,000,000, and the guarantees of the western provinces were so high
that I cannot remember the figures; I know
they were more than a hundred millions.
That situation was the origin of our miseries,
of our financial troubles with regard to railways; and the right honourable gentleman
was the master mind in having the legislation
passed by Parliament in 1917 and 1919. I
am not trying to punish him by these reminiscences, but why should he question my statements?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I can stand
the reminiscences.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I know that my
right honourable friend has many sins on his
conscience. While the Senate is quite willing
to absolve him, he must promise us that he
will behave better in the future than he has
done in the past.
The honourable
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
gentleman should speak for himself and not
for the Senate.
lon. Mr. LEMIEUX: I have read the
Royal Commission's report with a great deal
of attention. It is, I suppose, the best that
could be obtained under the circumstances,
but I must say that I strenuously object to
the proposal to effect what is nothing more
nor less than a confiscation of the Canadian
Pacific Railway's charter rights. It may be
said that the Canadian Pacifie has obtained
a great deal from Canada. That is true, but
on the other hand the Canadian Pacifie has
given a great deal to Canada in return. The
credit of Canada and that of the Canadian
Pacifie have been for many years almost
synonymous. Now it is proposed that Parliament should say to the C.P.R.: "After all
the trouble we have created we are going
Hon.

Mr. LEMIEUX.

to deprive you of solemn rights that your
charter gives you. You must give up certain
of your powers to a tribunal."
Of oourse, I know that the tribunal will be
composed of men of high character and will
dispense justice, but we already have a Board
of Railway Commissioners, which in my
judgment could continue to give better service than can be obtained under state ownership. I am against state ownership. I remember when, in the days of Sir Oliver
Mowat, the Province of Ontario was the
banner province of Canada, but since it has
adopted the policy of state ownership of
certain utilities, such as the Hydro-my right
honourable friend is a member of the HydroElectrie Power Commission of Ontario-the
credit of the province has declined. And
now that province has to look up to the
Province of Quebec, which twenty-five years
ago was not considered at all comparable
financially with the great Province of Ontario.
I submit that a better system than state
ownership of railways was established by
the Laurier Government when it created
the Railway Commission. What have we
to fear but unduly high freight rates or
unjust discrimination? The Railway Commission is vested with ample powers to proteet the public against any such abuses on the
part of the railways. But we have been under
the impression that state ownership-so flambuoyant to-day in the economie policy of
Russia-would be the cure for all our ills.
I contend that common sense will eventually
prevail and that we shall come back to the
competitive system. Was there ever a corporation more soundly organized and better
managed than the Canadian Pacifie Railway
Company? I am not what is called on the
I am simply an
street "a C.P.R. man."
admirer of the C.P.R. When I travel abroad,
as my friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) said a moment ago, I feel proud of
the C.P.R., just as I feel proud of the Bank
of Montreal and of all our other financial
institutions.
Now, by this Bill we in effect confiscate
some of the statutory powers which were
solemnly granted to the Canadian Pacifie
Railway Company by the Parliament of
Canada. If no alternative is brought forward
I shall not oppose the Bill; I shall simply
bow to the wisdom of the majority. But
let us be very careful in the step we take.
Again I say that I am pleased that the Government bas asked the right honourable leader
of the Bouse to introduce the Bill in this
Chamber. I am confident that it will be

NOVEMBER 4, 1932
thoroughly scrutinized by the Standing Conimittee on Railways, Telegraphs and Haibours.
I hope that eventually we shall find a solution for our railway problem. I ar n ot despondent at ail. I 'believe that this very
acute crisis will pass away. Why, every
week I read in reviews and other periodicals
the history of past crises. They are flot of a
permanent nature. Only a few days ago I
observed that the rnonthly report issued by
the Royal Bank of Canada contained an
article describîng most desperate conditions,
and naturally 1 thought the writer was dealing with present-day conditions in Canada and
ail over the world. But no. Be said that
those desperate conditions fol'lowed the
Napoleonic Wars. We know from our study
of the history of those times how seriously
Europe was affected, and the reaction was
feit even in Canada. So economic and industrial depression is not a permanent condition, and if we keep our heads level, if we
refrain from j oinin-g the hue and cry in -favour
of state ownership, which has already ruined
so many countries, I arn confident we shall
emerge triumphantly from the prescrnt worldwide depression.
I regret it if I have been unduly severe
towards my right honourable friend the leader
of the House. 'I did not intend to be severe;
but the less we engage in open warfare with
one party or the other with respect to presentday railway conditions, the Ibetter for us alI.
Let us attend in the proper spirit the standing
committee to which this Bill is to 'be referred. Let the right honourable gentienian
forget the past, except to remember that on
this very question hie was opposed in the
other Bouse by bis qpresent leader.
Hon. Mr. SHAjRPE: You cannot forge t
conscription.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Conscription was
nothing but a camouflage to cover the Mackenzie & Mann legislation.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: You could flot help
bringing it up again.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: No; I was forced
to 'bring it up. I ar nfot ashamed of my
attitude on conscription.
Hon. Mr. SHAjRPE: You should be.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: No. There were
more soldiers in Canada and in the camps at
the end of the War than there were at the
front, according to a report issued by Sir
Andrew Macphail. But that is past and gone.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Then let it die. Why
bring it uýp again now?

129

Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Very well, but do not
provoke one to revive it.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: It does not take much
to bring that out of you.
Hon. Mr. LEMIEUX: That is ail I have
to say.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bihl
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO STANDING COMMITTEE

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen,
the Bill was referred to the Standing Coinmittele on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGBEN: Honourable
members, it is my purpose in a few minutes
to move that when the Bouse adjourns it
stand adjourned until Tuesday next at eight
o'clock in the evening. But inasmuch as this
Bill is of very great importance, and I know
the standing committee will desire -to sit
and organize its work at as early a date as
possible, I should like, with 'the consent of
the Bouse, to move:
That the Standing Oommittee on Railways,
Telegraphs and Harbours be authorized to sit
during adjournments of the Senate.
Bon. Mr. LEMIEUX: Does the right honourable gentleman refer to the present
adjournment or to future adjournments?
Right Bon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I understand
the rule is that a committee may sit during
adjournment provided the adjournment is not
longer than a week, but that in any other
case it may flot sit except by leave of the
Bouse. I should like this comrnittec to be
in a position to sit at any time between the
present day and the completion of its work
on this Bill. The chairman of the committee
is the riglit honourable senator from Eganvîlle
(Right Bon. Mr. Graham). Be does not
happen to be present, but I feel sure this
would be his desire too, although I have flot
spoken to him on the subjeet. That is why
I have made -the motion.
Bon. Mr. DANDURAND: The eommittee
would neot have its first sitting before
Wednesday.
Right Bon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I did not
know the right honourable gentleman (Right
Bon. Mr. Graham) would be absent. I
thought it would be bis desire that -the comnmittee should sit next Tuesday.
Bon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think my. right
honourable friend would be sure of getting ahl
the members of the committee here on Tuesday evening, when -the Senate *meets again.
The committee could sit next morning.

PACIFIC BILL

FIRST REPORT OF STANDING COMMITTEE

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM presented, and
moved concurrence in, the first report of the
Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs
and Harbours.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Honourable memibers.
before the report is adopted, I would suggest
to the chairman of the committee that he
consider whether it is advisable to reduce
the quorum of the committee to nine. In
view of the great importance of the matter
referred to the committee, it seems to me
the quorum should not be reduced. This is
a time when we require the attendance of all
the members of the committee who are
available.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
if they wish.

Others can come

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: In reply to
my honourable friend, I would, Irish-like,
ask him a question. Suppose the quorum
were fixed at fifteen, and only fourteen members appeared, what then? We could not do
any business, no matter how important it
might be. There is nothing to hinder any
member of the committee from attending the
meetings. In view of the importance of the
Bill that is to go to the committee, it seems
to me wise that, while urging all members
to attend, we should allow as much freedom
as possible in dealing with the measure.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: The reason given by
the right honourable gentleman is the very,
reason why, in my opinion, a reduction should
not be made. I do not think the business
should be done by a small number of members.
The report was concurred in.
Hon.

Ir. DANDURAND.

The Bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

To-morrow.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have no objection to the motion that the second reading
be taken to-morrow. But I confess that I have
not yet read the Bill, and if I happcned to
know of a reason for requesting an adjournment I would request it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am quite in
accord with the position of the honourable
senator. I am sure the Bill will be without
fault or blemish.
CANADA GRAIN BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with BilI 9, an Act to mei(n the
Canada Grain Act (Domestic Grain).
The Bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read a second time?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: To-morrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps this Bill
should be put down for second reading on
Thursday, if the right honourable gentleman
intends that the House should sit on that day.
We may have nothing else on the Order Paper
for Thursday.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is my carnest hope that we shall have work for both
to-morrow and Thursday, but whether we do
depends upon some persons over whom we
bave no control-at least, over whom I have
none. If we know to-morrow that we shal
be sitting on Thursday, I shal have no objection at all to moving to-morrow that the
second reading be taken on the following day.

whether it bias been distributed in this

ACQUISITION 0F CANADIAN NATIONAL
RAIL WAYS
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, after some difficulty I have discevered one copy of the financial statement
of 1917 respecting the Canadian Northern
Railway system and the Grand Trunk Pacifie
Railway, which statement was asked for at
a previous sitting by the honourable gentleman from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain).
I have mucli pleasure in handing it to the
honourable gentleman, and hope that it will
be returned, for it may be of great value te
me later on.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is not the one
I asked for. I have had a copy of that in my
desk and can lend my copy to the riglit
honourable gentleman, if lie wishes it. It
contains only about twenty-five or tliirty pages,
whereas the report I arn looking for was mul
larger, of about 300 pages. It was given to al
senators and members of Parliament when
we were dealing with the Canadian Northern
Acquisition Bill. It is very strange that that
report seems to have vanished into thin air.
As I have said before, it would give us the
figures for the six years between 1917 and-1923,
concerning which there is now a ga4p, for the
Duif Commission does not deal with the
Canadian National Railways development
prior to 1923. All the information contained
in that report would be very valueble just
naw; but I take this opportunity of telling
my right honouraible friend that the gentlemen
who sent that letter of protest, to whicli I
referred some days ago, tliought the information was very vague, and that is why they
signed the protest.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIýGHEN: Wliat I have
presented is the statement of assets and
liabilities of the companies as submitted when
the railway legishation was being deaIt with.
I understood that was the report desireul. If
there is a 300-page report I shal try to procure it. I am always desirous of *making up
for the laxity of honourable members wlio lose
the copies thart are distributed to them in the
first place.

ADMINISTRATION 0F
PENITENTIARIES
Hon. Mr. DANDUlfAND. I should like to
draw the attention of the right honourable
gentleman to the trouble, which amounted
perbaps almoat to a riat, at the St. Vincent
de Paul Penitentiary, and to ask whether,
in vîew of the previous riot at Kingston,
special orders have been given to the wardens
or other penitentiary officials to take additional
precautionary measures against outbreaks. I
have been told that when there is a distuilbance in any penitentiary the news of it
will travel to ail other institutions of the kind,
and will reach them, however distant tliey
may be, as soon as it reaches the new.5papers,
if not sooner. If this lie the fact, I should
like to know wliether the happenings in the
týwo penitentiaries I have mentioned have not
been sufficiently alarming to warrant the
issuance of special orders to every warden to
do whatever is necessary, with a view to preventing uprisings.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: I shall make
inquiries and ascertain if any special orders
have gone out. I have not the least doubt
that precaýutions have ibeen taken, because
the very fact of the neots being bruited about
would in itseif be a reason for precautionary
measures, and no doubt the wardens would
act as required.
We must fot overemphasize the national
con.sequence of these neots of conviots. It is
true Vhey are something to be deplored, and
guarded against. Our peniten-tiaries at this
timue happen to lie very crowded; the numbcrs of inmates exceed the average by very
substantiai percentages; and the difficulties
which 'the department bas encountered under
these circumstances are nlot lessened by the
attention given by the press to iurid atonies of
ex-convicts and to things od that kind.
RADIO COMMfSSION
Hon. Mr. STA.NFIELID: Honourable me*mbers, I read in the press the other day an
article stating that the Radio Commissioners
are. going te travel ail ýover this country, frein
the Atlantic to the Paoifie, to inquire into
radio operations. This country is getting sick
of travelling commissions that are spending
a great deal of money. As for this one in
particular, I do not ?oelieve it is necessary at
ail, for we have in the Radio Brandi of the
Department of Marine very conipetent men
who are quite capable of doing ail that is

required. Yet three commissioners have been
appointed, at salaries of $10,000, $8,000 and
$8,000 respectively, and in addition to that
they will need a number of clerks and other
assistants, new furniture and office space. It
is time to call a hait to unnecessary expenditures of this kind, and I wish the right honourable leader of the House wou'ld bring my
remarks to the attention of some one in
authority in another place, with a view to
preventing the tour of this useless institution,
the Radio Commission.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As I did not
detect a question in the honourable gentleman's remarks, all I can do is commend bis
speech.

INSURANCE ACTS
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I should like
to ask the right honourable leader of the
House whether he bas anything to communica.te to us concerning conferences or negotiations that have taken place between himself
and representatives of the provinces with respect to the insurance legislation passed last
year.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is nothing tiat can be co.mmunicated at this time.
Merely a co.mmenceennt bas been made. I
think it is a satisffactory commencement, but
even satisfactory commencements sometimes
end in very moderate successes.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is the finish
we want.

CANADIAN NATIONAL-CANADIAN

On the motion to adjourn:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Although I
think all honourable members have received
notices of the meeting of tihe Railway Committee, to which has been referred the Canadian National-Canadian Pacifie Bill, it will
do no harm to mention now that that committee is to meet in the Railway Committee
room immediately on the adjournment of the

CANADIAN NATIONAL-CANADIAN
PACIFIC BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Right Hon. G. P. GRAHAM presented,
and moved concurrence in, the report of the
Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs
and Harbours on Bill A, an Act respecting
the Canadian National Railways and to provide for co-operation with the Canadian
Pacific Railway System, and for other purposes.
He said: While on my feet I wish to suggest te honourable members that they might
well attend the meetings of the Railway
Committee. There is a rule of the House pertaining to the attendance at any standing or
special committee of any senator who is not
a member of the committee. That rule is
No. 81, and reads:
Senators, though not of the committee, are
not excluded from coning in and speaking; but
they must not vote. They sit behind those who
are of the committee.
The members of the Committee are not
particular as to where anyone sits, but they
would be pleased to have present any honourable senator who can attend. The railway Bill now before the committee is a most
important measure, and as it may not go to
Committee of the Whole House for discussion in detail, it would be well that all
members should become conversant with the
provisions of the Bill, what the standing committee is doing, and-perhaps this is equally
important-why it is doing se. I think such
knowledge on the part of honourable members will tend to expedite matters when we
come to deal with the Bill finally. It bas
been suggested that I make this statement in
the House.
The Committee intended to begin to-day
the hearing of persons interested, but no one
seems to be prepared up to the present time.
Two or three decisions have been made with
respect to the way in which the meetings
of the committee shall be conducted. One is
that the meetings shall be open, and another
is that all interested parties should be allowed
to appear. It was suggested that when public

NOVEMBER 9, 1932
notice of the committee meetings had been
given, either by way of this statement that
I arn now making or in any other way,
interested parties who desire to appear before
the Committee should be requested to notify
it of the nature of the subjeet-matter with
which they intend to deal.
The report was concurred in.
THE PRICE 0F COAL
Before the Orders of the Day:
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, scime three weeks, ago certain allegations with respect to the price of coal were
drawn to our attention by the honourable
senator from Maisonneuve.
Hlon. Mr. LEMIEUX:

From Rougernont.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I arn sorry
ýthere is "'rouge" in it. The honou.rable gentleman drew to our attention certain allegations
concerning the spread between eost and sale
prices, especially between the cost of imported
coal as landed in this country and tbe price to
the consumer. Later on the subject was again
brought to our attention. I stated on the
first occasion that it was the duty of the Dominion Fuel Booard to keep in touch with coal
prices dn general at ail times, and I intîinated
to the House the nature of the investigations
constantly being made by that board, adding
that it had been asked to give special attention to the prices of imported coal at the
present time.
The Fuel Board has made a report to the
Minister. I have not as yet had the opportunity of reading it, but I arn authorized to
say to the House that, as I intimated when
the question was first brought up, the Combines Investigation Act is applicable to this
matter in the same way as to any other in
which improper interference with trade is
alleged. It wi]l be remembered that I called
attention to the Act, and to its provision that
it could be set in motion by a certain number of persons-the actual number is sixwho request an investigation and represent
that there is need for it. I arn advised by
the Min-ister that, although communications
have been addressed to the department, none
have yet made such a request, in compliance with the statutory provisions. Neyertheless, the Minister bas, in accordance with
the powers vested in him under the Act,
asked the proper officiai of the department
to institute an investigation on the subjeet.
This investigation will no doubt take the
usual course.

133

Hon. R. LEMIEUX:
Honourable senators, I am much pleased with the statement
of the rîght honourable gentleman and with
the decision of the Minister of Labour to
proceed under the Combines Investigation
Act. I have received many letters on this
subjet-in fact I have been deluged with
them-and I have invariably replied to the
writers that they should make their representations to, the Fuel Board, whose chairman is well known throughout Canada; also,
that action could be taken through the Minister of Labour. The difflculty is that under
the Act it is necessary that six persons should
institute proceedings, and during these hard
times it may be that the costs would prevent
some persons from, taki-ng the necessary steps.
I think the Government is well advised to
proceed itself under the authority of the Act,
in order, as I said the other day, to dispel, if
unfounded, the impression now prevailing,
that there is too great a spread between the
price of coal delivered at tbe wharf at Montreal or Quebec and the retail price. I am,
I repeat, well satisfled with the action taken
by the Government.
EXCISE BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGIIEN moved
ihe, seicond reading of Bill 7, an Act to amend
the Excise, Act.
H1e said: The primary purpose of this Bill
is to reduce the excise on, liquors and
cigarettes, in aocordaxsce with the reduction
in the customs duty on these -articles under
the new British Prefevential Tariff. Its other
purpose is to enaibie the niinister to e.,tend
the period from ten to fifteen yeurs when maling allowance for evaiporation losses in, respect
of liquors held in storage.
Under the Conference agreement with the
United Kingdorn the duty on distilled liquors
is reduced fromn $10 to $8. At the present time
the excise is $9. To preserve the same ratio
between the excise and the duty, this Bill
reduces the excise to $7.
The former tariff on cigarettes of 84.10 per
pound and 25 per cent ad valorem bas been
reduced to $3.50 per pound and 25 per cent
ad valorem. This Bill provides for a compensating reduction in the rate of excise. The
aims of the reduction are to discourage
smuggling and to afford our manufacturers a
better chance to compete wîth the man who
rolîs bis cigarettes at home. I believe statistics show that the proportion of the individually rolled cigarettes to the manufactured is
very high and is still growing.

SENATE

It is anticipated that though these provisions may reduce the revenue collected on
these commodities, yet by virtue of the wider
application of the lower duties the revenue
will recover and in the course of the second
year exceed the present collections.

smuggler on oe hand and the home roller
on the othier. The Commons apparently took
no exception to this Bill being passed, and
I do net think that the Senate, hungering as
it is for legislation to digest, should offer
objection.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If I understand
the statement of my right honourable friend,
this is simply consequential legislation.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
none.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Only in part.
For example, in respect to liquors, it is not
necessary to allow for evaporation in storage
in order to comply with the treaty with Great
Britain. Indeed, this legislation is net in any
way binding upon us because of the treaty,
but inasmuch as that treaty reduces the duty
on liquors, it is necessary for us te reduce
the excise to give the home distiller a chance.
It is consequential in that sense. It is not
consequential in relation to evaporation, but
the provision is considered to be only just
and fair; otherwise the man having liquor in
storage would be charged excise upon a quantity which ho docs not have.
Hon. G. H. BARNARD: May I ask the
right honourable gentleman whether any representations have been made to the Government with respect to the position of our
brewers? I understand that the duty on malt
liquors from England is also reduced by the
treaty, but I see no provision in this Bill for
any corresponding reduction in the gallonage
tax on beer. The habit of rolling your own
cigarettes has its counterpart in the permits
for home brewing granted by the department.
Personally, I can see no difference in principle between the two cases, and I should
like to know if any representations have been
made on behalf of the brewing industry.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
In so far as
this legislation is consequential. I beg to point
out to my right honourable friend that he is
putting the cart before the horseRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
will like it butter that way.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
matter of fact, the treaty itself is not yet
before us. Evidently my right honourable
friend assumes that we shall pass it. It strikes
me that this measure is a little in advance of
the trade convention upon which it is bascd.
Right lion. Mr. MEIGHEN: Well, I am
inclined to think that it would be wise for
us to pass this Bill even without any trade
convention, as it reduces the excise to a point
where there is some chance of the home
producer competing successfully with the
Right H'on. Mr. MEIGHEN.

I am offering

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Answering the remarks of the honourable member for Victoria
(Hon. Mr. Barnard), I do net think that the
Government of Canada can legally grant a
man a permit to make beer in his own house.
I understand that if under such a permit he
does brew beer, the courts will hold that he
has rendered himself liable to a fine for baving had in his possession liquor not purchased
from a provincial government.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:
very strong.

The temptation is

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Is the riglt
honourable leader of the House sure the Minister of Justice (Hon. Mr. Guthrie) acquiesced
in this knock at the home roller?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
KInock?
There is no knock at the home brewer.
Right

Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

He is a man

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Has the Governmunt
made any estimate of the reduction in revenue
that may result from this legislation?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Governrment is hopeful that if there is a small reduction in revenue it will be entirely overcome by the second year. I think the honourable member was in the other House when
the late Mr. Fielding brought down his
budget of 1922, which placed a very high tax
on cigarettes. At that time I took the stand,
and urged very strongly, that the tax would
inaugurate an era of smuggling and result in a
reduction of revenue. The Minister of Finance
said if that should be the result the tax would
be reduced at once. He found it to be the
result, and in the spring of 1923 recommended
a substantial reduction; and, inasmuch as the
revenue then increased, his second thought
proved to be correct. If that experience was
in no way abnormal, there is no reason to
anticipate a reduction of revenue under the
present Bill.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: My question was intended to refer to intoxicating liquors rather
than to cigarettes.

NOVEMBER 9,1932
Right ýHon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The same
ýprinciple applies to a consideirable extent.
There is a great deal of smuggling of liquors
right now.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: A great deal.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The bootlegger is penalized by this measure. It is
hoped that by the reduction of his operations
the revenue will flot bie diminished. I notice
the minister has said that he e,»pects a reduction of revenue in the first ycar, but a
recuperation in the next ycar.
The question raiscd by the honourable gentleman from Victoria (Hon. Mr. Barnard)
was not 'brougbt up in the other House, and I
fear that I have not the facts which. would
enaýble me to answer lis inquiry. I should
presume-and in this I amn taking some
hazard-that in respect of beer there is no
reduction in the British preference.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Hon ourable gentlemen, I hope the expectations of the riglit
honourable leader of the House will be
rcalized, but I fear that the reduction is not
large enough to :bring about the rcsults that
lie anticipates. Very high duties on spirituous
liquors are, in my opinion, and in the opinion
of many others, the reason why there is so
mucli smuggling. Geographical conditions in
the Maritime Provinces lend thcmselves to
that trade, which is exceedingly large. The
islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, where
there is an unlimited supply of intoxicating
liquors, are quite near to the Maritime Provinces, whose numero>us harbours and rivers
enable the amugglers to evade the officers
of the law, and it is estimated by some wbo
have given the matter consideration that fully
seventy or eigbty per cent of the liquors cona-umed in that part of Canada pay no duty.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: They must be heavy
drinkers.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: That doca net f ollew.
I said seventy or cigbty per cent of the
liquors consumned in that part of the country.
1 suppose the people there are just as heavy
drinkers as the people in other parts of the
country. I do not think they are any worse
or any bettcr.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Eîghty per cent of the
liquors consumed in Canada?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: In the Maritime
Provinces. Before the War there was littie
or no smuggling, but during the first or
second year of the War the duties were incrcased, and since then smuggling lias incrcased tremcndously. Not only bas the
revenue suffered in consequence of this illicit

traffle, but the people have been dcmoralized
by it. A large sum of moncy is being cxpended, and a small army of men are being
maintained on land and sea for the purpose
cf prevcnting this traffie, but apparently they
are not equal to the task. In my judgmcnt
the only way to prevent smuggling is to bring
the duties back to the levels at whicb they
stood before the War.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: Hear, hear.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, ob.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The revenue miglit
suifer to some extent, but tbe moral character
of the people would be preserved.
I amn pleased to see a two-dollar reduction,
but I should have liked to sec an even greater
one, because I believe it would probably
eradicate this traffie. The legislation passed
under the circumstances of the War, aithougli
it was for s good purpose, really had the effeet
of establisbing sehools for crime throughout
Canada from Halifax to Vancouver, particularly in the Maritime Provinces.
I realize that anything I say on this occasion will not affect the lcgislation before us,
but I think this an opportune time for members from the provinces by the sea to place
their opinions on record and endeavour to
educate the public so tbat they will look for
the introduction of legislation to put a stop
te this very great cvii. That is my reason for
addrcssing these rcrnarks to the House at the
present time. I believe tbat under present
conditions, even if the preventive officers
could prevent smuggling, the quantity of illicit
bome-brew, which is nearly as bad, would be
incrcased. We should, in my opinion, lose no
opportunity of trying- to educate public opinion along the lines I have indicated, so that
the Government would feel justified in stilI
further reducing the duties in order to wipc
out this illicit traffie. Before the duties became bigli wc lied no sucb thing as smuggling
or homce-brewing, and conditions were very
much better than they are now.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:
Honourable
members, I do not wish to toucli upon the
moral aspect of this great question, but would
refer rather to the question raised by the
bonourable member from Kings (Hon. Mr.
Hughes) rcgarding the loss of revenue. If
honourable members will turn to the House
of Commons Hansard of November 7 they
will find that Mr. Ryckman, the Minister of
National Revenue, bas this te say:
I arn sorry to, tell the committee that we
would expect, on the basis of the current business for the twelve-month period, a drop in
revenues of between $7,000,000 and $8,000,000.
This is a change which bas been made as a

13f,

SENATE

resuit of the trade agreements. The request
was made, and we aceded, in an effort to f ulfil
our part of the bargain. Through benefits from
other arrangements 1 hope that in time any loss
wiil be fully made Up.
I think that answers the honourable gentieman's question.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: May I just
point out that that estimate refers flot only to
the effect of tbis Bill, but aiso, and in much
larger measure, to the effect of the trade
agreements.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I think the hionourable gentleman is in error. I tbink that the
loss as estimated by the Minister of National
Revenue was $1,500,000 or $2,000,000 on the
custoins duty, and the remainder would bo
on the excise duty.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Perhaps. I
do net know. It is a matter of proportion.
The motion ivas agreed te, and the Biil was
read the second time.
CANADA GRAIN BILL
SECOND READING

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 9, an Act to, amend
the Canada Grain Act (Domiestic Grain).
He said: Honourabie members, a.s we al
knew, the grain of our country-I have speciai
reference te Western grain-is transported
through a system of elevators as weii as by
direct shipment from the point of production
to the point of destination or of expert; and
even wh'ere direct shipment is resorted te,
the grain may go t.hrough elevators at the
eastern ports. The whoie administration of
our grain trade, se far as Dominion supervision is concernied, is in -the hands of the
Minister of Trade and Commerce,' but the
supervision is deiegated in the main te a
Board of Grain Commissioners who have
head offices at Winnipeg, and who are given
speciflc powers and duities under the Grain
Act. Amung their duties is the regulatien
of the many charges made in connection with
the handling of grain; fer storage in elevators,
weighing, dockages, and se on. Under the
Act as it stands now it is the duty of the
commissioners te fix each year the charges
that the -elevator cempanies may make for the
varions services rendered.
Once the coinmissieners have set ýthe rates for any year
there cannot be any revision until the foiiowving year, when, prier te the mevement of
grain, the commis.sioners sit again and dotermine what the charges shall be.
In acccsrdance with tha-t procoedure the comnjnîssionors sat this year for the boaring- of
Hon. Mr. M'acARTHL'R.

comýpiaints, or any other evidence that might
be given te enable them te decide what shouid
ho -the proper scale of charges fer the ensuing
year. I understand that výery littie in the
way of compiaint was advanced te them, and
that there was ne request for an investigation
or even for a general reductien in rates.
However, in view ef the faet that the
farmer is receiving this year a depiorabiy low
return for his product-a return se low as te
bo unprecedented-and the acornpanying fact
that Iast year's scale of charges, which I understand was continued this year, seems te be
ra-ther high in proportion te wha.t -the farmor
receives, it bas been deemed wise te alter the
Act te enabie the Commission te vary its
charges in mid season, if it se desires. It
must be manifest, of course, 'that Parliament
itseif couid net weil sit in judgment in a
matter of this kind and fix the charges;
that is cieariy the funiction of the Commission.
The Minîster and the Gevernment feit that
the cemmissioners should have power te reinvestigate the subjeet, if they deemod it
wvise, and that possibly, if they did se, lower
charges might ensue. 1 have ne reasen te
think the present scalle is high, except that,
if my undc'rstanding ýis right, it is the same
scalle that appiied when wheat was seliing at
$1.50 a bushel. Wheat is now et iess than
fifty cents a bushel, and as the farmoer's return. is co>nsideraby iower in proportion, it
would seom at first sight that the comimissieners mighýt weii review the charges.
The Grain Commissioners, as I haveo said,
were net prosentcd with compiaints, and
therefore feit thicy ought te retain charges
wvhich apparent]y wvore satisfactory te ail concerned. I do net know at whose instance this
legislation is introduceci; perhaps it is at their
own; but it dees seem te me that nothing
should tie their hands this year if they dosire
te effeet anv reduction in rates.
lion. Mr. CASGRAIN: Would any reduetiens apply te govornment olevators oniv, or
te private eioe ators as xxeil?
Right Hon. Mr. ME'IGHEN:

Te ail.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN_ý:
Private cievators
have issued bonds. Cao the commissioners
reduce the interost on them tee?
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: They cao
take the interest and the fixity of the intorest
inte consideration.
Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND:
We have had
the Grain Ac' before uls often, and this
Chamber lias on more than one occasion
given attention tu the questionm of fix\ing rates.
I do net remnember the exact situation with

NOVEMBER 9, 1932
respect to the ownership of elevators at Fort
William and Port Arthur, but I have a vague
recollection that both the large railway comnpanies and the pools have their own separate
elevators. The charges fixed by the Grain
Commissioners apply to ail the companies,
and the object of this Bill is simpiy to permit
a variation in those charges in mid season.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I arn very sorry that
thîs Bill was not brought down earlier in the
season, because I imagine that a very large
quantity of grain is now out of the farmers'
banda and that the dealers will ha the ones
to receive the most benefit from legîsîstion of
this kind. I have no objection whatever to
the Biii being given second reading now, but
object simply to the delay in bringing the
measure before us. If a farmer left grain in
storage for twenty months, the value of it,
at present prices, would almost be equalled
by the storage charges, at one cent a month.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I was hoping
that the honourable gentleman would give us
some explanation of why the farmers' organizations, with which hie has been so closely
identifled, did not appear before the Commission this year if they feit that the rates
were high.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Be cause tbey own
elevators.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is a
condition that we cannot put out of our sight.
The organizations own a large numnber of
elevators, and I suppose on that account they
have interests on both sides of the ledger.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I do not think that
makes very much difference, because the
organization in Manitoba has just been declared bankrupt.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: That is the one in
Manitoba, but not those in the other provinces.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: No, but they are pretty
near to the same thing. It does not seem
that the organizations would be greatly interested in the storage rates. 1 think the farmera
thought they would not get a reduction. Probably thîs Bill was prepared at the instance of
the Minister, who realized the seriousness of
the situation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I did not
know the organization was flnancially bankrupt, though I thought it was poiitically
bankrupt eleven years ago.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

DUPLICATION IN RAILWAY SERVICES
On the motion to adjourn:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I desire to
nootify honourable members who were not at
the Railway Committee meeting this morning
that the Committee is meeting again immediateiy after the adjournment of the House.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: On the 2lst of
April iast I had the honour of moving in this
Chamber:
That in the judgment of the Senate, in order
to give immediate relief by eliminating some
duplication in the service of the Canadian
raiIways, pending action by the Commission
presently investigating Canadian raiiways, a
committee compoeed of an equal number of
present officiais from the Canadian Pacifie
Railway Company and the Canadian National
Railways, be formed, and eleet an umpire.
14ailing to agree in their choice, the Supreme
Court of Canada shall appoint this umpire.
Ia there any reason why that suggestion could
not be carried out now? It would involve
no expense, aside from the fees that might
be paid to the umpire, for ail the officiais
would be in receipt of saiary. And as for an
umpire, the Government could appoint the
present Chairman of the Raiiway Board, who
I underatand is a very able man.
At the present time the country is loaing a
million dollars a week on the Canadian
National. Therefore, why ahould something
not be donc pending action on the report
of the Transportation Commission? We are
spending a lot of time on discussion in the
Raiiway Committee, and it reminda one of
Nero flddling while Rome was burning. So
I say, why not act on this suggestion while
our deliberations are going on? No harmi
could ha done by that. In any event, we
have no assurance that our deliberations will
have a final resuit. The Royal Commission
sat for ten montha, and its report was made
some weeks ago. In ail this time the deficits
have been mounting up et the rate of a
million dollars a week, and stili nothing is
being donc to remedy the situation.
I amn not claiming any credit for the motion
that I made last April. The idea was not
mine, for I read it in the Montreal Gazette.
The proposai is a simple one, and it seema to
me that its adoption would immediately
solve some of the problema arising from
duplication of service. The committee mcmbers and others keep harping on the subi ct
of passenger trains, but it is the freight traffie
that bringa in moat of the revenue. Pessenger
receipts on the Canadian National represent
only twenty per cent of the total gross
receipts, and on the Canadian Pacifie only

SENATE
twenty-five per cent. Now, if a committee
were formed, such as I suggested, the members of it would know all about the difference
between freight and passenger traffic and what
should be done about the service now being
duplicated in so many places in Ontario and
elsewhere. Our discussion on this Bill may
last a long time, and if my suggestion were
adopted in the interval we might save
millions of dollars.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Would the
honourable gentleman read the motion again?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
That in the judgment of the Senate, in order
to give immediate relief by eliminating some
duplication in the service of the Canadian
railways, pending action by the Commission
presently investigating the Canadian railhaysThe Commission has made its report. but
action is still pending.
-a committee composed of an equal number of
present officiais from the Canadian Pacifie and
the Canadian National Railways, be formed,
and elect an umpire. Failing to agree in their
choice, the Supreme Court of Canada shall
appoint this umpire.
If, say, five Canadian National and five
Canadian Pacifie officials were appointed to a
committee, they could agree upon an umpire
who would bu a much better choice than any
lawyer could bu, for their nominee would
have a wide knowledge of railway affairs.
The chairman of the proposed new board of
trustees mnay have great legal ability, but
net know much about the railway business.
Why can we not have a committee of railway officials appointed now, se that they
might appoint an umpire and start us on the
way to a reduction in the deficit of a million
dollars a week?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman will observe that his motion
was merely a recommendation to the two railway companies to do certain things. Of
course the motion came to their attention,
but apparently they did net follow the suggestion.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The motion did not
pass the Senate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman's motion would, if proceeded
with, require a Bill which would be subject
to as much delay as the present measure.
The honourable gentleman bas apparently
suffered from what I myself have often suffered
from, namely, fai-lure on the part of others
to value one's thoughts. It is just another
case of wisdom being blindly passed byof flowers that blush unseen.

THE LATE SENATOR ANDREW
HAYDON
TRIBUTES TO IIIS MEMORY
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEICHEN: Honourable members, as undoubtedly all are already painfully aware, we are called upon in
the middle of the session to lament the death
of one of our number. The Honourable
Andrew Haydon, member for Lanark, passed
away this morning.
Senator Haydon, because of very severe disability, accompanied unfortunately by very
great suffering, had been unable to take his
place among us for several months, and could
attend but irregularly for a number of years.
His friends in the House watched his gallant
fight against an insidious and powerful foe,
and in deep sympathy and with the kindliest
feelings they have now regretfully witnessed
his defeat.
The senator was, as it is the happy lot of
most of us to be, a son of Canada. Born
of parents of the class that form the most
stable citizenship of our country, ho passed
his early years in the midst of a prospeirous

NOVEMBER 10, 1932
agricultural cornrunity not far frorn the
city of Ottawa. His education followed the
same lines as that of the more fortunate
youth of Canada who are alTe to avaiT thernselves of our scbolastic institutions. Having
taken a course at Queen's, lie was a double
medalist. Hie was one of the rnost distinguished
graduates of bis university.
His activities were mainly in the law, and
as welT-in fact mucli more assiduously than
most of us-bhe devoted hirnself to that branch
of public affairs cornmonly known as polities.
With the party to whicb lie became allied on
reachmng years of maturity lie identified hirnself whole-.heartedly and with exceeding
vigour, until lie rose to be one of its rnost
trusted councillors. Those wbo were closely
associatcd witb him in tliat respect wilT be
alTe to speak of bis capacity and fidelity.
No one could be a member of tbis House,
even for the short tirne 'that it bas been rny
good fortune to be here, without being impressed witb the fact that very few members
had endeared tbernselves to tlieir fellow
members and their intirnate associates so
mucli as had Senator Haydon. Undoubtedly
bis personal relationships were of the tenderest and rnost enviable kind. Hie ived truc
to the dicturn of tlie Australian philosopher:
There are two things that stand like stone:
Kindness in another's trouble, courage in one's
own.
On behaîf of the members on this side of
the flouse, who were opposeed to hlm in
public life, I desire to express our sense of
sincere regret at bis passing, and our deepest
sympa*thy with bis widow and son.
Hon. ýRAOUIL DANDURAND: Hýonourable
senators, it was not rny privilege to bie associated intimately with our departed friend
in bis carcer at the Bar and in politîcs until
lie entered tbis Cliamber. I learned to appreciate bis virile quailities during the seven or
eiglit years that we were thrown together in
debate. Hie bad a clear mmnd, hroad culture
and a felicity of expression that we all admired. To express rny view of his fine qualities, I can perhaps do no better than say
that 1 admired bis strong convictions, bis
rugged character, bis devotion, bis sincerity
and loyalty, and bis rnodesty bordering on
timidity.
H1e rendered valuable service to Queen's
University and was one of its trustees. We
know in wbat esteern lie was held in tbe
community wlierein lie dwelt for nearly
thirty years. I cannot allow this occasion
to pass without putting on record an event
which sbows bow bighly he was regarded.
On the sixty-fifth birthday of our departed

139

friend a special tribute was paid to him by
a large group of his friends. H1e was presented with a loving-cup of silver and a set
of the publications of the Champlain Society,
including many original records of the principal early Canadian travellers and explorers.
A deputation consisting of the Venerable
Arclideaoon Snowdon, Sir Perey Sherwood,
Chance<lor Francis H. Gishomne, and Dr. O.
D. Skelton made the presentation to Senator
Haydon at his bouse, on behalf of the group.
The gifts were accompanied by an illurninated addresss in the following words:
To Hon. Andrew Haydon, M.A., LL.B.:
On the occasion of your sixty-fifth birthday,
a few of your friends wish to be perrnitted to,
express to you the warm regard and affection
which your unvarying kindness and generous
self-spending have inspired, and the deep respect
and admiration which they hold for your outstanding ability, your fine integrity, and your
univearied services to church and state. They
trust that you will find in these publications
of the Champlain Society a token of the interest
you have always taken in the history of the
pioneer days of our country, and in this lovingcup a symbol of the devotion of the countless
friends who hope soon to see you fully retored
to health.
On the day of the presentation 1 perused
the papers representing public opinion on
both sides of politics and I found thern unanimous in striking a syrnpatbetic note as to the
value of the services rendered to his coinrnunity hy the late Senator Haydon. They
recognized bis sterling qualities of citizenship.
Hie served his cornrunity well, and I arn only
echoing the opinions of those who knew hlm
best in saying that lie was one of the fincst
characters that the Dominion of Canada bas
produced.
Riglit Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: Honourable members, rnay 1 add a word to the
dignified and wortby tributcs paid to the late
Andrew Haydon by the leaders on both sides
of the flouse? Sorneone lias said that the
man or woman who lias one real friend is rieb.
I think that if honourable members analyse
that statement carefully, putting the empliasis
on the word "real," tbey will corne to the
conclusion that the statement is correct. To
me Andrew Haydon was always a friend. We
had our differences on occasion, but they were
friendly differences and did not at alI mar our
deep friend.ahip. I knew &nator Haydon
wlien lie was a very young man, and from
lis early days-days not so early for metbrougli evil as well as good report, Andrew
ivas always a truc friend. To me bis loss is a
lieavy blow. Although he was a very quiet
man, a man of few words, I knew tliat I could
always look to birn when I needed a friend.

SENATE
In addition to being a great friend and a
splendid type of citizen, Andrew Haydon was
a man of unique literary achievements. H1e
published more than one book. I have in
my library copies of thema presented to me
by the late senator. He was devoted, if I
may say so, nlot so much to Ottawa as to old
Lanark.
His reminiscences concerning that
very richly endowed part of Ontario were
always most interesting to listen to. It was
when discussing that subi ect in conversation
that Andrew Haydon could talk more freely
than at any other time.
I often wonder why-perhaps this is moralizînýg too much-I often wonder why men of
advanced age, like myseif and others, are
permitted to dling to life, with its duties and
struggles, while young stalwarts like Andrew
Haydon are taken away. He was a man whose
every step had been upward, and who a few
years ago seemed to have before him many
years of usefulness, not only as a public man,
but as a devoted citizen of this Canada which
he so much admired.
I might say that
Andrew Haydon neyer requested to be made
a senator. This I know. The Prime Minister
selected him without any solicitation on bis
part, and he must have been very much
surprised at the news of bis appointment.
In reference to the statement rend by the
leader on this side of the B-ouse couceruing
the presentation to Senator Baydon, may I
mention something that sheds a littie further
light and shows the high regard in which he
\Vas lield by manx' people in this part of the
country? I was one of those who received
correspondance in reference to this prcsonlation. Wben the daY of the preseutation
arrived I received a latter from Venerable
Archdeacon Snowdon stating that those in
charge had received more money than wvas
required for the purpose they had in mind;
that people whom, they had nieyer approached
had heard of the presentation and had sent
their contributions as an evidenca of their
desire to assist in honouringý so noble a mian.
I mention this on]y to show that Senator
Haydon, in spite of bis retiring disposition,
had a far stronger grip than most men have
on the hearts of friends.
I shall miss Andy Haydon as a warm friend
to whom I could always go when I wished
Io discuss matters of any nature whatsoever,
and from whom I would always get advice
that I greatly appreciated. Andrew Haydon
wi]l be missed in the city of Ottawa, in this
I{ouse, in literary cîrclcs, and1 in his Cburch.
As an almost lifelong friend, I heartily join
with ail honourable members in expressing
sympathy w'ith the family of the late senator.

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honourable
senators, I have received a short letter that
I suppose it is my duty to read. It is as

follows:
(Translation)
Quebec, NKov. 11, 1932.
Hon. Senator J. P. B. Casgrain,
Ottawa, Ont.
Dear Sir,
We are enclosing herewithl eopy of a letter
we are to-day writing to Hon. E. B. Rycknian,
MNiniister of Cugtomsý, regarding the new tax on
cigarettes.
Would you be kind enough to, make an inquiry in the House on this subjeet, so that dealers may know what to rely upon? Otherwise
there would be a considerable loas to those who
have stock on hanýd.
Thanking you in advance for your kind
attention to thir, matter, we are
Yours vary truly,

NOVEMBER 16,.1932
(Text) That is merely asking me to read
a copy of the following letter, whioh was
enclosed:
Quebee, Nov. il, 1932.
Hon. E. B. Ryckman,
Minister of Custoe,
Ottawa.
Dear Sir:
As the Government is now redueing the tax
on cigarettes, will you ba kind enougli to let us
know if the Gevernment intends to remit te the
tobacco manufacturera the difference of the tai
already paid on the stocks of cigarettes the
jobbers have actuaIly on hand?
As you are aware, the cigarettes are already
sel]ing at -the new reduced prices, and if the
manufacturers cannot ff-emit to jobbers the
difference of price on the cigarettes they have
in stock, it wiIl be a considerable loas that the
jobhers wilI flot ha able to sustain in the actual
critical business situation.
If the Government does flot remit the difference of the taix paid on stocks on hand, we
would suggest that they put the new tai in force
only on December l5th, so as to give the jobbers
the necessary time ta sali the stocks of cigarettes they have on hand.
Your kiud attention to this matter will
greatly oblige,
Yours very truly,
Rioux & Pettigrew Limited,

I have been asked to read this letter and
I have done so, but 1 must confess that I do
net know much about the subject-matter.

HON. SENATORS O. TURGEON AND
L. A. WILSON
RECOVERY FROM ILLNESS

Riglit Hon. G. P. GRAHAM: Honourable
sanators, from time te timne it bacomes aur
sad duty te pay tribute te the memory of
some colleagua who lias passed frein our
midist. For the last few days I have been
reflacting on the thought that possibly it
would ha welI to take advantage of the opportunity we sometimas have of saying a faw
kind words to some of our number who have
coma back te us efter long siegee of ilîness.
With thise thought in mind, I should like te
offer my congratulations te my good friend
from Gloucester (Hon. Mr. Turgeon), who
is not in the House at the moment, but who
returnad to us a short tinie ago after having
been iii for a long time. When he came baek
he tolýd me that he feit as well as on the day
ha first met me. If th-at be se, lie is well.
I would offer congratulations also te our
old friend fromn Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Wilson),
who lias been 111for sema years, but is back
with us this evening, seemîngly as full of life
as ever.
I think -we should extend our hast wishes
and handshakes ta aur good friends who return te us in circuinstances like these, and net
reserve aIl aur kind words for t'he sad
occasions.
Hon. LAWRENCE A. WILSON: Honourable senators, it is unnecessary for me te say
that I a=n -ighlypleased at my right honofurable friend's kind remarks. His greeting is
alîneet sufficient compensation for the illiness
from which I have suffered for the last two

years.
During my long and enforced absence from
this Chamber I jotted down saine figures
conccrning our national revenue, and with
your permission I will read thein, for I believe they xnay be useful. But before doing
that, may I say that I have read every line
of the Senate Debates ef the last two sessions,
and I have ýbeen amazed at the profundity
and knowledge of my colleagues. I neyer
before had read our Hansard in this w-ay, and
I found that the debates contained in it wcre
very interesting indeed. Those who know me
best know that I arn sincere in what I say,
and I wish it ta be understovLd that I arnhi
cere when I state ià gave me great pleasure
to realize that we have sucli outstanding men
in this Chamber. There Ivas ane bill-if I
remember aright, it was a railway bill--that
came fromn the Commons and received ne
fewer than seventy-two amendmert3 before it

SENATE

14z

wvas passed here. I concluded that if the Soenate fonnd so many amendmnents necessarv,
there must ho something radi.--iliy wrong eIseivhere. Because the mnembers in another place
are amenable to their electorate they Fomietimes pass bills which they rely on the Senate
te roject. They know very w.'il that you bonourable gentlemen are perfectly indopendent.
I wondored at the time why the Sonate
should ho malignod by certain dumh-bellN on
the street. Many people imagine that those
who enter the Sonate must pass through a toîl
gale. Well, I refuse te believe that any
bonourable member ever paid one copper te
occupy a seat in this Chamiber. I think it
behooves us te lot sucb people know, once
for alI, that net a single member of this
Chamber ever had to use influence, much less
cash, to take bis seat. I confldently believo
that bonourable members are far above such
base coniduet. I arn net trying te justify my
own position, but certain insinuations have
heen made hy so-called friends of mine-and
to-day real fricnds are almost as scarce as
white crows. I want those "friends" te know
that I did net seek nomination to the Soate.
Wheon the seat to which I was suhsequiently
appointed became vacant through the death
of my predecossor. I went te a certain gentleman-ho now sits in this House-anid told him
that inasmuch as I represented a riding in the
Commons and did net wish te continue in the
pclitical world, 1 was willing te efface mysoîf
iri bis favour. He thanked me. However, another bonourable senator died and the gentleman I have just mentioned was appointed te
the vacancy.
I may add that twe weeks befere hoe passed
away 1 went to Sir Lomer Gouin and said te
hiîn, "As yen have ret.ired from the Coinmens, would yen net like te return te Ottawa
as a member of the Sonate, where a man of
yenr ripe parliamentary exporionco and preven
administrative ability ceuld ho of groat
service te the country?" Beyond thanking
mie, ho said vcry littîn. I found biter that his
nomination might not have been approved in
somne quar-ters.
But lot me go further. I was disgusted by
the harangues from botb sides of the flouse,
and hy the personalities that were indulged in
by certain members, and I resigned.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: We can move the
adjourniment of the flouse.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes; but wc have no
right to reply to the many interesting statemoents the honourable member is making.
With respect to the financial condition of the
country, he will have many opportunities during the session to say whatever he pleases,
but at the presenit time, as 1 understand th(,
rules-Mr. Speaker will correct me if I arn
m-rong-he bas no righit to mako ain extended
statement of any kind. If he wishes to raise
a question of privilego hc may do so, but
at this stage of our proceedings, I submit,
the honourable gentleman is out of order in
inaking an extended speech on n subject that
is flot formally before us.
Hon. Mr. WILSON: Honourablo members,
a~s I may not be able to attend any furtber
.sittings for some tirne, I should liko to prescrit
to the flouse and the country a few figures
whieh I have prepared. I will be very brief.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I regret 1 cannot permit the honourable member to proeeed except hy unanimous consent.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Go on, go on.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Mr. Speaker, if the
hionourable gentleman will confine himself to
a statement of figures to which, I iinderstand,
hie bas given considerable study, as xve have
nothing else before us, prohably we shall be
\,ery glad to hear him.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hcar, hear.
Hon. Mr. WILSON: Honourable members
are awvaro that recently wve have hiad to
borrow 860,000,000 in New York, and that a

loan for $80.000,000 bas just been fboa.ted.

1

arn pleased to know that that loan bas been
fully subscribed. I venture to say that these
l)orrowings would not have been necessary if
the Department of National Revenue bad
been empowered to miake the following rules:
With regard to cummun and preferred stock,
i companies at present make reports to the
Gov erniment annually. giving the namies of
'hareholders and the amouints paid to them.
But hankers and brokers bold in their names
some of those stocks for clients. Tbey sbould
inako a similar report showving the amounits
paid to their clients. In many cases stock is
held by nominees. We will say Johin Smuts
holds stock, in trust or othewise, for the real
owner; therefore Johin Smuts should ho coinpelled to make a return to the Goverument
stating for whom ho is holding the stock.
As to bearer bonds, wben the coupons are
deposited in the hank, the bank should deduet
income tax at. say, the minimum rate and

NOVEMBER 16, 1932
send to the Government a report of the
amounts so collected, acoornpanied by the
names of those cashing the coupons. Then
the Governmnent could compare these lists
with the income tax returns.
Should coupons corne from foreign countries, the Government would refuse payment
unless accompanied by a declaration. As an
example, Canadian holders of Quebec Government bonds payable in sterling have to
sign a declaration that they are flot subI ect
to British income tax; otherwise the normal
British tax wouId be deducted.
An issue of $100,000,000 at 5 per cent
means that the (iovernment of Canada pays
the holders of the bonds 85,000,000 annuaIly.
Hlow much of this is reported in income tax
returns? How does the Government check
the coupons cashed on ail outstanding bonds?
I venture to say millions are lost annually.
The gross funded debt of Canada is $2,926,265,698, and the interest paid by the Government ini 1931 amounted to $122,229,457.
How do you expect the Governmcnt to get
the money if some of the people are evading
the income tax?
These tax dodgers may be described as
humain icebergs, or bloodless sharks. Go after
themn like a panther. Open their strong
boxes and force them to pay their dues to
the nation.
Moreover, there is a provincial succession
duty law under which execultors must niake a
true report to the local government. The
Federal Government could sec to it that
nothing has escaped it during the lifetime of
the will-maker.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Honourable members, I should like to move the adjournment of the debate.

143

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: The diversion
of the water of the Great Lakes system
through the Chicago Drainage Canal has been
the subject-matter of litigation before the
Supreme Court of the United States of
America. The question is at present sub
ludice, as four of the lake States are seeking
a ruling from the Supreme Court of the
United States regarding the progress of the
construction of sewage disposal works.
So far as action by the Government i.s concerned, it should be pointed out that a treaty
was signed at Washington on the 18th July,
1932, by plenipotentiaries' named by Hi.s
Majesty the King in respect of Canada and by
the President of the United States of America,
and that article viii of that treaty contains
measures dealing with the diversion of water
at Chicago.

opium and other dangerous drugs from one
country to another.
At its second meeting, in February, 1920,
the Council of the League decided to summon

an international conference of health experts
to draw up the constitution of the Health
Organization authorized in a paragraph of the
Covenant, which declares that the members of
the League shall "take steps in matters of
international concern for the prevention and
control of disease." When the conference met,
in April of that year, it was faced with the
menace of the typhus and relapsing fever
epidemies whieh had originated in Russia and
spread into the eastern marshes of Poland.
To meet this scourge it was recommended that
be
Epidemic Commission
a temporary
appointed to work with the health administrations of Europe, and a cordon was established which proved a salvation to neighbouring countries.
Early in 1923, thanks to the International
Health Board of the Rockefeller Foundation,
it was possible to extend greatly the epidemiological intelligence work of the League.
The Foundation agreed to contribute $32,840
a year for five years towards the carrying on
of this work, and a branch office was opened
in Singapore for the study at close range of
the plague and cholera centres of the world.
At this office telegraphie reports are received
each week from the sixty principal ports of
Asia, Australia and the east coast of Africa,
concerning the number of cases of plague,
cholera and smallpox, and the deaths from
them. Through the kindness of the French
Government this information, which is of
tremendous importance to all shipping countries, is broadcast immediately. Full reports
are made directly to Geneva as well, and for
[his service we have again to thank the
Rockefeller Foundation.
Owing to the progress achieved in immunization against infection by microbes, the use
of sera is becoming one of the most important
weapons at the service of science for combating infectious diseases. In order to make
this weapon fully effective it is necessary to
get international agreement on methods for
measuring the antitoxic action of different sera.
Some way of standardizing units and methods
employed had long been considered desirable,
but it was exceedingly difficult to obtain sufficient co-operation from different laboratories.
After the War the probleni seemed to be
intensified, but it was finally solved through
the agency of the League Health Organization.
Every one will admit that the traffic in
women and children is a problem to the
solution of which the new machinery provided by the League of Nations may be
properly applied. Against so widely ramified

an evil the isolated efforts, however strenuous,
of individual states cannot be entirely effective.
Since its foundation the League has been
actively engaged
in mitigating
human
wretchedness caused by the War. On one
point, that of returning prisoners of war to
their homes, it has attained complete success.
The League has also engaged in the rescue
of the deported women and children in the
Near East. Owing to the protracted military
operations in that region, many women were
taken from their homes and removed by their
captors to the interior of Asia Minor. In
April, 1921, the Council of the League appointed a commission, which worked with
great devotion, under most trying conditions,
and assisted in returning to their own homes
large numbers of women and children. Houses
of refuge have been maintained at Constantinople and Aleppo, and in some cases women
and children are kept there for months while
necessary arrangements are being made. At
Aleppo those sheltered are taught useful
trades during teir period of residence. Turkish and Christian women alike have praised
the work of the League commission, which
bas brought hope into their lives.
Although drug addiction lias been known
in Canada only during the past fifty years,
opium smoking existed in Java in the
eighteenth century, and the trade was extended to Formosa and China by Portugese
traders. By 1906 'the production of opium in
China itself was estimated at 47,000,000
pounds, while importations totalled 7,000,000
pounds. Even in 1729 the Chinese Government issued an ediet prohibiting the smoking
of opium, but this and subsequent edicts met
with little success.
Canada is principally interested in the control of illicit importations of opium from the
Orient, and the smoking is net confined to
Orientals. A large proportion of the opium
traffickers handle also the white man's drugs
-- morphine, heroin, and cocaine.
Early in this present century public opinion
began to concentrate upon the necessity for
world control of the illicit opium traffic. Witi
this object in view, opium conferences were
held at Shanghai in 1909 and at The Hague
in 1911 and 1912. At tese conferences an
agreement was reached to control the production and distribution of raw opium, prepared
opium and medicinal opium, morphine, heroin
and cocaine. With tihe exception of Germany
and Austria, all forty-six countries represented
consented to ratify the agreement, but war
broke out and the ratification was left in
abeyance.

NOVEMBER 17, 1932
AV the conclusion of the War a number of
governments took vigorous steps to secure
more effective progress towards the suppression
of the traffle. The most important step was
the insertion of a provision in the Treaty of
Versailles automatically hringing into force for
each of its signatories the provisions of the
Opium Conference of 1912.
Canada, a signatory to the Peace Treaty,
amended her exîsting laws, and in 1920 a
more far-reaching Narcotie Act wae enacted.
In 1919 the Federal Department of Health
had been creaited, and to it was assigned the
administration of this legislation. A centralized control of legitimate narcotie transactions
was inaugurated and ail were carefully scrutinized and tabuiated.
In 1925 Canada took part in the International Conference at Geneva under the
auspices of the League of Nations, from which
emerged a Narcotie Convention, finaliy raVified in 1928 by a sufficient number of countries to bring it into international effeet.
Since then the improvement has been marked.
By 1930 it was obvious that further steps
were urgentiy necessary and a Narcotic Conference was heid at Geneva in 1931, in an
endeavour to strike at the source of supply by
limiting and controiling the amount of narcoties manufactured in the worhd. Fif tyseven nations, inciuding Canada, attended this
A convention was eventuaily

signed which. undoubtedly achieved the
primary objectives, and it has received almost
unanimous approval. Canada and the United
States have aiready ratified this convention,
and it is earnestly hoped that a sufficient
number of countries will follow to bring it
into international effect.
To a woman-Lady Simon-belongs the
credit for a courageous effort to arouse the
nations of the world to the appalling amount
of siavery existing to-day. In this year 1932
we are apt Vo regard slavery as an institution
of the past, but there are stiil 4,00,000
victims, and more probably 6,000,000. Must
these unfortunates look to the League of
Nations in vain?
After ail, the thirteen years of the League's
existence represent a very short period in the
history of the world, and we cannot change
the customs and habits of thousands of years
in a few decades. The League represents a
step towards the ideal, and with our support
shouid go forward. I well remember the
words of a medical friend of mine. Like
most fond mothers, 1 thought my first baby
the most, wonderful that had ever been
brought into the world, but the doctor, looking down pityingiy, said, "Oh, after aIl, the

higher the species the slower the development."
On motion of Hon. Mr. King, the debate
was adjourned.
MONTREAL HARBOUR COMMISSIONERS' BILL
FIRST READING

A message was reoeived from the House
of Commons with Bill 10, an Act to amend
the Montreal Harbour Commissioners Act,
1894.
The Bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read the second time?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: To-m orrow.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It ia moved by
Right Hon. Mr. Meighen that the second
reading of thie Bill be placed on the Orders
of the Day for to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my right
honourable friend has no special reason for
hastening the passage of the Bill, it might
perhaps be considered at our firgt sitting next
week. The Bill has noV been distributed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If to-m orrow
any honourabie member asks that further consideration of this Bill be postponed until
next week. I shahl not objeet. The puTpose
mierely to make clearer the
of 'the Bihl
powers of the Montreal Harbour Commissioners in respect of the regulation of plant,
machînery and appliances for loading or unloading vessels. It gives also the power to
deny vesseis 'the facilities of the harbour
should such exclusion be deemed wise. Because of its generality the present powýer of the
Commissioners does not give this authority.
Nor would it, 1 fancy, include the power of
levy, which noyw la made apecifie by the
amendment.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The main purpose
of the Bill is to allow the Commissioners to
levy toils?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
The motion was agreed to.
CANADIAN NATIONAL-CANADIAN
PACIFIC BILL
MEETING OF SUBOOMMITTEE

On 'the motion to adjouTn:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: On aocount
of the Railway Committee having feit it
necssry Vo have the important raiiway
legisiation redrafted, the committee itself will

SENATE

not meet this afternoon. but a subcomnittee
is to meet immediately after the adjournment
of the Senate, for the purpose of considering
the redrafting. I rise merely to say that
should any members of the committee or
other honourable members desire to be present
while the subcommittee is reviewing the redrafted Bill, there will be no objection. The
work is more or less clerical.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I saw in the
press lately a statement that consideration of
this legislation would be deferred until next
spring. I suppose the idea sought to be conveyed is that the Bill will not be examined
and disposed of unýtil after the long adjournment. At the time, possibly, the impression
was abroad that Parliament would soon adjourn. I would suggest that if we are to sit
next week and perhaps the following week,
the Senate might well grapple with this difficult legislation before we separate. I dislike
the idea that while considering this very
important measure, framed for the purpose
of curing an evil represented by a daily loss
of $150,000, the Senate is somewhat remiss in
its duty and desirous of adjourning. I wonder
if before we separate we could not reach a
conclusion on the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The remarks
of the honourable member are entirely correct as to the disposition of the committee
with respect to the Bill. The committee is
not disposed to hurry matters unduly, but certainly it has not dallied with the legislation
itself. There have been many and prolonged
meetings, and they arc continuing. I should
be hopeful, and I think other members of the
committee would share the hope, that if we
should meet next week it might be possible
for the committee to report.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
members, there is one unavoidable difficulty
in the way. Certain interests wish to appear
before the committee. Last week we came te
the conclusion that we sbould net be able to
get the Bill out of committee. on account of
the necessity of having it redrafted, and also
because of the interests to which I have referred not being ready to proceed. They
went away with the undcrstanding that we
would hear them after the recess. That is one
of the difficulties in the way of disposing of
the Bill before we adjourn.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is quite
correct. Their understanding was based on
the supposition that we should be adjourning
at the end of this week. The conmittee
might possibly see fit to take into consideraRiglit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN

tien the fact that we shall not be, and might
communicate with those interests again. The
committee will meet to-morrow morning at
eleven o'clock.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at

DUPLICATION IN RAILWAY SERVICES
NOTICE OF MOTION

On the notice of motion:
By Hon. Mr. Casgrain:
That he wil niove:That, pending the passing of the present Railway Bill A, in the opinion of the Senate a
certain number of officials of the Canadian
Pacific Railway Comspany and an equal numuber
of officials of the Canadian National Railway
should neet to try to co-operate iii eliminsating
sone of the duplication of railway service with
a view to econony in this service, and that in
the cases when they cannot agree, the Chairnian
of the Railway Board be called in to act as
unipire and thus give effect to the proposed
ecosnOies.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I have been advised
that it would be much better for me to make
this motion in the committee than in the
House. That is satisfactory to me.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Shall the notice
be dropped?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No, it should stand.
PUBLIC BUILDINGS

AND

GROUNDS

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ADOPTED

Hon. CAIRINE WILSON moved concurrence in the second report of the Standing
Committee on Publie Buildings and Grounds.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, the committee has recomnmended:
That the Federal District Consisission be
requested to draw up a coiprelensive plan for
the imsproveient of the grounds in Ottawa surrounding the Parliansent Buildings and the
Victoria Museum, and also in the area known
as Major Hill Park, and that such plan be submitted to this Committee for consideration.
I call attention to the recommendation only
to point to the obvious conclusion that would
be drawn from its adoption, that the layout
and general plan of the grounds around this
building, the Museun building and Major Hill
Park, are net what we should like then to be.

147

NOVEMBER 18, 1932

I make no pretence of having a particularly

artistie eye. 1 have neyer been shocked at
ail by the general contour and layout of the
grounds in any of those three places. They
are satisfactory to me. If the House is of
another view, there is no objection to the
adoption of the report. The chairman of the
Parks Board, I think, shares in general my
own opinion of the grounds, but if if is the
will of this Chamber fliat the subjeef should
be reconsidered, on the supposition thaf there
ouglit f0 be improvement, he will offer no
objection.
lion. Mr. DANDURAND: It would be
interesfing f0 hear froma the chairman and
some other members of the committee as to
the end fhey have in view. I have not followed the work of the committee, and do not
know wliat prompted it f0 make this report.
Hon. 'CAIRINE WILSON: Honourable
senafors, we discussed this question last May,
at flie time our last report on it was brougli
in, and I fhink if was the opinion of the
Senate at that time that a recommendation
similar t0 fhe one now made raighit be
advisable. We did propose that a landscape
architeet be employed, but the riglit honourable leader of the House himself suggesfed
what we considered was a better plan, that
the responsibility of looking affer the grounds
should be transferred to the Federal District
Commission, which is very much beffer
equipped with men and machinery to do the
necessary work. I feel confident that the
grounds could be very mucli improved at a
small expense.
Hon. J. S. McLENNAN: Honourable senators, I miglit supplement what the chairman
of our commitfee lias said, by stafing thaf if
was obvious fo us that one improvement
could be made by brightening the slirubbery
under flie revetmenf wall wifh a variety of
spring fiowers. The work done there hitherto
lias been more or less liapliazard. The view
fhe commiftee infended f0 convey in ifs
report was fliaf improvement miglit be made,
liowever slowly, by proceeding wifh a well
thouglit out plan, whicli would include tlie
planting of spring flowers and of bushes bearing aufumn and winfer foliage and bernies.
I fhink particular care sliould be taken of flie
very beautiful patliway under the cliffs, known
as Loyers' Walk. Unfortunafely, many of
the trees shading the walk are slowly decaying, and steps should be taken f0 arrest flic
decay. We are aIl acquainfed wifh fthe excellent work done by fthe Federal District
Commission on fhe way f0 Rockcliffe and
along the Rideau Canal. This work compares
remarkably well wif h any similar work that
53721-101

I have seen on the continent. I do flot think
iA would be the intention of the commiftee
to ask for an unduly large expenditure at
the present time. What is needed is a plan
whîch. in the long run will produce the best
resuits in beautifying these grounds and those
other properfies of the Government.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Who looks after
these grounds now?
Hon. CAIRINE WILSON: I arn afraid I
cannot say exactly. There is a superintendent,
and lie lias a few asistants. The work is
under the direction of the Public Works
Department. Formerly the department had
supervision of the grounds around Rideau
Hall, but this year if bas been taken over by
the Federal District Commission. 1 think
these three properties are the only ones now
under the direct control of tlic Department
of Public Works.
The motion was agreed to.

HARBOUR COMMES81ONERS' BILL
SECOND READING

Righf Hon. Mr. MEIC1 HEN moved the
second reading of Bill 10, an Acf f0 amend
the Monfreal Harbour C'ommissioners' Act,
1894.
Hon. Mr. DANDURLAND: Would the riglit
honourable gentleman explain?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As I explained
yesterýday, the Harbour Commissioners now
have jurisdiction in respect of machinery and
appliances, but the wording of the Act is
very general. It lias been lield by legal
opinion, thougli not by the courts, that the
Commissioners have not the power to deny
vessels admission to the harbour, nor have
tliey power to levy foîls in respect of the use
of their machinery and appliances. The Bill
clearly gives fhem authority in bofli spheres.
It is manifest to me that by the original Act
if was intended that they should have these
powers.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I understand
that some steamers equipped wifh loading
appliances have refused f0 pay the harbour
toils because they had not used the port

suppose, is to cover such cases.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: The appliances are
there for the steamers to use. We are charging
tolls at Three Rivers, whefher steamers use
the harbour appliances or not.
Riglif Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is riglit.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

of Hon. Senator Wilson (Rockeliffe) with
regard to the work of the Section of the League
of Nations dealing with Social and Humanitarian questions.
Hon. Mr. KING: Stands.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I do not think the word "stands"
applies. The Order for the resumption of the
adjourned debate is called. The honourable
senator has the floor. If he chooses to move
the further adjournment of the debate, it
will be for the House to decide whether it
shall be adjourned or not.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He can move
that the Order be discharged and be placed
on the Orders of the Day for to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. KING: I am prepared to proceed
with my remarks, which will be brief, but I
understand it is the desire of the Railway
Committee to resume its work as early as
possible, and in order to meet its wishes I
would ask that the debate be adjourned, if I
may proceed at the next sitting.
On motion of Hon. Mr. King, the debate
was adjourned.

That when the House adjourns it stand

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
Can the right

CANADIAN
NORTHERN
RAILWAYPROVINCIAL GUARANTEES
INQUIRY

On the notice:
By Hon. Mr. Casgrain:
That he will inquire of the Government:
1. At the time of the Acquisition Bill of the
Canadian Northern Railway were there bonds
guaranteed by the provincial governments?
2. Were there any bonds guaranteed by the
Government of Britislh Columbia?
3. If so, what was the amount of the bonds
thus guaranteed by that province?
4. What was the mileage of railways thus
guaranteed?
5. What was the amount in dollars thus
guaranteed per mile?
6. What was the rate of interest on these
bonds?
7. Were there any of the coupons paid by
this province? If so, how nany and for what
anount?
8. Did the Dominion Government relieve the
provinces of their guaranteed obligations?
9. The same questions for Alberta.
10. The same questions for Saskatchewan.
11. The saune questions for Manitoba.
12. The sanie questions for Ontario.
13. The same questions for Nova Scotia.
14. The same questions for Quebec.
15. The same questions for New Brunswick.
16. The sanie questions for Prince Edward
Island.
17. That on receiving these answers, he will
call the attention of the Senate to the
inequalities of these guarantees, if any.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable members,
I have a reply to the questions, but I suggest
that it stand until tomorrow, when the leader
of the Government will be here. It is somewhat lengthy, and I think he should have an
opportunity of looking it over.

NOVEMBER 23, 1932
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I suppose I may se
it?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Oh, yes; but he should

answers before they are given.
The notice stands.
DUPLICATION IN RAILWAY SERVICES
MOTION
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN moved:
That, pending the passing of the present railway bill A, in the opinion of the Senate a
certain nitmber of offcials of the Canadian
Pacifie Railway Company and an equal number
of officials of the Canadian Naitional Railways
should meet to, try to co-opera.te in eliminating
some of the duplication of railway service, w.ith
a view to economy in this service, and that in
the cases where they cannot agree, the Chairman
of the Railway Board be called in to act as
umpire and thus give effeet to the proposed
eronomies.
* He said: Honourable members, the other
day, in deference to the right honourable the
leader of the House (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen), I allowed this motion to stand,
because I understood that he and the other
members of the House were desirous that the
Railway Committee should meet witbout
delay. It was then suggested to me that I
should present the motion to the committee,
but when I brouglit it before the committee
I was informcd that it was already before the
Senate and would have to be dealt with by the
Senate.
The motion has been on the Order Paper
for some days. I think it speaks for itself.
It would be effective only until the Railway
Bill became law. It has been suggested to
me that I should add after the words "Chairman of the Railway Board" the words "or
the Chief Justice of the Exehequer Court."
It is quite immaterial to me whether the
addition is made or not, but it ba-s been said
that it would be better to name two umpires
in case one of thema might be absent. Tbere
wvou1d be recourse to the umpire only if the
railways agreed; and if tbey could agree
about the umpire, surely tbey could agree
about the subjeet-matter under discussion.
The purpose of this motion is to aceelerate,
if possible, or to anticipate, the good provisions of Bill A. An opinion of the Senate
formally expressed carnies almost the force of
law. Honourable mexnbers are all familiar
with the passes or cards of identification issued
to memnbers of both Houses of Parliament.
The issuance of those passes was brought
about merely by an expression of opinion of
the Senate. I întroduced a Bill to provide
for the issuance of those passes, and the Bill

149

was read the first and second times, and discussed in Comm-ittee of the Whole, but before it reached the third reading stage the railway authorities themselves, in collaboration
with the 'Clerk of the Senate, prepared the
cards, which have been issued since, to this
very day. They said they would rather take
this action voluntarily than. by reason of the
Bill. The explanation they gave was good,
and I appreciated it: they feared that if the
Bill went to the Commons more privileges
would be desired and might be granted. When
iwas pointed out that the Canadian Pacifie
and the Grand Trunk, the only two important railways of thc time, had accpted the
idea and that cards had already been distributed, I agreed to the withdrawal of the Bill.
Although no Bill was passed, the opinion of
the Senate as expressed in the measure given
second reading was incorporated in the consolidated Railway Act as it appeared in the
Revised Statutes. If this present motion were
passed, it too would be but an opinion of the
Senate, but it would provide an incentive to
action. I bave been told that it would be
a good thing that the Senate should pass the
motion, because the railway companies, and
even the Chairman of the Railway Board,
would be influenccd by it. 0f course. there
would be nothing comapulsory about it, as it
would flot be a law. 1 could speak upon the
matter for a long time, if the House so desired, but I think it is not necessary ta say
more at present.
I beg to move the motion, seconded by the
bonourable gentleman from Shawinigan (Hon.
Mr. Paradis).
Hon. J. A. CALDER. Honourable members,
I suppose the honourable gentleman does not
expeet us to reach a decision on bis motion
to-night. The leader of the House (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) is not present, but wil'
be here to-morrow, and I presumne the woulc
like to have an opportunity to spcak on the
question.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It will be quite satisfactory to have it stand until to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Personally, 1 may say
that I rather like the idea oiontained in the
motion. It seems to me that it would be
most unfortunate that Parliament should adjourn without making some provision for the
economies that we all hope for and expeet.
We are told that at the present time the Canadian National Railway System is running behind to the extent of some $5,000,000 a month.
I aece.pt Vhat figure as correct. Now, it is
expected that Parliament will shortly adj ourn
for two months. During this time, unless

SENATE
sorne action is taken, the deficit will be iu-

creased by

another $1,O0,0O0. Even if the

Senate were to pass the presenit Railway Bill
before adjournment, the measure would, flot
likely -be carried through the other House and
given Royal Assent within, say, the next five
rnonths, a period which would mean an increase of approxirnately $25,000,O00 in the
Canadian National deficit.
I understand that in the Railway Cornrittee
the other day the point was raised that as long
as this motion was before the Senate we could
not consider the principle of it in cornrittee.
My own suggestion would be'-and I arn stating this without having eonsulted anyonethat the motion should be withdrawn in the
Senate, and that the Railway Commrittee
should have the fullest opportunity to explore
the idea contained in it, and to determine
whether it is possible for Parliament, even
in a comparatively short tîme, to take sorne
action that would tend to give tlhe relief for
wvhich wc are ail hoping. I do not know
whether that suggestion will meet with rny
honourable friend's approval. However, there
is no burry this evening. I say again, I think
that Parliament should not adjourn for a
period of two months until every avenue bias
Leen explored that rnight lead to the doing
of something< vohich xvould imrnediatcly give
at least partial effeet to the econornies proposed. 1 arn sure honourable members ses- my
point of vicw. 1 intended te raise, the question in comimit tee. I ar nft

proposition; I may faIl in with the view of
the majority of the committee on this point;
but I think xvc should certainlv lock horus

at this tirne.
liou. Mr'. DANDURAND:
Further consideration of this matter, I understand, is to
ho postponed until the righit honourable leadler
of the bouse takes bis seat to-morrow. In
the meantirne perlaaps we miglît turn ever i

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Pcrsonally I arn inehined f0 the view that if would he better te
discuss the question in cenmittee, because
there ive shail have greater freedorn. Under
our rules a member rnay speak to this motion
only once; whereas in cornmittee there is no

THE PROBLEM

0F UNEMPLOYMENT

QUESTION 0F PRIVILEGE

Bonourable senHon. J. MTJRDOCK:
ators, on Novemiber 16, under rule 42 of the
Senate, I called the attention of the Bouse
to an unwarranted and untruthful statement
contained in the Toronto Daily Star of
November 14. 1 stated that that item, purporting to quote me, was absolutely untrue.
Under the sanie rule I desire now to bring
to the attention of the Bouse an editorial
which appeared in the Montreal Daily Herald
of yesterday. It is headed "Senator Murdock
Sees Red," and contains sixteen paragraphs,
of which I shall read only the first two:
If his ivords are to be taken at their face
value Senator Murdock is trying to, put a dash
of Red into t-he Red Chamber.
When he says that the unemployment problema
nmust be settled in a way to satisfy the unemnployed, or it will be settled in a way unpleasing
to the Government, he utters what sounde painfully like a veiled threat againet constituted
authority.
The gentleman who wrote that editorial is
just the common or garden variety of prevaricator. I want to make that as plain as I can.
Senat.or Murdock does not "see red" except
when some tool of someébody holding the
moneybags writes lies about an ordinary
citizen.

SENATE

SOCIAL AND HUMANITARIAN WORK
0F LEAGUE 0F NATIONS
PROPOSED RESOLUTION-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumned from November 18 the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Senator Wilson (Rockcliffe) with regard to
the work of the section of the League of
Nations dealing with Social and Humanitarian
Questions.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
I desire to congratulate the honourable senator
from Rockcliffe (lion. Cairine Wilson) on
bringing this motion to thc attention of the
House. I would ask that it be given faveurable consideration. I think. even in this day
of curtailment of budgets, none of us desire
to see the activities of this section of the
League of Nations in any way interfered with
or piirtailed.
We are learning from time to time that in
the control of certain human activities it is
neoessary for us to go beyond local, provincial
or Dominion regulation; in fact the control,
if it is to be successful and effective, must
be international. This is strikingly demonstrated by the convention entered into some
years ego with respect to quarantine regulations to control plague, choiera, smallpox and
typhus fever. By that convention each contracting nation agreed that in the event of
any of these diseases becoming epidemie within its territory it would not only institute
measures of local control, but would warn the
other contracting parties of the outbreak, thus
giving them ample opportunity to take preventive measures. The success of the quarantine regulations as worked out internationally
is well known to aIl. Thanks to their enforcement, the dissemination of disease is so
thoroughly controlled that to-day we are no
longer subject to those epidemnies, with their
attendant suffering and loss of life.
With regard to the opium traffic, as the
honourable senator from Rockcliffe (Hon.
Cairine Wilson) advised this House a few
days ago, the traffic originated in the East,
but only within the last century has it
attained such proportions on this continent
as to necessitate the introduction of measures
for its control. I can well remember that
when I was a medical student only one case
of morphine addiction was shown to the
student body, and this was done for the purpose of imýpressing upon us the grave danger
of the injudicious use of the drug i 0 the
practice, of medicinc. It was only in 1899
that the matter received international attention. In that ycar the world powers met
at Shanghai and there formally adopted
Hun

Mr. CALDER.

certain regulations for the control of opium.
Little came of that convention until 1912,
when on the initiative of the Goveroment
of the United States the matter was brougbt
before the nations at The Hague. It ivas
hoped that by the force of law based on
international agreements the regulations as
set out in the Shanghai convention of 1899
would be made effective. Some thirty-two
nations signcd the convention.
Then the
Great War broke out, and nothing further
was donc internationally until the signing of
the Versailles Treaty, when the treaty nations
became parties to the bague convention.
I may be pcrmitted to refer bricfiy to the
conditions that prevailed in Canada after the
War. The Dominion Department, of Health
was established in 1919. That department
was charged with the responsibility of administering the Opium and Narcotie Drug
Act. It was through the survcy made and the
information collected departmcntally that we
became aware- of the extent of the narcotie
traffle in Canada. To our surprise, the survey
showed between eight and nine thousand of
olir people addicted to the narcotic habit. It
also showed that our methods of control wcire
not sufficient. Thereupon Parliament passed
leg-islation known as the Opium and Narcotie
Drug Act. The Act provides for control of
the importation and sale of n.arcotics, and requires drug importing bouses to secure a
licence and to register and report to the
Department of Health each and every sale of
narcotic drugs to retail druggists throughout
Canada, who dispense the drugs on prescription nf certitie(l physicians.
Honourable members may be interestcd to
know the results of that control. On refcrring
to page 94 of the 1932 report of the Department of Pensions and National Health they
will flnd a table setting ont the amount of
narcotie drugs imported into Canada annually
from 1919 to 1931. It will be noted that in
1919 we imported 12333 ounces of cocaine.
During the succeeding years dowvn to 1931, it
will be observed, there was a gradual decrease
until, in 1931, wve imported only 1,947 ounces
of this narcotic drug. 0f morphine, in 1919
wve imported 30,087 ounces, but by 1931 the
traflie had (lecreased to 5,353 ounces.
0f
crude opium, in 1919 we imported 34,262
ounces, as against only 999 ounces in 1931.
These figures cover the legitimate importation
of these three narcotie drugs.
Now I will deal with the illicit traffie. In
1931 the League of Nations published a document in wvhich they set out that within the
period between 1925 and 1930 ot less than
106 tons of morphine, heroin and cocaine

NOVEMBER 23, 1932
entered the illicit traffic. ÎI arn speaking now
not of ounces, as I did before, nor of pounds,
but of tons-106 tons of morphine, heroin and
cocaine entered the illicit traffc. It will be
of interest to honourable members to know
that during the year ended June 30, 1931,
three and a haif tons of drugs that had
entered illicitly were seized on the North
American continent. This gives eome idea of
the enormous market available to those engaged in the traffic.
1 should like to pay a compliment to the
Narcotic Branch of the Department of National Health. Sinoe its establishment that
branch has been most active and most insistent in routing out those who engage in
the illicit traffic in narcotie drugs. We flnd
that during the years frorn 1925 to 1931 that
department, acting in co-operation with the
attorneys-general of the various provinces,
and the police departments throughout
Canada, have au>cceeded in securing 1,560 convictions in which jail sentences without the
option of a fine were imposed, and 2,157 convictions in which the option of a fine was
given. It is history, and it can be easily
ascertained fromn a readmng of the reports,
that this department of the Government service has carried on its activities with great
energy and bas been successful in tsecuring the
conviction of many persons of great importance in the world traffic in illicit drugs.
In many cases these convictions have resul'ted
flot only in a fine, or imprisonment, but also
in deportation.
The adoption by the nations who signed the
Treaty of Versailles of the regulations and
resolutions coming out of the Blague convention was of great value in eoping with this
problem. However, it was found that if the
desired degree of control was to be secured,
further activities would have to be undertaken by those nations and that the internal
administration of the Acts governing the
manufacture of narcotic drugs would have to
be extended. So in 1925 another meeting
under the League of Nations was called at
Geneva and more drastic measures were
agreed upon. In 1928 these were adopted by
the nations Vhat were represented. Suýbsequently to that convention Canada again
amended hier Narcotic Drugs Act, and to-day,
I think, we may well be proud of the internal
administration of that Act as it relates to the
international control of this traffie.
After the treaty of 1928 it was found necessary to extend control to the source of supply,
and at the convention called in 1931 under
the auspices of the League of Nations there
wvere laid down certain formulS which related

not ouly to the international handling of
narootics, but also to the curtailment of their
manufacture. Under this new convention it
was proposed that each of the contracting
nations should designate, through a central
bureau of the League of Nations, its narcotie
requirements for medical and scientifie purposes. Furthermore, importers were required
to secure an import licence, and, as that
licence muet pass through the central oontrol
body, aIl the contracting parties will be aware
of its existence. Countries in which the drug
is manulactured must estimate the quantities
necessary to meet their own internai requirements for medical and scientific purposes, and
they nmust not allow exportation without an
export licence. This agreement has already
been assented to by Canada, the United
States, and certain other nations, and will
become effective in 1933 if accepted by the
representatives of twenýty4lve nations and the
representatives of four of the nations in
which the drugs are manufactured. These are
France, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Japan, Turkey, Switzerland and the
United States. I amn satisfled that if the
report is finally adopted internationally the
result will be a much better control of the
world drug traffie.
The second part of the resolution before
us refers to the traffic in women and cbildren,
and to child welfare. These subjects have
been a matter of international eoncern, and
bave been dealt with through committees
appointed by the League of Nations. In 1921
the representatives of thirty odd nations
assembled and drew up certain regulations
concerning these matters, and since then other
committees have met from time to time, but
1 do not think that the recommendations
made have as yet been finally accepted internationally. From the experience gained in
dealing with matters of this character I have
no doubt that eventually the recommendations touching these questions will be -accepted
internationally and their adoption will be oi
great benefit to the nations of the world.
Hon, W. A. GRIESBACH: Honourable
members, I agree with the honourable gentleman from East Kootenay (Hon. Mr. King)
on the seriousness of the drug traffic, flot only
in this country, but throughout the world, and
I can quite understanL the interest of the
honourable senator from Rockcliffe (Hon.
Cairine Wilson) in the subjeet. I should like,
however, to point out to them and to al
others interested in thîs subi ect that if we
are really desirous of reducing the numbe-r of
trafflekers in drugs in Canada we should do

SENA TF

154

wcli to abolish the fine that is now ievied and
to impose in ail cases a jail sentence, to be
followed by a flogging. This wouid reduce
the number of drug cases from 3,000, the
prescrnt figure, to a few hund-red a y earl.
Last year 1 placed on the Order Paper some
questions in regard to the financing of the
League of Nations. I have not before me the
figures that I received in reply, but it is my
recollection that the League of Nations is at
presenit being supported and maintained by
ihe nations of the British Empire plus a bare
half-dozen other nations in Europe, including
France, Italy, Holland, Denmark, and perbaps Sivcden. The contributions of ail the
Cher members of the League of Nations are
in arrears for periods ranging from one to
seven years. It follows that we probably bave
as good a rigbt as any nation, and a much
better rigbht than many nations that are menmbers of the League, to direct as to what the
League of Nations shall do.
Yoi will ob)serv-e that the resolution before
the House reads, in part, as follow.s:
'J'lat in the opinion of the Senate there
should be no curtailmient or inter ruption in the
continuity of the vwork of the Section of the

1cave been glad f0 support it. But xve are
asked to deal with one subject to tbe exclusion
of ail oezbers, and to assert that there shonld
ha no curtailment or interruption in this wîork.
The Leag-ue of Nations lias many important
tasks before if at the present time, and, for
the reason that 1 bave already mentioned, it
bias a limited income; consequently, I gravely
question the wisdom of tbe Senate solemnly
asserting that in ifs opinion this matter is

activities cf the League of Nations. I thi that at this dhstance wve sbould be well advised to let the League of Nations decide for
itself what are the important questions to ha

I rise at this time, however, merely for the
purpose of saying that if an opinion is to

of Parliament, and not of only one section
of Parliament. While Parliament may presumne to speak for ail the people of Canada,
we cannot do so. I arn not opposing the
motion on this ground, but would suggest
that the subi ect be carried over until tomorrow, so that the right honourable leader
of the Government may have an opportunity to express his views on it. Personally,
I have every rea.son to hope that so long as
the League of Nations continues to exist and
function it will carry on the work referred to
in this resolution, because in many respects
work of this character is very much more
important than some of the other classes of
work that the League attempts to do.

CUSTOM-HO0USES
INQUIRY-MOTION

AND OUTPOR'Il
FOR RETURN

Hon. Mr. LYNOR-STAUNTON inquired
of the Government:
1. What is the number of eustom-houses,
sub-customn-ho uses and outports in Canada?
2. How inany of them are in -receipt of
customns duties sufficient to pay the expenses
of such offices?
3. What is the number of custom-houses,
sub-customi-houses, and outports in the United
States of America?
4. Does the American Government maintain
as many such offices as does the Canadian
Government?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I arn told
that the compiling of this information will
take consideraijie time. Therefore I suggest
that an order of the Senate issue for a return.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The ýOrder stands
as a motion for a return.
UNITED KINGDOM TRADE
AGREEMENT BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN moved the
second reading of Bill 8, an Act respecting a
certain Trade Agreement between
His
Mai esty's Government in Canada and lis
Majesty's Government in the»United Kingdom.
Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Although we
have vaguely heard of such an agreement, I
suppose the right honourable genitleman will
give us an exact statement as to its purpose?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The exact
statement is quite complete, exceedingly
accurate and informative: it is contained in
the Bill itself. The agreement embraces every
detail, and its purpose, which is manifest,
shines in every line of the Bill. That purpose
is to provide freer access to Canadian markets
for products of the United Kingdom, and
freer access to United Kingdom markets for

157

produets of the Dominion of Canada, which
latter products are chiefly and predominatingly agricultural.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
members, during the debate on the Address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne I sta.ted
my belief that we ail were in favour of the
principle of reciprocity with the British
Empire. We have been seeking an extension
of that principle ever since 1897, when we
started giving a preference to British goods in
the Canadian market. But as a resuit of the
formula contained in this Bill there will be, 1
believe, considerable, difficulty in establishing
proper trade relations with those nations with
which, under the most-favoured-nation clause,
we have been exchanging goods in the past,
to our very great advantage. No one can
say wbat will be their reaction to the fact
that we are transferring our purchases to
British markets. It will be the business of the
Government to make agreements with them
as favourable as possible to Canada. Only
time can tell what will happen, but we have
already had some inkling of the reaction in
the attitude of some countries, which are
beginning to raise their tariffs against Canada and the rest of the world. I fervently
hope that the transferring of purchases to
Great Britain and the other Dominions will
not; resuit in diminishing the volume that our
exports attained in the time of prosperity.
I need not; repeat what 1 have already said
in this Chamber, that on fiscal matters there
are two trends of thought which constantly
divîde the two great parties in Canada. The
-Liberal Party has stood for freer trade. This
follows logically its profession of Liberal
policies based on Liberal principles. I remember the time when the Conservative Party
protested that we on this side were uni ust
in characterizing it as standing for high protection. I suppose the members of that party
would not protest so vehemently to-day in
view of the very high tariff that has been in
force since 1930.
Ail these trade agreements, being based on
the principle of high tariff, naturally cannot
have the adherence of the members of a
party that has stood for freer exchange of
goods with the outside world. Yet I must
recognize that the Government of the day
obtained from the People in 1930 a mandate
on this principle, which was clearly enunciated
by the leader of the Conservative Party, the
present Prime Minister. The mandate having
been given, I feel that the Senate is precluded fromn challenging it at this date. Knowing full wveIl the limitations of this Chamber,
1 will Pontent myself by simply declaring

SENATE

158

that we dislike the policy, and cannot adhere
to it, yet we must bow to the will of the
people as expressed at the last election
However, a contentious element has been
introduced into these agreements, and I for
one cannot concur in it: this country binds
itself to maintain the policy enunciated in
these agreements for a term of five years.
On fiscal matters it has been generally accepted in Canada that a Parliament cannot
bind any future Parliament; yet, although
the people might see fit to reverse that policy
at an election held within the next two years,
and might pronounce themselves in favour of a
lower tariff, these agreements might prevail
for practically the whole life of , the next
Parliament. This, it seems to me, is an
anomaiy bard to reconcile with our cherished
belief in the freedom of the people. For this
reason I declare again, and more vehemently
than J did on the first point, that those who
stand for the people's fuîll liberty of expression, and for a lower tariff, cannot concur in
the binding of this Parliament for the next
five years to a higli tariff policy. On the' other
hand, I recognize that if the people should
choose to reverse the policy for which they
voted two years ago, Parliament might lower
the duties, and a reduction of the tariff would
bc an easy way to alter these agreements, for
it would benefit both Great Britain and Canada, in the opinion of those who hold that
greater freedomn of trade is beneficial.
Besides the fact that the people might reverse the present policy and thcir wishes might
be expressed in legislation, in spite of thes
agreements, by a reduction of the tariff, I eau
foresee the possibility of a change in the policy
of the present Government, as well as of the
Government of Great Britain, in con-sequence
of the conclusions which the projected World
Economie Couference may reach. There is
no question that that Conference will attempt
to bring about a general reduction of tariffs
throughout the world. During the last few
years I have niet inen-not Canadians-interested in international affairs, and they have
all agreed that the economic condition of the
world cannot be improved except by agreements amongst the nations. Those uen clearly
foresee and positively affirm that there can be
no chance of an early economic recovery un!ess the representatives of the various peoples
liold a round table conference and reach conclusions te bring about grcater freedoa of
international exchange.
In reading these agreements I have felt that
the economie unity of the Empire, xvhich has
been the goal of some statesmen in Great
Britain and perhaps of others in Canada, can
lon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

be built on an enduring foundation only if it is
based upon the principle of freedom. I fear
that the various clauses of this Bill indicate
some weakness in this respect, inasmuch as
they permit of intermeddýling by the two
governments. I see some danger in the right
given to the British Government and its
nationals to appear before our Tariff Board to
claim equality of treatment with our own
producers. I do net object to any policy
that tends to reduce the cost of production
for the benefit of the consumer, but I feel
it is a dangerous principle to give one Governiment the right to intermeddle in the affairs
of the other. The appeals which the manufacturers of Great Britain, supported by the
British Governiment, may make before our
Tariff Board are to my mind fraught with
considerable danger. Within the last two
rmonths a representative British statesman
while in Canada said that he was very much
interested in the constitution of the proposed
Tariff Board, because in it could he found
all the meat there was in faveur of the Britisli
producer. So I fear that disappointment will
follow the disposition of those appeals, with
all the recriminations incident to ruch disappointment.
It has already been stated in British publirations that appeals before the Canadian board
would be useless. I see in a despatel froin
Halifax, England, which appeared in our press
of the 14th of this month, the following:
The Yorkshire Chamber of Coimaiece bas
incvited the co-operation of the Bradford and
iiuddersfield Chambers of Connnree in jreparing a case for revision of the Canadian wool
and textile tariffs set uîp under the agreeients

of the Imîperial Coiference.
Althougli the wool and textile delegation
comprising a central body representing the
origanized employers lias already decided upoi
certain lices of action, the delegation will niot
at present indicate in wliat direction it propose s
to take advantage of the clause leiiiiittiiig
iepresentations to the new Canadian TairlF

Advisory Board.
We shall have pilgrimages of British producers to Canada oftener than many Canadian
industries would like, and a highly technical
discussion will take place as to the comparative rates of wages paid Canadian labour
and British labour and as to other factors
entering into the cost of production.
There is another statement to which I should
like to refer. It comes from Mr. Neville
Chamberlain, who, I believe, bas a wrong
viewpoint as to wliat will be the effect of
these agreements between our country and
his own. A London weekly said recently:
fr. Neville (haimberilain lias said what we

pression Ieft on my mind when 1 got to Ottawa,"
hie told the Conservative Party at Blackpool,
"1was that the ties which bound the Empire
together bcd begun to get dangerou sly frayed,
and that if something were not done to reverse
the tendencies of recent years, the day might
corne, and core in no long time, when the
disruption of the Empire would gradually begin." And hie claimed that the tariff agreements at which the Ottawa Conference had
arrived had begun to repair the damage. It
is a libel, of course, and of the worst kind,
to suppose that the ties of Empire are composed
of strands of reciprocal tariffs.
What did the right honourable gentleman
mean by "tendencies of recent years"? Un-

doubtedly hie referred to the Conference of
1926, which proclaimed equality of stetus
between the Dominions and Great Britain, and

to the conclusions of that Conference, which
were translated into the Statute of Westminster
and unanimously approved by the House of
Commons and by the Senate of Canada. I
would remind the right honoureble gentleman
that freedom and sentiment are the basis of
our relations, and it muet not and cannot be
altered by business considerations.
Hon, C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable gentlemen, as the chiefs on both sides have practically rested their contentions on the merits
of the Bili itself, I rise with corne diffidence
to speak on this meesure. I may, however,
have corne dlaim upon your indulgence by
reason of the fact that time and again, in this

Huse, 1 have joincd my modeet efforts to
those of honoureble gentlemen on both sides
of -the House in asking that the one-sided,
uni ust preference which. had existed for so

long, to the detrirnent of Canada, should be
either amended or withdrawn. I cannot help
expressing my deepeat satisfaction at seeing
this long-standing injustice repaired at laÀst.
1 regret that we have flot a:rongst us to-day
a gentleman who, when this metter was lest
discussed here-in 1924 or 1925, 1 believe-geve
the House a inost beautiful exemple of courage
and patriotism. Many honourable gentlemen
here to-day will rernemiber the stand taken et
that time by Hon. Mr. Devid. Hie wes eighty-six
or eighty-seven years of age, extremely weak
physically, with hardly any voice lef t. He
hed been the bosom friend of Sir Wilfrid
Laurier; no man was dloser to Sir Wilfrid's
heart, no man more intimate with the great
Leader's thought, than Senator David. No
policy wes more closely bound up witb the
purpose of one man than was the preference
granted to Great Britain in 1897 identified witb
the mind of Laurier. The preference wes
Laurier's preferred child. Although Mr. David

was the bosom friend, confidant and devoted
admirer of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, he stood
up in this bouse and called for the repeal of

this unjust preference which for years levied
tribute not oniy upon tbe capital invested in
our industry, but also upon the labour men
dependent thereon. For the benefit of wbom
was this preference given? It w-as for the
benefit of capital invested end labour employed
in the British Isles.
Honourable gentlemen, if the late Senator
David were witb us to-day, with what deep
satisfaction hie would hail the reparation bie
bcd so long awaited, not alone, but with
many other honourable members on eitber
side of polities. If I am not mistaken, our
ever-young member for De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Béique) spoke very sympetbetically et
that tirne in support of Hon. Mr. David.
Be that as it may, I cannot help expressing a very sincere regret thet et co pressing
a time as the present this meesure, of such
importance, sbould be fought tooth and nail
by a great party like the Liberal Party. Why
bas it become necessary? I know it bas been
asserted that there are differences, tints invisible to the eye of tbe ordinary man, between the policy now pursued by tbe Conservative Party and the policy adopted by
the Liberal Party and pursued for thirtytbree yeare. For my part I cannot cee tbe
sligbtest difference, except, perbape, in the
manner of expressing the policy. le it not
a feet that Sir Wilfrid Laurier and bis
successors demanded reciprocity? That cennot be denied. le it flot e fact tbat tbey asked
,for tbe camne sort of reciprocal treetment?

Thet cen readily be found in perliamentary
records. and no man dare deny it.
I have often a.sked myself bow it was that
the Lîberal policy, pursued for so long, was
not carried to final fruition. May I give you
rny explanetion? I will do so in all candour.
Sincerely. I believe that in 1897 the policy
of tbe Liberel Party was born witb e deedly
congenital disease. In 1897 tbe Liberal Party
intended to reduce the tariff, but that wes
not an easy task. In the greet ind-ustriel
centres of tbe East were many thousande of
voters dependent upon industry for tbeir
livelibood and that of tbeir farnîlies. Notwithstanding that, those wbo relied upon protection, nay, lived upon protection, wcre induced
to eccept a reduction of the tariff. Wben I was
in Spi, like otber honourable members of
tbis House, I witnessed the gruesome spectacle
of a bull figbt. I will not enter into all the

details. The toreador cernies bis rapier concealed under a cape of bright red silk.

the cape thet it sees, and neyer tbe

dispatched with a clean thrust to the heart.
In 1897, when the Liberal Party wanted to reduce the tariff, it held its pruning knif e, but
was verv careful to conceal it with the British
flag. To the voters in the large centres the
Liherals said, "Do this for the British Empire."
Later, in the House of Commons, statesmen,
men of great talent and prestige, rose and
said that the preference had been given by the
Canadian people out of the fullness of their
hearts; but those statesmen, hecause of their
political creed, had perforce to add that it was
granted for the good of Canada, as well. Suchi a
striking attitude eould flot be taken without hoceming known across the Atlantic, and for
thirty-three yeaýrs thereatter, îvhenever Canada
knocked at the door of No. 10 Downing Street
and asked for reciprocal concessions, an in,creduloýus minister alýways rernembered that
Canada gave a preterence to Great Britain,
not at ail for the sake of Great Britain, but
for Canada's own advantage. How could
Canada ever expeet te obtain trom hardheaded business men, like British statesmen,
any valuable concessions in return for what
Canada had donc simply for its own henefit?
If any honourable gentleman requires any
evidence, I can quete it from the lips of an
Eng-lish statesinan who for years was utterly
opposed te any reciprocity favouring Canada.
but wlio lately bas become one et the most
ardent aposties et our treaty with the Uinited
Kingdom. Listen tu wbat Mr. Thomas said in
the British House of Cemmons in 1926, when
this very question was heing discussed:
During a debate in tbe Canadian Pailihameiit
a week age, MNr.Lapointe. the Canadin Mmiiister of Justice, said that "Canada was giî ing
Great Britain a preference in lier market of
lier ew n free wviIl, but inainly becaiise it suited
Canada te do se."
Mer. Grahamn said at that tirne: "Iliat pieference was given te Great Britain eut et the beart
of the people et Canada, but uot altogether

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Hear. beur.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Wby, may I ask,
should British statesmrn censtrain their people
te aecept sacrifices in return for what Canada
did. net for Great Britain, but for bier own
henefit? In view of the attitude of the Liho-ral
Party, I arn net at ail sinrprised that Mr.
Thomas, who was very bard to convince, even
in 1930, should have thon claimed, during the
zýourse et the Imperial Conference, that the
propesition made 'by the Canadian delegates
wxas netbinýg but humbug.
But the situation changed, honourable
gentlemen. The change ivas net due entirely
Uon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

te the efforts et the Conservative Party. In
1930 the pruning knife was taken eut again,
the tariff again eut down, and the preterence
inereased. Then trouble began. Our workmen found themselves with empty dinner
pails, and througbout the country a cry arese
that this sacrificing et Canadian markets and
Canadian interests for the henefit et British
capital and British workmen baid gene tee
far, and this opinion was eenfirmed at the
elections which sbortly atterwards took place.
It is easy in a speech betore Parliament te
contend that our delegates took a big stick
and browbcat John Bull, but 1mow ridiculeus
it is in fact! Can anyone conceive that a
British Government would last for twentyfoeur hours if it submitted te such treatment?
The truth is that a condition existed îvhich
could last ne longer. A cendition whicb, if
ià did last longer, would have fatal results,
was placed clearly 'hefore the British nation.
The tacts were clear. The British people
realized that Canada was sincere and that if
their Gevernment did net give a quid pro
que te Canada, the preterence wouid go. for it
was well understeod that eur Prime Minister in
bis declaration was supported by the pee-ple et
this country. Great Britain realized, furtbc'r, that
e\'ery ether Deminion supperted the Canadian
,stand. Can honourable members net picture
the situation as Britain saw it? May I ask
you te ponder on wbat wold have been the
result if Canada and the rest et the Dominions had withdrawn the preterence? We have
been told that it is dang-erous te inject business
into family relations. That may bie true, but
the danger is hy ne oleanýs certain, wbilst the
repeal et the preferenice was an immediate, inescapable calamity. Grea t Britain could avoid
such disaster on-ly by revers ing bier nid policand granting- the preterence which Canada bad
been requesting for many ycars.
There ivas a migbty differeince 'between the
Liberal Partys bialf-bearted pleas fer concessiens, which the British Gevernment did net
grant, because it bad ne failli in tbom. mndthe
dignifled ibut firmn language et the Conservative Party in 1930. 1 censider that at the conference et that year the Canadian Prime Minister and delegates rendered a, very great service
te the Empire by fercefully settinýg fertb the
censequences et the then existing cenditions.
If I arn wreng in this epinion I arn in excellent
company. May I read what Viscount Hailsham

until this year at Ottawa, so that we might al
join witli a fresh opportunity of seeing whxether
we could flot solve the problent whicli, in 1930,
proved beyond solution.
And Lord Elibank was quoted by the Montreal Gazette as saying:
Th'le Britishi Empire was at the parting of the
ways when the Ottawa Conference wras held,
I think that the successes achieved there have
been 'the cause of avaiding disintegratiom.
Mr. Neville Chamberlain expressed a similar
view when lie said that the ties of Empire
were wearing dangerously thin prioir to the
Ottawa Conferesice.
The pact lias been attacked on the ground
tliat it will resuit in excessive protection. I
liave endeavoured to analyse the whole situation in an attempt to determine whether
there is any justification for such a contention, and if honourable inembers will bear
witli me for a few minutes 1 will state MY
conclusions. In the fiscal year 1930-31 wie
imported goods to a total value of about
31,000,000,000. 0f course, owing to worldwide conditions, our importations have
decreased by roughly 50 per cent since tha.t
time, but I am taking tliose figures as representative of a normal year. 0f that total
only 21 per cent, or $211,000,000, will be
affected by tlie agreement. United States
goods tliat will be affected total only 12
The total value

of other foareign goods affected will bie only
$M5,000,000, or 2ý per cent of tlie wliale.
British importe affected total U68,000,000, or
7 per cent. Tliere will be tariff changes on
only 20 per cent of all the Amerîcan imparts,
and 50 per cent of ail Britisli imports. Whatever increases in duties are made will affect
foreign goods, and decreases favour mercliandise from tlie Emipire.
In liulk, the increases affecet 139 items, of
a total value of $121,000,000, while the
decreases app]y to 130 itemis, valued at
$117,000,000. So the preponderance of increases over decreases is only $4,000,000. Yet
it lias been said that this agreement will lead
ta unreasonable protection! Wlien this agreement is put into opera ian tlie people of
Canada will be paying increased duties of
84,000,000 a year on the basis of total imports
of 81,000,000,000. But, as present importations total only about $500,000,000, we shahl
be paying only about 82,000,000 more in
duties than we were before.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: It would require

ultimately brake the camel's back.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Yet tliis agreement
with Great Britain lias been attacked witli
unprecedented bitterness. Is there justificatian for sucli attack? I leave that ta the
judgment af lianourable members.
I have lieard it said, and have read in the
press, that it would bave been wiser ta facilitate the importation of instruments of production rather than obtain preferences on the export af aur awn natural praducts. Is there any
ground for that contention? The natural
praducts of this cauntry, in con.sequenýce of the
agreement witb Great Britainý, wiil be granted
,free entry into a slieltered market of 42,000,000

Limited, and Canadian Woollens & Worsteds.
If the spirit expressed in this interview could
penetrate certain parts of this country it would
do a deal of good. This is what he says:
Taking the long view, which is the only view
t take, i.t ought to be a good thing for all
concerned. It will necessitate our issuing withont delay a new and lower price list, which
naturally gives us some concern, but, as I say,
sacrifices have to be made, and we are loyal
enough to do our part. It must be remembered
that this cut comes on top of the detrimental
efiect of Britain going off the gold standard,
which was a serious blow to us, and added to
our problems, while in addition there has been
a cut on operatives' wages in England whieh
will enable them to make still lower prices for
export, all of which has to be met by us, if
we are to hold our trade. The freeing of fine
linens means that it will prevent the development
here of finer lines of goods, but someone had
to make a sacrifice, and the manufacturers are
the only ones who can do it. The whole thing
seems to be very fair-there had to be some
trading between the different parts of the
Empire, and while each part was looking after
its own it was not unmindful of the others, and
the compromise seems to be fair for all concerned.
Premier Bennett bas handled the
matter in a masterly way, and we hope it will
bring the benefits that are anticipated.
I know it is easy to smile at a statement like
this, but the truth of it can none the less be
established for anyone who takes the trouble
to inform himself of the facts. Perhaps some
honourable members are not familiar, as I
am, with towns that have been net so long ago
decimated as a result of too keen competition
from Great Britain. But many honourable
members constantly feeling the pulse of business are better informed. They do not smile
at the statement that I have read.
So far as Great Britain is concerned, the
trade pact bas been in effect for a few months.
Perhaps the House will bear with me while
I read a despatch in the Montreal Star of the
15th instant, as showing already the effect of
these tariff changes made in favour of Canada. This is the despatch:
Export of copper showing big gain-British
preference inereases market for output from
Canada.
Big quantities of Canadian copper are being
passed over the Montreal wharves, the movement having been accelerated considerably by
the recent British decision to put a duty of
four cents a pound on the foreign commodity,
thus giving Empire copper that mueh preference.
This afternoon the freighter P. Madsen will
sail with 1,000 tons of copper rods, while 24
carloads of copper are being taken aboard the
Concordia, scheduled to sail within the next
two days. In addition, many other ships are
loading copper.
J. A. Nuttall, manager of A. W. W. Kyle
Company, forwarding agents, said to-day that
the P. Madsen had been specially chartered
for the conveyance of copper.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

He went on to say that the British preference
should act as a tremendous impetus to exports
from Canadian ports. Speaking specifically of
copper rods, he said that while some 15,000
tons have been taken from Montreal this year,
at a conservative estimate at least 50,000 tons
would be shipped next season. "This trade
is only really beginning," he emphasized.
He said that shipnents are being made to
all parts of the United Kingdom including
London, Liverpool, Glasgow, Swansea and
Cardiff.
I think it is beyond contradiction that
this year we have exported to Great Britain
more wheat than in practicalIy any other
year in our history. That is something.
Besides, nobody will deny that the exportation
of lumber, particularly of Douglas fir, has increased tremendously this year. To be exact,
the increase for the first eight months of this
year as compared with the same period of last
year has been 68 per cent; whereas the exports
of lumber from the United States to Great
Britain during the same period have fallen 73
per cent. Our exports of tobacco have also
received a tremendous impetus. In another
place a long list was presented, and not
challenged, showing in many cases very substantial improvement in our sales to Great
Britain.
One further point for the benefit of an
honourable gentleman whom I do not see in
his seat. It is suggested, with respect to trade
negotiation with foreign countries, that we
should be very careful lest we tie our hands.
I would ask him, and others who share his
view, where to-day could they find another
nation of 42,000,000 people willing to give our
goods free entry to their market? The United
States? That country bas a protective tariff
against wheat of 42 cents a bushel-as much
as the commodity is worth to-day. Moreover, President-elect Roosevelt has stated that
he will not reduce the tariff rates on agricultural products. Where are you going to turn?
To France? She has a protective tariff of
$1.60 a bushel-four times the price at which
wheat sells to-day. Germany? She has a
tariff against wheat of one dollar a bushel.
Italy? There, too, the tariff duty is practically
one dollar a bushel. I understand the importation of practically all other products is
treated in much the same fashion by these
countries.
We have been told that in these trade agreements there lurks the danger of coercion, and
we are warned to be careful. When I hear
men speaking as if it would be possible for
Great Britain to coerce Canada to-day I am
inclined to remind them that, considering the
mentality of this country, the Boston Tea
Party is not a hundred and fifty, but a
thousand years old. Who will stand up

NOVEMBER 24, 1932
and take the responsibiiity of refusing to
accept a shelt-ered markcet for our goods such
as is offered to us by a nation of 42,000,000
people? Some honourable gentlemen, while
they will fot take upon themselvee such a
responsibility, are ever ready to put forward
various objections against this trade agreement. One of these objections is that by this
Bill we are tying the 'banda of Parliament.
I asic those honourable gentlemen., in cases
inifinitely less important have they noV, when
ini office, takcen the very saine course that they
are now condemning whiie in opposition?
They have done so. They know it. NoV one
cf them. can answer no Vo that question.
But those who have advanced that objection
knew Vhey were hitting in a vital spot the
project which we are now trying to foster.
They have made known to the country that
this trade reaty between Canada and Great
Britain is to be subordinatcd Vo party interest-that one of its most important elements,
certainty of duration, iz Vo be destroyed. That
is what the Liberal Party is doing to-day. Teli
me whether any exporter wiil attempt Vo take
his share of a foreign market *of 42,000,000
people if the entry Vo that market is so insecure
that he wili not be able to recoup his outiay,
which may 'be enormous. I know something
of export trade. How long will it take
you to make your goods known throughout
Great Britain? How many travellers will you
riquire? You have to establish your organization-samle, distribution, credit and collection. How long will that take? Will you go
Vo the expense and trouble of doing it while
there hangs over your head the menace that
only so long as the Conservative Party ia in
power shaHl this agreement last? Do honourable gentlemen opposite realize that by their
hostillty to this trade agreement they are discouraging many of our exporters who otherwise would courageously take the necessary
steps Vo develop the only great markcet open
Vo them to-day?
1 do noV think the gravity of the present
world criais lias been emphasized in a more
striking manner than by Mr. Montagu. Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, in
one of lis rare speeches, which ho de1ivered
last month. He said:
The difficuities are so vast, the forces so
unlimited and 8o novel and the precedents s0
lacking, that I approach the whole subjeet not
only in ignorance, but in humility. It is too
great for me.
I believe if aIl the nations wouid act Vogether
Vhings would be different.
But that we don't seem able to get, and
therefore I arn driven Vo the conclusion that
we must take for the moment the short vjew.
But we can plan for the long.

the affairs of the worid or of this country with
any assurance as Vo what resuit his action will

Who, two years ago, couid have foreseen Vhe

been mnade, mostIy in isolation, the vast forces
of the world, the herd instinct, and the
desperation of people who have neither work

events and a generai tendency which appear Vo,

Time and again I 'have put Vo myseif this
question: Who can sa>' that this view is ton

Vhe courage Vo stand up and say that it is
altogether unjustified? Honourabie members,
one shining truth stands out in this speech:
no one government, no one nation can hy
its own force overcome the present depression.
So far as I know, but one constructive international attempt had previously been made
Vo overcome this grave economic criais: it was
made by M. Briand when hie advocated *his
plan for a European union. But national haVte
and national suspicion kilied that plan.
This la the oni>' living, constructive agreement of vast international extent.

Nowhere. Wou1d it not therefore 'be wise

Right Hon. G. P. GRAHAM: Honourable

preliminary may I say Vo my honourable

friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien)
that I tbink he will get few people to join
him in his copious tears over the sacrifices
that the textile men have made. I have read
the commenta pro and con. The only sacrifice
made is a little item respecting linens, which
does not affect us very much. Textiles still
enjoy the high, higher and highest protection
<hat they had before this agreement was
made, and therefore I think you will realize
that my honourable friend had to pump up
a good deal of sympathy to become tearful
My -own
over the textile men's dilemma.
opinion, and I express it with great humility
in the face of the arguments that have been
presented, is that the world has gone crazy
on high protection.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It has gone
mad, and one of the quotations read by my
nonourable friend (Hon. Mr. Beaubien)
pointed out quite distinctly that the nations
of the world must get together in order to
discuss relations with one another, and that
until this is done and suspicion and hate disappear we can have no worlýd reaction
rather
better conditions. That
towards
destroyed the whole argument of the honourable gentleman in favour of higher protection.
Do not mistake me, honourable gentlemen.
I am not a free trader, but when honourable
miembers endeavour to tell us that the panacea
for all our troubles is to "soak" us with a higher
tariff I fail to follow their argument; though,
of course, I shall have to pay. Every nation
in the world has raised its tariff higher and
higher, and the situation has been getting
worse and worse, net only internationally, but
in individual countries.
I think my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) spoke politically for a time. I had
thought bis lecturing was a bidding to all to
rise above partisanship and deal with this
question in a great national spirit. I was
rather surprised, therefore, to observe him
descending to the level which the rest of us
are said to occupy, and talking party polities.
As a matter of fact I never heard a more enthusiastic Tory speech in my life. It is an
old saying that the proof of the pudding is
in chewing the strings. My honourable friend
brightened his speech with some remarks of
mine, made on a previous occasion. That part,
to my mind, was unanswerable, and was a bit
of a brilliant touch. I am not going to argue
about whether what I said was right or not;
sometimes I say the wrong thing; but I will
just ask my honourable friend and other
honourable members here to take the years
from the time when those remarks were made
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

down to the time when Sir Wilfrid went out
of power, and compare them with any Tory
régime, and say what the comparison would
show. The fifteen years that Sir Wilfrid
Laurier was in power were the brightest years
in the history of Canada, economically, internationally, and, I might say, socially as well.
As my honourable friend would ask, can anybody deny that?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Will the honourable
gentleman permit me to ask him a question?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

Certainly.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: First of all, would
he deny that Sir Wilfrid Laurier hardly
changed the tariff at all; and, secondly, that
from 1922 to 1930, when it was changed, we
lest more of our population than at any other
time in the history of this country?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am glad that
my honourable friend has taken in another
piece of territory. I will come to that in a
minute. I asked him whether anybody would
deny that the Laurier régime was the brightest period in the history of Canada. He does
net attempt to answer that. The allusion tc
the preference was absolutely correct, and the
result of the granting of that preference was
the brightest era in the history of the Dominion of Canada. Results mean more than
words or eloquence. And, as we have learned
since 1930, promises do not count; they do
net bring much in the way of results.
I say in answer to my honourable friend's
question that one year after the Liberal Party
came into power there was a change in the
fiscal policy of the Dominion, and that from
that date until after the War Canada was
I
Is that a fair statement?
prosperous.
brought in the War because at that time
we all went insane in regard to our business
relations. We were prosperous because money
was plentiful and we spent lavishly; but
immrediately the War was over the outlook
was net so good.
My honourable friend has referred to the
times from 1922 to 1930. Many people have
cerme into the country only to go out of it
again. Greatly exaggerated statements have
been made in this regard, but I have the record
that my honourable friend placed before the
House at one time. You really cannot judge
the success of a country by the number of
people coming and going. Many were deceived
by the allurements of the United States' high
tariff, which proved a delusion and a snare.
Now I am going to ask a question, and I
shall not confine it to my honourable friend,
because lie, like myself, does not know everything. Next to the régime of Sir Wilfrid

NOVEMBER 24, 193216
Laurier, was there ever one as prosperous as
that of the King Government, which, carried
out the policy enunciated by Sir Wilfrid? If
I were to sit down now, I think I should have
miade out a case against mny honourable friend
and his policy of high and higher protection.
I corne'now to the agreement. I arn not
going ta take any strong ground against this
agreement. I agree with my leader. I appreciate that the Britisher is not an easy man
te deal with. I would say this to my honourable friend <Hon. Mr. Beaubien), hvwever,
that if the carrying out of this agreement
re.sulte in conditions that are flfty per cent
ag good as those prevailing in the tume of
Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Mackenzie King, we
shall ail he glad. The honourable gentleman
lias told us that 250,000 men were out of
employment in 1930, and that certain things
were done. Then came higli tariffs, and tbree
times as many men are out of emnployment.
It *was promised that high tariffs shouýld cure
the evil, but surely my honourable friend
must admit that they have failed. I do not
think any persan eise will shake bis head at
that. Whatever else happened, the high tariff
did nat produce the promised resuit. This is
p7oof that this higher tariff nonsense is as one
muan, Thomas, said, "humhug." We can go
ta a certain point with aur tariffs, in the same
way that a business man can go ta a certain
point with bis prices and in the operation of his
finances, but beyon-d that it is siniply a case
of riding a willing horse ta death.
'Phroughout the world there is insanity on
the question of tariffs. We are trying ta make
ou-selves believe that we can lift ourselves
by the boat-straps, and in that way get out
of the condition into which we have got aurselves. It cannat be done. We must have
tariffs for revenue, but if nations are ta
prosper, the world as a whole mnust prosper.
As one honourable gentleman has said, no
nation can prosper alone, and I say that no
empire can prosper if it does not deal with the
outside world. If the nations of the warld
are ta prosper they must be willing ta trade
with ane another -on fair ternis, because
nations, like individuals, are not going ta buy
from others if they cannot seli ta theni and
exchange with theni. The United States is
beginning ta find that out, and it is being
borne in on the business men of that country
every day that they must reach some conclusion which will enabie thern ta trade with
the people of other nations.
Ail this does not mean that I arn a free
trader, but there are two or three points I
want ta impress upon the House. One is
that the régime af Sir Wilfrid Laurier was
superior ta any that preceded or followed it,

and that the régime of the King Government
was a clase second, proving that the poiicy
of high and higlier tariffs is not essential ta
the country's development, but is, as a matter
of fact, detrimental ta the best interests of a
country and of the world at large. The
Lord neyer placed us here that we niight
buiid a Chinese wall around the country,
saying that we would nat buy from other
countries, but baving the temerity ta try ta
make people think that they could sell their
goads ta oChers without buying froni others.
The objections ta t-hese agreements have been
expressed very accurately by my leader (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand).
As ta the rnaking of agreements, as I said
a moment aga, the British business man is
not an easy man ta trade with. Sanie of us
who think we knaw something about what
happened within thîs very peaceable conference-my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) could not have heard of it-know
that negotiations require a great deal of
patience on bath sides, as weil as diplomacy
and some horse-sense. I know the Govermnent
did not have an easy time, because it was
dealing with men who were born diplomate,
and who afterwards were trained ta be better
diplornats and thorough business men.
Some persan in what 1 will caîl the Lower
House, ta distinguish it frorn this one, also
did nie the honour of quoting something that
I said somewhere at some tume or other. While
ordinarily I would not for the life of me
mention anything said in a place to which I
should nat refer, yet I will speak about this,
because it was personal to nie.
It was a description of the attitude of the
Liberal Party in endeavouring ta secure preferences. What was that attitude? In the flrst
place, Sir Wiifrid Laurier and Mr. Fielding~
the Liberai Party-gave a preference ta the
Motherland.
My honourable friend frorn
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) wiil remember tbat it did not meet with enthusiastic
support. In fact, 'he himself bas criticized it
this afternoon. But the resuits for Canada
were wonderful. I have been criticized. for
saying that the motive was not altogether
altruistic, and I ask again, why should it be?
We received great benefit from having granted
a preference ta Great Britain. Without going
inta detail, I may say that the resuits show niy
statenient -ta have been perfectly correct. It
might be called prophetic now that the prophecy bas been realized. In granting the first
preference ta Great Britain Sir Wilfrid Laurier
allways niaintained that it shouid be dyone as
a gesture of friendahip and devotion ta the
Old Land, which for sanie tume had dons

SENATE
much for us by allowing our goods to enter
its markets comparatively free of tariffs.
The same objection was taken to what was
done at that time as was raised by my honourable friend this afternoon, namely, that
it was one-sided. I think results have shown
that it was not. I do not want to be harking
back to that every minute, but it seems to
relate to my remark about chewing the strings
of the pudding. Canada obtained results.
I

had the honour of sitting in the Imperial
Conference, and the Imperial Economic Conference as well-they sat on different days-in 1923.
The situation at that time was
peculiar. You can imagine what would have
been the situation last summer, when the

if it so happened that during the negotiations

such conditions it was not easy to negotiate,
for partisans are partisans-even in the Senate
I have discovered this-and each party was
just a little anxious about the outcome of
the approaching election. To make the story
as brief as possible. I may say that I suggested quietly-and the Canadian delegation
was with me-that because of the preference
which had been given for mutual benefit for
many years, and which had been increased, I
thought the time had arrived when Canada
would appreciafte some reciprocity. Broadly
and briefly, that is the way I put it. I think
I am not making public anything that I
should not make public when I say that the
British members of the Economic Conference
agreed with that presentation and expressed
the belief that something could be done. But,
mark you, the campaign was already on, and

did give us certain concessions on tobacco,
fish, and several other articles, which I cannot
enumerate. Of course, these concessions were
all subject to ratification by Parliament. It
was represented to them, through a letter
fron the Prime Minister-you can understand the delicacy of the situation-that
if at any time Great Britain desired to change
lier policy and give us a preference on commíodities in addition to those outlined, the
names of those commodities were to be put
on record. Wheat, I think, was the first item
mentioned; then came lumber, and fish, and
maybe a dozen other articles on which Canada would be helped most in case the British
representatives changed their policy. I may
say that the members of the British Government agreed that this was a very proper
request, but the election came along, and the
party that had made the tentative arrangeRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

ment with us was defeated. If my memory
serves me rightly, Ramsay MacDonald, the
Prime Minister of Great Britain, left Parliament free to say whether it would ratify the
agreements made tentatively with us. Parliament did not ratify them; consequently

statenent merely for the purpose of explaining the conditions under which the negotiations took place.
Who can question the wisdom of having
some kind of preferential arrangement with
the Motherland? I am sure I have never

heard any person do so. I am in favour of
preference, and endeavoured to make as much
progress as I could on that line, but with a
view to having free-will offerings ?rather than
bargainings by various parts of the Empire.
It was the people of Great Britain and not
the British Government who refused to grant
the suggestion of the Canadian representatives. I do not want to weary the House by
further reference to this matter, but I can
tell my honourable friend f·rom Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) that if he is desirous
of making a comparison of results, and not
of promises, I should like to have a lengthy
discussion with him some time.
Hon. R. FORKE: Honourable members,
after the very eloquent addresses that have
been made from both sides of the House, I
rise with some hesitation to make a few
remarks. It seemed to me that the first part
of the speech by the honourable member
for Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) was
bitterly partizan, and I must confess that
I was better pleased with the latter part.
No matter what any of us may say, or how
strong the party spirit may seem to be, I am
sure that at heart we all are willing to get
together in an effort to improve conditions.

I have jotted down a few lines, and, with
the permission of the House, I shall follow
them rather closely during the time I am
speaking. The people of Canada looked forward to the Imperial Conference at Ottawa,
which was a meeting for the discussion of
affairs of common interest to all countries

comprising the British Empire. The Conference is over and we have the result in the
agreements that were reached. It was a
meeting at which a spirit of good-will and
mutual helpfulness should have prevailed, but
it is somewhat doubtful whether any such
spirit existed, for we have heard a good deal
about the bargaining alleged to have taken
place there.
I intend to deal principally with the agreement between Canada and Great Britain. I
am afraid that in the making of this agree-

NOVEMBER 24, 1932
ment the bargaining spirit of the marketplace prevailed, the spirit that is actuated by
the principle of giving as littie and getting
as mucli as possible. The former Chancellor
af the Exehequer in Great Britain said that
ail the Dominions had been obsessed with
econornic nationalism and had looked solely
to what they could get, particularly from the
Mother Country. 1 do flot want ta be understood as endorsing that statement, but I think
it shows how some people ini the Old Country look upon this agreement. It is now
adlmitted that towards the end the Conference
was on the point of breaking up in an abrupt
manner, but such a terminatian could not be
permitted.
Lord Snowden has stated that at the 1930
Conference in London the Prime Minister of
Canada threatened-I t'hink that was the word
used-that if lis demands were not agreed to
hie would make arrangements with foreign
countries. These are rather strange words to
be used by the Prime Minister of this country
at a meeting that might be considered preliminary to the Ottawa Conference.
I cannot see that Great Britain stands ta
gain much, if anything, by this agreement.
But the distînguished delegates could not
afford to have it said that the Conference
had failed, that the Mother Country had met
hier children and they could not agree. I have
looked over the free list in the schedules, and
I rather think that a great many of the
articles mentioned there are likely to continue to came into this country from the
United States, duty paid. I had hoped for
something different. I admit that we may
export a great deal more lumber than we
have exported in the past, but I had hoped
for some developments beyond that.
Lord Snowden speaks very fantastically with
respect to the 8,000 articles that were to be
put on the free list, and states that the same
list was submitted to the Conference in three
different sehedules.
Under the agreement the tariff is supposed
to be adjusted on a competitive basis, in relation to the cost of production. A Tariff
Board is ta be set up f or the settlement of
differences that may ariise between Canadian
mianufacturers and British exparters, but the
final decision will always rest with Parliament.
Now, I wonder how much is likely to be
gained by any British exporter who appears
before the Tariff Board, while we have a high
tariff Government in power at Ottawa. I
am not saying that there is much to complain
about in this respect, but I am certain not
much will be gained.

167

In another place a list was given ta show
the duties that applied against certain coinmodities during previaus administrations, as
compared with the tariff that will be in effect
under the agreement. I imagine those figures
are correct, as they have not been denied, and
I will quote a few of them.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Is the honourable

Hon. Mr. FORKE: 1 will go on witb my

regret very mucb that the Mother Country
bas departed fro-m the policy that she had so
long followed and bas adopted that of protection. It was hy making this change that
she wa.s ahle to place the Dominions in a
preferred position. It mnay ultimately develop,
owing to unsettled conditions in Great Britain,
that we might have heen further ahead if
wo had increa.ed the preference on British
goods and continued to bave froc access to
British markets for our primary produce. The
right bonourable gentleman from Eganville
(Rigbt Hon. Mr. Graham) has pointed out
very clearly that for many years aîl our
primary
produots
bave
entered Great
Britain free, while other commodities have
enterod under low dutios. Surely Canada
has enjoyed a good market in the Old Land
for many years, and surely it was as little as
we could do to give some preference to
Britishi goods. The honourahle gentleman
from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beauhien) bas
said it required a great deal of courage to ask
for a preference in Great Britain. But I look
at the matter in a differont way. I think that
in consideration of the free market we have
hoon getting in Great Britain we should not
have heen too generous if we had given a
preference witbout asking anything in return.
However, wc bave got protection for our
goods, but I am not sure that it will prove
to ho of vory much value.
Perhaps the protection that is ta ho given
to wbeat, under the agreement, mnight ho considered in some quarters ta he an advantage
of first importance. A duty of six cents a
hushel is ta ho placed upon foreign wheat
entering Great Britain, and our wheat has a
preference to this extent. But we are told
that Canadian wheat must ho sold at the
world price. The Prime Minister has made it
plain that 'Canadian producers will not get
anc cent more hecause of this preference, and
the Right Hon. Stanley Baldwin bas said that
the British people will get cheaper food than
they ever got hefore. With a normal crop
Canada will have a large quantity of wheat

NOVEMBER 24, 1932
to seil on the markets of the world, outside
cf Great Britain. I amrn ot going to go into
this question, because it lias been discussed
at great iength in another place and I think
ail 'honourable members are welI posted as to
the situation. The United States, the Argentine, Australia and a great many other countries wiil lie pouring their wheat into Great
Britain, and it is very difficuit to say what the
world price will be. I feel certain that althougli the agreement may resuit ini certain
benefits to us, we shall get no advantage with
respect to the price of our wheat..
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: The United States
growers cannot slip t-heir grain into Great
Britain without paying six cents a bushel on it.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: But still they may be
able te ship it in. I ar n ot going further into
the matter at this time. Neither the Prime
Minister nor anyone else lias been able to
explain to what extent our farmers will benefit by this preférence of six cents a bushel.
1 have too mucli British blood in rny veins
to speak in a derogatory way about any
agreernent that miglit be of be-nefit to this
country and the British Isies, and I can only
hope that the final results wilI prove of some
value.
We are to get a preference on bacon to the
extent of free entry of 2,500,000 liundredweight, 'but I do not know whether we shall
profit mudli by that. However, we take it for
what it is worth, and I only hope that the price
of bacon will increase. I notice that the Minister of Agriculture no longer tells farmers te
raise more hogs, but ad-vises only that nothing
but the very best quality of bacon be produced. It is very good advice, but I doulit
very much that we shail ever be able to capture the Britishi bacon mnarket. A few years
ago I visited the bacon packing plants in
I)enmark and saw the type of bacon hogs.
From time to tirne we have been encouraged
to raise a type that wiil produce a better
quality of 'bacon. I have seen just as fine
pigs on the St. Boniface market as I saw
anywhere in Denrnark. But the Danish farmer
has the advantage of being oniy a comparativeiy short distance from the British market,
and I think lie will be able to pay the tariff
duty and stili compete successfuily with the
Canadian producer. I do not say this to discourage Canadian farmers from raising pork
for the British market-they have enough to
discourage thern at the present tirne-but that
is rny candid opinion frorn personai observation.
I arn very giad to know that Great Britain
has removcd lier imnport restrictions against
our cattie. We were toid that these restric-

tions were enforced to guard against the
importation of diseased stock, but I think
rnost of us suspected that this was not the
real reason. Tlie Canadian cattie trade will
be beneflted by the removal of the restrictions, cspecially if the tariff troubles continue
between the Irish Free State and Great
Britain. When overseas a few years ago I
had an opportunity of visiting several farms
in Scotiand during the rnonth of June, and
I found that on airnost every farrn Irishi
cattie were being fattened on grass with thé
addition of a small cake ration. Tliey were
very fine cattle; indeed we do not raise any
steers that I should consider better. The
removal of the restrictions may aise lielp to
improve the price of stocker cattie, that is,
cattie needing finishing. Horetofore no cattle
could bie shipped to Great Britain unless in
the finished state.
I regret that the wliole structure of these
agreernents is buiit upon the principle of
higlier protection. 'I lad lioped that Canada
wouid iead the way towards iower tariffs.
The whole worid seems to lie agreed that the
higli tariff wahIs which every country lias
erected are the main factors in tlie présent
economie situation. Leading atatesmen and
economists are agreed that the dépression is
to be attributed iargeiy to the biocking of
the avenues of trade by the erection of higli
tariff barriers, brouglit about by national
jeaiousy and fear. Indeed, I think fear is
a very im~portant 'factor in the present economie situation. To my mind tarifse play
mucli the same part as armarnents. Ail
nations to-day are crying out against excessive armarnents and urging that tliey be reduced, but no nation is prepared to take thle
lead. So it is in regard to tariffs: ail nations
deprecate high tariffs, but each hesitates to
lower its tariff, because it is afraid of its
neighbours.
'I desire to refer te économic conditions in
the Western Provinces.
The purcliasing
power of Western Canada lias dropped aimost
to zero. I repudiate any suggestion tliat the
people of Western Canada are hostile towards
our manufacturers, althougli tliat charge is
frequently ievelled at us. I arn aiways glad
to be able to buy goods manufactured in our
industrial centres. But what is the use of
producing goods that cannot be sold? The
réduction of the purdhasing power of our
people is bound to react disastrously on our
manufacturers, and I arn convinced that until
we remove the disparity between the prices
that the farmers have to pay for the goods
they buy and the prices they receive for the
goods they seli, we shall neyer enjoy real

SENATE
prosperity. However much the Government
may boost our manufacturing industries, while
the farmers have to sell their products at
world prices I do not think this agreement
can help Western Canada to sell the products
of the farm in foreign markets. On the other
hand, our manufacturers will find themselves
hard put to it to meet competition in Great
Britain, and this agreement will not be of
any use to them in foreign markets.
Recently while reading the life of Lord
Rosebery I came upon a passage that I
think might well be pondered by honourable
members at this time. I may say that when
Lord Rosebery was at the height of his
political career I was a young man and took
a very keen interest in British politics. The
speech of which this is an extract was
delivered fifty years ago, before an audience
in Australia:
It seems to me that hand in hand they-the
British nations-- may yet follow up a career of
usefuiness to mankind-led by those common
and eternal principles of justice which alone
can exalt and sustain a nation, which we
proudly boast and humbly hope have long
guided and sustained the British Empire, which
have been the pillar of cloud by day and the
pillar of fire by night, that have guided us to
many achieve.nents, and through so many

more likely you are to have friction. I for
one believe that the ties of blood, the ties
of history, the ties of common traditions,
will always prevail.
Since Lord Rosebery
spoke, fifty years ago, the British Empire
has on many occasions demonstrated its inherent strength to meet changing world conditions, and I do not see why the Mother
Country and the sister Dominions should not
continue to bless the world by their example
of just and righteous dealings with one another.

troubles.

risen and desire to speak.

[ believe that every day we remain united

we shall be less anxious to part.
I believe that every day we remain united
it will be considered more desirable that we
shall continue so, not merely for our own selfisli
interests, but for the interest of humanity at
large. I believe the connection of the British
Empire will remain--that it is desirable for
civilization that it should continue to exist. I
confess that each day we live we shall be more
and more unwilling to see this ancient Empire
of ours-raised with so much toil, colonized with
o mucli energy, cemented with the blood and
a-eat of so many generations-pass away like
a camp struck noiselessly in the night, split
into isolated and sterile communities. jealous
among themselves, disturbed by suburban disputes and parochial rivalries.
Now I do not pretend to define for a moment
what is the basis on which the British Empire
rests. I do not believe that such a conglomeration
bas ever been seen since the world began, and
I don't believe that any one here or outside
this room can give any satisfactory account to
the logical mind of the basis on which the
Empire rests, because it is not a matter of
compact or civil contract. The connection between Great Britain and the Colonies is a
marriage of the affections or nothing at all.
It is a sad mistake to imagine that the
British Empire can be held together only
by trade agreements of this kind.
Each
component part of the Empire must be left
to make its own arrangements and to follow
whatever line it thinks most to its benefit.
The more you try to bind the Empire together by means of trade agreements, the
Hon. Mr. FORKE.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
gentlemen-

The Hon. the SPEAKER: All honourable
members who desire to speak should do so
before the mover closes the debate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have no
desire whatever to ask for any special concessions in my favour.
It is true that I

appear nominally as the mover of the motion,
but in that capacity I have said nothing.
However, if you, Mr. Speaker, desire to invoke the rule, I am content.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Does the right

honourable gentleman desire to close the
debate?

Other honourable

members have

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. If anyone prefers to speak now it will not impinge

on my patience in the least; I am ready to
wait.
Hon. H. H. HORSEY: Honourable members, I am sure we have all listened tn
the debate with a great deal of interest.
I am always glad to hear my honourable
friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien),
for I am an admirer of his talents and
eloquence, but, without wishing to be personal
in any way, I think the criticism of that
speech by the righit honourable member for
Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) was, in
some respects, well founded. My right honourable friend from Eganville in his very
strong and eloquent speech conclusively
answered the somewhat partizan declaration
made by the honourable member for Montarville.
But -in one respect I must differ from my
right honourable friend. I am not just mildly
opposed to this Bill; I am opposed to it
practically in toto, because it seems to me
that we ought to maintain our fiscal freedom.
We are, of course, all for preference to increase trade within the Empire, but many of
us differ with respect to the methods to be
adopted to bring about that laudable end.

I repeat, honourable members, that we should

NOVEMBER 24, 1932
maintain our fiscal freedom. Lot us have ail
the conferences you like, but let it be understood beforehand that as a family of nations
we corne together for consultation only, to
explore ail the avenues of trade, and that we
bring our trade experts together to pool their
experience and information for the welfare
of ail the cornponent parts of the Empire.
Let us have a full and free exehange of ideas,
and theni let each representative go back home
and advîse his Governnient to take whatever
action rnay be decided on to increase trade
witih other parts of the Empire. This agreement is for a fixed termi of years. It is, in
my opinion, an agreement ta interfere ini one
another's affairs. It is an agreement to restrict
one another's operations in certain ways.
In everything I say this afternoon I desire
to deal with the subi ct from an independent
standpoint. I arn not going to try to defend
ahl that our party has done throughout its
history. Every party, es we know, makeés
mistakes. Outside this Chamýber we can take
up the various matters involved in this agreement and deal with them in a party spirit;
but in the remarks I amn about to males I
shall try to approach the Bill from a différent
angle.
Those who support this Bull and these trade
agreements, whioh are before us for consideration, do so for two main reasons. First,
they dlaim that these agreements wiil help to
strengthen the unity of -the Britishi Empire.
Some go so far as ta assert that the Empire
bonds are growing thinner and weaker, especially in the Dominions, and these agreements
are required to keep themn from breaking.
In the second place, supporters declare that
the pacte, if given a reasonable trial or test
for a sufficient time, would prove profitable
to Canada, Britain and other parts of the
Empire. They are very indefinite as to time
required for test, but some state one year
will suffice, others a couple of years, still
others think five years, and some that it will
take ten years to test them properly, and
that the agreements should be for that period.
Let us examine these two positions. First,
will the agreements tend to strengthen the
unity of the Empire? My reading of history
and my study of these agreements teacli me
that they will not, but that the very reverse
will happen. We must remember this is not
the first time that we have had British pref..
ei ential tariff arangements. Indeed, we tested
them out for many years, and they proved a
dismal failure at that time.
During our latter colonial days down to the
year 1849 there were preferential arrangements between Great Britain and the colonies.
Truc, it was before Conféderation and applied

171

only to united Canada and to the colonies
which we now know as the Maritime Provinces. And that arrangement came about in
a different way: it was made and imposed
upon us by Great Britain herseif. What was
the basie of those preferences that we then
tried out? We gave to Great Britain a preference on her manufactured products. We are
doing that by this agreement. In return Great
Britain gave ta our fariers a préference an
their wheat-a real préférence without any
nullifying clause that it muet be sold at world
prices. She gave us a similar preference on
timber and flour. At that time wheat could
be brought into this country from the United
States at a very low rate of duty, and could
be ground into flour here and exported ta
England as Canadian flour, thus getting the
full préference. These particular industries
flourished at that time. But I want to ask
honourable gentlemen how the préferences resulted in the end? How did they affect the
British people? How did they affect the
Canadian people?
Firet of ah, how did they affect the British
people? At that time there was a corn law,
and as Britain will have to have a corn law
if she is going .to give a preference to the
Dominions, the situation will be virtuaily the
same. Under the preférences formcrly given
to us by Great Britaîn thé prices of food
graduaily rose until a large proportion of
the population of Britain was on the verge
of starvation; food riots occurred throughout
the land, and the preferences became s0
burdeneome that the Governinent which had
grantcd them had to cancel thein altogether.
I submit, therefore, that after a real trial
the preferences turned out very badly so far
as the British people were concerned.
How did they turn out for us? When
these préferences were cancelled the Canadian millers and farmers and lumbermen were
greatly disappoînted; in fact, they became
so enraged by the canceilation that 1 think
we may say that it was one of the main
causes of the only senious movement for annexation that we have had i our whole
history. Many of our people at that time
wished ta dissolve the bonde of Empire,
change their ailegiance and join with the
people of the United States. That was a
very bad experience sa far as the binding
together of the Empire was concerned.
How did this ail turn out as a matter of
tra de? It is true that under the préferences
certain of aur industries flourished to a considerable degree. I think that we had the
better side of the bargain, and when the
British Government withdrew there was great
chagrin over the situation. But aur people

172

SENATE

continued to carry on, and they gained their
fiscal independence and freedom, and it was
only a few years later, in 1854, when Lord
Elgin was Governor, that they were able to
make a reciprocity treaty with the United
States. Then for eleven years we had the
greatest development of wealth and extension
of trade that had occurred up to that time,
and a prosperity far exceeding anything that
had resulted f.rom the preferences themselves.
That is an historical review of a fair and
square trial of British Empire preferences.
Let us apply the lessons to be learned from
that to the agreement that we now have
before us. If, by this agreement between
Great Britain and Canada, Britain puts a
tax on the food of her people-on wheat,
butter, cheese, milk products, poultry, eggs
and fruit-as some people say it does, are
not the British people going to feel the results,
more especially when exchange reaches a
parity, and when the issue of free or taxed
foods is concretely and specifically put before
them at the next election are they not going
to show their disapproval?
We must not
prophesy, but past experience shows us that
whenever the issue was placed before the
people they voted for free food; and we know
that it was when they had free food and
freedom of trade that Great Britain, with
her 40,000,000 people, became the wealthiest
and greatest trading nation in the world.
For seventy-five years she accomplished a
development that has never been equalled
by any other nation with similar resources
and with a population living within such a
restricted area.
If, on the other hand, these agreements do
not place a tax on food, what then? Where
are our exporters of food and raw materials
to look for their markets? If they do not get
preferred treatment for their exports in the
British market, that market is of no value to
them, so far as preferred price is concerned.
In the clauses of this agreement there are
many restrictions that any man of common
sense can discover by reading them overrestrictions which are likely to cause trouble
and friction and disagreements between the
peoples of the British Empire. I purpose
reading just two or three of these clauses before commenting on them.
Article No. 10 of the trade agreement with
the United Kingdom reads as follows:
His Majesty's Government in Canada undertake that protection by tariffs shall be afforded
against United Kingdom products only to those
industries which are reasonably assured of
sound opportunities for success.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY.

Article No. 11 says:
His Majesty's Government in Canada undertake that during the currency of this agreement
the tariff shall be based on the principle that
protective duties shall not exceed such a level
as will give United Kingdom producers full
opportunity of reasonable competition on the
basis of the relative cost of economical and
efficient production, provided that in the application of such principle special consideration
shall be given to the case of industries not fully
established.
Then Article No. 12 says:
His Majesty's Government in Canada undertake forthwith to constitute the Tariff Board
for which provision is made in the Tariff Board
Act, 1931.
And, finally, Article No. 13 says:
His Majesty's Government in Canada undertake that on the request of His Majesty's
Government in the United Kingdom they will
cause a review to be made by the Tariff Board
as soon as practicable of the duties charged on
any commodities specified in such request in
accordance with the principles laid down in
Article Il hereof and that after the receipt of
the Report of the Tariff Board thereon such
report shall be laid before Parliament and
Parliament shall be invited to vary wherever
necessary the Tariff on such commodities of
United Kingdom origin in such manner as to
give effect to such principles.
What do these clauses mean? I think it
would be impossible for anybody to say,
because the interpretation put upon them by
one man would differ from that put upon
them by another. But Article 13 speaks of
the appointment of a Tariff Board; and no
matter how good and strong and able may
be the men who are appointed to that Board,
it will be a Tariff Board of Canadians. Are we
going to be the judges of our own disputes?
Are we going to have our own judges try the
differences that arise between England and
Canada in regard to tariff matters? I can
see there, honourable gentlemen, a very fruitful source of trouble in the near future. How
can those tariff commissioners settle accurately what constitutes reasonable competition, or what is the relative cost of production
of various articles produced here and in
Britain? When a case comes before the
Tariff Board for a finding of facts, or an interpretation of them, no matter how sincere our
tariff commissioners may be-and I know we
shall have good men-the fact that they are
Canadians will, it seems to me, open the door
to unconscious partiality and to the possibility,
almost the certainty, that the decisions of the
Board will be unsatisfactory. This will not be
conducive to the cordiality and harmony and
good-will that have prevailed up to the time
of the making of the fixed bargain represented
by this Bill.

NOVEMBER 24, 1932
Our whole development has been towards
greater freedom. It has been a steady march
forward, unhampered by restrictions and conditions, until politically we are absolutely
free to manage our own affaira within and
without the country. We gained our fiscal
freedom and independence, as 1 showed, in
1849, when the then existing preference was
done away with as a failure. Fiscal freedom
and independence enabled us to make trade
agreements with any country we wished, and
in any way we desîred; and under that system
we have become, with ten million people, one
of the leading trading countries of the world.
We should not forget, I think, that it was
under political and fiscal freedom that we
came triumphantly through the greatest test
that the Empire has ever been called upon toi
bear, the Great War, and were able to withstand the ordeal when other empires, bound by
greater restrictions, went to pieces.
At 6 o'clock the Senate took recess.
The Senate resumed at 8 p.m.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY:
Honourable members, before six 'o'clock I was endeavouring
to show that this trade agreement between
the Mother Country and Canada would flot
tend to strengthen the bonds of unity throughout the Empire, as some of its supporters
have claimed it would. 1 referred to an historic instance where British preferences became one of the main causes of the only
serious annexation movement that we have
ever had. I also sought to show that the
attempt to carry out the meaning and purport
of certain clauses of the Bill, especially those
clauses relating to the powers of the proposed
Tariff Board, would almost inevitalbly lead
to disappointment, friction and disharmony
as contrasted with the cordial good-will that
has always existed under a voluntary system.
My honourable friend from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) spoke of a one-sided
agreemient. I do not wish to enter into any
political controversy, but I would remind him
that the agreement -of which he spoke was
continued in effect alter his own friends were
in power.
Supporters of the present agreement contend that if it is given a reasonably fair trial
it will prove profitable to Canada, to Britain
and indirectly to other countries. Well, how
ean it, when to a considerable degree it is
based upon increased tariffs? The Bill does
flot even pretend to create new or additional
business, 'but merely diverta a portion of the
Empire's foreign trade into Empire channels.

1V~

That ia a very laudable and desirable objective if it can be profitably realized. But we
have to count the cost of ahl actions of this
kind, and -I think we should give careful consideration to the extra burdens that would be
imposed upon our people ini consequence of
such diversion of our foreign trade. Most
Canadians are consumera of some goods imported from foreiga countries. I[n ail our
homes and places of business there are commodities that have been purchased abroad.
Some of the many reasons for this situation
are: inability to produce certain articles in
Canada, the production abroad of some gooda
at prices lower than are possible here, and
the prompt service that is available with
respect to some types of machinery and
implements. Perhaps I shahl be permitted
to enlarge a littIe on the third reason. The
owner of an implement made in the UJnited
States is able to get any necessary parts at
short notice, probably within a day or two
if he orders by telephone or telegraph, whereas parts for a machine made in Great Britain
or some Dominion might not be procurable
without a delay of weeks or perhaps months,
umiess, as la unlikely, a complete supply were
always kept in stock in this country.
Now, the effect of these Bills la to compel
Canadians to pay a higher customs duty if
tbey wish to buy any foreîgn article; in other
words, they have to pay a penalty; or they
can go to Britain or some other Empire
country and buy similar goods, but even
though these goods are said to be on the
free list, high taxes must be paid. True,
they are somewhat lower than the customs
duties on foreign made goode, but still they
are comparatively high.
Let me put it another way. We will say
that we have a body of Canadians wishing,
for various reasons, to purchase foreîgn goads,
and also to buy more freely within the British
Empire. Those people are confronted with
two high tariff walls. One, for convenience,
we will cail the foreign wall-an extremely
high wall and very difficult to scale. Then
we have the other wall, the British Empire
Preference wall, almost as high as the foreign
wall ini the textile schedule, for example, and
very low in no particular whatever, so far
as taxation is coneerned. There is not an
article in these acheduhes that comes in free
of taxeb; every commodity from Britain and
the other Dominions of the Empire must pay
a heavy tax.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Linenà and cutlery are put on the free list.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. HORSEY: What about the 3 per
cent excise? What about the dumping or
exchange duty, which averages from 15 to 20
per cent? What about the sales tax of something like 20 per cent on goods from Great
Britain that are said to be allowed free entry?
You can call them whatever you like, but
they are taxes that all our people have to
pay on every article from Great Britain or
any other part of the Empire.
There are really three high walls, but I
wish to emphasize only two. There is the
intermediate high tariff wall as well as the
other two that I have already mentioned.
Behind these three high tariff walls we have
our manufacturers carrying on their operations and enjoying what amounts to a monopoly of the Canadian market. I ask honourable gentlemen, do you think that is
going to be to the advantage of our people
who want to buy Empire goods more and
more freely? I subinit that it is wholly against
the national interest. Not only do we tax
our people in every direction, but these three
higlh walls shut out imports.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Are these
new taxes that the honourable member is
speaking about, or did they exist before the
agreement?
Hon. Mr. HORSEY: I am not going to
enter into an argument as to whether our
party is responsible for high or low taxes. I
say some of these tariff duties on the items
covered by the agreement have been raised
since 1930.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: But I inferred that these are new taxes created by the
agreement.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY: No, I do not say that.
I say some of them have been raised higher
than they were before 1930. I repeat, we
have now three high tariff walls: the general,
the intermediate and the British preference.
Behind these three high tariff walls the
Canadian manufacturer has virtually a mnonopoly of the Canadian market. I submit that
this simply penalizes those who desire to buy
imported, rather than pay too high a price
for Canadian goods. These walls have been
erected for a purpose-to shut out foreign
goods, and in many cases Empire goods, which
the people would find it very profitable to
buy.
If we shut out these imports, if we will
not buy freely from foreign or from Empire
countries, it means that we shall not be able
to sell freely to those countries. Exports are
paid for by imports. If our farmers cannot
freely sell their surplus food producte to
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

foreign countries or to our sister Dominions,
their purchasing power will shrink so, much
that eventually our manufacturers will find
they have no home market. The lower our
purchasing power, the fewer goods the manufacturer produces; the fewer goods ho produces, the less labour he requires in their
production; and the final stage is an increase
of unemployment with all its attendant distress. So in the end every class of the community is adversely affected.
The whole
economic machinery of trade slows down, both
imports and exports decrease in volume, for
lack of purchasing power our factories close
down, and in a short time there is a lamentable increase of unemployment. If the circulation of the blood is defective the body
becomes anemie. And so with trade: if circulation of trade is impaired, all classes in
the community are adversely affected-farmers, labourers, clerks, professional men, manufacturers; at last they are all drawn down
into the deepest depression, into what is now
beginning to look like a bottomless pit. Instead of opening up trade channels with our
sister Dominions and foreign countries by
lowering duties and taxes, we have followed
the opposite course, with the result that I
have indicated.
There are many features of these Empire
pacts open to attack. but I do not intend to
refer to them all. Nor do I wish to confine
my remarks to negative or destructive criticisms; I would rather try to suggest something constructive. The destruction and dislocation occasioned by the Great War, the
aftermath of senseless speculation indulged in
by many of us, and the extreme nationalism
expressed in higher and higher tariffs-some
of then perhaps justified as emergency
measures to preserve credit and exchangethese are, as we all know, sone of the main
causes of this great, world-wide depression.
Nearly all persons agree that freer trade
is profitable when practised by inter-trading
countries. Should we not, then, as Canadians
turn away fron this false objective of economic warfare and lead the way towards trade
revival by announcing our willingness, first
of all, to clear the channels of trade within
the British Empire by a substantial reduction
of duties and taxes all along the line-a reduction that would admit British goods to
our markets more freely and give relief to
the great body of our suffering producers
and consumers, and aIso more competition to
our manufacturers as a spur to their efficiency
and self-respect?
The most eminent economists and statesmen in all countries declare that the greatest
step the different countries of the world can

NOVEMBER 24, 1932
take ta help back prosperity is ta start trading
a.mong thernselves by the lowering, or abolition where possible, of the high customs
duties'-they impose egainst one another.
In the face of this the most tragic of al
world depressions, when international trade
is crippled and blocked, with the result that
credit and currency values have been seriously
affected, when transportation has dwindled and
as a resuit unernployment and distress are the
lot of s0 rnany millions ini the world to-day,
it is surely time ta seek within and without
the Empire ta apply the healing remedies of
peace and good-will, ta drap the economie
armaments of ernbargoes and high, exclusive
tariffs, and for Canada at Ieast ta let it be
known ta ahl peoples with whom she trades
that she is prepared ta sit down with any of
their representatives and try ta work out
mutual agreements along voluntary and freer
lines.
We should give up mumbling about Imperialism and at the sarne time striking selfish, fixed bargains through confiicting interests, with high tariff protection prominent
in. the picture. Let aur country work ta
elimînate mutual tariff fighting, and profit by
the lesson proved frorn this great world experience-that ail high tariff cambatants, no
inatter how bold and blustering a front they
exhibit, are on the samne road ta stified trade
and increased unemplayrnent. Let us here in
Canada give a lead ta the coming World
Economic Conference and saund the bugle
cail for a tariff armistice whîch wili precede
a revival of trade intercaurse based upon international tarif! disarmament.
Hon. P. J. PARADIS: Honourable rnembers, I do not intend ta discuss at iength the
provisions of this Bil, because I believe that
during the last f ew weeks enough bas heen
said in another place fully ta acquaint mast
of us with the merits or demerits of the
measure. In fact, every clause of the Bull,
as well as every item of the different
schedules, bas been examined, closely scrutinized, and dissected ta such an extent that
my imagination fails ta find a fresh argument
ta advance or a new form. in wbich, ta present
it. I therefore purpose ta limit my remarks
ta the single item of ashestos.
Asbestos is one of the few items that
appear bath an the list of concessions that
we received frarn the Governrnent of the
United Kingdam and on the . list of concessions that we made to them. On referring ta
page 53 I find in echedule C, between the
words "'Other Fish, canned," and "Zinc," the
word "Asbestos." This, I arn informed, represente asbestos ini its raw state, that ie, asbestos
fibre.

175

During the past year asbestos fibre lias been
admitted ta England free of duty. On the
làth of the present month the concession was
extended for a period of five years. This
means that for the next five years Canadian
asbestoe fifýre may be imported into, the
United Kingdorn free of duty. A similar concession is extended ta Rhodesian fibre. The
only other country producing asbestos fibre
ta any extent is Russia. Sa according ta this
agreement Russian asbestos fibre is subi ect
ta a duty of 10 per cent ad valorem; that
is ah. Small depasits of asbestos fibre are
found in the states of Arizona and Vermont,
and in Cyprus, but not in sufficient quantities ta compete with aur raw product.
Now, what benefit are we gaing ta obtain
frorn this concession? It may surprise honourable members ta hear that we cannot compete i the English market with Rhodesian
asbestos, for the simple reason that asbestos
fibre in Rhodesia is produced by kaffirs, who
are paid at the rate of a shilling a day,
whereas the Canadian wage scale is about
32.50 a day. It niay be urged that on
accaunt of the long distance frorn Rhodesia
ta England we miglit get sorne advantage
in freiglit. The latest figures I have obtained
frorn England show that the freight from
Rhodesia ta London is $18.50 a ton. From
Thetford, Quebec, we have ta pay a freiglit
rate of $16.50 a ton. This advantage of only
$2 a ton is nat sufficient ta overcome the
competition. of the Rhodesian producers.
Russia, as miglit be expected, can meet aur
campetition. The asbestas producers of that
country quate prices from 10 ta 20 per cent
below ours. Therefore we shall not get any
advantage at ail fram the concession macle ta
us by the British Government. While we
enjoyed this concession last yéar we obtained
no increase of business.
Naw, as ta the concessions that we made,
anather situation presents itself. I refer ta
article 312, on page 69 of sohedule E, which
reads as fallowe:
Asbestos in any forma other than crude, and
aIl manufactures thereaf, when made from
crude abesto. of Empire origin: British preferential tariff, free; intermediate tariff, 22J
per cent; general tariff, 25 per cent.
We manufacture a large variety of ashestos
products, ranging all the way freim asbestes
cernent ta textiles and packings. By sbesescement products I mean shingles, flat sheets
and corrugated sheets, aI of which have been
manufactured and used extensively in this
country for years. The shingles are used for
roofing anid siding, the fiat sheets for walls,
and the corrugated sheets for steel-frarned
structures like grain elevators. You will see
ther on the grain elevators in Mentreal, Van-

SENATE

couver, Quebec and elsewhere. If the duty
of fifteen per cent previ-ously imposed on
British goods coming to this country is heing
removed, and the product of British menufacturers carn be imported into Canada free
of duty, I meintain that the Canadian manufacturers cannot meet the competition. I arn
surprised thaît the Government let this pass,
the policy in this regard being so ddfferent
from that followed in relation to other articles.
My friends have been compiaining of higher
tarifis ail the time; in this case I arn eompluining of e Iow tarif!. I do not see the logic
of it. It would seem that the Government
had become, if not a free trade Government,
at aiýl events e low tarif! Governanent.
I am speaking as one who bas had some
experience. Although I am not interested in
this business, I arn familier enough with it to
state that if the business of menufacturing
these products in this country is not comnpletely ruined hy the free entry of British
asbestos products, dt will be greatly inlured.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Do they make finished
asbestos products in England?
Hon. Mr. PARADIS: In England there are
large manufacturers of asbestos produots.
Most of the trade is controlled by the firm o!
Turner-.Newhall, who have a very large
business. They are operating with Rhodesian
mines; so they have the benefit, which we
have not, o! a low fibre cost and a low cost
of labour in manufarturing. These are my
reasons for claiming that our business will be
greatly injured, if not ruined, should the
presenit provision be permitteil to remain.
I arn told that the Governinent, or some
mnember of the Governrnent, admitted that
a mistake had been made in this case, and 1
have brought up the question here wit'h th'e
intention of asking my right honourable friend
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) to place the situa1 arn

as to whether or not this is a good deal for

Canada. I wish to discuss for a short time
the agricultural end of the question, and to
say that this is the kind of deal I have been
looking for during the twenty-four yeers thet
1 have been in Parliament.
This agreemnent opens to the farmers of
Canada the great rnarket of the United
Kingdom. Personally 1 think it is the best
deal ever consummated within the British
Empire, or, in fact, any other empire.

Right Hon.

Mr.

MEIGIIEN:

Hon. Mr. PARADIS:

Except

Quite right.

Hon. Mr. SHARPE: There is no use in
looking to the United States for rnarkets,
becausc no sooner have we properly established ourselves in order to export to them
than up goes their tarif! and we are shut out.
I should like to take a few moments to
show how the United States have raised the
tarif! against Canada at every opportunity.
They have raised týheir tarif! on four different
occasions during recent years. In 1913 there
wvas the lmndcrwood tariff, in 1921 the Emergency tarif!, in 1922 the Fordney tariff, and
These
in 1930 the Hawley-Smoot tarif!.
tariffs work in this way. In 1913 our cattie
entered the United States free; to-day we
pay three cents a pound. Hogs were free in
1913; to-day we pay three dollars apiece on
them. Chickens and geese paid one cent a
pound in 1913; to-day they pay eight cents
a pound. In 1913 the duty on other poultry
wvas two cents a pound; to>-day it is ten cents.
Beef and veal were free in 1913; to-day they
pay six cents a pound. Pork wvas free in 1913;
to-day the duty is two and a haîf cents a
pound. Eggs were free in 1913; to-day they
pay ten cents a dozen. Butter paid two and
a half cents a pound in 1913; to-day it pays
fourteen cents a pound. These figures show
that, at every opportunity they raised the
tarif! ag-ainst us and shut out our produets.
Now, I want to show how the tarif! of 1930
affected the people of this country. In 1930
we shipped 236,000 head of cattie to the
United States; in 1931-after the Hewley-

NOVEMBER 24, 1932
Smoot tariff came into effect--we shipped
39,000 head. In 1930 we shipped 26,000 pounds
of chilled or fresli meat; in 1931 the quantity
was redueed to 3,000 pounds. In 1930 we
shipped hog products to the extent of 5,000,000
pounds; in 1931 we shipped onfly 2,000,000
pounds. In 1930 we shipped 90W,000 pounds
of pickled pork; in 1931 this was reduced to
125,000 pounds. In 1930 we shipped live
poultry to a total of 54,000 birds; in 1931
we shipped 4,000 birds. In 1930, of dead
poultry, we shipped 660,000 birds, and in 1931
only 98,000. Why we should continue to
look to the United State!s for a miarket for
our goods is more than I can understand.
There are many items on which the farmer
gets a preference in the British market under
this Bill, but I will deal with only a few of
them. We get a preference on wheat of six
cents a bushel; on wheat flour of ten per
cent; on barley ten per cent; on poultry ten
per cent; eggs ten per cent; cheese fifteen per
cent; butter tliree cents per pound; apples
one dollar per barrai; lumber tan per cent;
lead tan par cent; zinc ten par cent and
copper four cents a pound.
By reason of the splendid work of our dalegation, the embargo was lifted from our cattie.
We are getting a quota of 280,000,000 pounds
of hog products and are being put on the same
footing as the British grower.
Many say that the wheat praference does
not amount to an.ything, but I will tell you
what it means to the people of this country. If
a Canadian Ioadad a vessel with 300,000
bushels of wlieat in Montreal and took it to
Liverpool, and thera it met a Ruasian vessel,
or a vessai from some othar foreign country,
with an equal cargo of grain, what would
happen? The Canadian vessel would be unloadad frae; but before a single bushel could
be unloaded from the foreign vassel $18,000
would have to be paid. I regard that as a
pratty substantial preferanca in the British
market.
As to our quota of hog products, amounting to 280,000,000 pounds, with our chaap
Western grain-wlieat, oats and barley-we
can supply this quantity to the British market; and even if my honourable friend from
Brandon (Hon. Mr. Forke) had soma doubt
about the quality of our hog-Hon. Mr. FORKE: No. I said they were
jusgt as good in St. Boniface as in Den-mark.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: I beg the honourable
gentleman's pardon. I have bean talking to
packers in this country who tell me that when
our hams and bacons are proparly cured they
secure a pramiumn in the British market. Our

177

great trouble bas bean the embargo against
our cattia. This is now removad, and if our
farmars will turu, to the production of cattie
and hogs they can use a great deal more of
thair land for raîsing coarse grains instead of
wheat, and we shall not have such a great
surplus of wheat year after year.
What a wonderful deal this would be for
the farmers of this country if conditions ware
only normýal! But conditions are not normal,
and the price of everything grown and raised
by the farmars lias neyer been at such a low
ebb. Ini addition to this, for every carload or
shipload that we send te Great Britain there
is a discount of from twenty-five to thirty par
cent on every dollar that comas back. We
are therefore deprived of a great deal of the
benafit securad for us hy the Prime Minister
at the Imparial Conference.
I should like honourable gentlemen to considar for a few moments the conditions in the
West. I speak of the West becausa I know
the conditions there muai better than in the
East. Five years ago it took the prîca of oneeighth of a car of wheat to pay the freight
on that car; to-day it takes the price of haif
a car of wheat to pay the freiglit. Farmers
to-day are sellîng wheat as low as twenty to
thirty cents a bushal, barley at from eight te
fiftaen cents a bushel, oats at from six to
ten cents a bushel, chickans at one cent par
pound, good turkays at from thirty-flve cents
to a dollar each, sliaep at thirty-flva cents per
head, and beaf at one cent a pound.
'Referring now to the selling agency of the
Wliaat Pool, of which Mr. John I. MoFarlane
is, manager, I may say that thara lias been
some criticism of the Govarnment in guaranteaing to the banks the sum nacassary to
handie the wheat. But if tiare had net been
some steadying influence in the rush season
of the year, the price of wheat at country
points would have beau down to tan cents a
bushel. What the Governinent did meant a
great deal more than would any bonus that
could have beau given. Evary farmer in the
We.st sliould thank the Government for wliat
it did in this connection.
-If a farmer had borrowed $5,000 in 1929,
whan whaat was at eue dollar a bushel, he
could tien have paid off the loan with 5,000
bushals of wiaat; but witi wieat selliug at
twenty-five cents a bushel, as it is to-day,
20,000 bushels would be raquirad to pay off this
boan. Mr. S. J. Gibson, of St. Charles, Manitoba, took 51 chiakens, liaving a total weight
of 324 pounds, or about %~pounds per bird,
to the Harris Abattoir, and lie received for
tiamn a chaque for $3.24, or one cent a pound.
I hava another statament, with reference to a

man who sold eight steers, weighing 5,000
pounds, to the ilarris Abattoir, for wbicb he
received, after expensos woro paid, $49.80, or
less than a cent a pound.
Witb conditions like those, how can a farmer
pay anytbing? Hie can bardly live. Thousands of farme are being sold for taxes, and
in many cases the farmers are losing thoir
homes. Think of the business man who has
lest bis income, or of the clerk who has lost
bis job and bis salary, and, as in many cases,
bis home. People in the cities are being
taxed to carry the uncmploycd, and many
citizons of moderate means are losing their
ail. The other day in Winnipeg I met a
retired business man who bcd investod his
money in industrial stocks fromn wbich, at one
time, be received an inoome of over $12,000.
To-day that man's income bas ail gene, with
the e2xception of about $1,000 per year, and
he must start ail over again.
I cannot believe that the Prime Minister
undorstande the real condition of the people.
0ur farmers are facing rein because of the
disparity between buying and selling prices.
The Britisb pound is now at $3.60, a discount
of 25 per cent. If we went off the gold stand,ard and brougbt our currency to the lovel of
the British pound, the resuit undoubtedly
would 'be an incroase of from 12 to 15 cents
a bushel in the prico of wbeat; we should
get $20 more for a 1,200-pound steer, and
butter, cheese, eggs, pork and ail cf her farm
products; would command higher figures. Virtual]y ail our important competitors in agricultural products throughout the world, exceýpt
the United States, have gene off the gold
standard. The Australian pound is worth
$2.93, and as a resoît Australia obtains an advantage over us not eniy in the British
market, but aise in the Chinese and Japanese
markets, witb respect te wheat and fleur. The
New Zeaiand pound is wortb $3.33, and therefore the farmers of that ceuntry can soul beef,
butter and varieous ether products in England more cbeaply than we can. Twenty-six
nations, including meet of those in South
America, are off the gold standard, and mnany
of tbemn are eur chief cempetitors in soe
lines of produce that we seil te Great Britain.
Listen te wbat seme business men say.
Bruce Burns, President of Burns Brothers, a
firm wbich bas sbipped 3,000 bead ef cattie
te Britain this yoar, declaros:
If the pound wvas anywhere near par we
could pay $20 mere en the St. B3oniface market
fer every experit steer.
F. N. Baker, of 'Canadian Meat Packers,
states:
In exchange alene we lost $1.40 en every 100
pounds ef bacon bogs.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE.

And J. J. 'Coyle and Company, produce
dealers, say:
The difference in exehange as between Britain
and Canada operates as a premium te Australian
and New Zealand butter. It is a serieus
matter, cnd wben the pound droýpped te $4 we
stopped exporting butter te Great Britain.
New take wbeat. On Octeber 24 the p.ound
wcs at $3.62, and according te Broombail the
Liverpool price that day for Ne. 1 Northorn
Atlantic wbeat, for October shipment, was

26s. 9d. per quarter of 8 bushols. Tbis werked
eut at $4894 per quarter, er G0ý cents per
bushel. If the shilling bcd been convertible
into 24 cents, the price would have been $6.42
per quarter, or 80J cents per bushel. The
exohange was taken into consideration in the
price of 601 cents as quoted that day in the
Winnipeg papers.
If we were tied up te the British pound we
should be getting at toast 15 cents a 'bushel
more for our whoat. On this yoar's crop of

450,000,000 bushels that would me-an $67,000,000. Consider the additional money we should
get for our other products that we scll in
Englcnd, sucb as othor grains, cattie, bogs,
cheese, butter, eggs, minerals, and se f ertb.
We could easily bave 100 or 125 million
dollars more te spend. In other words, we
sbould have se much more money for the
purcbase of ma-nufactured goode and tbe payment of debt, and as a consequence the
wheels of commerce would bo epeeded up, a
great deal of employment would be made
available and conditions in general would ho

very much improved.
l-t is stated that we muet romain on the
gold standard becauso we ewe se mucb money
in New York. But wo pcy New York in
eitber geodes or gold, net witb our papor
moey. The debt of Great Britain in New
York je many times greater than ours, yet
she is off the gold standard. If we tee discarded that standard the United States would
increase their purchases from us, and ive would
buy more from that country. In my opinion
the Canadian dollar sbould bo on the same
standard with the British pound. If it were,
we should get the full benefit of this splendid
trade agreement.
I want te toil bonourable members that
there is ne better spirit anywbcre in the world
tban ie Western Canada. We bave passod
thTough mcny depressions cnd bave always

NOVEMBER 24, 1932
Hon. G. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Honourabie
members, 1 wish to make a few remarks, not
upon the merits of this Bill, but with respect
to some of the criticiams that have been
leveiled against it. Realýizing the fnilibility
of human judgment, I wouid not vote against
this Bill even if I were convinced it was
wrong, because the prinoiplie of it seems -to
have commended itself to ail Canada. The
honourable leader of the opposition in this
HouseIf opposition
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
there be.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: The honourabie leader ofAn Hon. SENATOR: -the other sîde.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I arn giad
to know that there is not an opposition here.
The honourable leader of the other aide has
st.ated that the Government of Canada had
a mandate from the Canadian people to
negotiate an agreement with the British Government, and that there wa8 a duty to open
negotiations to that end. He added that he
did noV objeet to the agreement in itself, and
he conflned himself to criticism of the provision that the agreement shahl be binding
upon Canada for five years. But my honourable friend doea not contend that there were
any strrings to the mandate. It was a general
authorization to negotiate an agreement, and
such authorization does not imply that there
shahl or shahl noV be a time limit. If I
authorize an agent to rent my bouse, I cannot
complain if he renta it for five years; I cannot
argue that he should have made the tenant
a tenant at wili. So far as I can recail, no
person warned the Government againat making
an agreement which, would be binding upon
Canada for a definite period, and I think
it is unreasonable now to complain, that a
definite period bas been set. This agreement
is one such as has neyer before been entered
into by any country. It is a new departu re,
which commends itself Vo our people,
We know that Parliament can undo what
it lias done, and the right honourable leader
of the opposition in another place has stated
he does not consider a nesw Parliament would
be bound to respect this agreement longer
than it desired to do so. -In the British
House of Commons it was also said that a
new Parliament would noV be bound, except
perhaps in bonour, to maintain the agreement,
and t-hat no Parliament can bind its successors, unlesa the successors choose to respect
the action of their predecessors.
I consider that the failure to fix a definite
period would have been wrong and might bave
defeated the ratification of the agreement. In
53721-11,

179

my opinion the omission of such a provision
from the Reciprocity Agreement of 1911 had
more than almost anything else to do with
the repudiation of that agreement by our
people. I know that, for I took part in the
election campaign of that year, and throughout this country the burden of the song of
those opposed to the agreement was that the
Americans wouid be able to terminate it
whenever they desired to do so. That is to
say, flot that our neighbours in the southern
republie would have attempted to be unfair
or dishonourable, but sîmply that there was
nothingc to bind them for any delinite term
of years.
In Canada and ail over the British Empire
we boast that our constitution has broadened
down from precedent to precedent throughout
the centuries. We have no written constitution, and we regard precedente as binding.
As was pointed out in another place, and in
the British House of Commons, there are
precedents which. may be considered in relation to such an agreement as this. Now,
according to British practice and law, one
Parliament may make an agreement that is
binding upon its successors. I think the
Parliament of Great Britain is as solicitous
of the riglits of the people under the constitution, and is as well informed about those
rights, as we are. We have been in the habit
of foliowing its example, and it has declared
that an agreement like this may properly
be made. Numerous precedents have been
cited, but I recaîl one which I -have not seen
cited, and that is with respect to the
treaty under which the British Government gave to the Americans for all time
the right to navigate the St. Lawrence River.
Ever since it was passed no person has denied
the right or questioned the propriety of enter
ing into auch a treaty. I have aiways had
sufficient duriosity to study constitutional
precedents which came to my notice, and I
cannot recall that the question of the right
or propriety of making such an agreement
was ever raiaed until it was raised on the
discussion of this agreement in the British
House of Commona, when it was resolved
that Parliament had the right.
1 have said that I thought it would have
been unwise and improper to make an indeterminate agreement. In support of this opinion I arn going to cite an instance which came
to my attention during the past summer.
While I was in Ireiand a gentleman toid me
-and he was a person to ibe relied uponthat he had it from a high authority in London that Denmark fhad sent a deputation to
the British Government with a proposai that
England shouid give to Danish agricultural

180

SENATE

products free entry, in consideration of which,
while, as the deputation said, they had no
authority to make an agreement, they had
authority to say that a quid-pro-quo agreement would be made to give British manufactured products a monopoly in the Danish
market. As honourable members are aware,
Denmark heretofore has had a free market in
England for her agricultural products. Denmark is almost wholly an agricultural country,
and consequently nearly ail her exports are
agricultural products. Hitherto the Germans
have had the preference for manufactured
goods in the Danish market and have supplied
the industrial requirements of the Danes. Now
that Danish agricultural products are barred
from Germany one can see what a tremendous
advantage it would be to Denmark to continue to have free entry into the British
markets for her agricultural products.
That suggested to me a question. We know
that the French -Government contemplates
niaking approaches to England for a new
tariff deal based on preferences. We know
that other countries are doing the same. We
know that since England has renounced frec
trade all other nations are clamouring at her
door for better fiscal terms. We know that
for eighty or ninety years every nation ignored
Great Britain, but to-day, fearing the effects
of the preference given to us, they are willing
to concede almost anything to secure the
British market. Great Britain has to look out
for herself, and if we had an agreement of
this kind terminable at six months' notice,
and Denmark, France, Italy or the United
States offered better terms to Great Britain,
the British Government would not dare to
refuse them. Suppose France said to Great
Britain, "We will allow you into our markets
on terms as easy as or better than the Canadians allow you into their markets," what
would be the answer of England? I say it is
the part of prudence to tie all the participants
in this agreement to at least a term certain,
and that it would have been the part of folly
not to do so.
Hon. E. D. SMITH: Honourable senators.
I feel that I should say a few words in regard
to those industries which have been favourably affected by this treaty in such a pronounced way that there can be no question
about it.
During the six months that our apples are
on the market we can supply all the requirements of Great Britain. Under the agreement we are granted a preference of Si to
$1.25 on apples. That is something that every
apple grower in Canada will appreciate.
Even canned apples are given a substantial
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

preference of three shillings and sixpence a
hundredweight. We
can produce
canned
apples in tremendous quantities, but for a
number of years we have not been able to
ship them profitably to the British markets,
because of competition from the Northwestern
States. Some years ago they planted out such
an enormous acreage of apple orchards that
they glutted the market. Then they tore up
many thousands of acres of orchards; but
still they have a sufficient acreage left to produce apples at as low as $2.50 a ton, or 12J
cents a bushel. This preference on canned apples
will enable us to regain the Britislh market.
The preference on fresh apples is simply a
bonanza for the apple growers of this country.
If to-day we do not produce enough apples,
it is easy enough for us to increase our production. Except the three Prairie Provinces,
every province produces apples equal in
quality to those produced in any other part of
the world.
We are also able to produce pears equal
in quality to any produced elsewhere. We
do not produce a very large quantity of pears,
but what we do put upon the British market
will not meet with competition, as no other
country can ship them there at the same
season of the year, free of duty. This will
encourage us to increase our production of

pears very extensively.
This year alone, with only 10 per cent preference in our faveur, we were able to ship a
great many more carloads of pears to the
British markets than we ever shipped before,
and the return, although not high, was sufficient to enable our growers to continue in
business.
The British Government has imposed a
heavy duty on plums from foreign countries,
and if the pound sterling were at par it would
be equivalent to a preference in our favour
of two cents a pound. Our growers have
shipped some fifty cars of plums to Great
Britain, perhaps seven or eight times more
than wc have ever shipped there before.
It is interesting to compare the methods of
,the Old Country with ours in regard to imposing duties. The fruit growers of this
country had been struggling for years to get
an increase in the duty of half a cent a
pound. It had stood at this figure for fifty
years. We asked for a duty of a cent a
pound.
Just before the last election a
quarter of a cent a pound was added, making
the present duty three-quarters of a cent a
pound. Some honourable members to-night
have said that we are a high tariff country.
Well, after eighty years of free trade Great
Britain went back to protection and at the

SENATE
House of review where considerations that
affect members of the other assembly need
not have their force.
I have been a member of one of the parties,
and I think perhaps as loyal and thoroughgoing a member as that party ever had or is
likely to have, and I know something of the
exigencies of party affairs, of the loyalties
that are essential if parties are to perform
their functions, and of the deference that
must be paid-not a deference amounting to
subjection, nevertheless a deference that is
often necessary in order to render effective
the majority opinion of a party. I venture to
say this, that never in my acquaintance with
the affairs of Canada has opposition to a
measure been more manifestly or to a greater
extent based upon party considerations than
has the opposition to these Bills. I am not
referring now to this assembly. What there
can be in the measures before us to justify
antagonism on the part of the Canadian
people or their representatives I really do not
know. I have listened this afternoon with
some curiosity to addresses from honourable
members to see if I could analyse what really
was in the back of their minds when they
affirmed, timidly, as did some of them, a
measure of opposition. I venture to say that
never have more straining and struggling been
in evidence than in the effort to find some
ground on which to plant the foot in order to
create apprehension and fear about the adoption of these measures.
I was delighted to listen to the speech by
the honourable member for Wentworth (Hon.
Mr. Smith). He bas a lifelong experience
with that branch of Canadian industry directly
affected by the large advantages this treaty
brings to Canada. I refer to the fruit industry. I would ask honourable members
whether there is anyone in Canada whose
experience would qualify him better than
the honourable member for Wentworth to
speak on the subject of what is really of
benefit to Canadian fruit growers. I venture
to pass from him to some honourable members from the Annapolis Valley in Nova
Scotia, from the Okanagan Valley in British
Columbia, or from the rich counties along
Lake Ontario, where apples arc the very lifeblood of the peopleHon. Mr. LAIRD:
County.

From Prince Edward

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, or from
Prince Edward County-and to ask them
whether it is not worth while to have a
$1.25 advantage for the apples of Canada in
the British market.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. HORSEY: That is about all they
are getting for a barrel now.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Then it is
certainly worth while not to have another
$125 against them. Yet the honourable member wants to defeat this measure in the naine
of free trade and low tariff. If this measure
is defeated, the British tariff, now on a protective basis, will rise against the products
of Canada-our apples and wheat and other
natural products; yet honourable members
are ready ito defeat it, because they are
opposed to high tariffs.
The world to-day is flooded with a surplus of wheat. There are, it is estimated,
200,000,000 bushels more than the population
of the world can, under present conditions,
consume; consequently we have the deplorable prices reci'ted by the honourable member
from Manitou (Hon. Mr. Sharpe). Everything possible is being done to steady those
prices, but world prices cannot be seriously
disturbed, whether down or up. The cure
can come only through pressure of those
economie forces which might contract the
acreage under crop in Canada, in Australia,
in ithe Argentine, or in the United States.
The greatest wheat-buying country in the
world is Great Britain, and under this treaty
we are getting a six-cent advantage for our
wheat in the market of that country. This
means more to Canada by far than it does to
any other Dominion. I ask honourable members, especially those engaged in agriculture,
which country they think will be compelled to
contract its acreage if these treaties go into
effect? Will it be Canada? Would the honourable memiber for Brandon (Hon. Mr.
Forke) rather be farming in Canada, whence
he can get his wheat into the British market
under this treaty, or in the Argentine or the
United States, from which he could not get
anto that market except over the duty of six
cents a bushel?
Where is the contraction
going to take place? Is it going to be in the
countries whose producers have to climb a
fence to get into the woirld's greatest market,
or in Canada, with no fence to climb?
Yet the honourable gentleman is filled with
whimsical and imaginary apprehensions.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: The cost of production will ultimately prevail.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And the cost
of getting into the market. Is it any better
to pay six cents to get into the British market
than it is to add them to the cost of production?
Hon. Mr. FORKE:

It may be six cents.

NOVEMBER 24, 1932
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is better
noV ta have ta pay the six cents? Why the
apprehiension of the honourable gentleman?
Hon. Mr. FORKE:

I have none.

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: He lias none.
I understood hima ta say that hie had same
apprehiension. That is exactly the language
hie used. If this treaty had been sponsored by
someane else, these murmaurings of doubt
would have become a halleluj ah chorus in
which the lionourable gentleman from Brandoil would have roared in lis highest pitch.
In respect of the bacon trade, we shal
secure under this reaty, noV at once, I understand, but subject Vo certain delays which
have ta intervene, a tremendous accession liecause of a quota that Vhs country will have
in the greatest bacon market of the world.
In its equipment as a bacon producer Canada
lias no seriaus rival in the world, save perhaps
two countries in Europe. The honourable
member for Brandon (Hon. Mr. Forke)
is absolutely riglit in saying that we
have to-day in Canada as fine a park
product as can lie found in the world; but
unfortunately it is not in Vhis country a universal or systematized product.
Denmark, having had the Britishi market
for some time, and later Poland, systematized
the product, brought iV up ta certain standards demanded hy that market, and thus
almost domina ted the situation. But when
this treaty goe inta effect, a mrultiple which is
four, five or six times the largest quantity
that we are at present able ta slip ta Great
Britain will be our quota in that market. I
ask the honourable gentleman fromn Brandon
(Hon. Mr. Forke), and my riglit lionourable
friend fram Eganville (Riglit Hon. Mr. Graham), what mare can any Governient do
for its people in Vhis respect than enable
them ta geV a market for their product? We
cannot compel people ta produce the product, we cannat shorten Vhe distance between
ourselves9 and England, but we can produce
the best possible conditions for access to that
market. And docs noV this treaty do that?
Then why this appreliension?
I have confidence that the farmers of Canada will adjust Vhemselves ta tlie situation
and that park production will be placed on a
f aundation sucli as it lias neyer had bore.
This is a problem whidh the Government ca-nnoV salve. The responsibility of the Gaverament is ta secure ta the utmost extent a

position that this country happens ta occupy
in relation ta that kingdom.
Then I pass ta copper. Surely the duty
against the product of other countries is of
great importance in relation to anc of the
base metals that Canada lias ta expart. Ask
any exporter what effeet ths treaty will have.
Look at the market for copper stocks. Týhat
is the answer to honourable members who have
fears that this is of no value to us.
But I prize the treaty more because it
brings to us for the firet time the advantages
of a wider market for agricultua'al products
of this country. Ever since I fi.rst heard
political speeches 1 have heard appeals for
wider markets on behaif of Canadian agriculturists. How can honourable gentlemen
listen in patience ta those who set themseîves
up as representatives of Canadian agriculture,
and wlio now, when these markets are first
offered, look upon thema with dismal demeanor
and speak of them with words almost of

Do honourable members suggest going somewhere cIsc? There is no market comparable with the Britishi market for agricultural praducts. For saine other products
there may lie. There cannot be a market

they too have a tremendous surplus. But

NOVEMBER 24, 1932
upon the commercial principle of east-andwest transportation and trade. If we made a
treaty with a nation of twelve times our
magnitude and power, the trade with which
is necessarily north and south, and if then,
having div&rted our trade inito oerteÀn channels by virtue of that treaty, we found those
claannels stopped, what a shocking and debilitating influence the resuit would have on
the trade of this countryl But east-and-west
trade is wholly consistent with sales to the
British rnarket; east-and-weet trade is wholly
consistent with sales to Japan; east-and-west
trade is wholly consistent with sales to any
country save only the United States. Therefore the question of fiscal freedom can enter
oniy in connection with a very wide and
sweeping treaty with that republic. There is
no peril to Canada in east-and-west channels
of trade, nor probably in trade with any
nation on earth. outside of the North Arnerican
continent. We have neyer before heard the
words "fiscal freedorn" uttered in reference
to any treaty made withý any country in the
world that deait with us through esst-andwest channels.
I arn at a loss to understand how honourable members can feel that there is going to
be danger of friction and ail the other things
mentioned, just because we sit down together
and seek to hel1p one another now that
the opportunity to do so has corne for the first
tirne hy reason of the change of ,policy in
Great Britaîn. Honourable nernbers say it is
going te be risky to let representatives frorn
Great Britain corne before a tribunal in this
country and seek to establish the fact that by
reason of the agreemnent entered into they are
entitled to -certain consideration under our
tariff. Are not the people of Great Britain,
yes, the people of any country, entitled to
aippear before any court in this Dorninion, and
to seek under the laws of Canada to esta-blish
their rights? What, then, is the danger in
enahling the people of Great Britain to appear
before this Tarif! Board, this court-for it bas
the status of a court-to seek, on the basis
of the law of Canada, to establish their rights?
lu what respect is Canadian autonorny or the
political integrity of the Dorninion irnperilled?
I arn unable te see s.ny justification for such
an apprehension.
I ask honourable members to keep in view
the fact that for many years it has been difficuit, if not impossible, to do justice to the
agricultural. community of this country, under
the protective system which we have found
necessary. The opportunity to do justice
carne only when, by virtue of a protective
tariff in Great Britain, we were able te get a
preferenoe. Let us rejoice that we were able

8

ta obtain that opportunitY, and let us not
postpone for one unnecessary moment the
time when the people of our agricultural districts will take advantage of it.
Honourable members say that this Government is a high tarif! Government, and that
the world is being strangled with high tarifas.
1 have a great deal of sympathy with the contention that tariffs ail over the world are high,
and I should like ta see a movernent for the
reduction of tariffs by ail countries. Is there
anyone in Canada who would not? The tarif!
policy of a country bas to be governed by
local conditions and also by the policies
of other nations with which that country
cornpetes. In providing a tarif! for Canada we must prirnarily and continuoualy take
into consideration the tarif! policy of the great
cornpeting nation to the south of us. That
is why this country bas been compelled
through aIl ifs history to adopt protection.
Sirnilarly, Great Britain's decision ta adopt
a protective policy was arrîved at because of
what other countries had done. Do honourable memnbers think that reasoning with respect to any theory caused Great Britain to
depart frorn the principle of free trade, which
was adhered to for long decades?
Hon. Mr. HORSEY: The people neyer
voted on the matter.
Right Hon. Mr. M'EIGHEN: No mean in
Canada has the right to question whether the
British Parliarnent speaks for the British
people.
Hon. Mr. HORflEY: The people did not
vote for a tariff.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman had better discuss Canadian
affairs and assume that the Government of
Britain speaks for the people of Britain. We
should resent any attempt made in the British
Parliamen-t to deny that our Parliament spoke
for the people of Canada. Let us extend to
the British Parliarnent the same courtesy that
we should dernand for our own.
The Government of Great Britain decided
to adopt protection. Why? Because the government of one country after another raised
barriers against British trade, and as a result
the markets of the OlH Country were floodeè
with foreigu goods, and manufacturers, artisans, ail classes of people suffered in oonsequence. Protection was resorted to, not
because of devotion to any theory, but under
the.compulsion of events. For sirnilar reasons
rnost countries of the world have done the
same -thing. Undoubtedly the principle of
protection bas been carried too far in
rnany landa. But the Ottawa Conference

SENATE

186

was an attempt on the part of British nations,
all of them large trading countries, to open up
channells of trade among themselves, to give
concession for concession, and it may well be
the precursor of similar endeavours on the
part of other nations. It is recognized everywhere that the British Government, in adopting the principle of protection, and especially
in entering into these trade treaties with us,
has set an example that may be followed by
other nations, and by itself in its relations with
other countries, in an endeavour to lower tariff
barriers the world over. So I say this agreement is a step in a direction which should
eventually tend to the general amelioration of
the difficult conditions of our time. It is of
great value to our country as a whole, and
especially valuable to our agricultural districts
because of the obviously great advantages that
will accrue to them.
Now, I ask honourable members seriously
to consider this question. Would you like
to defeat this measure? If you would not,
have you any right to vote against it? Would
honourable members like to be responsible
for oausing customs duties in England to be
raised, under the terms of the enactment
now in force in that country, against the
products of Canada? That is what the result would be if this Bill were defeated here.
Some honourable members say that the
enactment should not be given a life of five
years. Well, we have legislated for agreements that would be effective for five years,
or more, with foreign countries. I do not
know why we should be so trustful of foreign
people and so distrustful of our own. Five
years is a short time. I hope that not only
five years from now, but ten years from now,
and even long beyond that time, these channels of trade for which we are now providing
will have been deepened and extended, and
that commerce between different parts of the
Empire will have become larger and freer.
May the Empire set an example to the rest
of the world in the way of recovery from the
present chaos, for which recovery there is
grievous need at this juncture of our fortunes.

Honourable members are aware that a large
number of countries are in arrears with respect to the payment of their allotment to
the League for the continuance of the activities of that body. Canada has paid ber dues
promptly and is nlot one dollar in arrears.
At the moment no one can foresee what will
be the outcome of this negleet on the part
of many nations, and the acceptanoe of obligations by others. That is one problema which
confronts the League, if indeed it does not
threaten it at the present time.
Hon. M.r. DANDURAND: There anay be
some other reason than neglect.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, and I
know what those other reamous may be. But,
subi oct te the reservation by Parlia-ment of
Canada's rights with respect te her contribution, there eau be no objection to the continuance of the work that is urged in the
resolution, nor to the passage of the resolution.
The resolution was adopted.
GUSTOMS TARIFF BILL
PIRST READING

A message was received front the House of
Commons with Bull 13, an Act te amend the
Customs Tariff.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: What is this
Bill?
Right Hon. Mr. MEliGHEN: ]lt is a consequential Bill; it centaine consequential amendmente to the Customs Tariff.
The Bill was read the first time.
The Sonate adjourned until to-morrow at

RESOLUTION ADOPTED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Senator Wilson (Rockcliffe), with regard to the
work of the section of the League of Nations
dealing with Social and Humanitarian Questions.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I understand that, out of a deference which I very greatly appreciate, the debate on this matter also was adjourned yesterday in my absence. As representing the Government, I have no objection at ail to the
passage of the resolution. What might be
called the cultural or ancillary work of the
League of Nations has by no means been unproductive, and certainly its work in relation
te opium and narcoties has been effective.
The matter of the continuance of the League's
labours in this field is entirely a financial one.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON inquired
of the Government:
1. Ras the Canadian National Railway management adopted any scheme to divide the cmployment given by it fairly among ail its
employees?
2. Or lias it adopte(l a reheme to divide the
employment given by it fairly among any class,

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The answer
to the honourable gentleman's inquiry is es
follows:
1. Working hours and mileage being conditions of formai contracts between the company and varions classes of employees, the
employees affecteil and the company have,

CANADIAN NORTHERN RAILWAYNOVA SCOTIA GUARANTEE
Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honourable
memrbers, may I draw the attention of the
riglit honourable leader of the House te the
answer brought down to my inquiry with respect to provincial guarantees of Canadian
Northern Railway bonds. Under Nova Scotia
I find this answer: "No guarantees." I think
the right honourable gentleman will recail
that at tbe time of the acquisition of the
Canadian Northern Railway the Dominion
Government relieved the Province of Nova
Scotia of its guarantee obligations to the
extent of at least $6,000.000. Evil tongues even
said that it was an incentive for the adherence
of the Provincial Government to the Union
Government. In the strict legal sense perlisps it was not a guarantee; it was money
that the Provincial Government bad advanced
for the construction of the railway, and the
obligation was loaded on to the other provinces.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I bave no
reason to think the return is not correct.
One does flot carry one's tbougbts back over
eighteen and a haif years with the greatest
confidence; but witb this reservntion I would
say iI do not recaîl that Nova Scotia had any
guaranteeHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Net a guarantee;
the province paid the money, and was relieved of that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: The province
was relieved of the money if it paid the
money out.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes; relievcd of the
obligation by the Dominion Governnment.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, it did
not get any money back.
THE PRICE 0F COAL
Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RODOLPHE LEMIEUX: May I ask
the riglit honourable leader of the Huse
whether the Labour Department or the Fuel
Board is proceeding witb the coal investigation, and wbether we may expect reports
of that investigation fromn time to time?
ýRiglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The coal investigation, so-called, is being proceeded with
under the Combines Investigation Act. I
can assure the House that it will receive from
time to time sncb reports as the Act calîs for.

I arn not at aIl convinced that the Act calîs
for any reports.

CUSTOMS BILL

THIRD READING

SECOND READING
Right Han. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 6, an Act ta amend the
Customs Act.
He said: Honourable senators, under the
Customs Act as it stands, ail goods are liable
ta the application of the special dumping
section. This Bill amende the Act so as ta
exempt from that section goode entitled ta
entry under the British Preferential or any
lower tariff. This action is not taken in pursuance directly of the Economie Conference
agreements, but is rather the resuit af some
collateral understanding.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN moved the
third reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill was'
read the third time, and passed.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It has nothing
ta do, I suppose, with the valuation of the
pound sterling, which I think is from time
ta time fixed at a certain amount for customs purposes.
Rîght Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
think it has special relation ta the question
of exchange. The section reads this way:
If at any time it appears ta the satisfaction
of the Gavernor in Council on a repart front
the Minister that goods of any kind are being
imported into Canada either on sale or on consignument, under such conditions as preiudicially
or injuriously ta affect the interests of Canadian producers or manufacturers, the Governor
in Council may authorize the Minister ta fi
the value for duty of any clase or kind of
such goade, and natwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the value so fixed shaîl be
deemed ta be the fair market value of gucli
goode.
As amended the section will read that the
class of goods, as respects which the value for
duty purposes may be fixed, shahl not include
those which are entitled ta enter under the
British Preferential tariff or any lower tariff.
It will be seen that the new statute subtracts
from the power of the Minister ta fix values
for duty purpases. This power was first
given about 1924, and I am free ta canfess
that at the time I pratested against it most
strongly. However, the practice, as might
have been expected, has grown instead of
diminishing.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
To the extent
only of this amendment my right honourable
friend's views are being met.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: To that extent only. It is a matter of very much regret
that they are not being met ta a greater
extent.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill was
read the second time.

DUPLICATION IN RAILWAY SERVICES
MOTION

The Senate resumed from November 23 the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Casgrain with regard ta certain arrangements ta be made between the management
af the Canadien National Railways and the
Canadian Pacifie Railway pending the passing of the present Bill A.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I moved the adjournment of the debate merely in order that the
matter might be cansidered and that thase
who wished ta address themselves ta it might
have an oppartunity af daing so. I had my
say the other evening.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Order
Paper daes nat show the revised. f orm of the
resolution.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Honourable
gentlemen, this resohution has been under review indirectly by the Railway Committee.
The Raihway Cammittee is impressed, I think,
first, with the fact that if it is ta deal
thoroughhy and maturely with the tremendous
subject referred ta it, a long period of time
may elapse bef ore it is able ta report, and
further time wihl then be required for the
Bill ta pass 'bath Houses. Secondly, the Committee is impressed with the fact that in the
meantime economies might be effeeted which
are not being effected. The evidence seems ta
tend ta the view that much is being dune, but
that still greater work can be accomplished

190

SENATE

and greater savings made. I can Oniy say,
and I do so without the authority of the Coimitttee, that thcse two convictions scem to
prevail. It bas been suggested that possibiy
the work of effecting joint economies hetween
the two systems of raiiways might be given
an inipetus and acceeented if this Huse
were cieariy to express the view that there
shouid he no undue deiay or iethargy in the
exccution of the work of effecting these economies. I shouid think, though, that it might
be wiser flot to pass the resolution in its present form. It seems to me that it would he
the part of wisdom for us first to recite that
pending the passing of the Bill any losses that
can possibly be eiiminated by co-operation
shouid be eiiminatcd, and then to rccommend
that this be done. The second suggestion I
have to make is that it would be as well to
leave out the requcst for an umpire.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
strike that out.

I arn willing to

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is a
difference of opinion as to the wisdom of that
section of the Bili which provides for the
compulsory settiement of disputes which may
arise out of efforts towards economy. If we
wcre to pass now a resolution stating that in
ouir opinion there shouid be some one to
settie such disputes, it might be argued that
we wcre prejuidicing the work of the Coinmittec.
My suggestion is that the purpose of the
resolution shouid be more cieariy expressed,
and that the iast clause, commencing with the
words "and that" in the third from iast line,
be omitted. Possibly some one would move
the amendment-I do not think I should do it
myscf-that after the word "that" in the
first line, the f ollowing words be inserted:
For the purpose of expcditing the attainrnent
of ail possible econonies hy mutuai co-operation.
and tiîat ail the words after and including
the word "and" in the fifth line be omitted.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU:

How

the

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It would rend
in this way:
That for the puirpose of expcditing the attainment of ail possible economnies by mutîiai cooperation, pending the passing of the present
Raiiway Bill A, in tue opinion of the Senate
a certain nuimber of officiais of the Canadian
Pacifie Raiiway Company ani an epial iiiimber
of officiais of the Canadian National Raiiways
should meet to try te co-operate in eliminating
some of the duplicatien of raiiway service, with
a view to econorny in this serv ice.
Hon. Mr. LE MIEUX: This is only the
expression of a desire; it is not an order?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: It is the expression of a wish that is inipersonatcd in the
honouirable senator for-I neyer can remeinber his constitucncyHon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

De Lanaudière.

Riglît Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I think if
we said for the whoie Province of Quebec it
would be appropriate.
It is quite conceivable that the resolution
might, be of advantage pending the passing
of the Bill it.sclf. It represents the conviction
of this House that even though considerabie
time iýs likely to be consumed in determining
upon the provisions to set up the nccessary
inachinery, there shouid be no dclay in attaining economy, so far as that is possible, in the
meantime.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHIAM: As Chairman
of the Committce I might explain that the
Committee has workcd strentiousiy and bard,
and bas hecard the representations of ail pcvsons who have askcd to bc heard, and some
who have not, ýinciuding the representations
of President Beatty of the Canadian Pacifie
Railway, and Mr. Ruie, furmcriy of the
Canadian National Raiiways.
it wxas the
consensus of opinion when we werc discussing
tihis resolution of my honourabie friend (Hon.
Mr. ýCasgrain) that whiie the Senate couid
neot make an order at the presenit time, it
could pass a resolution exprcssing its opinion
that the economies we have been considering
shýouid be expedited, and that the companies
might, be a little more cnthusiastic in their
efforts.
I have no objection to moving this amendment:
Tbat after the word "that" in the first uine,
the foilowing words be inserted: "For~ tise purpose of expediting the attainmcnt of ail possible
seonomnies by mutual co-operation."
I move that as an amendment to the resolution.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I suiggest that
you put the words "in the opinion of the
Senate" at the beginning.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I have much pleasure
in seconding the motion. There is prohably
one littie ph-rase that might bc altercd.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: The-re is too much
"ýeconomy" in it now. I mean that there is
redundancy near the end.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I doubt, whether the
words "try to co-operate in eliminating some
of the duplication of raiiway services" express
what we intend. However, that is flot a very
important point, for if we pass the resolution

NOVEMBER 25, 1932
both raiiway systems wiil understand the object we have in view. Personaily I was hoping that something would be accomplished to
bring about some economies between now and
the time when a Bill deaiing with the situation
is finally passed by Parliament. However,
the answers I received to the two or three
questions I asked Mr. Ruel in the commîttee
this morning satisfied me thet under existing
law the Canadian National Raiiway Company
bas sufficient euthority ta continue its caaperetion with the Canadien Pacifie Railway.
I have no doubt et ail that bath raiiweys,
being fuily aware of the situation and knowing
what aur hope is, will endeavour to proceed a
littie faster in voluntariiy giving effect ta ecanamies whie actuel legisiation is pending.
Hon. J. MURDOCK: Honou-rabie senators,
ail xny life I have been somew.hat inclined to
teke an interest when I have seen an ettack
upon a small boy by a bigger one, and it seems
ta me that if this resolutian is passed it will
resuit in an attack of that kinid. Why? Recause the resolution would lie suggestive ta,
and ta a large extent binding upan, the Canadian National Railweys, indicating what we
expect of them, yet there is not a word in it
that would be binding upan the Canadien
Pacifie.
Recently we have been told that bath 'railways have a long list of questions ready for
subrnission ta a joint co-operetive board. Now,
if the resolution were passed wouid it not
mean that a comm4ttee of officiais of the two
lines wouid get together and exehange their
lists? And if that bappened, wouid the Canadian Pacifie nlot have the big boy' s unfair
s.dvantage, in being able ta say ta the Canadian National officiais, "«Here are instructions
and suggestions given ta you iby the Senate
uf Canada"? It seems ta me that if we are
gaing ta deal f airly with our own railroad
we should endeavour ta place it on an even
basis with the other great raiiroad, of wbich
we are ail so praud. Why give the Canadien
Pacifie a materiel advantage, as this proposes
ta do?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: How?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If representatives
of the two qailroads geV together with their
iists of questions on which they desire ca4perative action, the Cenadian Pacifie officiais
can stand firm and suggest ta Cenadian
National officiais, "Here is wbat the Senate
bas said you shouId- do."
Mr. Beatty, the President of the Canadian
Pacifie, was hefore the Raiiwey Committee for
two hours or more, and we were al very much
interested in what hie said. I tbink we gat
the impression that lie is unaiterabiy opposed

191

ta the provisions of Part 'III of Bill A. Perhaps I shahl -be permitted ta read a stetenient
made by him before the Royal Commission:
We have aiways contemplated from the bieginning that there wouid be an overriding
commission which wouid be a court of appeal
in ail these matters. It wouid lie in the shape
eitber of a giorified raiiway commission or a
separate and independent body which wouid
pess an this very tbing, and permit or refuse
ta permit the abandonment of properties in
the public interest. I think that is essential.
I do not think you should sey to a private
body of inen like e board of directors, "You
have uniimited power ta do these things."
Mr. Beatty is evidently expeoting that a
proper body will be appointed for consultation
in matters of dispute between the Vwo Tailroeds. But it seems ta me that this resoluien would have ani entirely one-eided effect.
Wbet would bappen when Parliszent resumes
at flie end of Jenuary? I have a riglit to
guess, if I cannot do anyth-ing else, and my
guess is that we sbouid want ta find out
what bas been t he effect of tihe passage of this
resolution, which. someone bas called a piaus
hope. We shouid be Void thst meetings were
heid, but that the Canadien National wouid
not agree Vo tbe requests and proposais made
by the Canadien Pacifie, and theref are the
Canadien Paoifie bad no apportunity of
cerrying out its plans for the eiimination of
certain services under a co-operative arrangement.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Wiil -the
honourable member permit a question?
Suppose thet does happen. Wouid that not
be very iiluménating ta the Committee wben
it is .trying ta formo a conclusion as ta whether
or not an arbitral tribunal is neoessary?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes. I fear it
would be iiiuminating ta some members of
the Committee, Who wouid then contend-if
I arn permitted ta gucess egain-that the
result proved the necessity of putting bath
raads under anc executive head and preventing the recurrence of meetings that were
only a farce. I fear it would be argued that
the Canadien National officiais should have
agreed ta suggestions made by officiais of the
Canadien Pacifie.
I th.ink it is only fair that those who are
cherged for the time being wi'th the responsibility of carrying on the work of the governmen-t-owned railways should net be made the
victiins of e regolution of tbtis kind, a resolu.
ian which, as I have already sa4d, wouid liE
more or less binding upon them, but et whicl
Canadien Pacifie officiais couid snap theii
fingers. Do we want ta place -th.e representatives of aur reilway in f bat position?

192

SENATE

Hon. J. LEWIS: Honourable senators, I
arn inclined to support the contention of the
hon-ourable gentleman from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock) for another reason. These
economies, I suppose, will neoessarily resuit ini
the dismissal of a large number of employees
of the Canadian National, and possibly of
the Ciinadian Pacifie also. While I admit that
in the long run snany dismissals may be inevitable, it seems to me that it would be
unwise to hurry the process at present, or
during the coming winter, which will probably
be an extremely bard one. If the economnies
were made effective now there woul'd be an
increase in unemployment d.istress, whereas
if they were held off until spring I doubt
that very much harmn would be done. By
that time the summer would be on the way,
and possibly there would be evidence of improvement in employment and general conditions.
Hon. J. A. McDONALD:
Honourable
members, I should like a littie more light on
this resolution. If the motion passes docs it
mean that duringý the parliamentary recess,
while Mr. Best, Mr. Mosher and other representatives of labour are working overtime
to make out a case for prescntation to us,
large bodies of railway employces ivill be discharged from the Canadian National and the
Canian Pacifie? Shall we find, ihen ve
meet to discus.9 this problemn agaîn, that damage bas been donc and that it is tee late
for us to undo it? A prominent member of
this Huse, who is noted for bis conservative
and guarded statements, said tbe other day
that he eould show our Government how to
collect $170,OO,000 which is beîng improperly
retained by income tax dodgers. There is
net tbe sliglitest question that every labour
man, every Canadian, is wondering vwy the
Senate is net investigating that statement,
instead of taking action that will result in the
discharge of employees and a reduction or
impairment of railway efficiency. The honourable gentleman's assertion was publisbed
in tbe newspapers, and I think it should be
the subi ect of serious consideration by this
buse.
Hon. R. LEMIEUX: I arn net rising te
oppose the motion, fer I arn in faveur of it.
It seems te me that many econemies can be
put into effect while tbe present Railway
Bill is being dealt with. Only yesterday the
newspapers stated that a large sumn of money
was being saved through collaboration between the Canadian Pacific and tbe Canadian
National in eliminating certain trains between
Montreal and Toronto. That is the sort of
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

process which I think should go on. The railway muddle is costing the country one
million dollars every week in Canadian
National deficits, and we should net hesitate
for one moment te take drastie means te put
an end te them. I ar n ot opposed te tbe
interests of tbe employees of either road,
but we know that it is impossible te make an
omelette without breaking eggs. Everybedy
in this country is suffering from tbe bard
times, and we cannet allow the railway
situation te continue uncbanged. The people
expect us te do something in tbe way of
reducing the deficits, and it seems te me tbat
we are in conscience bound te proceed along
that line. We must notify the twe railway
companies that in our opinion tbey should
continue eliminating duplicate trains and
other services that are unprofitable. Our
situation reminds me of the one that existed
in France sbortly before the Revelution,
wben the Assembly was being asked by tbe
Government te adopt legisiation under whicb
every citizen would be taxed to tbe extent
of one-quarter of bis fortune. There was a
long debate. and flnally Mirabeau from tbe
tribune exclaimed, "Gentlemen, bankruptcy
is at our gates, yet you deliberate!"
After baving listened te the remarks made
hy tbe rigbt honourable leader of tbe Senate
yesterday, I tbink we shaîl be taking- a very
heavy responsibility upon our shoulders if
we fail te adopt drastic means te terminate
the scandalous increase in our railway deficits.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, I sbould .like an oppertunity of saying
a few words more. In the first place, this is
flot a drastie measure. We are net dealing
with the Bill now. The drastic measure will
bave te come when Parliament sits again after
the adjournment. As regards this resolution,
aftor all it ýcan have onhy one object: it is
a furtber intimation fromn the Senate, on
representationis from its Committee on Railways, Telegrapbs and flarbours, which bas
been dealing with this question, that these
co-operative measures should be continued.
There is nothing in. tbe law nýow, that will
prevent the two railwvay companies fromn doing exactly what this resolutien says they
should do. Then why aIl the fear? My honourable friend says, dn effeet, that the Canadian Pacifie Railway is going te gobble uP
the Canadian National. That cannot happen.
By this resolution we simply say that in
view of the information submitted te the
Senate Committee, these co-operative measures should ho continued immediately. Par-

NOVEMBER 25, 1932
liament as a whole is not acting; the Senate
only is expressing a wish and a hope that the
efforts made during the past may be continued.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Arn 1 to iinderstand that àf we pass this resolution it will
flot mean one thing more to the C.P.R. than
obtains at present?
Hon. Mr. CALDER:

Not a bit.

Hon. M.r. MURDOCK:
C.N.R. it will mean more?

While

to

the

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Not at ail. The
C.N.R. for months past have been co-operating with the C.P.R.-I presume, under the
direction of the Minister-and the two managements have actually effected economies to
the extent of some mnillions of dollars. This
resolution does flot add anything to the
authority that already exists. My honourable
friend heard the statement made this morning
by Mr. Ruel when I asked him whether or not
there exists in the statutes power to do this
very t.hing that the two railways had been
doing. He said, "Yes, undoubtedly." Then
I asked himn whether or not he thought-and
there is no man in Canada more familiar
with the situation-that the personnel of the
C.N.R. management was properly equipped
to carry on that co-operation. What was his
He said, "Yes, undoubtedly."
jiidgment?
Then what are we to fear'frorn the passing
of t'his resolution? There is no danger to
the C.N.R. where both companies are voluiitarily trying to co-operate. Then, where is
the danger of the C.N.R. being gobbled up?
I cannot see any such danger. This resolution
neither gives the C.P.R. any additional power
nor takes away froin the C.N.R. any power
that it has at present.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Will you say that
the C.P.R. may not corne in later and complain that the C.N.R. would flot co-operate
as we now request?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I will go the whole
way with my honourable friend there. I arn
content that Parliamnent should continue to
ait and deal with this problem, which is the
most serious domestie problema that we have
had to deal with for many years. But we
cannot ail have our wish, and although this
question is of the greatest importance, there
may be a thousand reasons why Parliament
should adjourn at this time. 1 repeat, ail
that is asked by this resolution is simply an
expression of opinion on the part of the
Senate, after it has heard from the Combuittee

which is dealing with the question, that the
two railway companies from now on, until
such time as legislation is passed by Parliament, should continue to co-operate with a
view to securing the largest possible economies. That is ail. I cannot see why my
honourable friend should have any fear.
As for the rernarks of the honourable
gentleman from 6hediac (Hon. Mr. McDonald), you cannot have omelettes without
breaking eggs. Not a single economny of any
consequence can be effected without affecting
some individuals. Let us look at the railway picture. The C.N.R. revenue in the
third week of this month felI short of their
revenues for the corresponding week of last
year by over $1,200,000.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And last year was
a bad year.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes, it wvas a bad year
in comparison with the preceding years. What
is the picture so far as the C.P.R. is concerned? During that same week its revenue
fell behind its revenue for the corresponding
week of last year by over $600,000. Now, 1
arn not an alarmistHon. Mr. FORJCE: I think in this discussion we are prone to forget that the aggregate
losses of business people who supply these
railways with trafflc are much more than the
railway shortages. Consequently, while business continues to decrease we are going to
have these large deficits if the railways are
to render any service at aIl. I admit there
bas been extravagance on the part of the
railway managements, but I think a little too
much is made of that fact, considering the
tremendous loss in traffic which bas been
gradually taki-ng place during the past few
years. 1 have in mind that, on a little line
at home we used to have the dining car
filled every day, but with the decline in passenger traffie the dining car bas been replaced
6y a buffet car, which to-day is very slightly
patronized. Indeed you will find only two
or three passengers in the first-class coach,
although fôrrnerly it used to be crowded. It
is not the fault of the Cajiadian Pacific that
it is not making money on that line. There
is virtually no traffie.
I can sympathize to some extent with the
honourable gentleman from Shediae (Hon.
Mr. MeDonald). I was in favour of the
resolution, and I do not say yet that I shaîl
voté against it; but we have to think twice
before we take any steps that may result in
hundreds ,of thousands of men heing thrown
out of empIoyment at the beginning of winter.
That worries me more than any other factor

mn the case. I repeat, I think we are prone
to forget the tremendous drop in railway earnings during the Iast few years and to overempliasize past extravagance.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I arn not unmindful
of whiat the honourable gentleman bas just
said. I arn attempting to deal with the situation as it confronts us. I arn not overlooking the fact that there is f remendous economie depression ail over the world, that we
are right in it, and that aIl classes of the
community are adversely affccted. But the
question is, can the Dominion of Canada continue fa carry a Joad of more than $5,000,000
a month to meet the:se deficits? I doubt it.
The rîght honourabie leader of the flouse
pointed ont yesterday that the treasury bas
witbin nine years poured into the C.N.R.
Systemn more than $900,000,000, fa a very considerable extent f0 t.ake care of deficits. Can
Canada go on doing that? In rny judgment,
no. We have been slipping downhil], with
deficits and debts mounting ail the tirne.
There is an end ta that sort of thing; it cannot continue. That is ail. As 1 said a few
days ago, we are approaching near-bankruptcy.
Only when the people understand that we
are reaching that dangerons stage shahl we be
able ta dcal with this problem as in my
judgrnent it must be dealt with.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Wonld the right
honourable leader of the House have any objection to amending the resolution by striking
ont the words "try to" in the fourth line and
inserting the word 'mutuai"?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:
"Mutuai"
is already in the resolution. The words "try
to" are better ont.
Han. Mr. MURDOCK:
They give too
much latitude ta the fellow who says,' "We
won't." Might we have the resolution read
as arnended?
The Hon. the SPEAKER:- In an amendment ta the main motion it is moved by the
Right Hon. Senator Graham, seconded by the
Hon. Senator Calder,
That the followiag words he added after the
word "that . in the first line: "in the opinion
of the Senate, for the purpose of expediting
the attainnient of ail possible economiee by
muttial co-operation"; that the words "try ta,"
in the fourth line, be stricken ont; and that ail
the words in the fifth line after the word
"service" he stricken ont.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Lines 5, 6
and 7.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The motion as
amended wilI read as follows:
Hon. Mr. FORRE.

That in the opinion of the Senete, for the
purpose of expediting the attainrnenit of ail
possible econarnies by mutuial co-operation pendîng t.le passing of the present Railway Bill A.
a cet-tain nuniber of officiais of the Canadian
Pacifie Raiway Comnpany and an equiai number
of officiais of the Canadian National Railways
should nîeet ta co-operate in elirmnating soet
of the duîplication of raiiway service with a
view ta ecanomiy in
this service.
Shahl týhe arnendment be adopted?
Right Han. Mr. GRAHAM:
I do not
want ta delay the passing of the motion, but
I would ask, the right honourable leader of
the Goverament whether we, are jnstified in
using the words "pending the passing of the
present Raiiway Bihl A."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Perhaps we
should use the word "determination" instead
of "passing."
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Then the substitution of "determination" for "passing" wiil
be incinded in the amendment.
The amendrnent and t.he motion as amended
wore agreed ta.
ADJOURNMENT
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, we are still in a state of dubitation
as ta what is ta ho the conduet of the othcer
Hanse before adjournmcnt, and when the adJourament wiil take place. IL may be this
ex euing, and, tentatively, ton o'clock bas been
named, thongh one cannot say that the adjournment will actually take place then.
On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen, the
Senate adjourned during pleasure.
After some time tbe sitting was resumed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourabie
members, I have iearned that an effort was
made in the other Hanse ta camne ta an
arrangement whereby it would compiete its
business by 9.30 to-night, and that, though the
effort was unsuccessful, there was an understanding that at 6 o'ciack a definite decision,
either yes or no, would ho reached. This
being so, we can either adjourn again during
p easure, ta meet at six, or continue in
session until we hear from the other flouse.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Provided that
we hear at 6 o'ciock.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have
arranged ta be advised at once. Whiie we
are waiting for the information from the other
flouse, I may say that it is the clear intention
of that Hanse, when it adjourns, ta stand
adjourned until Monday, the 30th of January.

NOVEMBER 25, 1932
It would appear to me to be the duty of the
Senate to convene vcry shortly afterwards,
and 1 would suggest that our adjournment
should be tilt Tuesday, the 31st of January, at
8 o'clock. If anyone hais any other suggestion
to offer, we shall be glad to hear it; otherwise, it seems to me, the date 1 have mentioned ie an appropriate one on which ta meet
again.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There wouId be
no special reason for our adiourning for the
same length of time as the Commons if it
were nlot that we have the Railway Bill in
our charge.

ference to which the honourable gentleman
refers took place a week or ten days ago, but
the railway comnpanies did not participate, as
the

governments. Although there was an inter-

esting discussion of this question, I arn not at
liberty at the moment to make any statement as to, the result; but I know of no

reason why the honourable senator should
be precluded fromn making bis motion. I
should think a discussion on the proposed

would be very useful at this tirneý entîrely
irrespective of wliat took place two weeks

TRýIBUTES TO DEC-EASED SENATORS
THE

LATE

1-ON. SENATORS ROSS,
DANIEL AND BUREAU

TODD,

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Honourable
gentlemen, we mect again, in this resumed
session, under circumstances of peculiar sadness: during the short interval of our adjournment no less than four of our members have
passed from the scene of this life. 0f the
four, three at ail events were men long
identified with the public life of this Dominion; and the only consolatory cireumstance
that we can suirnmon to our minds is the fact
that cach of themi had passed the allotted
span.
Senator Ross, of Moose Jaw, who died
very shortly after we adjourned, had been a
notable figure in Western Canada through a
long period of years. H1e was one of those
thousands who trekked froro Ontario into the
West in early times, and contributed much
to the building up of our present Western
civilization. I had not personally the status
of friendshiu) with Senator Ross, but long before
I hiad a seat in the Huse of Commons I had
learned that hoe was a shrewd, far-seeing man
wvhose counsel, always impartial and intelligent, was souglit by bis fellows, and particularly by the political party of which hie was
a staunch adherent. Senator Ross was a
pioncer in the West, and hie Ivas another
instance of those who, having started very
young on the path of public affaira, go far.
In his twenties hie was a member of the
Legislative Assembly of the old Northwest
Territories, and at about the age of thirty
contested a seat for the House of Commons.
Hie took a prominent part as a minister in the
Territorial Government, and later hecame
Corumissioner of the Yukon, but retired early
from that post, and was elected to, the
ýCommons in 1902. Those who knew him best
testify to the peculiar illumination of his
mind and the soundness of bis judgment in
matters not only of business, but also of
public affairs. Though hie never seemed to
seek high office bimself, those in high office
very often hied to him to get the benefit of
bis advice. H1e had the proud satisfaction,
while still active himaself in political matters,
of witnessing the retumn to the House of
Cominons of his son, who took a very considerable and creditable part in the deliber-

FEBRUARY 1, 1933
ations af that body over a period of years.
This must have given him mucb jay. 1 arn
sure that this House and ail who have sbared
with Senator Ross the burdens of public lîfe
will join with me in extending sincere
sympatby ta his son and to the other members
of his family.
Senator Todd occupied a brieifer space in
public affairs. I shahl find it bard ta speak of
Senator Todd in terms unmixed with emotion.
He was one of those peculiarly unselfish men
whase counsel could be sought in the certain
assurance that it would be given witbout the
remotest trace of self-interest. Anything that
migbt bias bis judgment seemed ta have no
place at ail in bis constitution. From the
wealtb of bis experien-ce and the bigb quality
of bis intellect, hie gave of bis best while hie
was in public life. I neyer 'feît quite sa free
to seek the adylce of perbaps any ather member of this honourable body as I did in consulting Senator Todd when such difficulties or
complications arase as seemed ta me ta warrant my asking for bis time. In the Province
of New Brunswick, in, which as a business man
hae rose ta very great successes from a baginning of very great difficuitias, bis namne stood
remarkably bigb. He was racommended, I
wail recali, for sumnions ta this Chamber by
the late Han. Frank Carveli, and I venture
ta say tbat New Brunswick bas sent none
other ta tbe Senate af Canada wba bas left
uipon his feiiows a mark so permanent, and in
their hearts a stranger affection. He is
survived by a widow-, and a son of promise,
and ta them. we extend aur sincerest sympathy.
Senator Daniel had reached a very ripe age,
an age sa ripe that be bad becoma one of the
grand aid men of aur country. But, tbough
his years were many, hie neyer permitted the
sbortness of vision of aid age, or the hankering for times a.nd conditions of the past, ta
obscure bis judgment of the present. Ris
steps was always strong, bis look was always
forward, and bis pathway tbrough public if e,
aver a pariod of nearly thirty years, was one
highiy ta bis own eredii and ta tbat of the
province from wbieh hae cameé. It is rare
indeed that we find a man active in public
service who is forward-looking, hopeful and
heipfui at the age of eighty-.eigbt.
I now came ta a referenoe ta the last of
thosa who have le! t us, Semator Jacques
Bureau. In doing so I know I approacb the
memory of a personality wbich had about it
more distinctiveness than is the lot of buman
beings in general. It was not a personality
difficult ta analyse, but a mnost interasting onie.
He bad devaloped a pbilosophy of life wbicb
appsrently was not acquired by conscious

199

inteliectual effort, but was born in him, a part
of bis being. It was a philosophy of good
cheer, of absolute sincerity, of real toIerance
to ail men. He not oniy neyer wished ta
make an enemy, but seemingly was incapable
of makirg one. Through a long and somewhat eventful career hie met ail the vicissitudes which from time ta time opposed
him, with a delightful gaod humour and a
fascinating aggregation of qualities, and I
venture to say that the number of those
whose passing fromn our eountry wouid be more
wideiy and more deeply lamented than his is
very smali indeed. The tributes paid him,
not only by the press, but by bath humble
and great of his awn province, are themselves
a testimony ta the remarkable personality
wbicb is naw no more. I am sure my humble
sentences will be foilowed by the words af
athers wbo knew him even better. These
together will go in deep sincerity to his widow,
to bis daugbter and ta bis son and san's famiiy
as testifying the very profound respect and
affectian in whicb hie was heid by this body.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honaurabie friend bas spoken with such felioity
in word and tihought of aur departed calleagues tihat 1 hesitate ta follow him aet thls
moment. The longer we serve in this Cha~mber, the more do we feel tibat we are bound
together by ties of friendehip which make us
virtuaiiy ane family.
I rememiber the coming ta this House of
the late Mr. Ross. He hied already been
stricken with tihat disease which prevented

worth and services. I refer to, James Hamilton
Ross. I well remnember my first meeting with
him, in 1891-f orty-two years ago-in the
office of Dr. Turnbuli, on the main street of
the then littie town of Mooee Jaw. At that
time his son, J. Gordon, Ross, who was a
member of the iast Partiament, had flot been
born; and it was flot titi fourteen years later
that the provinces of Saskatchewan and
Alberta were esta'blished. From the day of
our first meeting tilt we iast parted, a few
short weeks ago, we remained close personal
friends, with the resuit that I knew the man,
the reat Jim Ross, as very few, if any, now
surviving him did.
We have had in 'the press, and here to-day,
sketches of lis life and of his public services.
These 1 shall refer to but briefly, as tbey are
well known. I desire, rather, to give you a
gtimpse of the man and his worth prior to
the time of the great calamity that struck
him dovn thirty-two years ago, when he was
but forty-five years of age.
Young Ross, of sturdy Scotch stock, was a
born pioneer. With the fuil approvai of his
parents, he trekked to the tittle-known open
stretches of the Canadian West some time in
the seventies-I cannot give you the exact
date, but he coutd flot have been mor-e than
twenty-two or twenty-three years of age. I
can readiiy recail many atonies relating to bis
experiences in the regions of the Lake of the
Woods and Lakes Winnipeg and Manitoba,
and of his earty travets over the vast prairies,
from Fort Garry to the Rocky Mountains.
Finatty, a year or two prior to the advent
of the Canadian Pacifie Raiiway, he entered
for a homestead, on part of which the city
of Moose Jaw now stands.
In the winter of either 1891-2 or 1892-3,
when I was living in Moose Jexw., his aged
fathfT nearly lost his life. The eider Ross
wua in the village one evening when a blizzard
sprang up. H1e i'mmediatedy st.arted for home.
With difficutty he reached the fence surrounding part of 4the farm, and finaity groped his
%vay to the gate; but, although the house
stood only some 150 yards away, he neyer
reached it that niight. Hour after hour, ait
night long, tAie oid man tramped up and
down, backwards and foq-wards, in a smail
coulee thut gave some shelter from the howiing storni that xiaged att a&bout. In the mornmng, with thbe aid of daYiight, lie finally reached
home., Thougli badly frost-bitten, he soon
recovered.
SThis selfame spirit of piuck and endurance
often aided the son in hîs many pioneering
and travelling experiences. I rcait that on
one occasion Jim Rjosa and a companion were

201

eaught in a blizzard somnewhe-re between
WVitbow Bunch and Moose Jaw, on a treeless
plain so-me n-inety mites across. On three
separate occasions relief parties were organized in Moose Jaw t-o search foir them, but
the storm was so bad that they were cornpelled te tura back. Without going furthei'
in-to detail, ail I need to relate now is tjhat
Ross and his oompanion, when they reaiized
the nature of the a.pproachàng storm, sought
shelter in the nearest dip or roll in the
prairie, pitched their amatil tent, and, fastenmng it securely and banking it high with snow,
sett.ied down te wait tilt the blizzard blew
itself out. In similar circumstances many of
tihe early pioneers leSt their lives.
The varied experiences of the late Senator
Ross, whilst he roamed the prairies in the
late seventies and in the eighties, fitted him
as nothing else could for his subsequent
career and work. In the early days there
wau scarcely a pioneer in that vast territory
from the Red River to the Kicking Herse
who did net know him in person or by
name. On the other hand, wherever lie went
he always made it his business to study the
needs, hopes and aspirations of the settiers
and ranchers.
In the Northwest Ternitories at that time
there was little or nothing in the way of
government as we now und-erstand it. Finally,
however, the Northwest Assembly was ez-tabtished, with very limited powers, and in 1883,
at the early age of twenty-seven, young Ross
was etected by popular vote as oxfie of its
members.
From that time forward he devoted a, great
deal of his time and energy to the struggle,
first, for fult responsibie government, and
later on, for the establishment of autonomous
provinces, lis first partner in this struggle
was Frank Oliver, of Edmonton. Later on
they were joined by Fred Haultain, a young
lawyer of Macleod, who became their very
able leader. Mr. Haultain, now Sir Frederick
Haultain, is Chief Justice of the Appeal
Court of Saskatchewan. Mr. Oliver becamne
Minister of the Interior after the resignation
of Sir Clifford Sifton, and later was a member
of the Board of Railway Commissioners for
Canada. First Oliver, then Ross and Oliver,
then the trio, Hauttain, Ross and Oliver, and
finally Haultain with other associates, battled
long and strenuously for the same rights,
powers and privileges for the people of the
plains as were enjoyed by Canadians living
elsewhere in the Dominion.
Eventually
success crowned their efforts, and in 1905 the
Autonomy Acts, creating the provinces of
Saskatchewan and Alberta, were passed by
Parliament.

SENATE

The Jirn Ross of those days was a real
force-c-nergetic and resource-ful. On the platform he bad few equals. Wbile flot in
orator, he was a very rapid and convincing
speaker, and his universal popularity always
ensured bima a warmn and spontaneous welcorne wherever he went. In rny day in this
Chamber I have neyer heard bis voice raised
in the way that I was accustomed to hear it
in the West. But there was a reason for
that.
ln 1901 Mr. Ross was appointed CommisEioner or Governor of the Yukon. At that
time the big gold rush was on the wane, but
there were stili turbulent days and trying
situations for those in authority. That the
new Commis.sioner did his work weIl bas
been f ully attested by ail who followed bis
regime. It was a trying time, with endless
work and worry, but the Commissioner neyer
spared himself, witb the resuit that his healtb
and strength were considerably undermined.
Then, suddenly, in August, 1901, witla the
wreck of an ocean steamer, be lost his wif e
and baby child at sea. Not long afterwards
be suffercd a severe stroke, and it, was only
after many months of careful nursing and
the greatest care that he partially recovered
bis old-time vitality.
In 1904, sorne twenty-nine years ago, Mr.
Ross was appointed a member of the Senate,
but he was under strict medical orders neyer
to take part in our debates. He was neyertheless a member of our more important
committees, and attended their meetings
regularly. It was more in quiet private conversation tban in the burly-burly of House
or committee work that bis sound practical
common sense and unusually good judgment
were belpful in dealing witb the problerns
that came before us.
As a man arnong men our late colleague,
as I knew him in the old days, had few
equals. He possessed to a rernarkable degree
ail those qualities of head and heart that lead
to popularity. To the very end lie retained
bis cheerful, sunny, sympathetie disposition.
Tbroughout bis entire span of life be was
always Jim Ross to all wbo knew bim. Here
we were always glad to meet and greet bima.
His private life was ever characterized by
kindness and generosity and witbin bis family
circle he was an ideal busband and father.
He was beloved by aIl.
The end carne suddenly, and without pain,
at the cornparatively ripe age of seventyseven. Truly rnay it be said in the broadest
and best sense that bis was a useful life.
The historical records of Canada, more particularly those of the pioneer days of Western
Canada, will for ever carry bis name on their

Hon. H. S. BELAND (Translation): Idesire
to join rny honourable friends who have preceded me in expressing the deepest sympatby
of tbis House to tbe 'bereaved farnilies of
honourable senators Ross, Todd and Daniel;
and I whole-beartedly subscribe to ivhat bas
ýbeen said in eulogy of tbcse departed colleagu es.
Honourable senators, death. whicb ruthlessly
cuts down the dearest and xnos precious lives,
bas just left a great void among us in taking
froin us our lamented colleague Senator Jacques
Bureau.
WelI merited, indeed, is the praise bestowed
upon bim, a few moments ago, 'by the bonourable gentlemen who so ably lead tbe deliberations of tbis Chamber. My purpose in rising
at this tirne is sirnply to add the bumble
corroboration of a French-speaking voice from.
Tbree Rivers, and to lay upon this newly('Iosed grave the affectionate and respectful
trihute inspired by an old, a warmi and unalterable friendsbip.
It is scarccly 'believable, honourable senators,
tbat neyer again -hall we look upon bis face,
:ýGopecn, so jovial, so îsvmpatbetic, wbicha for
ncarly thirty-five years; wa., one of tbc ornamnents of parliarnentary life.
A munificent Providence bad endowed our
colleague Jacques Bureau with admirable
qualities. He had been granted the rarest
gi'fts of intellect and the finest qualities of
heart and mind. Indomnitable energy and
inany years of unremnitting toil bad brougbt
into prominence these gifts and qualities and
carried him t.o tise highest ranks, botb in tbe
legal profession and in tbe public life of
Canada.* We owe it to bis memiory to proclaima
that the fine talents entrusted to bima were
ever uýsed in the rnost sacred causes and for
noble ends.
Ibis love-I migbt say bis passionate loveosf country and race, bis devotion to bis farnilv.
bais pursuit of trutb and justice and the performance of innurnerable works of cbarity and
kýindness-tbe-se were the characteristios that
diqtinguisbýed bim in the course of bis fruit-ful
career, in wb'ich be was actuated always by tbe
generous, impulses of bis beart and an untiring
activity. Perpetual youtb seemed to adorn bis
brow and radiate frorn bis wbole person. Ris
mere presence in a group sufficed to create a
cheerful atmospbere, and everyone sougbt bis
eompany for the very reason that bis mental
disposition bad the happy effeet of dissipating
gloom, as if by magic, and speading sunshine.
How mucb moral distres bow rnucb physical
misfortune be relieved! Tactfully, quietly and

FEBRUARY 1, 1933
unostentatiously, throughout his hie, he followed the example of the Good Samaritan in
allaying or mitigating suffering wherever he
could find it.
Rom one end of the country to the otber,
honourable senators, the death of our colleague
causes bitter sorrow. But it is especially in
bis dear old city of Three Rivers that bis
memory will be ensbrined with fadeless and
perpetual flowers. From there will ascend towards him the incense of affection and gratitude.
And this feeling of devoted gratitude that
rises frein the hearts of bis fellow-citjzens of
Three Rivers will nlot be sbort-lived. No. It
will continue to be wafted up to bis seul and
hover round about it as long as the peaceful
waters of the majestic St. lawrence shaîl reflect on their limpid surface the beautiful
countryside in whose bosom our lamented
coileague and friend sleeps bis last sleep.
The sorrow that weighs upon the soul of bis
family, and upon us, will be softened, let us
hope, by tbe thouglit that lie bas entered upon
another lufe, a life immune from care, wbere
hearts abounding in charity, solicitude and
loyalty receive their final reward-a consoling
thougbt, indeed, whicb the great poet Victor
Hugo bas strikingly expressed in these lines:
Je dis que le tombeau qui sur les morts se
ferme,
Ouvre le firmament;
Et que ce qu'ici-bas nous prenons pour le
terme
Est le commencement.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
my only excuse for rising at this time is that
1 cannot let the occasion pass witbout referring to two senators from the Province of
New Brunewick wbo have departed this life
since last we met here. I amn in entire accord
with all the kindly and generous -remarks that
have been made witb respect to our four
colleagues who have passed away, but I wisb
to speak particularly of Senators Daniel and
Todd. Both were prominent in the public
and social life of their province, and in their
departure the province bas suffered a loss
whicb it will be very difficult, to 611l.
Senator Daniel was of an older generation
than I, and I was not as intimate with him as
I was with Senator Todd. Nevertheless, I
knew him sufficiently well, personally and by
reputation, to realize that bis personality bas
leift its mark upon Parliament, New Brunswick, and Canada as a wbole. He was an
outstanding man in bis professional life, in
bis military connections and in the affairs of
bis adopted city.
Hon. Irving R. Todd it was my privilege to
know intimately for many years, but particularly since the War. When I firet came to

203

the Senate lie was already a member. At
his request I joined him in the room which
we occupied until recen.tly, -and for the past
four years we weTe desk-mates in this Chamber. I only wish that I could find the words
to say wbat I really feel wîtb regard to Irving
Todd. Very little reference bas been made to
bis business relations in bis native province.
Notbing could be said about the industrial
activities from the earliest times on tbe St.
Croix river. wbicb separates the State of
Maine from the Province of New Brunswick,
witbout mention of the name of Todd. In
that community, wbere large lumbering operations are carried on, the Todds bad a large
business, the late Senator's grandfatber and
fatber having preceded bim in the same line.
His father dicd at a coxuparatively early age,
leaving Irving to take charge of the business.
That was at a time of depression, not quite
as bad as the present one, but stili a very
marked depression ail over the Nortb Amenican Continent, and be came in-to control of
the business to find it almost in a state of
bankruptcy. Neyer was any man's business
acumen more clearly demonstrated than in
the case of the late Senator Todd. He nelieved that concern of its bunden of debt and
developed it into one of the most succeseful
enterprises on the St. Croix river, netining
from it only when, at the age of fty, bis
hcaltb broke down and bis doctonr ordered a
rest.
But Irving Todd was niot the type of mani
who could nemain idie, even unden a docton'e
orders. He was too active in mind to permit
himself to nust out, and lie at once became
actively interested in various otber affaire of
bis town, bis county and bis province. For a
numrber of years he worked witb me on the
exeoubive of the New Brunswick Telephone
Company. He was one of the most aotive
men in that organdzation, one whoee advice
wa-s always souglit and usually tccepted. He
bad a particular faculty of endearing himself
to those wbo knew him. Frequently I visited
him in hie home at Milltown, on the St. Croix
river. He hiad a fine old country bouse that
had heen the home of bis gnandfathen and
bis father. Tbe people of thbe whole community consulted Sen-ator Todd when in difficultie's. He was a depositony of thte secrets,
tbe troubles and thbe ills of all the older
people in that neighbourhood. Those wbo
wanted advice came to bim, and those in
seancli of sympatby knew that in Senaton
Todd tihey would find an inexhaustible well.
Young people, too, wbo wanted assistnce of
any kind alwiays got it from him, if tbey
convinced bim tibat tbey were deeerving.

SENATE
The attitude of the whole community to0
waîtls Senator Todd was weil demonstratod
during the War. He had been a vcrv prominient membor of the Liberal Party in Newv
Brunswick, active iu ail its work, but on the
formnation of flie Union Clovernment hoe
ohanged bis poliue.da adhcrence, as so mny
others then did. But hce continued to occupy
thc same position in the heairts and minds
of ail who knew him, regar-dle-as of tlic party
tn wbich they belonged; the political aspect
did flot affect tbic situation in anv wav wbativer. 1 think that of vr few 'men'could a

For :ît least twenty years Senator Todd ivas
one of my tixo or ilîree most intimate friendsý.

I very deeply regret the passing of Senator
Ro&s. We were warm personal friends for
more than thirty-five years, and I repeat that
it is an unfurtunate thing for Canada that he
was prevented from taking a more active part
in the public life of the Dominion.
Hon. H. H. HORSEY: Honourable members,
I would not have riîsen 'this afternoon had I
not felt constrained to say a few words as a
room-mate of my friend, the late Senator Ross,
of Moose Jaw. To my leader and others who
have known him intimately throughout his
long and succez-sful career I leave the estimation of his work and worth.
From our first meeting in the late Senator's
room after my appointment, he always treated
me as a comrade, and I looked upon him as a
splendid representative of a constitutional
body like the Senate. His kindness and consideration to a stranger without parliamentary
experience, and without any officiai public
service, 1 cannot forget.
As the months went by and the several
sessions came and went, our friendship increased and I came to have a higla regard for
bis ability, experience and judgment, and a
real affection for his attractive personality.
He seemed to be ever the same; cheerful,
almost buoyant in spirit, neyer irritable,
gloomy or cast clown. Even the deepest and
deadliest of depressions could not spoil his
spirit, for silence his clear, merry chuekle,
for he had absolute assurance more prosperous
days would come eventually.
When his eyes began to give him serious
trouble, althougl handicapped also by the partial disablement of one arm, from. a previous
trouble, he continued frecli in spirit and spotless in attire. Just as lie kept every spot
from bis garments, so lie tried to guard bis
life and character from every blemish. His
example and presenoe here have been helpful,
and 1 know lis memory will lie also.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable

at il o'clock. In viiew of the necessity of
having a good attendance on Tuesday mornmng, 1 would move that wlhen the House adjournis it stand adjourned until Monday
evening next at 8 o'clock. I admit that my
purpose is merely to insure a creditable
attendance at the Railway Committee on
Tuesday. I do not wish to be too insistent,
and should like to hear whether honourable
memibers are in favour of the suggested.
motion. When the -adjournment of the cornmittee unbil Tuesdey morning was proposed
I had thought tiha-t the House could be adjourned until Tuesday afternoon and that
mýos.t of the members would be here in the

consîderable number would not be here at
that time unless thie House should resume on
Monday evening.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Perlsaps the

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I might say
that we have again notified the railway

REMEDIES FOR UNEMPLOYMENT AND
UNREST
PIIOPOSED RESOLUTION
Hon. PASCAL POIRIER moved:
Eeselved, that ie the opinion cf this House,
six heurs should coustitute ene fulîl day's work
for labourers, le the manufacture and in the
ruine, and also for artisans, handicraftsmen and
llire(l commnoe day labourers;
Fuýrthp.rmorc. that more effective encouragement should be given te the reteuru te, the land.
He said: Honourable members, the economic
world is eut cf gear. Take for instance the
United Stat-es: ene-fourth cf the world's
gold is boarded in Washington, and ten million
meFn, mostly labourers, are starving for want
cf gold te buy bread. The condition cf the
labouring class hero in Canada is about as
abnormal. We have hundrcds cf millions cf
bushels cf wheat stored in our elevators, and
out cf a population cf nine million seuls,
800,000 cf our citizens would go without their
thrce meals a day if the State did net provide for them.
But. you say, those men in nced must be
on the sick-list, or in seme way incapacitated?
Net at alI; the greater number cf themn enjoy
full health and are capable cf earning a
living. Then they refuse te work? On the
contrary, they are claîneuring for employment.
Wbat, then, is the trouble wvith them? What
is the cause cf alI t.his? The cause cf aIl this
is that everything is going wrong; that the
werld is net turning on its normal axis; that
our vaunted civilization is lagging beihind.
Honourable members, nearly one million cf
our countrymen are destitute and are calling
upon us for bread and shelter. What are we
te do? XVe are voting annually thirty, fifty,
sixty millions of dollars for t-heir relief. But
did it ever strike you that this dole, as we
caîl it, is nothing but a form cf Socialism,
the werst form cf alI; that the State is
supplying a livelihood te able-bodied men,
men capable cf producing a revenue, and is
receiving nothing in return; that it is actually
enceuraging idleness and mendicancy?
The day will come when the public treasury
will have been exhausted, and the State will
no longer be capable cf supplying food te her
pensioners. These will continue te go hungry
tbree times a day, and they will keep ceming
to us, in increasing numbers, clamouring for
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

brcad and relief. What will happen then?
Idleness is of evil counsel. A British citizen
capable of earning wages, and willing te work,
soon tires of begging and of receiving alms.
That degrading condition is distasteful to him.
Before long he gets to hate the hand that
feeds him. The French peet was right who
said: "Notre ennemi, c'est notre maitre."
What are we to do te avert such a calamity,
to save our civilization, which is s4haken to its
very foundations? This is what I invite you
ail to inquire into with me.
Now, before applying a remedy, a good
physician carefully examines the patient he is
called upon to treat; he goes into the remotest
causes of the disease and makes a thorougli
survey of the p0hysical conditions of the
patient. Then, after making as accurate a
diagnosis as possible, and then only, he
applies a remcdy. This is what we are going
to do together.
The outward, visible and tangible symptoms
of the ailment froni which the world suffers
arc the want of means to enable a very large
number of common day labourers and artisans
toecaro their daily bread, the resulting discentent, and the rumbling threats cf a general
uprising. What causes ail this? If we want
te be sure of our diagnosis, we must flrst go
deecp down into the history of labour.
At ahl times, frem the remotest periods, we
flnd two categories cf men plainly distinctthe toilers and the reapers; the former workrng the wbole day long, and the latter enjeying the fruits of their labours. "Sic vos, non
vobis." To the former, subjection and abjection; te the latter, possession and authority.
Let us take slavery, for example. Slavery is
unnatural; slavery is heIl on earth. Now,
slavery, in one form or otlher, has existed from
the remoest ages. At the time when Socrates
was preacbing the unity of God and the immortality of the seul, three-fourths cf the
population cf Athens consisted cf slaves.
Under the Roman emperors the condition
was still worse. 1 recaîl only the twe most
polished nations of antiquity. We find that
.slavery existed in the United States until
the War cf Secession, and here, in Ontario,
up te 1774. It was only in 1772 that the courts
declared it non-existent in the United Kingdem cf Great Britain and Ireland.
Truc, slavery was banned from continental
Europe, by the Church, during the Middle
Ages, but serfdom and villainage were substituted in its stead, by the barons and the
dignitaries;
and oftentime9 serfdom and
villainage were worse than slavery.
For the serf and the villain-our forefathers, honourable gentlemen, were villainsthe working heurs were fromn sunrise te sun-

FEBRUARY 6, 1933
set. Women and children were flot excepted.
A Iaw was enacted in England, in the fifteenth
century, exempting fromn universal. corvée
ahildren under the age of eight years. The
ordinary working day for menials and peasants
at that period was twelve to fourteen hours.
Why go back so far in history to ascertain
the intolerable servitude of the common
labourer and of his wife and children? Within
the memory of the present generation the
working day bere i» Canada, flot only for the
common labourer, but for the artisan as well,
was from te» to twelve hours. To-day in
Nova Scotia it is over ten.
But, you will ask me, what have we to do
with ail that? This, honourable gentlemen,
is the hidden germ. What had we to do with
the disobedjence of Adam and Eve in the
garden of Eden, that we should be held responsible, i» this world and i» the other, for
the misdoing of oui common father and
mother?
There obviously exists a Iaw, flot well
understood, but just and equitable, since it
is of God, that makes us answera'be-to what
extent I do flot k»ow-for the misdoings of
thosge of our kind-a law of huýma» solidarity.
It is generally the innocents who atone for
the guilty. To this law is due the Redeinption of ýman'kind. The dobt sometimes remains years, nay centuries, i» suspense, but
immanent justice requires that it be settlcd
sooner or later. >'It is of flPcessity that al
standing accounts do, saine day, balance, by
way of payment; that equations in ail things
be established. Now, the date for the settlement of the abuses, of the injustices, of the
crimes of the past is maturing, has apparently
arrived. The day of reckoning is at, hand.
The governing powers of to-day, who occupy
the position of the governing powers of yore,
are summoned 'by the governed classe, who,
in their turn, represent the misused, and exploited classes of past ages, to come to a
settlement of accounts, to strike a balance.
The liabilities of our prede-cessors weigh upon
our shoulders, rest upon our heade.
ARl this sounds like extracts from the
Apocalypse, 1 hear you say. [t may be so,
but it is nevertheleas something that also
sounds like a formidable truth.
The labouring: classes have another grievance, less momentous, perhaps, than the
accumulated injustices of past ages, but
actual and more acute: they complain that
in the distribution of the boons which were
aIl destined by umiversal democracy, coupled
with the marvellous inventions of the nineteenth and twentieth centu-ries, for the aileviation of tIe condition of mankind, they are
not getting a fair share-in fact, that they are

getting comparatively nothing. As a consequence they are thrown out into the cold
world, and thousands of them forced to beg
lamentably for a morsel of bread for theix
starving families and themselves.
To these two mnai» grievances that the
labouring classes have against the world Voday must be added the wail of the farmer
and ttue cry of despair of the manufacturer.
Altogether, the total amount of obligations
to be met is stunning. We must not forget
that the duty of making a settlement, or at
least a compromise, devolves upon us as
legislators.
But did we not hld, 'here in Ottawa, last
summer, an Imperial Conference of the
United Kingdom and of aIl the British
colonies, and enter into fiscal agreements
destined to relieve the situation? Is it not
aiso true that we are just out of another
conference, that of the Canadia» provinces
and of tIe central Government, convened for
the samne object? ARl this is true, and, I will
add, laudable. As a resuit of these conferences our economic situation will very hikely
be improved. Improved, but not healed.
The dreaded cancer will remain. Something
must be found which will extirpate it, and
this with no long delay, for tIe cancer grows
alarmàngly.
The murmur that reaches Parliament from
the streets is now subdued, for things have
not come to a crisis, and the dole appeases
the hanger of the multitude. But when the
public treasury is exhausted and the dole is
no longer forthcoming that murmur will
change into a ýmalediction. Hearken to the
suppressed rumble! It comes from gatherings of unemployed fromn Victoria to Sydney,
from prisons like Portsmouth, St. Vincent de
Paul, Dorchester-from everywhere.
And
what will happe», what can happe», if the
raibble, so-called, run amuck and break ahl
restraints?
Remember what happened in France during
the Revolution of 1793. Look at what happened in Portugal flot so long ago. Look at
what is happening to-day i» Russia, in Spain,
i» Mexico. The Czar of alI the 'Russias, the
grandees of Spa»n and Portugal, the clergy of
Mexico, on-ce all-powerful, were scattered like
dry leavc.s in a hurricane When the people
rose in anger.
ARl that may be truc, but are wc, the govcrning class ini democratic Canada, not in a
position to quell insurrections?
No, my
friends, we are flot, if lines are drawn and
sides taken. Since the granting of manhood
and womanhood suffrage, the rnajority govcrns, as it did before, but the axis of the

is, according to all appearances, about to come
into bis own. This will be the edjusting of
another equation. Not satisfied with crushing
down the man of the glebe, Mother Earth
humiliated him. But the cultivation of the
land will soon be considered as honourahie
as any other calling. The if e of a farmer is
now no longer what it was in years past. Re

Let the Federal Government, the provinces'
and municipalities apply the millions of dollars
they spend on doles to-day (the Dominion
Government bas already voted $115,000,000)
towards helping the exodus from the city to
the countiy, buying and equipping farms,
supplying instructors, paying faxes and the
like. Then the jobless and unempleyed wbo
now overcrowd the cities will be able, nay,
will be forced to do something te help themselves and relieve the public treasury. The

Let us open wide the avenues that lead to
available farcas, and in three decades the
population of Canada will have doubled. St.
Thomas Aquinas was right, and was prophetie,
when he said that all mon should own a plot"'particellam"ý-of mother land.
But all thie again is higli f antasy, 1 hear
you remiark. 0f course it is. But wbat is
f antasy to-day is apt to be stera reality to-

morrow. It is a ve'ry unimaginative politicien
who doe not try bis luck as a prophet in an
age when every recurring day announces oome
startling invention or new device.
But the capita.lists, the lords of trade, the
barons of industry, whaît will become of them?
Do flot worry. They wi11 continue to hoard
money, though on a scale less colossal than
they have been doing heretofore. And what
is the good of a billion dollars to-day? In
times pa.st one could have bought with one
billion dollars, nay, with one million or less,
ail that is purchasable under the sun, to wit:
men, women, territories, tities, honours, digndties, coneciences-everything, in fact, except
dogmatic truth as revealed in the gospels.
Riches, tities and dignities hoisted their
possessors ahove the law and conferred irarnunity on tho-m. To-day let Ford drive
his auto at a greater speed than the municipal
by-law permits, and, although a billionaire, he
will be amenable to the police court. This
shows how far democraey has gone. It bae
gone far enough.
It is our duty to see that jts further conquests turn to the betterinent of humanity.
Revolutions are rampant. Let us turn them
into evolutions. Let us show the world,
which bas its eyes on us, bow an impending
calamity can be averted; how a devastating
torrent roaring down from the mountain
can be converted into channels of irrigation.
Another consideration, and it will be the
last. This one concerne the role Canada
appears to be called to play among nations.
Did it ever strike you, honourable members,
that the coming into the world of our Confederation is different from the birth of ahl
other known nations, ancient or modern?
Kingdoms, empires, republics, since history
began, have been founded in the borrors of
war, in bloody conquests, in violence, in
hatred, in malediction. Canada springs from
a friendly conference held in Charlottetown
in 1864, and from an Act of the Imperial
Parliament passed in 1867. Since 1867 the
two component racial elements of our
Dominion, the English and the French, have
lived and grown up side by side in peace,
amity and good-will. No unjust war bas
ever tarnisbed our escutcheon. Our glorious
participation in the World War of 1914 was
to save the Empire, ourselves, and the
hegemony of the world.
The wars Canada waged against the United
States in 1774 and 1812 were in self-defence.
Even prior to the British conquest, the first
European settlers of Canada, the French,
lived in peace and fraternity with the aborigmnes. The Mohawks or Iroquois, our only
Indian foes, were allies of the warring

It devolves upon us who are not fettered by

believe the best way to attain this end is
by legal enactment to limit to six hours the

day labourers employed by municipalities;
also to encourage effectively a return to the

bringing this resolution before the House, and
in making the remarks be has made to-night;
but when I saw this resolution on the Order
Paper, and when I heard the discussion that

thinking that thousands of citizens of Canada
outside of this Chamber would regard it as a
great reason for the reform of the Senate.
Why? Because, as surelv every honourable
member of this House knew before this debate
started, the matter is none of our business.
Both parties in this country have so agreed
for many years. If that were not so, why
should we not have concerned ourselves long
ago witbh securing the adoption of the eighthour day? Both parties have indicated that
it was neither their business nor their right to
interfere in the matter, as it was one over
which the provincial governments had exclusive jurisdiction. When, the other day,
my good friend the senator from Le Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) asked me if I cared
to second this motion, I promptly said no.
Tînt did not mean that I was not in full
snmpathy with a proposal for a six-hour day
first, last, and all the time. But far be it from
me to inject into this Chamber something
vith which it has no authority to deal. No
matter what we did with regard to it, our
action would be, at best, only a graceful
gesture.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The League of
Nations takes that kind of action.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It would be just as
consistent and logical for this Chamber to
enter into the discussion of a resolution tiat
the children of I*rael should be given separate
schools in the cities of Toronto and Montreal

FEBRUARY 6, 1933
in order that they might be taught in theji
own language. The one is just as much oui
business as the other.
In this connection I cairnot help thinking
of a letter that came to my desk lasît Wednesday from an employee of a manufacturing
concern flot many -miles distant from here, a
concern which exacts tribute from every
citýizen of Canada who wears covering over
his stockings. This letter indicated that the
ernployees of that concern were working a full
week, and that the wages of married men
withi families were from $1.75 to $6 a week.
I arn wondaring what tihe wage miglit be for
a six-h our day; whather it would be sufficient
to enabla a man with a wife and family to
keep soul and body togethar. Again, last
Thursday there came to my office a clean-cut
young Canadian who told me that hie had a
wife and thraa children, the oldest of whom
was a girl of n-ineteen years of age, and that
ha did not have enough money to buy her
street-car tickets to enabla hier to gat to the
high school that she was attending. H1e showad
me a due bill for $5.40-what hie was allowed
for working three eight-hour days in a stone
quarry-and said hie could redeem it only
in grocaries and the like. Ha wantad to
know if I could do anything to assist him in
getting at laast fifty cents or a dollar of that
in the form. of cash. 0f course 1 could not.
So, in considering the length of the day it is
aqually important to consider whether the
day's work is going to bring sufficient compensation to the labouring man to keep body
and soul together.
I know something about the shortening of
the working-day. I happen to have livad
long enough to remember the time when, as
a freight brakeman, I got $1.25 to cover a
115-mile division; and I may say that on
many a trip 1 worked from fifteen to twenty
hours--yas, and as long as forty hoursfor
my $1.25. *Such things have changad, and
some of us hava been charged with being too
radical in halping to bring about the ohange
from the twelve-hour day and the ten-hour
day to the aight-.hour day.
Now let us talk about a six-hour day. It
is coming, but not as a resuit of any pious
resolution of the Senata of Canada. 1 do not
suppose that such a resolution will do a
great deal of harm. It has dona me no harmi
to listan to the words uttered by my venarabla
friend to-night. Bis action makes us realize
that men think about these things in the
interest~ of their fellow men. But 1 would
respectfully suggest to my honourabla friand
that there is something aIse to ba considered,
su that when the shiorter day cornes, as 1
think it will have to corne if we are going
53721-141

211

to d-ivida up the work equitably, a married
man with a family, at least in t-lis Canada of
ours, will receive a reasonabla living wage and
will not be expected to subsist on $1.75 or
$6 a week.
I a'm not sure ais to the benefits or other
affects that may accrue froin this discussion,
but it seems to me that the people of Canada
would think more highly of our intelligence
and our legislating sbility if we were to stick
to our knitting and deal with matters in regard to which we have some authority and
right.

CONTROL OF MýOTOR TRANSPORTATION IN CANADA
MOTION

Hon. JAMES H. KING moved:
Resolved: That in the opinion of the Senate
the Governroent of Canada should bring into
confarence the provincial gvramant, the
axacutivas of tihe Canadjan National and the
Canadian Pacifie Railways, and representatives
of the newer formn of transportation, as
obtains in the autobus, motor-truek and aez'oplana services, wbth a viaw ot formularting
regulýations for thami of an interprovincial or
national character which wo.uld permit of their
normal and proper developmant, and prevant
unfair and unwarranted competition with our
railway systemTs.
Ha said: Honourable sanators, the objeet
of my resolution was to bring before the
Senate a phase of the second part of the
report of the Royal Commission on Railways
and Transportation. In that report you will
find a comprehiensiva survey of the automobile, motor-hus and motor-truck transportation and its affect upon railway traffie and
railway earnings in Canada. It is also shown
that !his formi of traneportation is diractly

212

SENATE

under the control and regulation of the provincial authorities. From the report it will
be found that there has been a very great
increase in motor vehicle registration since
the year 1923. If I may, I will read the
figures. In 1923 there were 585,000 registered
motor vehicles in Canada. This number increased very rapidly till in 1930 there were
1,239,000, and in 1931, which showed a slight
decline, there were 1,206,000. It is shown in
the report that the entrance of these motor
vehicles into our transportation service has
seriously affected the revenues of the railways. The railway earnings from passenger
traffic alone, in 1923, were $77,335,000. In
1926 there was a decline to $73,709,000, in
1930 to $61,512,000, and in 1931 to $43,759,000.
There is no doubt that tihis decrease in earnings has been largely due to the privately
owned automobile, though the motor bus also
has been a factor.
There is no control over the privately
owned automobile beyond the power and
desire to own and the regulations imposed by
the municipalities and provincial governments.
But there is an entirely different situation
with respect to the motor bus and motor
truck, which are common carriers, and provincial govemnients have passed legislation
to control the traffic of those vehicles to a
certain extent. The Commission indicated its
belief that, owing to our great distances and
spursity of population, the development of
motor-bus traffic would not be as rapid in
Canada as in the United States. If I am
permitted, I should likeo to refer to a pe-sonal
observation I have made during the past
year, which does not confirm the Commission's
belief.
For manv years I lived in the
Kootenay country in British Columbia.
Twelve or thirteen years ago it was considered a more or less hazardous adventure to
go from my home in Cranbrook across the
Rocky Mountains to the city of Calgary or
other parts of Albcrta, but the higlways
have since been improved by the provincial
governments and are now well used by
motorists. Last year I found to my amazement that every morning a motor bus leoves
Spokane, in the State of Washington, for
Calgary, Alberta, and one leaves Calgary for
Spokane, the service being maintained over
roads througlh that mountainous country. The
result is that during the summer season most
of the passenger traffic beîtween these points
is handled by motor buses, and the services
of the railways have been curtailed because
their revenues are reduced. I do not believe
that miotor-bus service has been of sufficient
value to warrant the provincial governments
Hon. Mr. KING.

to make expenditures for maintenance of the
roads, due to the wear of that type of traffic.
I think inquiries would reveal many similar
instances throughout the country.
We in the Federal Parliament have some
responsibilities, although we have nothing to
do with the regulations.
Large sums of
money have been contributed from the federal
treasury for the building of interprovincial
highways which it is hoped by many people
wil become a national highway across the
country from Halifax to Vancouver. If that
devolopment is proceeded with, the day may
come when the Parliament of Canada will
declare that highway in the interest of the
people of Canada, as has been done with
If that should
respect to our railways.
happen, it would become a federal responsibility to maintain that highway and regulate
traffic over it.
As far as the motor bus and motor truck
are concerned, it is not my desire, in bringing
this matter before the Senate, that their usefulness should be unfairly curtailed. I believe
that if a proper study and inquiry were made
by qualified persons who are in the employ
of the provincial governments, co-operation
and understanding between these governments
might result in a plan for enabling these
forms of transportation to give the best
possible service to the public, without destroying the railway services that we are trying to
protect and save. It is not necessary to deal
extensively with the Royal Commission's
report in this respect. I think the Commission has stated very clcarly the proper use
of motor-truck transportation. On page 104
of the report it is stated:
The truck has its place in the movement of
goods, but its proper function is collective and
dispersive and not that of a primary carrier.
I think that theory is sound, and if a study
were made of the newer forms of transportation with that theory in view, a very useful
purpose could be served.
When, before the adjourment, I placed this
resolution on the Order Paper, I had no
knowledge of what the Government intended
to do, but shortly after the adjournment the
honourable Minister of Railways stated in
Toronto that it was intended to bring this
question before the Interprovincial Conference. It met in January. The right honourable leader of this House, in replying to the
honourable leader on this side on January
31, stated that at that conference there had
been an interesting discussion on the question.
He said also that there was no objection to
my bringing the subject to the attention of
this honourable body.

213

FEBRUARY 7, 1933
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I was not aware that the
honourable member for Kootenay East (Hon.
Mr. King) was to go on with his motion
to-day. Had I been, I should have felt it my
duty to renew my recollection of various facts
and historical data bearing on the subjectmatter. The question of the regulation of
motor transportation as relating to the whole
subject of transportation, and especially ta
the railways, is one of those very complicated
difficulties which have supervened in the
evolution of our railway and general transport systems, and likewise in all other countries, but particularly in the republic to the
south. I cannot say that what reading I
have done and what conferences I have been
able ta take some part in have yet brought
me to a point where any very distinct recommendation has formed in my mind. An
enormous amount of material has to be
reviewed, and I can assure the House that
there is a lot of argument to be presented
on both sides.
Perhaps my own collection of material
would be presented in a more orderly way if
I were to rehearse first the arguments presented on behalf of a rigid system of control
of motor transportation. The House should
keep in mind, though, that under our constitution, sa far as motor transportation is confined
within a province, it is a subject for provincial rather than federal regulation. A like
constitutional factor presents itself in the
United States in relation ta the same subject.
Such motor transportation as is interprovincial may well come under federal jurisdiction;
and undoubtedly the Federal Parliament
would have power ta tax all motor transportation, whether the termini were within
a province or whether one terminus was without.
Then what is ta be said on behalf of regulation? The argument mainly is that the chief
competitors themselves are regulated; that
very cumbersome, very rigid regulations have
been enforced by law against our railways:
regulations which fix the maximum and the
minimum the railways may charge, or even
fix the exact rate; regulations compelling
them ta take traffic from all and sundry;
regulations requiring them ta charge a specific
rate on goods of a certain weight and volume
if the goods are of a particular quality, and
ta charge perhaps five times as much for the
same weight and volume if the goods are of
another quality; regulations also which compel them ta render this service and that service and a whole multipIied list of services
at the behest of governmental commissions,
who represent of course the public of the
country. On the other hand there are no

such restrictions,

no

such

limitations,

no

such burdens placed upon their competitors
who use the highways by means of motor
buses and motor trucks. It is argued that
the highways are built at common cost, that
the railways are compelled to contribute ta
that common cost, and that the use of the
capital so employed is at the service of their
competitors, the motor bus and motor truck.
Then, too, there are provisions, more or less
of a public character, bearing on the wages
paid and on the qualifications of those
employed on the railways. These also are
burdens fixed by statute upon the great railway corporations, burdens from which their
competitors are, so far, relieved.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: And the upkeep?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Then the
upkeep, of course, is in the same position as
the initial capital investment; that is, the
upkeep of the motor road is on the State;
whereas the railways are compelled themselves to support the right of way upon which
they run.
That these arguments are forcible I believe
there is no doubt. To them can be added
this, that when you have a great utility which
provides transportation or other service for
the public in the mass, at very low cost, and
which, admittedly, is indispensable-which all
agree cannot possibly be allowed to disintegrate and be lost-then it is the duty of
the State to see to it that conditions are such
as to enable it to operate, and subsidiary and
more or less temporary means of transport or
service must yield to the paramount necessity
of the great public utility operating.
This principle we see in effect in our cities.
Take for example Montreal, Toronto or Vancouver, where the big public utility is the
street railway. The street railway is granted
certain franchises, and it is also compealed to
observe certain restraints and give certain
services, and everybody admits that it is an
indispensable necessity in our large cities now,
and will be for many years to come. Consequently our cities adopt regulations which
enable that utility to survive. The jitney, for
instance, is forbidden. In Winnipeg, I recall,
not many years ago, a question arose as to
whether the city was to permit the Winnipeg
Electrie Railway to be smothered in bankruptcy by the fly-by-night jitney, which was
run at five or ten cents a trip, and which
perhaps would be off the street in a week.
The city came to its decision and jitney
traffic was prohibited. This was merely a following out of the principle that where you
have a utility carrying the public in the mass,
an essential utility for the great body of the

214

SENATE

people, then such cornpetition as would make
the life of that utility impossible should be
forbidden.
It is argued that a similar law must apply
as respects motor-bus and motor-truck transportation and the raiiways. Everybody will
agree that the railways are not only essential,
they are of the very life of this country.
Where, for example, would Western Canada
bc if our great railvays were to collapse? The
400.000,000 bushels of wheat which must be
transported from that section of the country
could not emerge at our ports and reach the
market. It is essential that the railways be
maintained, and therefore, it is argued, other
things less essential and other services which
compete with theirs, and which are perhaps
ephemeral, munist yiold to their demands in
order that that vital and indispensable utility
may not be lost. Such in the main is the case
presented on behalf of the railways for the
regulation of motor transport.
On the other hand, the case presented by
those who would like to sec a minimum of
regulation applied to motor transport is
indeed a formidable one. We have perhaps
but little conception of the gigantic dimensions which motor-truck and motor-bus transport has now reached. In the United States,
if my recollection is right, the investment in
transport by motor exceeds the investment in
raihvay transport for that great country by
as muic as three times; I think the proportions are 3-48 to one. The investment for
motor transport includes, of course, the construction cot of the motor road, and rightly
inclides that element.
The number of
passengers carried per mile by motor tra~nsport is vastly greater than the mile-passenger
figne of the railways.
When you come to analyse the truck and
motor transport situation you find that in the
passenger field the vast majority of the business to-day is donc by the automobile; and
in the truck transport field, as I fancy could
be gathered froin the speech of the honourable member (Hon. Mr. King), the vast
mass of the business is donc not by common
carrier, but by private truck, owned and
operated by an individual or a company carrying on another business. The proportion left
for the common carrier is relatively very
small as ceompared with what is carried by the
individual, the departmental store, the chain
store and the manufacturer. So, in the sphere
of regulation, we find that the principles
applicable to the common carrier do net apply
at aill in the passenger area, and apply only
to a very moderate extent in the freight area.
It is also argued on the other side that
already the contribution of the motor traveller
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

to the revenues of the nation is fully equal
to the total outlay of the nation for the
support of motor traffic. The figures presented in a very wel1 studied report by a
Mr. Hutchison, of the Chrysler Corporation,
if I remember correctly, go to show that in
gasoline taxes, licences and other forms of
taxes specially applicable to those running
motors, the contribution already equals the
outlay. It is therefore pretty hard to argue
that it should be greater.
One hears it said many times that the big
truck is really the destroyer of the roads,
and that its effect on them is so great that
they are really maintained for the purposes of
the truck. This is truc if the road is of a
certain quality, for then it is the heavier
vehicle that finally destroys it. But the
argument, very strongly supported, is this,
that any road that is properly constructed to
meet the alternate attacks of frost and heat
is not affected by even the heaviest truck.
We have reached the point, I think, of
admitting that any sort of regulation except
that imtposed in the form of taxes-that is
to say, of payment for the use made of the
instrument-is very difficult indeed te devise.
How is one to get into the field of regulation
so as to attach to the user of the motor
vehicle sone of the restraints that we attach
to the use of the raihway coach and the freight
car? I for one feel that it is never going to
be practicable, and that if we are to bring the
two methods of transportation into the sanie
sphere, and apply like restrictions to both,
we shall bave to move along the line of removing restrictions froin the railways rather
than of adding thiem in the case of the motor
trucks.
I think I have said enough to indicate that
the subject is very conplex; but it is certainly
a subject whici we cannot avoid, for the
condition of freight earnings to-day is one
of the chief and most serious of the problens
that face us. I do not think the Senate could
do anything better than appoint a committee
to consider the subject for the purpose of
producing a report that would be of lielp
to the Governtent of the day, and enabling
both branches of Parliaient to address themselves to the question in concrete ferm.
The motion takes the position that there
should be an interprovincial conference. There
already has been such a conference. I can
assure the House, however, that the field of
review is by no means exhausted, the study
by no means complete, and the conclusion
reached by no means definite. I would suggest
to the honourable inember, therefore, that if
he were to gnend his motion so that it would
call for the appointient of a committee of

FEBRUARY 7, 1933
inquiry, it would perhaps be the means of
initiating proceedings whereby the Senate
would render valuabie assistance in a very
important field of future public commerce.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps the
honourable gentleman who moved this motion
wouid ask that it be aliowed to stand, in order
that lie might bave time to adapt it to the
suggestion of the right honourable gentleman.
Hon. Mr. KING: I shouid be glad to do
tbat.
On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen, the
debate was adjourned.
PENSIONS TO OFFICIAIS 0F CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS OR
DOMINION GOVERNMENT
MOTION NEGATIVED

Hon. JAMES MURDO-CK moved:
Resolved: That in the opinion of the Senate
no officer or employee of tihe Canadian National
B-ailways or of thse G<vernment osf Canada
should be paid after tise expiration of tise
present fiscal year a pension or retiremnent
allo-wance in exeas of $5,000 par yeax.
He said: Honourabie senators, on the 25th
day of iast November this Chamber almost
unanimously, if not entirely sio, passed a
resolution wbich contemplated co-operation
between the Canadian National Railways and
tbe 'Canadian Pacifie Railway for thse purpose
of seeing whether some of the enormous burdcn of excess costs now loaded on the people
osf Canada could not be eliminated. We are
told that the excess cost of operating tise
Canadian National Railways runs around a
million dollars a week. 1 tbink it can fairly
be said tbat it was with tbat purpose in
mmnd that the 6enate, by resolution, urged
the two railways to, co-operate. Tbis morning tbe Railway -Committee of tise Senate
had before it representatives of thse two railways who had been cioseiy in toucis with this
proposal for co-operation with a view to thse
elimination of excessive and unnecessary costs.
The committee undertook to discover wbhat,
if any, steps had been taken in thse desired
direction, and what had been accomplished in
bringing about essentiai and aitogetiser necessary economies. Tbe action of the 25tih of
Nov-ember and the inquiries made this morning were surely intended to strengthen the
position of honouraible mesmbers of this bouse,
who as representatives of the taxpayers of
Canada are intereqted in reducing expenses
in every way possible.
Tise resolution which I have the honour
to move to-day contemplates notbing more
and nothin-g less tian what I understood to
be in thse mind of thse Senate on the 25th

215

of last November. I realize that if this
resolution were to pass unanimously it would
flot -eut a single dime off any pension now
being paid unless action by the proper authority, namely the House that directly represents
the people of Canada, implementied our proposai and recommendation.
i do not want to labour the distress--yes,
sometimes disaster-that the railway situation
in Canada has brought, is bringing, and will
bring to thousands of citizens of this Dominion
-taxpayers, pre6umabiy, who have given the
hast part of their lives to irnplementing the
intention of Parliament. Not one of those
lines of railway came into existence without
the authority of Parliament, but to-day many
men who enýgaged in railroad work find that
ail their years of effort have been in vain,
and that they must either look elsewhere for
something to, do, or become derelicts of
society. Many of these men and their loved
ones are on Government relief because there
is no possibility of their getting sometbing
else to do.
We were told this morning that there
are tbree pension schemes conneýcted with
the operation of the Canad'ian National
Railways, and the details of those three
schemes were explained. We heard something- this morning about pension regulations and their application to certain persons, citizens of Canada, taxpayers, capable
and enthusiastie officiais and employees of
the Canadian National Raiiways or the Government of Canada. I think we wili ail agree
that in many cases those regulations were
foolish and unwarranted, particuiarly in relation to the construction of railways and the
carrying on of the transportation business of
Canada. In view of tbe present situation of
tbe people of Canada, who bave to pay the
piper, some of those regulationis bave become
obsolete. My proposai is simply this: that
under the emergent condition that now confronts thousands of Canada's citizens as a
resuit of the raiiway situation, and in accordance with the desire of the Senate as expressed on the 25th of Novemnber, tbat proper
officiers of the t-wo raîlways should get together and work out and însist upon certain
economies, we should, if we are sincereand ýI think we are-express the view that
$5,000 a year of the money of the taxpayers
of Canada is a sufficient amount te, be paid
to any empioyee or officer of the Dominion
Government as a pension. As I said hefore,
it seems to me that if the proposals that we
are now contemplating are put into effeet,
as I imagine tbey wil1 ha, we can fairly suggest to some one in authority that tbe existing regulations should ha changed. 1 assume

216

SENATE

that the passage of this resolution would not
take a dime from any pension 110w being
paid. I do think that to allow a maximum
pension of $5,000 a year is to deal fairly and
squarely with ail concerned, the high and the
low. My proposai may flot be in accord with
the Biblical text which says that to him that
bath shall be given, and that from him that
hath not shall be taken away even that which
he hath; but my hope is that the Senate will
indicate to the Government its belief that
$5.000 a year under existing conditions is a
sufficient and ample pension for any retired
employee of cither the Canadian National
Railways or the Government of Canada.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANiS:
May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question?
I-on. Mr. MITRDOCK:

Ves.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
1 arn anxious to
know whether the motion is confined to, the
railwaymen.
Would it apply, for instance,
to judges and other officials of the Government?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: As it is worded it
probably would be held to apýply to sîl, and
to that extent it might be quite proper to
revise it. I neyer did draw anytbing right
the first time. Lt is subject te, revisian when
you get my thouglit.
Hon. Mr. LYNýCU-STAUNTON:
The
bonourable gentleman bas not given us anything definite .Are there any persons in the
Canadian National who are receiving sucb
pensions as be implies?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes. I think you
will find a few-a very few-receiving $10,000
a year.
Hon.
Mr.

LYNCH-STAUNTON:

Hon. Mr. MURDOýCK:
Yes. I know of

have amounted to more than $10,000 a year,
but was fixed at $10,000 i11 order that it

Hon. Mr. AIURDOCK.

might nlot appear to be overloading. The
implication was that the amount was less
than be was actually entitled t.o receive.
This resolution would not apply ta very many
persans, but it would be a gesture from t.his
Senate that would commend itself to the
views of the rank and file ni the people.
Hon, W. A. GRIESBACH:
Honourable
members, aIl I know about railway pensions
is largely what we were told at the meeting
of the Railway Committee tbis morning by
a representative of the Canadian National
Railways, wbo said that pensions are paid
ta employeca under an Act of Parliament and
regulations based therean, and that there is
no favouritism or irregularitv practised under
the law and regulations. Lt sceins to mie that
the bonourable gentleman from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock)
might better have
moved against the Act itself, in order that
there might be an inquiry as ta how pensions
are paid, what they amount ta, and so on.
I 'am, however, more particularly interested
in pensions paid ta empinyses of the Government of Canada, and it seerns ta me that this
is a favourable opportunity ta place on
Hansard some information as to the pension
systcm. The Act that deals with Civil Service pensions is Chapter 24 of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, and the nîethod of arriving at the amount to be paid in any case
is stated in section 6:
Exeept as hereinafýter o-therwise provided the
superannuation a]lowance rnentioned in the next
preceding section shahl be one-fiftieoth of the
average qalary received by the contributor duriug the last ten years of bis service rnultiplied
by the numiber of years af býis service, not
liever, exceeding thirty-five years.
Clause 16 af the reg-ulations which have
been passed under and by virtue of the Act
reads:
Until sueli time as it may be found practicable ta co-mplate an actuarial valuation under
the Act, "The Contribution by the Goverament"
t,, bcecredited ta, the Accaunt from timne ta time

Balance at the credit of Fund Jan. 31, 1933 ...
Number of contributors ai et March 31, 1932 ....
......
..
The coantributions by conitributors under the
"Pat Service" plan, q2,495,520.38, represent
payments that have been made to bring
applicants within the operation of the Act.
It would be wcill to mention at the moment
that the actual amount to, be contri*buted by
the Government is dependent upon an
artuarial valuation which is flot yet completed. It is to be undertaken, and involves
examinting those 26,005 persons and arriving
at an estimate of their life values, and when
that is ascertained the contribution of the
Governuient
should, in
accordance with
clause 16 of the regulations, equai the contribubions of the contributors. There is an
enormous sum of moniey standing to the
credit of this fund, whicb fund is based upon
an Act of Parliament and regulations pasaeed
thereunder.
I submit this general proposition for the
consideration of the House, that if a man
chooses the Civil Service of this country for
lis career he has a right to, examine the Acts
of Parliamwent under which lie is to labour,
and to rely upon those Acts for his remuneration whi]e in the Service, ais well as for his
classification and promotion from time to
time, and he lias also the right to believe
that Parliamient and the Governm.ent witl
keep fatith with hlm in the motter of those
Acts, and that if lie serves well and retires
at the age of sixty-five, after a certain number
of years' service, lie will draw fromn the fund,
to which lie has contributed during the whole
of his service, a specified amoun-t that is
due to him. This Parliament lias no right,
by resolution, by Act, or otherwise, to interfere with the cuntract whicli exista b-etween
sucli person and the Government.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes.

The trend

of Civil Set-vice salaries liai, been upward,
and in the past thirty years, within my own
\eollection, salaries have increased by probably three times. Offices which carried a
salary of $1,000 three decades ago carry
sala.ries of $3,000 now. In recenit years salaries
of deputy ministers have been increased from
$6,000 to $8,000. and from $8,000 to $10,000.
It is quite on the cards that the salaries of
thesýe and ail other high offioers of the Government will be substantially increased in
vears to come.
What we are talking about is a 35-year
period. Any man who lias entered the Civil
Service iu the last few years comes under
thie Superannuation Act, and lie lias a contract. He is entitled to look forward to
tlie implemienting of that contraot ait the
end of his service, but tlie resolution in-troduced by my honourable friend, if passed,
wvould affect many such men. I say that we
ouglit not to pass this resolution. I submit
tliat to, endeavour to interfere with the terms
of the contract ernbodied in an Art of Parliament would be unworthy of any government and of this buse.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Possibly I
should apologize for inflicting myself on the
House at this time, but 1 do not care to give
a formal vote, which would necessarily be
against the resolution, without a few explanatory words. I have more sympathy with what
I think is in the mind of the lionourable
senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock)
than perhaps lie would give me credit for.
His resolution is not witliout some merit,
and possibly the most admirable feature of it
is the ease with whicli it could be improved.
As tlie resolution reads, it would really lie a
demand upon Parliament to fali away from
definite contracts of honour. We should be
called upon to repudiate solemn contracts

SENSATE

218

which we have made. Even if arnended as
suggested by the honourable member, the
resolution would stili invite repudiation, in
that it would affect those who have corne into
the service of Canada as judges, or porhaps
into the service of the railways as high officors,
anat who upon coining in had certain contractual rights. Stîcb persans would be
affected by being no longer entitled to look
to the country or ta thle railway for the
carrying out of its side of the obligation.
I arn not at ail ane xvho faveurs those
fantastie figures that toc often have been the
voguie by xvay of salary and of pension. A
great deal of nonsense, in rny judgrnent, xvas
taiked bcforo the Royal Commnission xvhose
report on raiiways is before a speciai committee of this House, about anc man bore and
another thore being worth twonty thousand,
and about Wellington iîaving said that Napokeon was as good as fory thousand rnen on the
field cf battie. If that, contention had any relevac at ail it would lead to the conclusion
that if in sornie speciai contingency one mnan's
brain and energy woro worth those cf forty
thousand others, thon hais saiary shuuld be
forty thiousand timos. as great. This would
miean that the salaî'y of the reaily first-class
execuitive of to-day would ho $10,000,000 a
year. One ba,,s only ta think, of this for a
rninute to sec that no siîchbhasis can ho consideî'ed. XX'bat gox d'os roînuneration or price
is lîux niocl tîju servxice or the inateriai can
cornimand in the market in competition with
otiier services or miateriais.
A notion grew up that a big- exceutive in a
raiiwav was aitogether different from any other
Oxecutive, and ta offer sucb a person anything
short of W10,000 a year xvas only the subjeet
of a sinile. A good, able rnan is required at
the hiead of a railway, but thic sane is truc
of anv business, and tlic level of the remuiineration to ho given rnust ho deterininod
after nieasuring tlic size of those who are in
sighit for the position and whiat bas to ho paid
for the services of tlic best one. 1 arn qiite
sure that in publie -zenv1ceýs, as in rnany other
quartors, fancy rernunerations have been given
without x ery close regard to the earning
powers of tho individuial rocipionts. Fixed
salaries have heon attached ta jobs, and
wlien the holders of those jobs retire they
receive pensions based upon their salaries.
Thus a wxholly unbaianced structure bas heen
ereated, and many people have heen paid
altogot ber out of proportion ta the rornunor*
atian cf the vast rnajority cf citizens. I hope
that, as a resuit of the experiences wo arc
n0W going through, sorne rnore carnron-sense
ruie wili ho applied ta salaries, professionai
rernuneratian and pensions.
flglit Hua. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Personaily I do not think that a $5,000
pension xviii be sufficient for the very valuabie
rnan, whiether hoe is in the raîlway service, on
the Bench or acting in any other eapacity that
dernands qualities cf the first arder. If a
supeî'annlîarion systern is going ta obtain at
ail, each pension must necossarily bear a
certain relation to the salary paid ta the
persan priaer ta bais retirement, and in same
instanes salaries wili have ta ho paid on sucb
ai hasis that $5,000 wouid nat ho a fair pensioan.

As the rnotion reads ccxv it wouid, I repeat,
compel us ta do an injustice ta mon xvitb
whcrn xxe have solernn contracts. That injustice would faii not cniy upon those wha are
now in receipt. cf pensions, but upon all athors
who hiave enbered inta a contract that entities tbern ta a pension in tirne ta corne.
Consequently, I se no alternative but ta
vote ag-ainst the motion.

FBBRUARY 7, 1933
flot have appeared large be'tween 19M and
1929. 1 sympathize with ail those who feel
that our pension lists contain some rather
large figures. But 1 would point out to my
honourable friend that it is hardly just to ask
the Senate to, make a lea.p in the dark-to
give such an expression of opinion a.s he desires in the fa-ce of the situation that exists by
virtu-e of the law and of existing contracts.
We do flot know exactly even what persons
would be covered by this resolution. Does it
cover ail those who are drawing pensions
under various Acts of Parliament? I arn not
ready to say now whether it does or not. I
would suggest that ins-tead of asking the
,Senate to vote my honourable friend withdraw bis motion and consider the subjeetmatter anew, and if he feels there is a
certain fleld whcrein bis action would be
.iustifled, he could present another motion to
effect his purpose.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable members on the other side and my honourable
friend on this side (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
have talked a good deal about law and contracts in connection with pensions. Unless
the information 1 bave secured is very much
in error, distinguished gentlemen have been
retired fromn tbe service of the Canadian
National Railways wbo to-day complain that
they did not get ail that thcy are entitled to
under a strict and literai interpretation of the
pension regulations. I arn told the Pension
Board in charge of these matters decided in
one case that $10,000 was about as far as they
should go, and in another case that $8,800 was
about the maximum; but I arn told also that
a strict interpretation of the pension regulations would have resulted in the board
awarding pensions in excess of these figures.
Now, I have not the slightcst intention of
witbdrawing this motion. I arn for economy;
I arn for doing something consistent with
what we are professing. I want to find out
wbcthcr we mean what we are talking about,
or whether it is-pardon the expression-just
camouflage. I tbink, in view of the great
distress now prevalent from one end of the
Dominion to the other, that $5,000 is just
as logical a maximum pension for certain
pensioners as the 810,000 and the 88,800 pensions fixed by the board under the regulations.
I submit that it is a sufficient maximum
under the emergency conditions whicb now
prevail. If there is any return to prosperity
wc might reconsider that maximum.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:
Wiil the
bonourable gentleman permit a question? If
I understood him rightly, hie said hie wouid
not have bis resolution apply to any pension

219

now being paid. That is to say, bie would
not interfere with a pension of, say, 87,500
now being paid to a judge. Is that correct?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I frankiy admit
that I regard the pensions of judges in a
different light.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Wby so? I
cannot see any difference.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Maybe I arn in
error in regarding their pensions in a different
ligbt. But I realize that many eminent legal
men have given up a lucrative practice to go on
the Bencb and mete out justice to the people
of Canada. We ail know some legai gentlemen who, having been appointed to the
Bench, found that the remuneration was not
sufficient to warrant their continuing as
judges, and who have gone back into private
practice. I realize that Canada should pay
members of the legal profession substantial
salaries to induce thern to sit on the Bencb,
and adequate pensions on their retirernent.
I had not given thougbt to judges, or to
returned men, of course.
An lion. SENATOR: Wbat about the
militarv?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I h-ad not a single
member of the military forces in mind. But
I bad in mind certain former government
employecs, certain former Canadian National
officiais. NÇone of the "special int-erests" that
I arn looking after, you know, are covered by
this resolution at ail; none of those men get
a pension of anytbing like $5,000 a year.
This motion is sirnply on expression of
opinion. It does noýt mean the slightest
change in the existing penoion regulations
unless the Govemnient is willing to, accept
the opinion herein expressed and revise the
pension reguilations accordingly.
I hope
honourable members will indicate thýeir views
for or against the motion, for I should like
to know wbe'ther we arc really in favour of
effeoting the economies that the people expeet at our hands.
H-on. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I may be
out of orderHo,n. Mr. MURDOCK: I tbougbt I had
closed the debate.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I may be
out of order, but I should like an explanatmion.
As I understand the trend of the debate,
there ie a certain pension fund, and there
arc regulations attacbed ta the administration
of that fund, under whi.ch regulations contributors to the fund are entitled ta receive
certain retiring allowanccs after thley have

SENATE

220

served a certain period of time with the
railway company. It seems to me from what
I hear that notwithstanding those regulations
the administrators of the fund have an
absolute discretion to increase the amount
which the pensioners would otherwise receive.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Decrease.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Increase,
I said. If this resolution goes no further than
to say that in the opinion of the Senate the
commissioners should net have the power to
increase the allowance to which a penLsioner
would be entitled, it seems to me its purpose
is salutary, for I think that a pension of
$5.000 a year is, as we say, rather a soft thing.
But if a man las been making a large contribution, and his contract provides that he
should receiv e every copper to which lie is
entitled, the position is entirely different. If
I understand the honourable gentleman's
motion, it does not apply to a case of that
kind; it is simply an intimation to the board
that it should not give to any pensioner a
gratuity-for it is nothing else-so as to place
his pension at a figure in excess of $5,000 a
year.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable members,
I am not rising to speak to the motion, but
I really think the honourable gentleman
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) should accept the suggestion made by the leader on that side of
the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand). In reality
the honourable gentleman is asking us to
make a leap in the dark. We do not know
who is going to be affected by this motion.
He himself admits that Le never had judges
in mind. He is asking us to express a
definite opinion of what should Le done,
and wc do not know what we are doing.
I would suggest to him tLat Le let the matter
rest until we have had at least time to see
where we are going to stand. In its present
form, I must vote against the motion.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I do not suggest
that anybody should jump in the dark. I
realize that even if we pass this pious resolution-for that is all it amounts to, as
every honourable gentleman knows-it is only
an expression of opinion after all.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If the motion
does not express the opinion of an honourable member under the circumstances, do you
want him to vote that it is his opinion?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: By no means; let
him vote the other way, of course. But I
say if the resolution were passed in its present
form it would be only an expression of
opinion, and then surely it would be up to the
Hon. Mr.

LYNCH-STAUNTON.

Government of the day to change any of the
pension regulations that might be in conflict
with the resolution.
Hon. Mr. CALDIER: May I say just one
word more? This is not merely a pious resolution; it is a very definite pious resolution.
It asks that no person who is in the service
of the Canadian National Railways shall
hereafter get a pension in excess of $5,000.
An Hon. SENATOR: Or in the service of
the -Government.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: And the same thing
applies to those in the Governnent service.
That is, we are asked to say baldly that in
the opinion of the majority of this House
no man who is receiving a pension from the
Federal Government should hereafter receive
a pension of more than $5,000. I say we are
leaping in the dark if we vote in favour of
this motion. Are we going to vote in favour
of this motion without knowing who are
affected, what branch of the service they
belong to, what pensions they are getting at
the present time, and all that sort of thing?
himself bas
gentleman
The honourable
admitted that Le never thought of judges'
pensions. We have six Supreme Court judges
sitting here in Ottawa, all of whom have a
contract with the Government entitling them
to pensions, and, whether the honourable
gentleman likes it or not, his proposed resolution affects their pensions. If one of those
judges retired to-morrow Le would not get
anything in excess of $5,000, should this resolution pass and be implemented by the Government. So I say we are leaping in the
dark, and I think that unless this motion i8
put into such shape that we know what we
are doing. we should not be called upon to
vote on it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My honourable
friend knows full well that not one of those
judges nor anybody else would be affected
one iota unless the law were changed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But the
honourable member asks us to vote that the
law Le changed, when we know that if it were
changed in accordance with the resolution the
grossest kind of injustice and breach of contract would result.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I cannot see it in
that light. All I am suggesting is an expression of the opinion that while the present
emergency railway conditions continue $5,000
should be the maximum pension paid to any
railway officials.
The motion was negatived.

The Senate resumed from. yesterday the

six hours should constitute one foul day's work
for labourers, in ýthe manufacture and in the

bired common day labourers;
Furthermore, that more effective encouragement should be given to the return to the land.
Hon. GUSTAVE LACASSE: Honourabie
members, again 1 desire ta congratulate our
dear nid friend fromn Acadie (Hon. Mr.
Poirier) on the very interesting speech he
deiivered two days ago. One may not agree
fuiiy with ail hie said, particuiariy as regards
the general sbortening of working hours, but
anyone readiiy appreciates the wealth of information, the patience of effort and the
amount of observation whîch stand behind
that splendid contribution.
Furthermore,
those who belong to the younger group in
this House cannot heip marvelling at the
vitaiity-perennial youth, should I say?-of
the oldest minds in this Chamber, and he
edified by the enthusiasm. which they show,
at the sunset of their very useful lives, in the
study of the great problems of the day.

221

I wisb my honourabie friend had worded
lis motion a littie dîifferentiy: it might have
avoided the objections whioh have been raised
aiready as to whether it is in order or flot.
0f course we are here ta, legislate, but let me
point out to my honourable, friends from
Parkdaie (Hon. Mr. Murdock) and Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans) that ample is the
number of precedients which justify our venerable friend fromn Acadie in presenting his case
in the way hie did. Weil do we remember the
eioquent pleas wbich our dear aid coilicague
the late, Sir George Foster used ta mýake bere
every year in favaur of the League of
Nations; and at the beginning of this very
session, iast fali, did nat the h-onourable senator from Rockcliffe (Hon. Mrs. Wilson) present a motion on "the social and bumanitarian
work of the League of Nations"? Have such
debates ever ied ta actual iegisiatian? Not
that I know of. Stili they gave somne of us
the opportun.ity of putting before the public
some very iiiuminating facts. 0f course, we
are here ta iegisiate, but we are here aiso ta
study in the most unbiased and dispassionate
spirit eny problim of interest ta the people
of Canada.
The motion before us is twofoid: first, it
suggests the shortening of working hours;
secondiy, it recommends a mare systematic
concentration of effort in the so-cailed backto-the-iand movement.
As ta the first part of bis motion, I shall
foiiow my honourabie friend with great
caution, altbough I accept the generai principie of it. I reckon that a shorter working
day cannot be applied without great difficuity.
I am giad my honourabie friend makes it
fairiy clear that his proposed regulations are
intended mostiy, if not soieiy, for shop
workers and artisans. As we ail know, there
are certain groups of trades and certain professions whose working hours cannot be reguiated. In that ciass are artists, inteilectuai
workers, farmers, doctors, and aiso those, for
instance, whose caiiing is travelling, for nio
train, no seropiane, no ocean liner can be
stopped because and when the six-hour limit
bas been reached. My bonourabie friend wiii
say that even here double shif ta couid be put
on duty; but that would neyer do with respect
ta certain classes of men whose work caiis for
personai init-iative and individual skiil-ike
scientists, composers, inventors end writers.
Such reguistions couid theref are be appiied
onIy ta men working -in shops day by day.
There is aiso the objection raised by my
bonourabie friend f romn Parkdaie, that the
shortening of working hours wouid flot soive
the prohiem of unempinyment if dissociated
fromn the problim of fair wages. I am confident, though, that shouid a commission-

SENATE

222

oh! pardon me for suggesting one more commission-go into the matter thoroughly, a
commission composed of employers and employees, under the chairmanship of an independent man, very gratifying results could
b obtained for ail concerned. As I have
already hinted, this question is primarily and
almost exclusively an industrial problem, and
must not be too generalized.
There are two particular features in favour
of this proposed shortening of working hours
which, as a physician, I wish to mention here.
Under such a new regulation, in the first
place, 'the working man would have sufficient
time for his meal at noon, instead of being
obliged to swallow it hastily in a few minutes,
and beconing eventually the victim of
stomach disturbances, sometimes serionus.
Secondly, it would do away with the working
of unjustified overtime, which plays such
deadly havoc amongst the industrial workers,
who, in this case, are rightly called the slaves
of industry.
It is clear to everybody that the main object
of shortening working hours is to divide the
work amongst as many people as possible, in
order to give a chance to everybody and
consequently solve the problem of unemployment. That is why I believe it is a step in
the right direction. I intend, therefore, with
the minor reservation nentioned a moment
ago, to vote in favour of the motion.
Let us hope, honourable senators, that ail
these efforts, all these suggestions, will contribute to bring back prosperity to our
beloved land, for blessed will be the day
when we shall hear again the rhythmic bark
of the busy hammer and the joyful song of
the saw; blessed will be the day when from
near-by shops and factories shall ring out the
call of industry inviting her sons back to work;
blessed will be the day when from massive
chimneys, so long idle, shall gush forth the
graceful spirals of black smoke writing in the
clear atmosphre of a blue sky the huge letters
that spell prospcrity; blessed will be the day
when the traditional loaf of bread upon the
table of the humble but honest and most deserving workingnan shall have been honourably carned and cheerfully paid for; blessed
will be the day when the sunshine of happiness and contentment shall again cast the rays
of its new hope and the warmth of its revived enthusiasm into aIl our Canadian
homes!
I anticipate, honourable gentlemen, that
by the time such a splendid and glorious day
dawns upon us ail our large industrial centers
and mo-t of our factory towns will have lost
a good twenty;five per cent of their popuAnd whither will ail those people
lation.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE.

have gone? Precisely to the place they
should never have left in the beginning.
They will be, let us hope, back on the farm,
where they can do the greatest good for
Canada, which is primarily an agricultural
country.
I thank my venerable friend for having revived this year the question whieh I had the
privilege of introducing before this Chamber
last session. I am pleased to observe that he
shares my views on that score one hundred
per cent.
I appreciate aiso the sympathetic reception
with which the right honourable leader of this
House favoured my humble effort last year,
when I spoke on the back-to-the-land movement. His promises were most encouraging.
Now let us sec what bas been donc since.
There is no doubt that the idea gradually
spread and gained ground. Some governments
have adopted and developed very intelligent
schemes along that line, but I am sorry that
my own province is not leading in that field
of progress. To the old Province of Quebec
goes the palm of bonour; Ontario is trailing
behind. It might be interesting to honourable gentlemen to hear that in the Province
of Quebec, in the course of the last two years,
8600,000 has been distributed among new
settlers in the forrm of premiums-primes aux
colons; that nearly $2,000,000 bas been spent
on the building or improvement of the roads
in the far-flung northern area, and that over
9.000 families have been taken out of financially overburdened cities and established on
new land, to become gradually self-supporting.
The establishment of 6,500 families, the
building of roads and bridges and a little
draining of the land have cost less than
S2,500,000. Dividing by those 6,500 families,
it will be found that the average cost to the
State for the establishment of one family is
$385.
My authority for that statement is the Hon.
Hector Laferté, Minister of Colonization in
the Province of Quebec, who gave those
interesting figures a few months ago.
And during that time what bas Ontario
donc? I forwarded last night to the Deputy
Minister of Lands and Forests, at Toronto,
in order to obtain fresh and up-to-date information, the following message:
As I intend to speak to-morrow on the backto-the-land movement, nay I ask you to be so
kind as to tell nie the number of families and
of single men established on Northern lands

the last twelve months.
And here is the reply I received about an
hour ago:

FEBRUMWY 8, 1933
Settled last calendar year two hundred tan
niarried heads families,
resnt*n one thonsand and ei ghty-five soul under reliief plan.
Expended thereon fifty-three thousand one
hundjred and forty-five dollars, two-thirds of
which (less administrajtion costs) borne equally
by municipalities e.nd Domninion.
This is exclusive of one thoueand six hundred
and for.ty-eight sales and free grant locations
carried out during fiscal year ending Ootober
last under ordinary unsubsidized practices.
W. C. Ca.in,
Deputy Minister.
1 do not wish ta make a deliberate attack
on the Government of any province, but I
will say that most provinces to-day do not
seem ta take enough advantage of the inducements offered by the FederaI Government in
this matter. We nîl know that $600 is the
cost est.imated for the establishment of ana
family of new settlars; we know also that
that axpense, according ta the plan agraed
upon, is ta be borne by the two Governmant-s
and the interested municipality in aqual
proportions. I do wish ta submit herm that,
in the case of a town or a city which cannot
ineet its financial obligations and is on the
verge of bankruptcy, the two Govarn'ments,
Federal and Provincial, shauld devise soane
special scheme whereay the municipality
would be relieved of its share of tha cast.
Before concluding, honourable senatars, let
me apologize for havinýg spoken s0 long, and
thank you for your most patient attention.
May I venture ta express the hope that the
facts I have submitted ta you have been of
some in'terest and that my humble contribution to this important debate has nat been
altogethar useless.
In spita of these most trying timas and
distressing conditions, 1 keap my faith in
Canada, in this great country which links twa
hemispheres, whose picturesqua shores are
bathed by three oceans, and whose beautiful
head is crowned with the shining glanaes of
the North. I kaep my faith in Canada hacause of the loyal devotion and industrious
courage of hier proud sons and faithful
daughters, tillers of land and toilers of industry, who ivill aven live in harmony and
work for the full recuperation and constant
advance of our dean aid fatharland.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourabla members, I ýpresume the mover of the motion
(Hon. Mn. Poirier) wvill make same additional
remarks befora the debate is concluded,' and
I want ta bring a few mattars ta lis attention. In th e first place, I think there is a
slight fault in the wording of the nesolution,
which is:
That in tha opinion of this House. six hours
should constitute ana full day's work for
labourens, in the manufacture and in the
mine...

223

I think it would be battar ta substitute
"factory" for "manufacture."
As the rasaution is worded now, the meaning is difficult
ta follow.
Tha honounable gentleman said in the
course of his raniarks that the raduction of
the working day ta six hours would salve all
aur difficulties. Now, I would ask him. if hie
ineludes farmens in the terni "labaurers." Ha
said:
For the serf and the villain-oun forefathens,
honounable gentlemen, wene villains--the working hours were from eunrisa to sunse. Women
and chjîdren were not excepted.
Well, about haîf the wonld's population, I
think, work on the land and thýeir working
hours to-day are fram sunrise ta sunset, and
aven longer; and waman and children are
not excepted.
The farmer would be quite
pleased if hie could make a living by working those hours, but hie cannot do it undar
presenit conditions. Would the situation be
improved by putting more people on the
land? T-hat is a very big question. Agriculture is hardeýr hit than any other class of
business; the farmen flnds it more difficult
ta make a living than any other man who
is at work. It would seem ta me that the
placing of mare people on the land would
aggravate the trouble.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS:
awn living.

They would earn thair

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: They would ta soma
extent. The honourable moyen of the rasolution says that his suggestion would cure all
aur troubles.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: Would the honounable gentleman allaw me ta intarrupt him?
Farmers are not included in the motion.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: That is the trouble.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: Non are fishermen non
railro-ad mon. I specifled the classes ta which
my resolution applies. I perfectly well understand that farmers cannot be inýcluded.
Hýon. Mr. HUGHES: That, I think, is just
the trouble with the honourable gentleman's
proposai. At ieast hailf of thie wonl1d's population would nemain serfs and villains. The
honourable gentleman also said:
Several solutions have been propounded. The
only one which, to, my mimd, can ba effected is
the shortening af working houns. It alone can
go doivn to the noots of the cancer and eradicate
it.
If that simple mnethod will eradicate the
troubles of the world, 1 would suggest very
humbly and respectfully ta the mover and
the seconder of thet resolution that they place
thieir viewvs before the League of Nýations, for
ive in Canada could not give effeat to the

224

proposai. The matter is flot within the jurisdiction of the Federal Government, and if
the provinces were to legisiate for a six-hour
day wbere sboiild we find ourselvce? The
matter has to, be settled by the whole world,
or not at ail. We could not compete with
other nations in the manufacture of coinmodities; if we sberte-ned our day and they
did flot do likewise. That appears to me
te, make the suggestion impracticable.
Towards the close of his remarks my honcurable friend made Ibis statement, wbich
1 wish bc wvould explain before tihe debate
is concluded.
The tille-r of the land who, during past ages,
the world over, bas been subjected te most
unmeroiful toil. is, aeeording to ail appearances,
about te, corne int bis own.
That, 1 suppose, means that nccording te ail
appearances tbe farmiers are about to becerne more prosperous. Wcll, it allvnys has
been said that the prosperity of the wliole
cornmunity depoinds iupen the condition of
agriculture. If the bonourable mover of the
reselution can reveal to us tbe signs, and
assure us that wbat hie bas prephesied is
about te corne te, pass, bie wili do more than
anyone else lias donc for many years towards
bringing hiope and encouragement back into
the world.
lonourable
lion. G. D. iROBERTSON:
members, it is my purpose, not te miake n
speech, but simply te say a few words teucbing the subject before us. Until tbe bonourable miember frorn Essex (Hon. Mr. Lacasse)
rose 10 speak, baif an heur ago, I was net
aware that Ibis malter would corne before
the lieuse tbis afterneon, and I wvas Dot
present when the heonourable inember frorn
Acadie (Hon. Mr. Poirier) introduced tise
resolution. With respect te the question of
legisiatien looking te tbe adoption of a sixheur day in Canada, I may draw the attention ef tihe lieuse te the fact that the first
International Labour Conference, beld in
Wa.shingten, D.C., in November, 1919, at
wbich I was present, went on record in favour
of an eight-bour day. Many of our provinces
were reprcsented at that conference, and all
aine of them wxere notified of the decision
arrived aI. Notwithstanding that fact, ne
govcramnent in Canada since that lime bas
atteml)tcd te, ndopt ex on eigbt-hour legislation, except with reference te, the publie
serv ice, wherein some progress in that direction bias bcen made.
When I n'as in Geneva lasI April there
was discussed a proposai for the establishment of a working day on the six-heur basis.
Thiere inay be a few countries thal have sixheur-day legisiation, although I cannet narne
lien. Mr. HUGHES.

any. As Canada bias failed 10 adopt legisiatien for an cigbt-hour day in industry, as
recommended some thirteen years ago, in my
humble opinion it would be eut of the questionf now le expeet tbat a proposai for tbe sixheur day would be acted upon. For a good
many years I bave bad something te do with
improvement of working conditions, both as
te heurs and compensation, particuiarly as
affecting railway empioyees, and in a lesser
degree labour generally; and wbile I appreciaIe and sympathize with the ideal that is
behind the resolution, I couid net support

PRISON DISCIPLINE
MOTION

Hon. JOHN LEWIS rose in accordance with
the f ollowing notice:
That hie will eall the attention of the Governmient to the report of Superintendent D. M.
Ormionti on the outbreak in Portsmouth
Peniitentiary, andi will inove thiat in the opinion
of the Sernate full publici.ty shoult be giý en to
pyrison dIiscipline, andi the jini of discipline
~hould hae reform as well as punishment.
11e said: Honourable gentlemen, although
in the motion I have referred ta Superintendent Ormond's report on the outbreak in
Portsmouth Pcnitentiary, it is flot my intention to give any time to summarizing,
mucb lcss to criticizing, its contents. Ho, very
naturally, dwelt mainly upon the necessity
of adequate protection against mutiny and
violence on the part of prisoners, a matter,
no doubt, of great importance, but with regard to which I should nat care to enter
into compctition with a military man. Mv
subjeet particularly is that cf prison discipline
Iliglit Ilon. '.\r. MEIGIIEN.

Ieading ta reform, and at the out.set I should
like to disahuse certain people of a nation
that the objeet of prison reformers; i.s ta give
the prisoners a good time, amuse them, please
them, and, as one bonourable gentleman said,
transfpr thern ta the Royal York Hotel. The
objeet of prison reformers is not ta please,
amuse or humour prisoners, but to give them
healthful occupation for body nnd mind.
I take up flrst the question of physical
exorcise. There is no doubt that the best
envirooment for a prisoner is a farm, for that
providos hcalthful exorcise in the open air,
as well as training in a useful employment.
Where that is not available a certain amount
of physical exorcise in the forma of games is
necessary, and there again I would remind
you that my abject is not amusement, but
healthful occupation that will send the prisoner
ta his oeil healthily tired. After that, between
the time of physical exercise and sleep, there
are hound ta a bo a certain number of idle
bours, and I think that occupation for tbe
mind is as necessary during tbat period as
bodily exorcise i.s in the dny-time.
The notion that solitary confinement is a
salutary discipline for prisoners is very far
fromn the truth. The notion has its basis,
I suppose, in the heýlioef that the prisoner
will spend his timae tbinking of bis past sins
and rosolving on amondment. The chances
are that tbat is the 'vcry thing which hoe wili1
not do. He will prohably spend bis time
thinking over his grievances, or alleged grievancos. and planning for revongo upon society.
Therofore I think that it is of the utmost
importancec that hoe sbould have the fullest
occupation for bis mind, that ho should be
not oniy allowed, but encouraged. ta read,
even Iiough his reading b-e flot always of a
serjous character. There should be a variety
of mental occupation. For instance, nt times
dramnatie entertainment or concerts could be
put on for the prisoners. I repýeat that the
abject I have in view is not to amuse
prisoners, 1)ut to keep their minds out of
mischief. Satan finds some misebief stild, as
well for itile mindis as for idie hantis ta do.
Coming ta the question of punishinent, I
notice in this repart one or two casual referonces ta the use of the paddle. But there is.
no information as ta wbat the paddle is, and
therefore I amn obliged ta fall back upon unofficiaI information as contained in an article
writtcn hy an ex-convict, published in the
Sydney. -Nova Scotia, Record and repuhlished
,n the Brovkville Recorder and Tintes, from
wbich I tako my copy.

FEBRUARY 14, 1933
Hion. Mr. LEWIS: The writer says:
The application of the paddle le a modified
form of whipping. It le supposed to be les
cruel than the lash, but I and the other
prisonere who have had a taste of it kn<yw thal
it je a lot worge.
I bave no doubt that there are honourable
gentlemen here who ca.n bear the suifferings
of prisoners with very great fortitude. The
writer goes on:
Before we go any further, let me deecribe
thie paddle. It consiste of *a broad strip of
leather about a foot and a haîf long, with a
handie about a foot in iength, which je used to
graep the paddle.
To get lashed with this instrument would be
bad enough, but this ie noV ahl. The leather
section of the paddle, which is the part that
comes in contact with the boýdy, ie dotted with
boles as big as a dime. When the paddle bite
the body the fleehi is pushed up through these
holes and when it le drawn away-well, you can
imagine the rest.
The Brockvilýle Recorder and Times comnments upon this:
If the f acte are as repreeen'ted, hie will find
a great many to agree with him. No one
believes, that those imprisoned in our penitentiaries sbouid be eoddled, eeecially when they
have cornmitted a breach of disciplinebut there
muet be elightly more humane ways of unflicting
punishment than those whieh have been indicated and wbich cannot fail to produce feelings
of vengeance on the part of the sufferer.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Will the bonourable gentleman permit a question? fIas lie
taken the trouble to satisfy himself that tbe
obs4evationsg put f orward by the ex-convict
are true?
Ho>n. Mr. LEWIS: I have tried, but the
Govenrnment steadily refuses to give any information on the point. Therefore I am
obliged to rely upon tbis etatement, not agrceing with it, but waiting until I get some
official information.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: Why does the
honourable gentleman give this out when lie
bas not absolute facte about these thinge?
Why does hie noV wait until lie gets the facts
first?
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: I miglit bave to wait
a couple of years, and I want to speak now.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL:

Well, why not

May I reRiglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

institutions, and to witne-ss for himself what
is going on. fias lie ever availed himself of
that?

Hon. Mr. LEWIS: I have not, and I doubt
whether many of us have done so.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL:

Hearsay

evi-

One of the points
Hon. Mr. LEWIS:
which I shall make later on is that so few
of us take an interest in what goes on in the
prisons, and to that omnission I amx going to
plead guilty myseif.
The editorial comment concludes:
There seems to be some reluctance on the
part of the Government to reveal the resuit
of investigations that have been under way in
other Canadian penitentiaries where disturhances have recently taken place. Persistence
in following such a policy will scarcely prove
effective in allaying the feeling so widely
prevalent that things are wrong in the Canadian
penitentiary system, a etate of affairs tacitly
admitted by various reforme w'hich the Minister
of Justice bas recent]y authorized.
That editorial lias been copied into various
Ontario papers and given wide circulation.
Always it bas elicited the comment which I
myseif would make, that we do flot absolutely
rely upon these statements, but they are the
only statiements we are able to obtain.
Now I corne to the general subject of
A judge frequently

sentences a prisoner to so many strokes of
the l.ash; but the sentence f ollows after a fair
trial, and this physical punishmcnt is resorted
to only where the prisoner bas been convicted
of very vile or violent oiffnces. This is a very
wise provision, because if such punieliment
were inflicted indiscriminatcly its moral value
would be entirely lost. I have no knowledge
that similar safeguards surround the administration of punishment for infractions of
prison discipline. Within the prison everytbing
is done secretly, and it is not unlikely that the
conviet who gets into trouble is neither vile nor
violent, but disobedient. While of course his
disobedience cannot bie overlooked by the
prison officiais, it may quite likely happen that
sueli a prisoner serving a terni for a comparatively trifling offence may in this way receive
in the aggregate mueh more severe punishment
than a conviet serving a termi for a criminal
assault on a child, but cunning enough to curry
favour with the guards. In my opinion
corporal punishment for infractions of prison
discipline should be surrounded with safeguards in the interest alike of the prisoners
and of the prison officiaIs. I have noticed a
newspaper announcement that in future a
prisoner ie not to be subjected to such punishment by a guard except with the approval of
the warden and of the Inspector of Prisons.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBAGH: If I may interrupt
tbe bonourable gentleman, would hie kindly

-tiary, and "prison" wlien lie mieans prison?
It is a matter of some importance, as there
are prisons and penitentiaries; the offences for
which men are committcd to penitentiaries are
different fromn those for which they are eominitted to prison; the internai disipline in
the two kinds of penal institutions is also
different. 1 arn sure the honourable gentleman would not wish to confuse the issue by
using inaccurate ternis.
I have been using
Hon. Mr. LEWIS:
"prison" and "ponitentiary" indiscriminately,
but if penitontiary is the word, I will try to
use it excltisivoly.
While I approve of the restriction that no
penitentiary guard may infliet punisbiment
without the consent of the warden and the
Inspecter of Prisons. 1 should be in favour of
an indeperîdent enquiry by a county judge, or
some such official, into breaches of penitentiary discipline, for suoli an investigator would
b)0 entirely independent of the institution.
We ail know that with the very best intentions the warden would he led by lovalty to
his staff to support the geard. and the inspeetor, animated by a similar loyalty, would in
turn support the wardon.
As te the qualifications of the penitentiary
guard, I recegnize that hie occupies a very
important place in the institution in mainHe cornes into contact
taining discipline.
with the prisoners more often than does the
warden, and it is net nccssary te consider
hima a monster of cruolty in order to suppose
that hoe may get into sucIî a quarrel with a
prisoner as may result in the infliction of
punishmcnt far beyond the prisener's deserts.
That simply means that the guard is an
ordinary man, net particularly interested in
prison wolfare, and regarding his job-quite
honestly-as merely a means of livelihood.
He may be a man of short temiper and
perhaps a littie tee mindful of biis own
dignity. While of course I recognize that hoe
must be a man of sufficiently powerful
physique te cope with a rebellious I)risonei,
I submit that hoe should ho a man zealous for
the welfare of those under bis charge. That
may sound rather idealistie, but w-e knowv
that teachers, preachers, members of the
Salvation Army and missionariýes in the West
devote themnselves whole-heartedly te their
work, entirely regardless of remuneration. I
hav e hecard some very touching steries of
our missionarios in the West who bave cheerfully sbared the troubles and bardships of the
settlers in their enthusiasm for social welfare
work. I think it would ho possible to find

more frequently than they do. By publicity
I imply, net that the public should ho constant1y finding fault with the administration
of our ponal institutions, but rather that there
should ho co-eperation by the warden and the
inspecter xith the public. The public should
be encouraged to take an interest in our
prisons and visit them.
Finally, I desire te contradict the notion
that authority is likely te ho unde.rmined by
%vhiat migbt ho regarded as the intermeddling
of the public with the administration cf our
penitentiaries. The recent outbreaks in these
institutions have taken place net as a result
of public interferen(e, but during a period
of public negleet through lack of interest.
The inmate of a penitentiary is net at alI
likely te ho incited te mutiny by the sympathy cf those outside; rather hoe is likely te
become mutineus from a sense that hie is
abandoned, that nohody takes any further
interest in him, that society regards Iiim as
a troublesome fellow whom it is glad te got

thousand is in the habit of visiting our ponitentiaries and interestinýg himself in the welfare cf the inmates; and, as I say, 1 freely
admit that in this respect I have been deliiiquent. In fact, there are few of us who have
net earnod he rebuke of the Friend of
publicans and sinners: "I was in prison and
vo visited Me net." It is in the hope of changing the, attitude of mind of the public as wed
as cf the authorities towards the inmates cf

Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honourable
gentlemen, I had occasion to visit the prison
at Bordeaux this winter, and when I saw the
rooms and the beds there I thought the
accommodation was much too good. I have
also visited the St. Vincent de Paul Penitentiary. Although I cannot put my finger
on the law which states that it is the duty of
senators to visit peniýtentiaries, I understood
there was such a law, and on many occasions
I have done so. It seems to me that the
feeling that a prison or a penitentiary should
be made a summer resort or something of that
kind should not prevail. I think imprisonment should have a deterrent effect upon
possible offenders, and they would be more
impressed if they thought that in the penitentiary they would be worse off than they
are at home. As a matter of fact there are,
I suppose, many people who would not be as
well off at home as in the Bordeaux jail, where
there are nice beds, running water in the rooms,
and many other conveniences. I was amazed
t.o see how comfortable the prisoners were.
My chauffeur was with me on the occasion of
my visit, and I said to him: "You had better
pick out your room. You would be better
off here than at home." I do not see why
we should make our prisons places to which
our people might desire to go.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I should like to
ask three questions of the honourable gentleman who introduced this subject. In the
first place, has he read the Penitentiaries Act?
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: No, I have not.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Has he read the
regulations compiled by virtue of that Act,
and approved by the various Ministers of
Justice?
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: No.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: And he has already told us that he has not visited any
penitentiaries?
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: Yes.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBAOH: A fourth question would be: Does the honourable gentleman not think that he is undertaking a good
deal in putting upon Hansard a discussion
upon penitentiary discipline and penitentiary
methods without having first acquainted himself with the most essential matters?
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: No; because my sole
object is to obtain information. I am in the
same position as the general public with regard to this question. They have become
very thoroughly seized of the idea that there

229

are abuses in penitentiaries and that a policy
of secrecy is being maintained. If I had
waited till I could do what the honourable
gentleman suggests, I should not have spokeii
at ail.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I had not intended to say
anything on this resolution to-night, but I
find it difficult indeed to retain my seat and
permit the material which has been put upon
record by the honourable member (Hon. Mr.
Lewis) to go out without some comment.
The- desire of an honourable member to
secure information on this or any other
subject of public concern is indeed commendable, but I should have thought it still more
commendable for him to exhaust such sources
of information as are easily at his disposal
before making himself the mouthpiece for
spreading throughout Canada complaints
against our system, especially the complaints
of persons confined in our penal institutions.
The honourable member seems to be under
the impression that there is a feeling abroad
of distrust and suspicion; that our penal institutions are harshly and unwisely conducted;
that the men confined in them are not properly
treated, and that discipline is very roughly
and rudely enforced. I should not much
wonder at such impressions getting abroad if
the habit were to become general, not only
among newspapers, but also among members
of the Senate or the other House, of appealing to prurient sentiments in this regard
on the basis of statements of convicts and
other equally reliable authorities. How an
honourable member of this House can justify
himself in spreading upon the records of
this country the complaints of convicts as
to what a paddle is, without having ascertained for himself, as he could easily have
done, what it is, and the only time it can be
applied, is more than I can understand.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: What is it?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable member can find out as well as I have
found out. I have not brought the subject
before this House, and do not intend to make
this House the instrument for distributing
information as to exactly what a certain
instrument in a penitentiary is.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
I have
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
visited our penitentiaries on many occasions
to make inquiries, and have had, perhaps,
peculiar opportunities to learn something with
regard to the general conduct of those
institutions. I would call the attention of
the House to the fact that the penitentiary
is a Dominion institution, where, under the

SENATE

230

constitution of this country, the harder and
v'iler classes of criminals are confined, and
that only those who have been sentenced by
a judge to two years or more can be confined
in thom. Prisons corne unter the jurisdiction
of the provinces and are recognized historieally, in this country as in others, as places
of confinement for lcsser offenders, and their
purpose is improvement and correction more
than punishment. The penitentiary is the
place for more or less desporate criminals, ou
at ail evonts a class of criîninals who are less
subjeet to correction than those who are
sentenced to the jails and the prisons.
The honourable momber says that our
guards are flot of the right type. Well, I
have not the honour of know.ing any of the
guards in our penitentiaries, I think, although
in times past I have had the privilege of
seeing some of thomn at work. I venture to
suggest, however, that a penitentiary would
be an exceedingly curjous institution, housing,
as it does, hundreds of convicts, or oven a
thousand, many of whomn are of the rnost
desperate character and of a type that one
would net like to attempt to describc in this
House, if the guards who are responsible to
the country and to the Government for their
care and discipline, and for holding them in
check, were flot of the police type, but, as
the honourable gentleman recommends, of the
tYpe of missienaries, whose business is that
of correction and teaching. The honourahie
membcr sax's the gu:îrds should be mon who
would be ready to give their services on the
same principlo as preachers, teachers, missionaries and mombers of the Salvation Army
give thieirs. I cannot express my astonishment that an honourable memnber of this
House shou]d suggest that any penitentiary
so organizod and se manned, to maintain
discipline amongst a group of conviets sucb
as I have describcd, could continue to exist.
No one will contend that every guard is just
what hie ought to ho, or that noue of them
make mistakes. But guards cannot be of
the type the honourable gentleman bas in
mind, and if hie availed himself of his opportiinities as a member of this House to visit
our penitentiaries and sec what the guards
have to do, he would never make such a
sug-gestion as hie bas made here.
The honourable gentleman thinks that the
men at, the penitontiarios should ho placod

some extent, but there come timos whien

the honourable gentleman any suspicion of

iany conception of the roal nature and furictien of a penitontiary, it ýcertainly cannot bc
run on the principles the honourablo gentleman bas in mmnd. If it wore, we should have,
net fewer neots, but many more, and the mon

be a matter of judicial decision. Accerdiug te

tian oi the press oi aur country, and wha
regarded thernselves more or less as leaders
oi society. They had developed considerable
organizing ability, and it was because of their
skill in working upon the other inmates that
the outbreaks reached sucli large dimensions.
These are, I think, the facts that protrude
irom this report. The riots occurred not because the guards were not missionaries, not
because there was no .iudge ta decide when the
paddle was ta be applied, not because they had
not had enaugh exercise on the farrn, or play
in the evening; but because ai certain definite
and extraordinary types oi men having been
admitted ta the institutions, and, no dou.bt,
because ai a measure of inefficiency on the
part oi certain officiaIs.
I know one warden, perhaps, particularly
well, and I know that many a rnan who has
gone out fro-m under his charge bas blessed

CANADIAN NATIONAL-CANADIAN

QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. MURDOCK: Honourable senators,
I feel compelled to rise to a question of
privilege affecting a committee of the Sonate.
Yesterday evening I asked the honourable
senator from King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes) to
make an inquir-y as to a certain newspaper
item in the Toronto Mail and Empire of
reenut late.
I Lad to leave the House
before my honourable friend brought the
matter forward. On referring to Hansard I
find he dd not gett very much information.
but was chided for bringing up a question
with respect to a matter now before a committee of this House. I find no fault with
the position then taken, but if that is good
for one member of this House it should be
good for all members, and I now raise a
question of privilege under Rule 42.
I hold in my hand a copy of the Ottawa
Citizen of February 13, also a copy of the
Montreal Star of the same date. In the
Ottawa Citizen I find an article with this
caption:
Senator opposes Beatty's scheine of amalga-

miation.
W. A. Griesbach, gives 'three

fimdffamental

objections' elaiming rail plan not feasible.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

implied in connection therewith were before
the Railway Committee of this House at that

time, and still are.
The Montreal Star carries statements that
are absolutely untrue-so untrue as to be
silly, and, as I am sure that the honourable
senator must have been misquoted, I think he
should have an opportunity to correct any
such silly, untruthful statements.
The Chairman of the Railway Committee
of the Senate (Right Hon. Mr. GraLam)
took me to task the other day, and quite
properly so, for forgetting that I was a
member of that committee. Last nigLt, as
I have said, my honourable friend from
King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes) was taken to task
for bringing forward a question still under
consideration by the Railway Committee. I
take no objection to this rule being enforced.
But I should like to know whether, if the
rule is to apply on Parliament Hill, a member of the Railway Committee is to be free
to go out and broadcast statements of the
kind contained in these two press reports, so
as to tickle the ear-drums of the uninitiated,
who first, ast and all the time are against
this. that and the other thing? If that can
be done, then I may as well say that I can
do as much of it as anybody I know of. But
I do not believe it is the proper thing to do,
and that is the reason I bring the question
to the attention of honourable senators. on
the principle that what is sauce for the goose
is sauce for the gander. If we as members
of the Senate committee must bide our time
and not discuss this question outside until it
has been finally disposed of by the House,
I am quite prepared to govern myself accordingly; but I do not want to have the rule
applied to one member of the House and not
applied to another member, who for the time
being happons to be sitting on the Government side.
I hope that the honourable senator who is
reported as making statements that are silly
and untrueSoine Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I use the words
advisedly. I repeat, the statements are silly
and untrue, and I hope ho will take the
earliest opportunity of correcting the press
reports.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I understood
the honourable gentleman to refer to Rule 42.
I have not myself textually read the rule.
If he bas it before him, would he be good

enough to read it?

FEBRUAIRY 15, 1933
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Rule 41 provides:
Whenever a matter or question directly concerning the privileges of the Senate or.of any
comiiiittee or member therecf, bas arisen, a
motion ealling upon the Senate to take action
thereon may be moved, without notice, and
shall, until decided, unless the debate 1)5
adjourne{l, suspend the consideration of other
motions as well as Orders of the Day.
Some hanourable senatar may ask, "Why do
you flot make a motion?" I do nat desire ta
stress that rule.
This is Rule 42:
Any senator complaining ta the Senate of a
statement in a newspaper as a breaeh af
privilege, shall produce a coýpy of the paper
containdng the statement in question.
I have donc that, and if bonourable senatars
wauld not think I was taking up too much
time I should like ta read bath newspaper
reports and put them on record.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Send them aver
ta me and 1 will rcad them.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I wnuiri remind the honourable gentleman that he bas
nat read the mile in question; that is, if 1
have got the pitrport of whrat hie bas read.
The rule I wo&ild asic him to read is thie ane
refe-rred ta by the Chairman of the Railway
Committee, which f orbids discussion in this
House of any suýbject already committed ta a
committee of the House.
Han. Mr. MURDOCK: I have not that ruie
before me. I am not questioning it. I regard it as logical and consistent. The Chairman invaked it the other day in the Railway
Committee, and I think it was in reference ta
myseif. Maybe I had forgatten the rule for
the moment.
Hon. W. A. GRIBSBACH:
Honourable
senators, every meïmber of this Huse lias the
right ta risc ta a question of privilege with
respect ta a newspaper article which bas misquo-ted him. In this instance I have the right
ta rise and caniplain of a misquotation. The
hanourable mensber for Parkdalc (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) has no right ta dlaim that I have
been misquoted. I have ta loýok after that
matter myscîýf.
In the firat part -of his oomplaint hie
appears to streýs the point made hy the
right honourable gentleman fromn Eganville
(Right Hon. Mr. Glraham), that after a subject lias been committed ta a committee it
aught n<st ta be discusscd in the HOuse until
the committee has made its report. That I
uxiderstand to be the rule, and, se far as I
know, no one has violated it. That rule, however, does net preclude a senator, whether a
member af the committee or not, from discussing in public a matter of public import-

233

ance, even though committed to, a committee
oft his House. There lies a world of différence
between wha't the homouT~able gentleman
believies to be our rights here, on the one
hand, anid our rights outside the House.
Now, as ta the statement. attributed ta me
by -the tiwo newspapers, 1 can largely agree
with the honourable gentleman in characterizing it as untrue and silly. He himself
says it must be a misquotation. It is. My
recollection is that the statement in the press
is that 1 said firemen drew wages of from
$450 a month ta $500 a month. I did flot
do anything at ail about it. Any man who
makes a fairly lengthy speech is pretty lucky
if he has nothing more ta complain of than
one misquotation. What I intended ta say,
and wbat I think I did say, was that in
normal times locomotive drivers drew salaries
of from $250 to $450 a month; and in making
that statement J relied largcly on information
brought down to this House by the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Murdock) himacîf.

gix en bi th(, Presiclents at the annrual nîeetingýý
of the Royal Bank and the Cana-dian Bank of
Commerce, als8o the addresses of the Presidrnt
and the General1 Manager of the Bank of Nova
Scotia, ail of whom hav e deolared that the
bur-dun of prutectivc tariffs must be removed
bc-fore we could hoipe for a revival of trade.
The Gencral Manager of the Bank of Nova
Scotia. spoke as fol-lows:
No moeaeure is more pressingly niccded at the
present timie than a sweeping reciprocal reduction in the tariffs of aIl the principal trading
countries. whjchi ivili release the now thw artel
prodluctive cuergies of tîmeir citizens and permit
of ant expansion of their commerce. In this
matter the world is waiting for bohi leadership.
It is probable that some of the men to whom
1 have alluded, in addi-tion to Sir Robert
Borden, have changed their ýmin-ds on th?
matter of trade; and, if se, t)hey aie not
a-harned te admiýt it. It is no reflection uipon
any man tihat lie lias ehanaged his mmid. In
fact it rnay denote that hie has a mind te
change; that hie possesses greater kuu«ledge
to-day than hie possessedi yesterday, and that
to-day *he is more conscious of bis moral
responisibility to God and his country than hae
iras yesteilday. I arn desirous of asccrtaining
wheether the Gox ern.ment has changed itý iiol
and is no-w in line wibh the strongly prono-unced, -mature ýconc4tusions of these and
many other men on this subject, or whether,
like the Bourbons of old, it is unable to, learn
or forget anything. Somet)hing the right
honourable gentleman -who leads this Housc
(Rig-ht Hon. Mr. Meighen) said somiewhere
recently is -nvouraginz; but after reading a

FEBRUARY 16, 1933
newspa1per report of a speech delivered by the
Prime Minister a short time ago at HamiLlton,
I arn afraid the Government has the Bourbon
menta-lity, and cannot get rid of it. I hope I
arn nistaken. I tihink it was in the Hamilton
speech that tihe Prime Minister epoke of tihe
balance of trade theory, and said that for
saine tiane we had been e3ypurting more than
we were importi-ng, and 'that our foreign trade,
therefore, was heaàlthy and profitable. Other
members of the Government from tiane to time
make, similar statements. There could nlot
weflJ be anything more falila.cious, and it i.s time
such ta4k storpped.
Sutaly we ougiht ta be able ta readh a definite
understanding on a matter that je capable of
mathematicaM, or almost mathematical, demonstration. When our eiqports are greater
than our imparts, if we are flot making investmente abroad or ipaying foreign obligations,
we are trading at a loss, and the measure of
our l-oss is the excess of our emports over our
importe. Our exporte are our outga, and aur
importe are aur incame-and most people like
ta increase theiir incarnes. As individuais we
can easily see that the more any persan gives

usq for what we give him, the betteT

it

is

for

us; and there je really no difference in principle
between international and 'nýdividutal trade.
If we may judge by the'agreements entered
inta at conferences held in recent times, and
by the utterances of ctatesmen in many parts
of the worid, it is beiieved ta be a cound
principle in trade for one country ta ievy
upon the goode of another a customs duty
equal ta the difference in the cost of production
of euch goods as between the twa cauntries,
A moment's reflection, however, ought to convince any one that if this princîple were
carried out fully there could be no trade
between them. Why dace any one ever buy
anything from another country unless it is
that he gets a given article at a lawer price,
or a better article at the camne price? Abolish
thie advantage and with a etroke of the pen
you abolish ail international trade. 0f course
international trade cannot be entirely aboliehed
if the nations survive at ail. International
trade is ta the warld what blaod is ta the
human body. But it can be ca crippled that
the peaples of the warld will be împaverished
and chut aut fram al the advantages which
unshackled trade wauld canfer upon them.
It is generally euppased that a warld canference will be held some time after the coming
Washington conference, and the question
arises, Ccii men halding fundamentally fa!lacious views an trade mattere ga ta that
conference and reach saund agreements an
the subi ect of trade? I have tried ta cmphasize the importance af the trade questian

235

because, a.s I sec it, if the shackles were removed from international trade, many other
questions, such as rates of exehange and
volume of currency, wauld in camne measure,
at least, adjust themselves.
During the session of 1932 the right hanourable the leader of the House (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) made the fallowing statement:
What is clear beyond ail question is thaît the
world is entangled in a great coul of debt; that
the world's d'cbts, national as well as private,
are out of ail proportion ta commodity values.
Debta as between indàviduals adjust theinselves.
The creditor finds that he must adjust or he
laces aIl. Economie farces bring this about.
But international debts are in another sphere,
and it seems ta me s0 plain that he who runs
rnay read, that unless there je a readjustment
of international debts a return ta prosperity
an the part of the world, egpecially on the part
of creditors, is finally and wholly impassible.
Sir Arthur Salter cays:
The fali in gold prices by about 40 per cent
in twa years bas made the load an the backs
of debtors af every kind, private and public,
national and foreign, insupportable.
Thece statements are ca weighty and se
wise they are worth repeating, and what is
needed, perhaps more than anything elce, is
soute immediate andl adequate action ta

carry out as far as possible the principles
iinderlying these etatements.
The United
States holds the key ta the international
situation. It ic neyer easy ta canvince the
creditor that it is ta bis own advantage ta
forgiv e bis debtor; but some pnogreesr in this
direction was being made, an atmosphere of
good-will was being created, when the Right
Hlon. Mr. Chamberlain made bis unfortunate
speeches. If the matters ta be adjusted at
conferences could be scttled by speeches
beforchand, why hold conferences at ail? I
should think that the greatest asset of a
conference would be the percanal touch, and
the personal explanations that could be made
on the spot, and it muet be clear ta even
ordinary people like oui-selves that these
things cannot take place tilI the delegates
meet. Mr. Chamberlain's speeches appear
ta be open diplomacy witb a vengeance. AIl
we can do now is ta hope that common
sense may prevail. Fortunately, hie is not
saying anything on the situation now.
As I see it, if no satisfactary arrangement
can be made with the United States, the
other countries should ship ta that country
aIl the gold they have, and then stop talking or even thinking about international
debts, except in so far as Europe might have
ta make came international adjustments of
hier awn. Such shipments would not greatly
injure the other nations unless they want ta

SENATE

236

hoard goid for the next war, and. tînder
pre..ent circumstancc-, would flot benefit the
United Stafes f0 the value of a fartbing. In
fact, if sncb shipments injured the other countries at ail, fbey would injure the United
Stafes to the same. or perhaps a greater,
extcnf. When international debts are taken
care of, if flot before that bias been accomplishied, cvery nation sbould set to work to
adjust ifs national and indix idual debfs.
Tbere is flot muîch difference in principle
among international, national and individual
dcbts, and we ought ta be able te sec our
own duties and advantages as cleariy as we
bave been able f0 comprebiend those of the
United States. If xve cannof sec what we
should do ourselves, and cannof do if, A our
preacbing f0 the United Stafes bas been
window-dressing.
Apparently fhe world is now pretty wel
coox-inceri that if is only by goods and
services tiiat international debts can ever be
rcaliy paid in a large way. If this depresý,ion
lias hammered in thaf lesson, it bas donc
somne good. Vnfortunateiy, the Unifed States,

It bas been estimated thaf fo prevent such

us te send you more goods tban we are

statesmen faul te sec tbaf tbis process would

probably would increase if by large sums, and
if paymenf were exacted in gold, or se
other mefal of whicb the world had a very

Hlon. Mr. RUCHES.

This thought generates anotheýr idea. Are
the rea], unde.rlying causes of this world depression moral and spiritual, rather than material? To answer this question intelligentiy
one must go back to the bcginning of things
and make at lcast a rapid survcy of some of
the outstanding evcnts in history. 1 presumne
it is flot ncessary for any one to undertake
to iprove f0 Ibis assembly or to any assembly
of Canadians that there is a God; that He
crcated the universe, including this world and
ail it confains, even ifs masterpiece eal'ied
main; ibat 11e endowed man wifh free wiil,
nameiy, the power to obcy or disobey; that
H1e gave bin intelligence cnough f0 kniow
whcnce hie came and whither ho is going-or
at Ieast intelligence cnough to reason about
these things, and intelligence enough f0
measure and weigh the stars; that He gave
man some ruies or commandmenfs for bis
guidance; that in some way or other man
disobeyed these ries and thus forfeited the
intimate friendship of ýGod and incurred the
penalty; tbat part of this punisliment was
darkness of the understanding, weaknesýs of the
wili and a propensity f0 evii; thaf mnan gradually drifte-d fartber and fartier away from
God; thaf one race or Dation reýmained more
faithfui fhan the others; that God was pieased
with this faifbfui nation and from fime to
fime inspired good men among them t0 reveal
His wili f0 their feliow men, and gave to tbis
nation, through one of their leaders, Moses,
an exact code of moral laws calied the Tcn
Commandmnents. Ail f bese things I feel sure
the vast majority of Ganadians believe, and
fhey ail postulate the omnipotence and oiniis.cience of God.

Godhead is also a mystery f0 buman understanding; for man's comprebension is finite,
anid the finit e can neyez comprehcnd fhe infinite. This does nef mean that we are not

we are convin.ced fbat it is God Who is speaking te us, the highest use of reason is f0 bclieve without doubfing. This is well illustrated

knees and adored. It is stili better iilustrated
in the case of St. Peter, as recorded in the
sixth chapter of St. John. -Our Lord propounded to His followers a mystery beyond
human comprehension. No one couid uniderstand it; many refused to believe it and therefore went away from Him. He turned to the
Aposties and said, "Will you aiso go?" St.
Peter answered, sa.ying: "Lord, to whomn shq.ll
we go? What other leader shail we follow?
What ýcan we do? Thou hast the words of
eternal life, and we have believed and have
known ithat Thou art the Christ, the Son of
God." On that occasion St. Peter followed
the highest method of reasoning of which. the
human mind is capable. Every day of our
lives we believe tihings we do noV understand,
on the testimony of some one in whom we
have confidence. We can pay a feliow man no
higher compliment than to tell himn that we
will take his "word. for it." Even earthly
rulers expect us Vo place enough confidence in
themn to take their word for many things. It
ie flot unreasonable, and ie very pleasing. God
requires, and bas the right to require, submission of our intellect and will. This is an
act of faith, and very pleasing Vo i.m. That
must be what St. Paul meant when he said,
"Without faith it is impossible to pleise G-od."
Je-sus claimed to be divine, to be equal to the
Father in ail things, and for this claim the
Jews a'ccused Hm, of blasphemy and de-clared
Him. to be worthy of death. To prove His
elaim, He performed the most stupendous
miracles, did things that onjly Ood cou-Id do;
amplified the Ten Commandments; taught
man everything it was necessary for him to
know, and finally gave His life for this teachingto show that He ivas man, and raise Himself from the dead to prove H1e was God. But
even so, many persons in Canad.a, and a stili
greater number in other countries, dIo not
believe these things.
If the Bible is to be taken as the written
word of God, I do flot sec how these thinge
can be disbelieved. If the Bible be taken
merely as authentie history, I do flot see how
they can be disbeilieved. Nobody doubts that
Caesar led his army through Gaul and invaded Britain; nobody doubts that Columbus
sailed across the Atlantic ocean and
discovered the western hemisphere-or at least
the southeru part of it. Yet there is more
and better proof for the birth, life, miracles,
death and resurrection of Jesus than there le
for cither or bath the other events.
Again, if the Bible is the written word of
God, or is taken simply as authentie history,
there is in this world an evil spirit far more
powerful and intelligent than man. That
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

237

spirit is continually trying to thwart God's
plan in regard to man. That spirit had the
power-or was permittcd- to take Jesus up
into a high mountain, show Him aIl the
kingdoms of the world and their glory, and
say. "Ail these will I give You, if falling down
You will adore me."
That is, I think, the particular temptation
to whioh multitudes of men and ail nations,
some more, some less, have su.ccumbed. Riches,
glory, honour, dominion-these make a strong
appeai to individual pride, and a stili stronger
appeal to national pride. It is probably the
subtlest and most dangerous of ail temptations. It can be prescnteýd to the individual
as a reward for his personal merits, and to the
nation as duty and patriotism. It leads Vo
every effort on the part of the individual to
overreach, outwit and exploit hie ncighbour
in aIl worldly transactions; it leads to
jealousies, hatreds, wars, physical and commercial. and to aIl manner of intrigues on the
part of nations. In fact, it substitutes the
law of the jungle for the law of God, and
would completely destroy the worid if the evil
spirit had sufficient power to compass its
destruction.
Every tboughtful person should, I think, sc
that if disbelief in the divinity of Jesus became general, the New Testament at least
would, go by the board. Civilization, as we
know it, would also go, and aIl, or nearly ail,
moral restraints. History, ns I sec it, furnishes overxvhelming proof of this. But bad
as the world is, imperfect as it is now, it is a
great deal better than it was during any historical period of the pre-Obristian era.
Disbelief ln the divinity of Jesus, even in
the existence of God, is far more widespread
than many persons imagine. Before the War
it was well known that atheismn was openly
taugbt in the universities of Germany. The
German scientiste and higher critics had
gotten away beyond the "superstition of
Christianity," and the idea of a Supremne
Being was repugnant to such mnen. There was
no being superior to, these men themselves,
and their Kultur was almost worshipped by
the reet of mankind. Many rich families in
every part of the world sent their sons ta
Germany to finish their education. That was
anly a few years ago, and where is Germany
to-day? There ie none sa poor as to do her
reverence now. "The Lord has looked out
from His piller of glory and aIl her brave
thousends are dashed in the tide."
Perhaps nations have Vo he puniehed in this
world for their infidelities, as they cannot, like
individuals, 'be punished in the next. Let
us noV, however, delude ourselves with the

SENATE
idea that Germans are much different in these
and all other respects from the people of
other countries. A little introspection might
do none of us any harm.
Some few weeks ago I read in the newspapers this Canadian Press dispatch, which
should, I think, receive some attention:
"I think we are foolish unless we keep our

eyes on Russia, and study some of the ways
the planned society there is working out, and
be hmble enough to take a lesson or two,"
said Professor King Gordon, son of "Ralph

Connor," addressing the Canadian Club here
to-day.
Professor Gordon visited Russia a year ago,
and he denied that visitors were taken around
only to "show places" and shown only the
most favourable aspects of life there. Be had
been absolutely unhampered.
Speaking of the general impression that in
Russia individual inititiive was discouraged. the
speaker remrked that in place of this one found
"definite controls directed toward the present
and future welfare of the country."
Thougli Orthodox religious education was outlawed, it was not truc that no religion existed
in Russia. "There is a dynamie religion in the
country to-day," Professer Gordon said. "You
need only watch the people at Lenin's tonb to
sec that."
I have been told that Mr. Gordon is a
Professor of Christian Ethies in a Montreal
ceollege affiliated with MeGill University. It
seems that Mr. Gordon rather approves of
the situation as he found it in Russia-the
He found
religious and other conditions.
Orthodox religion--which, I suppose, means
Christianity-outlawed in the schools, but
he found a "dynamie" religion in the country.
I do not know what dynamic religion is, but
evidently it is not Christianity. All the same,
acording to the press dispatch, Mr. Gordon
rather approves of it. Yet Mr. Gordon is a
Professor of Christian Ethics in a theological
school affiliated with the leading university in
a Christian nation. It is all very strange and
bewildering to me, and I think it is a sign
of the trend of the times. A few years ago
here were ugly rumours in regard to the
teaching and other things in the University of
Toronto. These rumtours have died away. Let
us hope they were not well founded.
Mr. Philip E. Wentworth has an article in
the Atlantic Monthly of June, 1932, entitled,
Mr.
"What College Did to My Religion."
Wentworth was reared in a Christian, Presbyterian home in one of the middle states of
the United States. His parents wished him
to study for the ministry, and he himself
was quite agreeable. When he arrived at the
age of eighteen and had finished lis high
echool education at 'home, his pastor wished
him to pursue his further studies in a theological college near by, but he wanted to go
to Harvard, and his father consented. His
Bon. Mr. HUGHES.

pastor urged that Harvard was the Sorbonne
of Unitarianism, that the very title "Unitarian" was a denial of the Trinity, and that
there was great risk of imbibing false doctrines there. These arguments did not, however, prevail, and to Cambridge he went. He
states thait two years in Harvard made him a
Unitarian, four years there made him an
atheist; and he further states:
Nine young men and women out of every
ten who will graduate this June (1932) would
probably admit, if they were called upon to
testify, that education has acted as a poison
to their faith.
What an indictment of the universities of
the Republic to tihe south! Mr. Wentworth
was a member of the graduating class of 1928
and rather glories in the fact that he is no
longer a Christian, for he says:
They--the churches-cannot give Him (God)
up and remain Christian; they cannot keep
Him and retain the loyalty of educated people.
Nevertheless, Mr. Wentwortih does not appear to be quite at rest in his own mind. He
makes some significant admissions. He says:
The really serions dangers of skepticism
become apparent when a student rejects the
supernatural part of his religion and concludes
that there are no valid reasons left for decent
conduct. Robbed of standards, he is likely to
adopt the easy ethies of business, which permit
a man to do almost anything so long as it
leads to success in moneymraking. This commercial point of view is rapidly becoming the
real philosophy of the nation, as Mr. Adams
brilliantly demonstrates in "The Epic of
America."
Again, he says:
But only a congenital optimist could bring
hinself to believe that a me.re systein of ethie,
howiever satisfying to the intelleet, couibl ever
take the place of religion among the masses.
Most men and women are incapable of sustained
self-eontrol. Greed, pride, lust, are too much
for them.
Observe the insinuation that infidelity satisfies the intellect, but that perhaps, after all,
And
Christianity is best for the masses.
these are the kind of men the American
universities are turning out. But there is more
to follow:
In so far as the colleges destroy religious
faith without substituting a vital philosophy to
take its place, they are turning loose upon the
world young barbarians who have been freed
froi the discipline of the churches before they
have learned how to discipline themselves.
Perha.ps this was Mwhat one of my least orthodox
Harvard professors had in mind when he once
said, "There are only a few men in the world
weho have ea-rned the riglit not to be
Christians."
In the end, what a cry of despair cemes
from Mr. Wentworth! But all the same, he
and those who agree with him think they are

FEBRUARY 16, 1933
superior in intelligence to ail 'the Christians
who have ever lived.
For the Christians
they have either scorn or pity, but for themselves adoration. They are ready to worship
anything but God, and this is to themn a mark
of profound intelligence.
The devil has
aclhieved some great victories!
A few yea.rs ago KiÀpling wrote, "There
ain't no ten com.mandments east of Mandalay." A few weeks ago The Literary Digest
wrote, "There are no ten commandmaents for
the mai ority of the people in the United
Sta tes." The colleges and -the universities in
that country are doing their work well. Even
Mr. Wentworth saw the inevitable, but hie
rather gloried in it. He would go down to
destruction rather than admit the divinity of
Jesus, or aceknowledge the sovereignty of God.
A few months ago I read in the newspapers
that there was one divorce for every six
marriages in the United States, and if the
Catholie population were flot eoun-ted there
would be one divorce for every five marriages.
Furthermore, if for the next few years the
growth of divorce should be as great as in the
last few years, there would be one divorce
for every three or four marriages. Quite
re-cently 1 read in the Mail and Empire a
statement given out by Mr. Justice Bartlett,
wiho had retired frora active service at Reno,
Nevada:
A Reno Judge's Record
'Reno, 'Nevada, bas for years been a synonym
for easy divorce. Opponents of divorce have
been wont to regard Reno as anathema. It i8
interesting, therefore, to note that Judge
George A. Bartlett, who bas retired f rom active
if e, bas a record of baving gr.anted 20,000
divorces.
Wben a case had been properly
prepared, according to the Sydney (N.S.) Post,
be reaehed a decision in ten minutes, and in
snoh instances bis court could handle one
hundred cases a day. Judge Bartlett, reealling
some decrees bie granted, says:
"I gave a woinan a divorce because bier
busband persisted in smoking a short dlay pipe
that smelled terrible. 1 gave a wosnan a divorce
last year because ber husband persisted in
playing only jazz isie on tbe radio mihen she
wanted at least a part of it to be classical
music. Sbe bas a fine musioal taste and I know
what she called those radio quarrels would continue and increase in intensity and nmental
eruelty 'to lier. I glave a divorce to another
wif e beoause hier hua nd played the saxophone
I bave granted
aIl evening until midnight.
divorces to women because their husbands wore
horrible neckties, because they used profanity,
and in one case, because the husband kept
steping on his wife's feet."
The divorce laws of Nevada were amended
recently, making the residence law for those
wbo seek separation six weeks înstead of three
months.
It is Dot improbable that Judge
Bartlett's record will be broken.
These statements by Americans present us
with a picture of the moral conditions in that
country. We know fromn the public records

239

and the news of the day what the inaterial
conditions are like: the richest nation in the
world, the creditor nation of the world, the
most self-eontained nation in the world, the
potentially stronge-st nation in the world,
having more hunger, nakedness, destitution
and discontent than any other nation in the
world. Destitution follows spiritual infidelity
and moral decadence. In ail these respects
the United States is but an intensified replica
of ail the other Christian nations. What will
be the outcome? Anybody who will read St.
Paul's Second Epistie to Timothy and St.
Matthew's Gospel will see ail the signs that
were to precede the end of the world. They
may not mean the end of the physical world
as we know it, and, if not, will net mnean
the end of any institution established by
Christ, but they rnay well mean the end of
the institutions established by man to oppose
God's plan and to make it appear that
Christ was not, omniscient, but was an unpractical Iaav-giver whose legislation could not bE
ohserved.
We are told that Sodoen would not have
been destroyed if ten just men had been
found within the city. There is doubtless a
far greater proportion of just persons in the
world to-day than ten would have been to
the population of Sodom, and the mercy of
God is as great now as it was then, or as it
ever was. Humility, the virtue opposed to
pride, would .probably save the world at any
time. But how many individuals will get
down on their kinees and humbly and sincerely
ask God for guidance? There is no means
of knowing.
Certain-ly few statesmen will
officially do it, and it is not likely that any
nation will officdally do it. They will rely
upon other means, upon what they can ac-.
complish themselves, notwithstanding the mess
they have made of things. Worldly means
are ail riglit in their place. But 1 do not
think God can be left out of the reckoning,
and it seemis to me to be the duty of every
one who thinks in this way to do his bit,
publicly and privately.
Honourable senators, I think I have in
these remarks enumerated the trends of the
times.
CONTROL

OF MOTOR TRANSPORTATION IN CANADA

DEBATE CONTINUED-MOTION WITHDRAWN
The Senate resumed fromn Fehruary 7 the
debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. King,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Sinclair:
That in the opinion of the Senate the Government of Canada should bring into conference
the provincial governments, the executives of
the (Janadian National and the Canadian Pacific
railways, and repreeenitatives of the newer form

SENATE

240

of transportation, as obtains in the autobus,
motor-tiuck and aeroplane services, w ith a view
of formulating regulations for them of an interprovincial or national character which would
permit of thoir normal and proper development,
and prevent unfair and unwarranted competition with our railway systems.
Hon. W. E. FOSTER: Honourable senators,
this resolution deals with the competition
of motor transportation with our railways,
and I shall endeavour to confine my remarks
to this question. The resolution I think is
timely, more particularly when the railway
situation is under general review, as it is today. During the last few months we have
heard a great deal about co-operation and
competition between our railways, but we
hav e not hard much about the competition
of mtor vhicl(s and other forms of transportation.
I should have liked to hear expressions of
opinion froum some honourable members who
fnom tiheir conncetion with the provincial
governments have seen expenditure on highway constriction inerease from year to year.
The incr ase is due to the fact ýthat through
the evolution of road transportation the need
for bighway conestrnction became greaiter than
it was in the carlier days. In other words,
the development of motor transportation has
laid a very heavy burden upon the taxpayers
of the various proinecs. I think also that
nembers of this House who have had experienoe in conneetion with the building and the
administration of highways in the provinces
know the difflculty of enforcing regulations
witlh regard to motior traffle on the highways.
That is another reason wh it would have
been intrestng to hear some of those honoura ble memibers give expression to their views.
I should have liked also to sec this resolution broadened a little, so as ,to take in all
avenues of transportatlion, including waterways,
of whieh I intend to speak before I take up
the main subject of the resolution.
I notice by the report of the Royal Commission on Transportation-the Duff Commission. so called-and the evidence given before that commission, which is to be found in
the Library in two volumes, and is available
to all of us, that certain representations were
made by the Maritime Transportation Commission, who claimed that traffic moving by
the St. Lawrence-Great Lakes system was
indirectly subsidized to the extent of about
$2 a ton. I observe also that the railways do
not complain very much of water competition
so far as bulk cargoes of grain, coal, etc. are
concerned. Nevertheless there is undoubtedly
considerable competition prevailing between
the waterways of the country and the railways. In this connection I noticed the other
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

day, in the Canada Year Book for 1932,
reference to the fact that the opening of the
New Welland Ship Canal had caused the
traffie in iron ore from Point Edward to
Hamilton to be diverted from all-rail to water.
Formerly, I understand, this movement took
place over the Canadian National Railways.
Now, by reason of the construction of the
Welland Canal, the cost of which is estimated
at about $200,000,000, and which is operated
without regulation and without charge, a
large volume of the brade which originally
moved over the Canadian National Railways
bas been diverted to the waterways. It seems
to me that there should be some way of
preventing competition between Governmentowned utilities.
Honourable inembers may have seen in the
press this morning a synopsis of the report of
the National Transportation Commission of
the United States, headed by the late Calvin
Coolidge, in which it is contended that inland
waterways should be made to pay their own
way. I understand further that, as a result of
the acute internal competition among the
water carriers. it bas been found necessary to
adopt a system under which rates are maintained at a fixed level; and it has been felt
by representatives of the Western grain
growers, and I believe rightly so, that the
steamship companies have taken advantage of
this ability to control their own rates. I have
thought it timely, therefore, to mention the
competition of the waterways-a subject
which is not mentioned in the resolutionand to stress my belief that the control of
our waterways, as well as of other avenues
af transportation which enter into competition
with the railways, should be given considera-

tion.
The resolution deals particularly with highways. Having had some little experience
with regard to the construction of highways
as far back as 1917, I know something of the
difficulty and expense of maintaining those
highways since the coming of heavier vebicles,
and their more general use. It is not my
intention to suggest that there should be any
interference with the free use of these avenues
of transportation by the commerce of the
country. But it is my belief that there should
be more thorough regulaition than there has
been in the past.
Our modern system of highways has been
constructed almost entirely at the expense of
the provincial governments. In 1919, I think
it was, the Dominion Government did give
assistance to the provinces in connection with
the construction of some of the trunk roads;
and at the present time it is giving aid towards
the building of the trans-Canada highway.

FEBRUARY 16, 1933
Nevertheless, the burden of the cost and
maintenance of the highways has fallen mainly
upon the governments of the provinces.
When the idea was first conceived of entering into the construction of these roade on a
large scale, it was not intended that they
should be exploited for commercial purposes
by the owners of heavy transportation vehicles.
The idea was to construct a highway, which
was not too costly, for the use of private
motor-car owners and of touriste, who were
coming here in ever-increasing numbers from
the United States. But the evolution of motor
transportation has brought with it heavier
vehicles, and bas placed upon the shoulders
of the taxpayers and the governments of the
various provinces, by reason of the wear and
tear upon the roads, a very much heavier
burden than was originally anticipated. I do
not know that, within limitations, there can
be any objection to the use of highways for
the purposes to which they are now being
put; but the burden of which I speak has
now reached such proportions that it is questionable whether the provinces will be able
to continue to maintain the highways in
passable condition without increasing taxes to
an extent that I for one should not like to see.
The cost of constructing those highways
was charged to capital account, and we could
go out and borrow money for their construction, and for a few years afterwards the roads
remained in very good condition without the
outlay of large sums of money. However,
during the past few years the provinces have
not been able to carry on as they had done
previously. Some roads had to be rebuilt, and
others maintained, and now we have come to
the time when this subject is a iatter of very
grave concern to the provincial govemments.
I noticed in the report of the Transportation
Commission the suggestion that the burden
of maintaining highways should be placed, to
the extent of about two-thirds of the total
cost, on the motor carriers. I do not think
the exact percentage is vital, but I believe
that any attempt to charge the operators of
trucks and motor buses too great a proportion
of the cost would frustrate its own purpose,
and would, in many cases, drive this form of
transportation from our highways. The result
would be that a greater cost than ever would
have to be assessed against the owners of
private motor cars. On the other hand, to
permit conditions to continue as they are
to-day would add so greatly to the cost of
highway maintenance that it would be necessary to increase the taxation on private cars
in order to provide a right of way for conmerce generally.

241

I believe, honourable gentlemen, that we
should endeavour to limit commercial transportation in such a way that only that portion
of it which is of real economic value should
be permitted to increase in volume; and I
believe that the time has come when we must
definitely consider applying such regulations
to commercial motor transportation as will
insure this end.
Commercial highway transportation, like
railway transportation, concerns those who
invest capital in it, those who are employed
in carrying it on, and the producers and consumers throughout the country. From the
standpoint of those who have invested their
money in this industry, I think nothing but
advantage would accrue from the adoption of
a system of franchises. In this way they
would be protected against the non-economical
competition that now exists. From the standpoint of the employees, also, I believe it
would be beneficial, in that it would make
possible the enforcement of proper standards
of working hours, working conditions and
wages. Experience has taught us the necessity of regulating railway rates in order to
prevent the exploitation of the shipper and
absurd competition in rate fixing. Without
this regulation the business would be uncertain, both as regards those who supply the
service and those who make use of its facilities.
The resolution before us suggests the calling
of certain conferences. It is well known that
the provincial regulation of highway traffic in
regard to rates, the responsibilities of carriers,
working hours, and other matters, bas proved
inadequate because of the difficulty of enforcement. If the matter is left to the provinces alone, this condition will continue to
exist. Hence, as it is impossible to conceive
of proper regulation of rates and proper control in other ways without an extension of
authority, the resolution commends itself to
me, and I am convinced that any conference
should see to it that not only is there uniformity in the provincial regulations regarding
highway transport, but some central authority
is created to enforce such regulations.
I believe that the regulation of the rates
and operating conditions of interprovincial
highway transport should be placed under the
jurisdiction of some body such as the Board
of Railway Commissioners, and that it should
be given power to issue certificates of necessity and convenience to those who engage in
the transportation of merchandise and of
passengers. It would, of course, be necessary
to avoid any clash of jurisdiction between
the Dominion and the provinces. It might
be that the provinces would be willing to

53721-16
REVISED EDITION

242

SENATE

authorize the Dominion Government to extend
the control of the Board of Railway Commissioners so that it would have jurisdiction over
all interprovincial highway commerce. I am
aware that at present the provincial governments may not be ready ta accept such a
method of dealing with the matter, but I
believe that within a reasonable time one
province after another will be ready to
acquiesce in such a proposal, with regard not
only to interprovincial traffic, but to its
internal commerce as well.
The National Transportation Commission
of the United States has the following to say
regarding highway competition:
Automotive transportation should be put
under such regulation as i8 necessary for public
protection. It should bear its fair burden of
tax, but only on a basis of compensation for
public expenditure on its behalf, plus its share
of the general tax load.
The comittee believes that the situation
requires general federal jurisdiction of motor
transport. It recognizes that no such intimacy
of regulation as characterizes railway supervision can ever be extended to this field, but
it is convinced that a broad measure of federal
and uniform state control can and should be
applied.
Transportation in this country of ours is
not only a national industry, one of the
greatest employers of labour, and the source
of the earnings of thousands of investors, but
also a vital public service. I believe it is
not too much to say that the economic life
of the country depends upon it. The very
fact that twice within recent years it has been
found necessary to appoint a Royal Commission to consider this subject is evidence that
in the past we have not used reasonable care
and foresight in planning our transportation
equipment.
Experience in this and every
other country has shown that in order ta
guarantee the operation of transportation
systems on a basis which shall be fair to
the users as well as to the owners of them,
the regulation of rates and operating conditions is essential; and I say, without fear of
contradiction, that we cannot indefinitely continue the present method of regulating our
railway systems without seriously damaging
the interests of those systems, the competing
systems, and the commerce of the country.
I realize that there will at first be criticism
of my suggestion tiat the regulation of highway and waterway transport be placed under
the jurisdiction of the body that has so ably
regulaited our railway transportation in the
past, but I am convinced thait on fair consideration this suggestion will commend itself
to all those interested, that is, to all the
country. I believe that such a system would
be in the interests of the taxpayers of the
Hon. Mr. FOSTER.

provinces, who provide our highways; of the
taxpayers of the Dominion in their joint
capacity as owners of our waterway system
and the Canadian National Railways; of
the many investors in this and other countries
who have placed their capital in the Canadian
Pacifie Raailway; of those who own securities
of our steamship companies, and of those who
work in any branch of the great transportation enterprises of ithis country.
I believe
that, above ail, it is in the truc interests of
the country's producers, merchants, manufacturers and consumers that all public transportation services, and particularly, under present
conditions, those that compete with our railway systems, should be under complete and
constant regulation and control.
I think, honourable members, that we should
bear in mind that our railways are our main
avenues of transportation. It may be that
they have seen their best days, but they have
been with us for a very considerable period,
they have served us faithful-ly and well, they
have aided very greatly in opening up this
country for settlement, and in a very broad
and comprehensive manner they have been
powerful factors in our national development.
No one who listened to the remarks of Mr.
Beatty, the President of the Canadian Pacifie
Railway, before our Railway Committee a short
time ago, could help being greatly impressed
with the record of that company since its
incorporation.
The Canadian Government
railway system has also had a very enviable
record. Our railways are on ýthe job 365 days
in the year. Other means of transportation,
suoh as the motor buses and trucks that use
our highways, are often prevented by the
clements from maintaining a regular service.
Jack Frost sometimes seals up waterways for
months, and weather conditions frequently
interfere with transport by air. My submission is that our railways should have a fair
measure of protection against competition
from what might be called those fair-wea-ther
forms of transportation.
I may be called to order if I make any
reference to the Bill which has been before
the Railway Committee, but I hope it will
contain some provision for reasonable protection of our ra.lways against competition
from these different forms of transportation.
If the measure does not conitain a provision
of that kind, I shall hope that in consequence
of this resolution some conferences will be
held and legislation brought before us later
on for the purpose of safeguarding our railways to the extent to which they are entitled
to protection.

is undoubtedly more acute than in this oountry,
and it seems te me that we should lose no
time in setting on foot an inquiry with the
objeot of maintaining and if possible improving our relatively favourable position.
To invite the transportation interests to
come into an interprovincial conference would
not be according to precedent or practi-ce.
since usually only the governments interested
are represented at such conferences. But if
an interprovincial conference is to result in
more than discussion on the matter it should
organize, for the purpose of further inquiry
and study, committees or other bodies conposed not only of competent provincial government offioials, but also of representatives
of tihe transportaition interests.
Acording te a report in the Montreal
Gazette of January 17, it would seen that at
the recent conference there was a disposition
te study the problem from a geographical
point of view, it being suggested that the
three Prairie Provinces might devise some
plan suitable to their local conditions, and
that the Central Provinces of Ontario and
Quebc, and the Maritime Provinces could do
likewise. This would leave British Columbia
to work eut its own salvation. As to that
we should have no objection, for the people in
that province are always anenable te a fair
and reasonable compromise.
The provinces have met, and, as we have
been informed, have carried on a discussion,
but apparently there bas been no further
development.
The Montreal
Gazette
of
January 27 says that Premier Taschereau,
when speaking in the Quebec Legislature on
the results of the conference, stated:
The question was raised as to the competition
with railways of motor trucks and motor buses
and after the matter had been fully discussed
it was decided it would be better to have a
conference on the matter later on.
That being se, it would seem to me that the
resolution should be carried. At least it would
do no harm, and I think it might be of some
use. The right honourable leader of the
House bas suggested that the resolution might
be amended so that a committee of the
Sena;te might make the proposed inquiry.
Personally I find it diffcult te amend my
resolution, for it deals with a matter in which
the provinces have primary responsibility and
will undoubtedly have the last say. But if it
is felt that a commnittee of this louse could
better serve the purpose, then, no doubt, the
procedure would be for the right honourable
leader te move for the appointment of such
a committee.
Hon. R. H. POPE: Honourable senators,
the way in whieh we look upon the proposal
Hon. Mr. KING.

te have an investigation into the transportation situation, whether by a committee of this
House or by the provinces, will depend very
largely upon the section of the country in
which we live. I am living in a mountainous
area of the Province of Quebec, where no railways have been built for sixty years and
where transportation improvements have been
made on the highways alone. If we are to
have an investigation it should be conducted
by representatives, not only of provincial governments, but aiso of municipalities and of
more or less remote areas that have been
benefited by the motor truck and bus; and
great care must be exercised su that the effect
of any decision arrived at will not be to
take away the livelihood that many people
have built up through the use of transportation by motor truck.
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Honourable members,
I have been informed that the competition
frorn motor trucks and buses is decreasing,
because owners of these vehicles are not making a worthwhile profit out of the business. I
believe there is some truth in the statement,
but I do not know whether the competition
will disappear to such an extent that the railways will be able to carry on as they did
before these newer forms of transportation
came into vogue.
Hon. L. McMEANS: Honourable senators,
I cannot very wel.1 agrec with the remarks of
the bonourable gentleman who has just
spoken. Some railway men who came into
my office a short while ago told me that,
whereas they used to load five cars of freight
every day between Brandon and Winnipeg,
they now load only half a carload weekly.
I do not see how the competition is likely
to decrease. Highways cover the country. A
farmer who wants te go into the town to sell
produce, or to buy goods, uses the highways,
for they pass his door. If his wife wants to
go to department stores, where prices are
lower, she jumps into her car and makes a
quicker trip than she could make by railway.
Although I have read somewhere a statement
along the same line as that made by my bonourable friend, my opinion is that the railways will have to face increased rather than
decreased competition frorn the motor bus and
truck in the future.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I am
sorry the honourable senator (lon. Mr. King)
is asking for a decision on his motion, for I
do not like te vote against it. Inasmuch,
however, as it calls for a conference of the
Federal Government, provincial governments,
representatives of the Canadian National Rail-

245

FEBRUARY 16, 1933
ways and of the Canadian Pacifie Railway, and
aiso representatives of the various motor-bus
and motor-truck companies of the Dominion,
I fear that I could nlot take the responsibility
of supporting it. Such a gathering, in point of
size, would be gigantic; it would dwarf even
the Hou&,e of Commons. It would neot be a
conference; it would be too large. The last
conference, although only the provinces were
represented, was about the size of the Senate.
Further, it is nlot the practice, nor do I think
the provincial authorities would regard it as
desirable, to include private companies in a
conference with governmnents.
For these reasons, although in sympathy with
the objeet of the motion, I do nlot feel inclined
to take the responsibility of supporting it;
indecd, I could not justify doing so. If the
motion is withdrawn, or nlot carried, I will
consider the suggestion to have a motion
introduced, either by myseif or by somne member who could perbaps more appropriately
introduce it, for the appointment of a comnmittee to make inquiry into this subi ect, witli
power to summon witnesses.
Knowing something of the pressure upon
the Government to-day, knowing a great deal
more about it than I did a year ago, and
knowing that that pressure is becoming greater
and greater rather than diminishing, I feel
rather boath to support motions whicb continually demand investigation of this, that and
the other mtatter un the part of thé' Government itself.
We are freer here than perliaps any other
body of equal status in this Dominion, and
1 think we might do something worth while
by undertaking a sys-tematic study of the
problem through a comimittee. We ehould
have no difficulty in getting into touch with
the views of provincial governments, nor with
the views of the industries concerned, and we
might really bring to this subjecet some light
that would enable goverfiments the more
intelligently to act thereon.
If the resolution is witbdrawn, I promise to
give immediate consideration to the suggestion
which flrst of alI I made, and which the
honourable gentleman has accepted.
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable gentlemen,
as far as I am concerned, I arn very happy to
do anything that wilI bring about the best
results in this matter, and if the rigbt honourable leader is prepared to consider the appointment of a special committee of this House to
carry out the purpose I have in mi, I shal
be glad to withdraw my resolution. I agree
with hii that interprovincial conferences often
do not get very far, and the necessary
machinery is often flot set up. I had hoped

that out of the suggested conference machinery
would be evolved to conduct the inquiry under
proper conditions. However, if it is the
opinion that a more effective inquiry can be
made by a speoial committee of this House,
I shaîl, as I said, be glad to withdraw my
resolution.
The motion was withdrawn.
PRISON DISCIPLINE
MOTION AND

AMENDMENT

The Senate resumned from February 14 the
debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Lewis,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Hughes:
That in the opinion of the Sena)te full
publicity shculd ha given te prison discipline,
and the airn of dieciplâne âhouJl be refi>rm
as well as punîshrnent.
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable senators, I submit that the motion n-ow before
us should not be entertained. It is proposed
that full publicity be given in regard to
discipline in our penitentiaries. As to, how
my honourable friend from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Lewis) would arrange for this publicity,
and to what extent lie would control it, I
am left in a great deal of doubt. I am inclined to think that such publicity would be
more likely to be subversive of discipline
than belpful in its maintenance. Perhaps he
has in mind that Parliament sliould vote
sufficient funds to establish a newspaper plant
in each penitentiary, to ha conducted by a
Soviet committea of the prisoners, so that
they might air their grievances, real and imagmnary, and issue thieir newspaper for circulation outside the penitentiary. Perhaps that
is what lie means?
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: Not at all.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: For many years past
we have had very careful and thorougli inspection of our penitentiaries. As lias been
pointed out so cogently by the riglit lionourable leader of tbe House (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen), we are bound to find a weak vessel
bore and there among tlie officials, but on tlie
whole I think it is true to say tliat the penitentiaries have been well managed. We can
neyer expeet te allay unrest or dissatisfaction
gmong the inniates of these institutions. It
appears to me that my lionourable friend and
other people who share bis views fail to
realize this very signifleant fact, that in a
penal establishiment, such as Portsmouth Penitentisry, where you have confined upwards
of 900 men of criminal minds and criminal
training, astute men endowed wàtli a good
deal of brain power, many of them leaders
if crime, the officials in charge are con.fronted

SENATE
with tremendous difficulties and have to
assume grave responsibilities in maintaining
discipline. It must be borne in mind that
only seasoned criminals are sentenced te
the penitentiaries; those convicted of lesser
effences are sent to other penal institutions.
As I have said, yen have in Portsmouth
Penitentiary 900 mon or more, many of thera
leaders in crime, mon who, if allowed their
freedoin to-morrow, would at once resumne
their criminal caroor. Therefore we must not
minimizo the diffieulties which confront those
in charge of our penitentiaries.
My honourablo friend roferred to some statemonts printed in certain newspapers. I arn
credibly informed that similar statoments were
offorcd to reputable newspapers, but wero not
published. Why? My honourable friend is an
old newspaper man; hoe knows. Bocause there
was no foundation for the statements, there
was no naine attached to thein, there was
nothing te, recommend their truth. My honourable friend can tell the Huse whether the
document hoe read had a naine appended
to it.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: No, it had not.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Or wbethor it was
one of those anonymous communications which.
roputablo newspapcrs put into the wastepaper basket.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: Not always. Maniy
anonymous' communications are published
froin time to turne by oui nowspapers.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: 1 have read some of
these published articles, and I have one right
uindor my hand. On their face the statements
contained therein are improbable and untrue.
I amn surprised that a seasoned newspaper man
like my honourable frîend could ho so easily
inisled by such a document.
We in this Chamber should ho endeavouring
to hold up the hand of authority, instead of
playing into the hands of these reckless mon
who have to be imprisoned becauso they are
law-breakers. Only the mian who is guilty of
many serious infractions of the criminal law
is put into a penitentiary. Thon why should
decent, law-abiding citizons ho called upon to
slobber over these convicts? We know they
are well treated and wcll cared for. We
maintain oui vory expcnsive penal institutions
for these criminally mindcd mon who persist
in breaking the law. Why do we place them
uinder restraint? To protect our reputable
citizens, to preservo life and property. Yet
my honourable friend thinks these desperate
convicts should ho coddled and made the
subleet of compassionate speeches. He is
addressing the wrong audience.
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

enjoyed. Each man had a nice, clean, electrically lighted ronin, a good bed, running
wator. wash basin, and lavatory; there was
a library at his disposal; hoe was provided
with wholesome food, prepared by dieticians;
a doctor looked after his health. The work
roon-s were large, well1 lighted and well ventiiated. I reflected: Who pays for ail these
comforts and luxuries for these persistent lawbreakors? The law-abiding taxpayers, among
whoma are thousands and thousands of pooT
people who do not know what a lavatory
is, except one at the back door, nor the cenvenience of running ivater; who have no
electric lights to brighten thoeir homes, and
liar-dl 'v an ' food toe at; in short, people whio
have noue of the ceinforts of life. It is these
poor taxpayers whio must holp keep our penitentiary population in luxurious comfort.
Why did the inmates of Portsmouth Penitentiary become mutinous?
Because they
were not supplied with cigarette papers and
fine-eut tobacco, and were flot allowcd to go
in and eut of the building as they wished!
Tliose are the principal reasons given in
Superintendent Ormond's report on the recent
dî,,turbances at Port.smouth. Because cf those
',..riev anees" these fellows, se well housed and
fed, st'irted in to dcmolishi the whole building. Forty or fifty of thein tore eut the
lavatory' fittings, ripped up their beds, and
ihirew thc debris eut of the windows. They
even smashed the electric lights. Well, if they
did net want these electrie lights tbey might
at leas't have said to the officiaIs, "Send thein
out t.o some of the peor taxpayers who need
thom."'
As I have said, these convicts foît aggrieved
beeause they were kept inside the building.
Wh 'v atre tbey kupt inside? Because, as I
said a moment age, if they were let eut they
weuld resumne their criminal career. They
mighit even break into my honourable friend's
bouse, steal seme of his property, and perhaps
threaten his life.
This is not the tino nor place te worry ouiselv es about these turbulent gentlemen. We
lknow rhey are well provided for. In my
judgment they are luxuriously provided for.
Talk about net having cigarette papers and
fine-eut tobacco! A lot of us cannet afferd
cigarettes these days, but we have te dip inte
otir pockets to, previde the convicts with
cigarettes.
Those desperate
fellows, whe

FEBRUARY 16, 1933
would thin-k nothing of breaking into our
homes, or even of qhoK>ting anyone who
resisted them, muet be provided with cigarette
papers and fine-eut tobacco! It was a man
of that type who yesterday, in an attempt to
assassinate the Presicient-eleet of the United
States, seriously injured five persons. The
whole world was shocked this morning when
it read of hie dastardly crime. No doubt he
will be sent to the penitentiary. In. a few
moniths la' may be the ringleader in a prison
riot. Why? Recause the food is not good
enough-because he is not getting cigarette
papers and fine-eut tobacco-because the
light in his celi is not briglit enough. Then a
lot of confederates in crime will raise the
cry, "This man is 'being treated cruelly";- and
in ail probability many gentlemen like my
honourable friend fromn Toronto will join in
the chorus and urge that we must have
publicity with respect to prison discipline, we
muet know that the inmates are not being
grounil down, and so on. The honourable
gentleman has referred to the use of a paddle
for disciplinary purposes. 1 neyer saw a
paddle, but I submait that those criminal
gentlemen who took part in the wanton destruction of property at Portsmouth deserve a
fine dose of the paddle. That is my judgment.
That we have refrained from giving them a
few such doses is, I thinik, one of the reasons
why they have been so defiant.
I repeat, I do not think this motion is such
as this honourable House should adopt, and
therefore I beg to move in amendment:
That ail the words of the Order ýafter the
word "Senate" in the third line be struck out,
and that the following be substituted:
that while administration of peniteuibaries
should be carried on with due regard to
humnanitarian policies, it is in the public interest
that there be recognition of the fact tha't
persons comamitted to penitentiaries are properly
thus placed under restraint for the purpose of
protection of society from sucb offenders against
the laws of the ooun.try and as a warmdng to
others.
This amendment is seconded by my honourable friend who sits beside me (Hon. Mr.
Donnelly).
The Hon. the 'SPEAKER: The question,
honourable memrbers, is on the amendinent.
Hon. Mr. McME.ANS: I should like to ask
the honourable gentleman whose very brilliant
speech we have .iust heard (Hon. Mr. Tanner)
whether the adoption of the standard pro.posed
in bis amendanent, might not be an inducement to other people in the country to be
sent to the penitentiary.
Some Hon. SENATORIS: Oh, oh.

247

Hon. Mir LEWIS: I intended to make some
remarks upon the main motion, not knowing
that an amendment would be moved. Perhaps some one else desires to speak. If notThe Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
senator might go on.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: Honourable members,
I have been criticized for bringing into this
House a letter which appeared in a Nova
Scotia paper, said to have been written by an
ex-.convict, as though I were endeavouring to
spread that piece of news aiýl over this country. If I were intending to make a sensation
of the matter I certainly would not bring it
into the calm and serene atmosphore of this
Ohamber, whose proceedings, as we all know,
receive very little attention in the press. In
this case it woul be quite unnecesgary for
me even to attempt to secure publicity for
that letter, because it lias been widely published not only in the paper in Nova Scotia,
but in papers throughout Ontario. .My idea
was not to try to spread knowledge from this
Senate to the public, but to endeavour to
bring this matter of public interest into what
lias been desori.bed as a quasi-judicial body,
and to the notice of the Depa.rtment of Justice, which is represented, in this House by the
leader on the othez side.
That was the course which I pursued about
four or five months ago when an immense
amount of matter wvas published in the
Toronto papers.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Particularly the Star.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: Particularly the Star.
It does not matter what paper it was, except
that the Star bas a very large circulation, and
therefore would create a great deal of public
interest. At that time, without quoting any
letters, I brought the matter in a general way
befowe the Government, and invited it to make
a statement, and to hold a public inquiry.
But I could get no satisfaction in that way.
Nothing bas been done since in regard to the
matter, except for the report on the Kingston
Penitentiary Distu-rbances, whiuh, th-ougli quite
proper and right it its way, deais on-ly with
the defence of the institution against the convicts. But if the publie are now in a prejudiced state of mmnd and feel that something
is wronig with the penitentiaries, the blame
restes, flot upon nie, but upon the obstinate
and arrogant attitude of the Dominion Goverument in refusing to make any reply or any
explanation except to say, "This is none of
your business."
Riglit Hon. Mr. M'EIGHEN: Explanation
of what?

Hon. Mr. LEWIS: 0f what was going on.

24S

SEýNATE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What is the
report but an explanation?
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: It is only partial.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: It is a cernp]ete explanation.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: It does not enter into
the complaints of the eonvicts at ail. Should
they nlot be answered?
Hon. Mr. POPE: You are a joke.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: What do you say about
a loke?
Hon. Mr. POPE: Yes, you are a joke.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: Well, you are a nuisance
in the House.
Now I comne to the criticism made by the
leader of this Huse of my motion that
guards should be men wbo have a zeal for
prison reform, men whose business should be
largcly that of correcting and teaching. I
made the remark, of course, that they should
be men physically able to cope with prisoners,

and I quite understand that they sbould be
men having certain police training. The idea
that a guarci should have any thougbt cf
kindness or of teaching or correcting a
prisoner was treated by the leader on the
other side with the utmost derision. It does
not seem te me to be se absurd to, suppose
that there are such things in the world as
muscular Christians, or that kindness of heart
should he compatible with 9trength of body
antI uind and will. But in the end 1 did
not need to answer the rigbt honourable
gentleman. H1e answered hirriself. He gave
a most touching account cf :L warden whom
he knew particularly well, and cf whomn he
said:
1 know that many a man mho bias gene eut
from uinder h's charge has hIe tsed him. for the
influence he exercised.
Well, if you can give -ne an institution
eut cf which mec will coýme blessing the
wardens and the guards for the influence they
have exercised, 1 am sure I shaîl be quite
satisfied. In my mest idealistie moment I
do net expeet such a resuit as that.
Then the right honourable gentleman cast
a great deal of derision upon my idea that
in cases where corporal punishment was te
be inflieted there should be an inquiry by an
outside person, independent of the authorities
cf the institution. H1e seemed to think it
a mest amazing thing that a ceunty judge
sheould try such a case, with the warden on
onc sile and the prisonerr on the etiher, the
two in a position cf equalit.y.
Whait an
amazing thingt Have any cf you gentlemen
Hon. Mr. LEWIS,

ever heard ef such a thing? Go inte any
criminal court and you will find the prisoner
at the bar on termas cf perfect equality, in

regard te procedure, with bis Majesty the
KingHen. Mr. MeMEANS: Oh, yes.
bon. Mr. LEWIS: -and having the same
right to eall witnesses, produce evidence,
cross-examine witnesses, make objections, and

charge the jury.
bon. Mr. MeMEANS: Oh, yes.
bon. Mr. LEWIS: What is the difference?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: He bas always got
that right.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: That is what I say.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: The prisener has
always got that right.
Hen. Mr. LEWIS: What is the difference?
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: A considerable difference. He bas net been sentenced.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: This is a new charge.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: You must love those
convicts.

Hon. Mr. LEWIS: I (le
not love them.

I

amn asking for justice.

lion. Mr. GRIESBACH: Does not, the honcurable gentleman distinguish hetween a
prisoner charged with an offence against the
law and a prisoer who has violated a regulation of the institution in which he is confined? A prisoner who violates the law, even
1in a penitentiary, is tried by a judge-as
some of these mon are bngtried now; but
a prisoner wvho is guilty of a violation of the
regulations of such an institution is in a very
different poisition. Do I un.derstand that the
honourable gentleman is asking that a prisoner
who viola-9tes the regulations of an institution
s-hould be tried by a judge?

Hon. Mr. LEWIS:

Jn cases cf extreme

punishment, net bread and water, as suggested by ýthe right honourable gentleman

(Righ-t Hon. Mr. Meiglicn). I do net include
anything but thýe most extDeme punishment.
Rig-ht Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Why should

not a prisoner about te, be hainged have a

Hon. Mr. LEWIS: I do net pyrofess te be

FEBRUARY 16, 1933
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: You cannot
answer yourself then.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: The righ't honourable
gentleman apparently thought I would writhe
under the accusaition that I was the mouthpiece of the convicts. Surely the riglit honourable gentleman has f orgotten Vhat some
of the ornements of bis owu professionD'Alton McCarthy and B. B. Osier, for instance-have been the mmithpieces of murderers anid persons aocusW of murder and
other heinous crimes. Sir (Mar1es Fitzpatrick,
who was Ministar of Justiie of this country,
and afterwards Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court-and who, I am fiappy to beliave, is
stili alive-was counsel or mouîthpiece for
Louis Riel, who was hangad for trea-son. A
long tirne ego a famous &lvocate, Erskine,
was counsel for Thomas Paine, on trial for
sedition in connectioin wit3h "The Riglits of
Man," a book i~n answer to, Burke's "Reflectiens on tjhe French Revolution." Erakine
was v'ery mnuai reviled by the flunkies of that
time for taking that position. He made this
very memorable deelaration, with which, 1
fancy, moet Iawyers agree:
I will forever, at ail hazards, assert the
dignity, indepandence and intagrity of the
English Bar, without which impartial justicethe most valuable part of the English conetitution-can have no extistence. From the
moment that any advocate can be permitted
to say that he will or iwilI nlot stand between
the Crown and the subjact arraigned in the
court where he dai.ly sits te practise, from that
momeont the liberties of England are at an end.
If the advocate refuses to defend, from what
ha may think of the charge or of the defence,
he assumes the character of the judge; nay,
he assumats it before the hour of judgment; and,
in pr(,portion to his r.ank and reputation pots
the hayifuceoperhaps,
a mistaken
opinion into the scale against the accused, in
whose f-ivcoeir the benevolent principle' of
Englili law mnakes ail presumptions, and commands the very judge to be bis counsel.
I am very deeply indebted to the leader of
the Government for placing so unworthy a
person as myseif in such distinguished company.

Hon. Mr. G'RIESBACH: Honourable gentlemen, I distinguish hetween the advocate of
a kn'own, visible murderer and the person
who speaks for those who, so far as anyone
knows, May have no corporeal existence at
all.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: There may be a slight
differenca; the principle is the same.
I have to thank the right honourable leader
of the Govarnment also for the advice which
he so plentifully showered upon me, and I
hope ha will not take it ill if I present him ini
return with a littia advice of my own, he

249

haing a comparatively new acquisition to this
Chambeir, possibly not acquainrted with its
tone and temper, as his pradecessors were.
The advice I should like to give is that he
should disabusa hi.s mind of the idea that he
is a sort of censor and sehoolmaster of this
assemhly, entitled to dictate to us as to the
course we are to follow or the sort of speeches
we are to make. I should like him to realize,
as bis courteous and urbanie predecessors did,
that ail the members of this assembly are
assentially equal in status, thougli not in
ability. At ail avenits, I initend to take my
own course and speak my own thoughtis without asking the permission of the. right
hionourable gentleman or anybody eise.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honou-rable membes, when. the honouraible gentleman (Hon. Mr. Lewis) rose in suxpport od this
motion, comae days ago, I made reply with
some earnestness, and certaily with more
emphasis than I ordinarily amploy in this
assernbly or anywhere else. My reason was
that I feit that in this country, for many
month.--yes, years--there lias been an al
too prevalent habit of rushîng indiscriminately
and thoughtlessly, in ail matters, reasonable
and unreasonabla, to the sîde of the lawbreakers and of those who, particularly in
these timas, are suffering oppression and distracs; rushing to their side, to the discomfiture of those responsible for the maintenance
of la'w and order, and thus making difficult,
and ever more difflcult, the preservation of
those institutions upon which rests the liberty
of this country, as of the world.
Hon. Mr. KING: I do not like to interrupt, but I understood a moment ago that
tihe honourable the mover of the resolution
(Hon. Mr. Lewis) was closing the debate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is an
amendment.
Hon. Mr. KING: I thouglit that ha waited
for speakers to the amendmant, and then
proceedad on the understanding that thera
wouid ha no furthar debate.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The prasent discussion is -on the amendinent. When the
amendment is disposed of, the honourable
senator can close the debata on the main
motion.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: i faît that
the honourable membar had made himself
a party to that habit, and that perhaps the

the interest of what is surely dearer to us

certain kind of acclaim, whicb is easily acquired at this time froîn the multitudes in
distress. I arn confirmed in the conviction
that I was right by the remarks made by
the ionourable gentleman to-day. H1e bas
had the benefit-and I arn glad he bas bad
it-of several days of reflection. and preparation. This bas resulted in at least a wellordered and certainly well-expressed staternent
this afternoon, but not, I fear, in bringing bis
min(1 to a clearer or lcss confused state in
regard to the real issue that be was attempting to discuss.
H1e has told us to-day that I derided the
ides thiat guards should be men with a beart,
men of humanitarian principles. I did nothinýg of the kind, and tbe honourable gentleman knows it. Wbat tbe bonoîtrable gentleman argucd was this: that guards rnigbt be
secured who had in their minds tbe prinriples
of the missionary, tibe principles of serviceHon. Mr. LEWIS: Wbere is the difference?

Salvation. Army captain, or of a prea-cher or
a teacher. No guard could be sccured if bis
scclîring were to be governed by the considerations the honouraible meinher bas in mmnd. A
gtîard is not a teacher. If teacbing is to be
done, teachers are ýprovided to do it. 'Ihe duty
of a guard is es.sentially the duty of a, disciplinarian or a policeman, and it is for 'that
du-ty be is emjployed. The honourable member
condiîcted bis entire complaint on the iprinciple
that those in cbarge of our penitentiaries are
reailly in the same relationship to the inmates
as a teacher wouldbe to the pupilîs of a Sun.day
school elas; and his intention was to gather
arouind the heads of the inmates a sort of
public sympathy, and a-gainst tbe heads of
those in autbority a public contempt.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: Not at aýl.
Right Hýon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gent4eman attacked the Governiment of
the day and the authorities of tbe pen'tentiaries.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: I did not.
And he
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN:
attacked them 'tbis afternoon. The honourable
Inml)er's mermory is so frigbtfully s4bort that
he sboul-d not trust hirnself to speak. Less
than haif an hour ago be said that the Goveroment had been stuhborn.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: The Goveroment, yes.
But I did not .say the authorities.
Riglit

Hon.

MIr. MEICHEN.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I 'think the
Government are authoritics. I arn as utterly
powerless to remove thse confusion fromn the
honourable member's mind as I arn to prevent
bim from speaking- when he, is out of order.
Tbe practice lias been altiogebher ton prevalent,
particulaî'ly in a section of the preq-I arn
glad to say, in only a smaîl section-of
seeking to bring upon the beads of ail wbo
bave tbe responsibiility of maintaining law and
order to-day tbe criticisma and -disapproval of
tbe country at large, and to amouse publie
synmpatby in favour of tbose woho are violators
of law and order. And I say again that as
part of that camapaign. thbe honourable gentleman made bis .9peecb a coupyle of days ago andi
bas sought to supplement it tbis afternoon.
Tbere is no thought at ail of removing
humanitarian sentiments from the code of
tbose who administer penal institutions, but
there is a determination against making bumanitarjan sentiments and treatment tbe purpose of such institutions wben tbeir real purposes are discipline, punishinent and warning
to offenders tbrougbout this Dominion. The
honourable gentleman says there is nothing
at ail wvrong about giving the prisoner a bearing before a county court juilge when it is
thought nccessarv at a penitentiary tbat tbe
paddlŽ. or any other kind of serious punishHo says that the
ment, be administered.
prisoner has just as much riglit to such a bearing as a man charged with a crime bas to a
proper trial.
Well, tbere is tbis difference,
tbhat the man in the penitentiary bas been
convicted of a crime nnd bas been sent there
to be subjeet to the laWS, Tegula,-tions and discipline, of the institution. Tbat is the punishment to m-bich be bas been sentenced. If
while serving bis sentence he is to be given a
right to appeaýl against it in the manner suggested by tbe honourable gentleman, where
in the world is punishment to begin and wbere
is it to end? To place on one side the warden,
wbo is responsible for maintaining the code
of regulations and discipline, and on the other
sidi' the man wbu is in bis cbarge, and tu ask
a judge to decide between tbem, wouki mean
onlv one thing-the complete, final and irretrievable ovcrtbrow of discipline in ail our
penal institutions. Sucb a tbing would be
impossible, and surely ougbt to bc, seen by
intelligent men to be impossible.
The honouýrable membor referred to tbe
right of counsel to defend persons w~ho appear
before the courts, charged with the commission of crimes. It was not necessary for him
to read tbe words of an English lawyer on
tbat point. But ho knows that bis position is
not, comparable to tbat of a lawyer defending
a prisoner in court. Tbe honourable gentle-

FEBRUARY 16, 1933
man laid before us the complaints of some
person whose identity is flot known, who wrote
an anonymous article concerning matters that
hie probably knew nothing about, anid who
may never have been a convict. As to the
kniowledge and experience of the writer the
honourable menmber has flot a tittie of
evidence, yet he has broadcast the writer's
complainta throughout this country and now
he wants to occupy the heroio position of
defender of -the downtrodden and the abused.
Does the honourable gentleman think hie was
justified in doing that when hie did fot know
the author of the complaints?
Hon. Mr. LEWILS: Certainly.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Again a confusion of mind that no efforts of mine will
ever be able to dispel.
Hon. Mr. POPE: He is a juke.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Conduet of
that sort wi.ll nlot entitÀle him to occupy that
position nor to bring ridicule upon the heads
of men who have posts of great respongibility
and are entitled ýto our support.
The honourable -gentleman tries to leave
the inference that there has been officiai stubbornese, and information bas been refused,
and that that is why hie is attacking the Govemment. He suggests that if the authorities
would but give information hie 'would be
thoroughly satisfied, yet only two days ago
hie stood up in this House and admitted hie
had neyer taken the trouble. to get information that hie could have got 'had hie so desired.
The regulations of the penitentiaries have aiways been available to him and every other
citizen; there is no secrecy about them. An
the penitentiaries themseives have been open
to him for inspection ever since hie has been
a inember of this House. So his complaint
of inability to, get information is utterly unjustified.
He asks me flot to, assume the role of
dictator. Honourable gentlemen can imagine
how I writhe under the imiplication. The
idea of any man venturing to think himseif
a dictator in the presence of bis equals and
before an honourable assembly of Paxrliament I
But I hope that my unwillingness to pretend
to be, and my incapacity to act as, a dictator,
will neyer prevent me from stating my own
views, even though they confliet viclently and
diametrically with those of an honourable
member, nor from seeking to describe in
juistifiable words conduet thst is incompatible
with the best interests of law and order,
especially in a time of crisis such as this.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Tanner ws
agreed to.
The motion, as amended, was agreed to.

MIGRATORY BIRDS CONVENTION BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 19, an Act to amend
the Migratory Birds Convention Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the Migratory Birds Convention Act was passed in
1917 to ratify a convention entered into by
this country with the United States for the
protection of migratory birds. One termi of
the ratifying statute was to the effeet that
the regulations thereunder should be published
in 'thc Statutes. This publication is now
deemed to be too expensive and to involve
more delay tihan its value would .iustify.
Publication of the reguilatio>ns is made not only
in tihe Canada Gazette, but also by posters
displayed in our post offices and other public
places and by general distribution on the part
of the Department of the Interior. I do not
think that the publicity given to the regulations would be very much increased by their
inclusion arr.ong the Statutes.
The Bill also makes aIl members of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police ex officio
game officers. It appears that the Maritime
Provinces neyer took upon themselves the
onus of enforcing the Act, although, I believe,
the other provinces did. To overcome this
omission and at the samne time to save some
expense, the police work in connection with
the enforcement of the Act was transferred in
1932 to the Royal Ganadian Mounted Police,
which, as every honourable member kinows,
operates also in those provinces. If the
members of that force were not made ex
officio game officoers, as they are by tihis Bill,
the mnembers would have to be appoinited to
office individually, and each one of them
womild hrwve ta take the oaith of office. The
thîrd section of the Bill makes the oath taken
by a mounted policeman when hie joins the
force applicable to his duties as such game
officer.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN moved the
third reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bull was

bridges; precautions at railway orossings;
precautions at highway crossings and in
thickly peopled places; the obstruction of

or wages?
1 realize, honourable members, that this is
a rather large order. I do flot expect the
right honourable leader of the House, after
looking at these questions, to answer themn
off-hand, but I arn submitting them in this
way s0 that hie may have an opportunity
to consider themn and may answer them later,
possibly at the next sitting of the House.
Right Hon. Mr. MEI.GHEN: Honourable
members, the order is indeed large. The
thought occurred to me, as t.he questions
were being read, that it would 'have been
more appropriate to place them before me
when the Bill was in eommittee. However,
it is certainly my desire to answer them as
best I can. Speaking off-hand, I should feel
fairly confident in answering them one by
one now, but perhaps my self-confidence
might be misplaeed and it might indicate
better judgment to give the subject thought
until to-morrow. Consequently, the desire of
the Government will be, not to move that
the Committee report the Bill to-night, but
rather to -have the Committee report progress,
and to-morrow I shall endeavour to gîve the
best answers that 1 can. We can proceed
with the Bill now.
On proposed section 2-inconsieeni provisions:
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Members
of the committee will recaîl that although
the Bill was to be reported, the statement
was made on behaîf of the sponsor of the
measure that an endeavour would be made to
meet the desire of counsel for the Canadian
Pacifie Railway in respect of definitions.
There wau some difference betwecn counsel
for that company and the Railway Department and myselýf as to how "National Company" and particularly "Pacifie Company"
shiould be defined. A new definition has been
arrived at, and it is such that it entails an
amendment to clause 2, although the definitions themnselves are flot in that clause. I
now beg to move:
That the follorwing be added as subsection 2
to section 2:
(2) Parte II and III of this Act ehall not
aply to (a) any mainufacturing, land, mining
or oeean marine company, undertaking, prop.
erty, work or service;
(b) any transportation, communication or
hotel Pervice whioh ie wi4,bin another legisiative
competence thon thiat of Canada or a province

253

of Canada or which, as between National
Railways and Pacific Railways, is not coinpetitilve.

The CHAIRMAN: Shall the amendment
be adopted?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I understand
that it is not the intention to proceed very
far with t.he Bill to-night; that the chief
object is to get these amendments on record
so that they will be in our hands to-morrow
when we are considering the measure in its
entirety.
Right lion. Mr. MEIGREN: I think that
suggestion is good. I will now move that we
prooeed to thie ncxt amendment, without asking that the amendment I moved be carried.
The proposed amendment stands.
On proposed section 3, paragraph e"National Railways":
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I beg to
move that paragraph e of clause 3, that is,
the definition of "National Railways,"' be
deleted and the following be substituted
therefor:
(e) "National R-ailwiays" means the National
Comnpany, as owner, operator, manager and
otherwise, and its tranaportation, communication and hotel systern, which system shaîl be
<leemed to oomprise aIl conipaniee which are
elements of the Canadian National Rsailways as
defined in the National Act, the respective
undertakings of sueh companies, the National
Comnpany in its oapacity as owner,

operator, in whole or in part, of
a railwys
including Canadian Gover.nment railways, or o
any land, water or air transportation or communication services or hotel services, and the
said railways and services, their works and
property. and aIl such works and property as
are ancilary.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I move that
we proceed to the consideration of the next
amendment.
The proposed amendment stands.
On proposed section 3, Panagraph g"Pacifie Rtailways":
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I move:
Thait paragraph g of clause 3 be deleted and
tbe following substituted therefor:
(g> '"Pacific Railwýays" means the Pacifie
Comnpany as owner, operator, manager and

SENATE

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

Is that

It is the
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
result of an attempt to bring the minds of
the two parties together, and, if not exactly
in unison, they are very close.
The proposed amendment stands.
On proposed section 4, subsection
Chairman; to devote all his time:

2-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I move:
That at the end of subsection 2 of section 4
the words "the National Company or a company within the undertaking" be deleted and
the following words substituted therefor: "a
eompany which is comprised in National Railways."
This complies with the definition.
The proposed amendment stands.
On proposed section 17,
limitations upon jurisdiction:

subsection

4-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I move:
That subsection 4 of section 17 be deleted
and the following substituted therefor:
(4) No Tribunal shall have power or jurisdiction to settle, determine or order that any
measure, plan or arrangement should or shall
consist of or include any agreement for the
construction of extensions and *additions to
existing railway lines, terminals or facilities
except in such minor matters as connections to
give access to exieting lines. terminals or facilities which, as the resut of the settlement or
determination of any dispute by any Tribunal
or otherwise, are used or are intended te be
usQd in common.

This amendment does not vary at all the
manifest intent of the measure, but it makes
the wording of the restriction on the power
of a Tribunal comply with the better language
later adopted by the committee in various
clauses.
This particular
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
subsection has to do with limitations upon
jurisdiction. If on further consideration the
right honourable leader should find that the
Bill affects some of the provisions in the
Railway Act or in other Acts relating to
safety, social or humane regulations, as set
out in the list that I have just read to the
Committee and handed to him, I would suggest that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal
might be limited right here in language somewhat like this:
Nor shall any Tribunal have the right to set
aside or abridge any Act which as a safety.
social or humane measure protects the rights of
the public or of the employees.
This is the only clause in the Bill where
limitations upon jurisdiction are indicated,
and it seems to me that this would be the
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

proper place to guard against the taking
away of the authority of the Railway Commission in relation to those rights to which
I have referred.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This would
be the proper place, and if on consideration
of the questions asked it appears to be the
part of wisdom to add any further restriction, I am not at all averse to an amendment
along the lines suggested. Indeed I will try
to draft one myself.
The proposed amendment of Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen stands.
On proposed section 18, subsection
Tribunal may be reconvened:

5-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This is the
last amendment. I move:
That subseetion 5 of section 18 be deleted and
the following substituted therefor:
(5) The Chief Commissioner may of his own
motion or at the request of the National Company or the Pacific Company or both, reconvene
any Tribunal to settle or determine any dispute
which relates to the conditions, interpretation
or enforcement of any order made by that
particuîlar Tribunal, or to enforce the jurisdiction of. or any order of, such Tribunal pursuant
to section twenty-two of this Act, and such
reconvened Tribunal shall have power and
jurisdiction te settle or determine in the
premises.
Again let me say that this makes absolutely no variation from the manifest intent;
it is merely considered to be a better wording.
This closes the amendments that I have to
offer.
The proposed amendment stands.
Shall the Committee
The CHAIRMAN:
rise, report progress, and ask leave to sit
again?
Honourable gentleHon. R. H. POPE:
men, 1 desire to express my opinion with
regard to the Bill which is now before us for
consideration, and which is based upon the
Report of the Royal Commission appointed
to inquire into Railways and Transportation
in Canada.
First, permit me to say that there is no
such thing as friendly competition existing
between the Canadian National Railways and
the Canadian Pacific Railway. Each organization is out for itself, and ever will be.
Second, in my opinion we had no right to
include the Canadian Pacifie Railway, a
privately owned road, within the scope of
the inquiry assigned to the Royal Commission. So far as the settlement of freight rates
and all that sort of thing is concerned, we
have the Board of Railway Commissioners,
which is still functioning. I think that in the

FEBRUARY 21, 1933
opinion of every member of the Senate I
arn right when I say that in the financial
obligations connected with the operation of
the Canadian National Railways aTone we
have a quite sufficient burden. When I pick
up this report and see the figure of $2,5W6,665.89, 1 think that is enough, and we should
flot proceed, as we have done in the past, to
incre.gse the indebte.dness of Canada and
impose upon the taxpayers of the country a
stili heavier burden. Someone bas spoken of
"the ten million taxpayers of Canada." Are
there ten million taxpayes.s in this country?
I doubt very much that there are tbree
million.
I have listened to bonourable gentlemen in
this House criticizing the use of trucks, automobiles and flying machines. Permit me to
say that we are not going to do away with
trucks, or automobiles, or fiying machines,
and that the railroads of the future will have
to meet the competition of the future in
ail its various forms. As competition. is Voday, so will it continue to be in the future;
perbaps in some directions it will be intensified.
So far as trucks are concerned, I know of
notbing more serviceable to the rural parts of
the country. Tbey deliver tbe farmer's goods
right at his door, at no expense beyond the
ordinary freight charges. He does flot have
Vo go to, the railway station to get bis goods,
nor does be have to pay someone else Vo bring
them to, him. I live in a section of the country in whicb, as I said the other day, flot a
railroad bas been constructed in sixty years.
For miles on eacb aide of the existing railroad there are the wonderful lands and the
forests and mountains of the Eastern Townships. Many of tbe villages in that region are
twenty or twenVty-five miles away from the
railroad. Are we to be told that we are noV
to have trucks? It bas been said that unless
the roads have a 'bard surface tbe trucks
tear tbem to pieces. Our roads are ail gravel
roacl, and I shall be pleased to take any of
you over them-on condition that you remain
perfectly sober-and if you do flot say afterwards, "Mr. Pope, we have neyer ridden
over better -roads in our lives," I shall be
greatly disappointed. Think of the amount
of money that is paid by the trucks in
gasoline taxes, of the sums spent on their
maintenance and repair in the garages of the
country, and of tbe employment that is
thereby afforded to many w-bo otberwise migbt
be unemployed.
In my humble opinion we should ail unite
in an effort to discover somne way of lightening, so far as possible, the burden i*mposed
upon the taxpayers of Canada by reaison of
the loss sustained in the operation of the

255

Canadian National System. Let me say that
I do not wish to find fault with the present
management, for Vo eriticize the past so far
as management is concerned. Criticismn does
not pay the bills nor lighten the national
burden. We have to, give serious thought Vo,
the adoption of some systean, or @uome improvement in the preeent system, whereby
our burden will be lightened. We cannot
expeet to be entirely relieved of the presenit
situation at one stroke; but any proposai that
will resuit in cutting tbe buirden in two at a
comparatively early date should receive
serious and immediate consideration.
Up Vo the present time the only railway that
hm. been able to pay its way in every respect
bas heen the Canadian Pacifie, wh.iob is
co-operativ-ely owned. It would a.ppeair, however, thait during the period of prosperity
that road went a bit wild in the building of
lines bore, there and everywhere, in competition witb the Canadian National. Many of
those lines could be taken up, or merged into
those of oe or >ther of thbe oompaînes of the
future.
The iuggeetion hias been made that the
entîre Canadian National System should be
given to the C.P.U. I do flot know that the
C.P.U. wants that. Nevertheiess, some newspapers and somne people have been making the
suggestion. I do not know whetber it was
made before the cornmittee of the Senate or
flot. I was not present at many of the sittings.
IV took so long Vo say very little tbat I got
out. Time spent in talk is wasted when
nothing -results.
Let us review the history of our railroads
and see how it cornes about thait we have the
Canadian National Railways on our hands.
We bad at first only one transcontinental railway, namely the Canadian Pacific, which bad
a connection with Halifax over the Intercolonial. The Conservative Party, when in
power, encouraged the construction of the
Canadian Pacific Railway in spite of Liberal
opposition. The word "mono>poly" was applied to the railway company, especially in
the Western Provinces, and became the political war-cry of the Liberals.
Wben, in 1896, the Liberal Party came into
power, there were, spart from this transcontinental railway, local lines scattered liere and
there in different parts of the country. Among
the most important of these was the Inter-.
colonial, which st that time was running fromn
the Maritime Provinces Vo Montreai. ]t was
part and parcel of -the Conîede"'ton pact, and
was Vo provide a means of tiransporfiing goods
from the Maritime Provinces to, the centre
of Canada at the lowest rates. I stand here
to-day to contend thýat 'that ra.ilroad should
be operated by a commission, or by the Gov-

SENATE

256

erniment, for the purpose of developing the
Maritimes. 1 do flot wish to flatter ainybody,
but 1 know of no part of Canada that has
given te P-arliament and to the public and
professional life of this country more mcn
worthy to maintain the standard of Canadian
citizenship than have the Maritime Provinces.
The old Grand Trunk, with its American connections, was man.aged by a directorate in
London, and for ycars we got about as much
out of it as we gained from the Canadian
National When for eight or fine years it was
under the management of a Liberal Cabinet.
The resuits in both ca-ses were the samne-less,
wrack and ruin. Then we come to Mackenzie
& Mann, who had sought as-sistance in Manitoba and the West, as; well as some ether
places, in order to build a transcontinental
railway. The Liberal Party, with Sir Wilfrid
Laurier at its head, was in power, and the
Grand Trunk, which found it-self sinking financially, and perishing, rapped at the door of
Parliament and asked the Government te provide it with connections across Canada, to the
Pacifie. Someene said, 'Go and make your
arrangements with the Canadian Northcrn and
we will hýelp you with the links." But that
was not donc.
Then politica entered into the ques'tion, and
there were dcmands for a railroad frein Winnipeg te the city of Quebec. The people of
the M1aritimes said, "Givc us a lino to Moneton." That line ivas no more part and p'areel
of a transcontinental systein of transportation
than the littie rivera in the valley in which I
live are part of the St. L.awrence. But that
line had to, be built: ýthe Maritimes demnand-cd
it in returil for their support of Quebec. On
the train on one occasion. when rctirrning after
a holiday on the lat of Julv, 1 met seme
members from. the Maritimes. They nished
up to me and said, "You must support us."
"Why, you are
'What am I te support?"
going to support a line from Quebec to Moncton." I said: "Am I? I thouglit yon had the

I
Quebec and the people in other places."
said: "Why don't yeu conneet at St. John?
That is a shorter route, and it provides communication with a seaport any-way. Gentlemen, I cannot agree with you."
Politios ente<red into the buildiing of ail sucli
roadýs, and they had to be built, and I 110 more
regard them as part andl paroel of the transportation system of Canada than I do the
Hudson Bay railroad. Therefore I do not take
thom mnto con.sideration. in the proposal tha-t
I amn about to inake.
Hon. Mr. POPE.

But our railîroadis wilil have to be run somehow, and I would not be standing here t'o-night
if 1 did not know that men and money could
be fouind for the pyurpose of takîng over a -large
portion of the railways and having themn
operatcd for the henefit of Canada by an
in-del).ondent ecorporati-on like the Caniaaian
Pacific.
There nover wag a peried. in the histery of
the wGrld when big mnoney wao so idle as it
is to-day. Do you. not think that in the
Lrnited Statx-s there are men who, with aUl the
troubles and anxieties they have had, would
be delighted to put a few iniillions into a
ivelil orgýanizeal transportation systema in this
country? There is no question or doubt about
it. You can go to England too, or to Montreai,
and flnd mon-ey for this purpose. I have had
thiA proýposal wo>rked out by financial men of
ability. I am n ot at lihurty te use their names
here. The only stipulation they make is that
the Cov-ernmnent of the day should approach
them. They feel, because of the uncertainty
in China, let us say, that they -cannût engage

SENATE

The principle of the measure has been fully
approved by Mr. Finlayson, and the Bill is
of course endorsed by the companies which
hold these seourities and wish to acquire
more of them. The people who contribute
freely to the support of the institutions
are also hopeful that the law will be
changed, and so is the Government of
Quebec; and obviously the change would be
to the advantage of the institutions themselves, for it would give them a wider market
for their securities. Above all, those who require and receive help from the institutionsand at present they form a large percentage
of our population-will be greatly benefited by
the passage of this measure.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, ;the Bill has been very clearly explained by the mover of the motion (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien), but as it affects a Governmentsponsored measure which was initiated in this
House last session and was given very carefuil
thought by our Committee on Banking and
Commerce, perhaps I shouild say a few words
before the motion is put. The honourable
gentleman has made it very plain thaIt the
intent of the Insurance Act is to authorize the
Superintendent of Insurance to permit insurance companies, whose liabi'lities fal due at
far distant dates, to invest their funds onily in
securities of a very high character, which will
make for the soivency of the companies and
the saifecuarding of their policyholders. Included in such securities are Governmentissued and Government-guaranteed bonds and
certain municipal bonds. The provisions,
however, are not wide enough te inelude the
securities referred to in the Bill, namely bonds
and debentures issued by certain charitable,
educational and philanthropie institutions in
the Province of Quebec, which, though not
direetdy guaranteed by the Government of that
province, have provision made for their redemption, both as to principal and interest, by
the annuail allotment of certain funds. This
Bill will make such securities eligible for insurance companies; not eligible in the absolute
sense alone, but eligible in the classification
whieh the insurance companies make up for
presentation to the public to show the assets
that are set against their liabilities.
I certainly have no objection at al to the
second reading of the Bill, and am glad the
honourable gentdeman has brought it in. I
think it wihi be necessary, though, for the
House to consider this session certain further
amendmentstoat least one and possibly two of
the Insurance Acts that were passed last year.
It would seecm to me that after the Bill does
go to committee it might remain there until
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

the other Bill ailso gets there; or possibly we
may be able te arrange that if we pass this
measure here it may be incorporated in any
otlher which the Government submits by way
of amendment to the Acts passed last session.
Right Hon. G. P. GRAHAM: Honourable
members, I have ne objection to the second
reading of the Bill, provided it is going to the
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Legislation by the Federal Parliament on
insurance matters has to be considered very
carefully, and even then, perhaps it will not
be altogether water-tight. Insurance companies are now having experiences that might
almost indicate Parliament had not been careful enough in restricting the classes of securities in which these companies may legally
invest. However, if the Bill is going to the
Committee on Banking and Commerce, this
and other matters can be discussed there, and
I think that perhaps good may come out of
the measure.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Honourable members, I think that the Bill should go to the
Committee on Banking and Commerce, for,
no doubt, there will be a number of people
who will want to express their views and
perhaps suggest amendments. Possibly Mr.
Finlayson would like te make some suggestions. Therefore I intend to move that the
Bill be referred to that Committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

CANADIAN NATIONAL-CANADIAN
PACIFIC BILL
PROPOSED AMENDMENTS CONSIDERED IN
COMMITTEE AND REPORTED

The Senate agaîn went into Committee on
the proposed amendments to Bill A, an Act
respecting the Canadian National Railways
and to provide for co-operation with the
Canadian Pacifie Railway System, and for
other purposes.-Right Hon. Mr. Meighen.
Hou. Mr. Beaubien in the Chair.
On proposed section 2-Bis Mai esty bound;
inconsistent provisions:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think, Mr.
Chairman, you would be justified in assuming
each amendmient as proposed by the Standing
Committee to be moved by myseif. Then as
te the additional amendments, of which I
gave notice yesterday, I shall move each one
in turn as we reach the section to which it
relates.
I move:
That the following be added as subsection 2
to section 2:
(2) Parts Il and III of this Act shahl not
apply to (a) any- manufac'turing, land, mining
or ocean marine company, undertaking, prop.
erty, work or service;
(b any trýanspo>rtation, comnmunication or
hotel service whjch is withjn another ].egislative
competence thýan that of Canada or a province
of Canada or whýich, as between National
Railways and Pacifie Railways, is flot coinpetitive.
The CHAIRMAN:
Shahl the section as
amended carry?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Might I have an
answer to the memorandum which I handed
to the right honourable leader of the Bouse
yesterday?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Possibly I
should -have ventured an answer at the opening of the Committee.
The honourable
senator înquired whet-her by reason cf the
general clause previding that this Act shall
be held to prevail in case cf inconsistency
therewith cf any provisions cf any previcus
Act, certain provisions recited in hie questions
are thereby annulled or in any way interfered
with. The Bouse wil agree with me when I
make this general statement: it is the practice
53721-17J

cf the courts and a principle cf British
jurisprudence that ail statutes must, te the
utmost extent possible, be made reconcilable
the one with the other. That is te say,
if a statute can be given either a reasonable
interpretation which makes it reconcilable
with another statute, or an interpretation
equaly reasonable, but net reconcilable with
the other statute, then the first interpretation
is held to prevail. In a word, the courts
seek te give such interpretations as will produce ne inconsîstencies. Another principle is
that where this is found te be impossible and
a clause cf a statute passed, say, this year
can be given ne reasonable interpretation
which would make it consistent with a clause
in a statute passed in a previcus year, then
the later word cf Parliament prevails ever
the earlier word.
In this Bihl the doctrine which I have
sought te define is net enly relied upon, but
it is emphasized by a special provision, which.
says that where there is inconsistency this Act
shail prevail. Had the special clause net been
included, the effeet would have been, in my
judgment, exactly the same, because of the
principle that I have stated.
At this point I desire te emphasize that
the insertion cf this special provision-which
is merely a re-statement cf an already recognîzed principle-will by ne means entail this
result, that the courts will net seek te reconcile any inconsistency just as earnestly as if
this clause were net here. If the reconcihiatien can be made by a reasonable inte-rpretatien, they will give that interpretation.
Be much by way cf introduction. Peqrhaps
it is well alse te say that provisions are net
incensîstent merely because they seemi te
express a different resuît, having in mmnd
different objectives. One may be dealing
with one purpese, another with another purpose, and in that event, in ail likelihood, the
courts will hold there is ne incensistency at
aIl.
'In the light of what I have said, perhaps the
answer which I shaîl give te ahl the questions
will he understandaule. The answer te each.
and ail is no, save that something furtber,
or perhaps semnething olightIly différent, is
required, because tue one of the questions that
answer is net strictly applicable. The one te
which it is net strictly applicable is paragraph
b cf 2. Question 2 as9ks:
Does the Canadian National-Canadian Pacifie
Act. 1932, supersede and prevail over the
Railway Act and in particular the following
provisions:
(a) Sections 32 te 44, inclusive, which relate
to the general jurisdiction and powers cf the

Board?

260

SENATE

The answer no applies to that part of the
question, but as to the next question(b) Section 179, which relates to the closing
or abandonment of railway stations or divisional points and/or other unauthorized changes,
witbhout leave of the Board? Exanple: In the
event of the Naitional Company and Pacific
Company, in the interest of economy, agreeing
to close or abandon a divisional point without
recourse to the Arbitral Tribunal, would it be
necessary for them to get permission froi the
Board of Railway Commissioners before doing
so, or would Bill A govern?
-the
proper answer would be this: Should
they agree to certain plans, arrangements, or
neasures involving what is here recited, without having recourse to the tribunal at all, then,
if before the passing of this Bill it would have
been necesary for them, in order to have
effect given to their agreement, to go to the
Board of Railway Commissioners, it will still
be necessary for them to do so. They are
not relieved in any way. I do not need to
answer as to what the result would be if they
did go before the Arbitral Tribunal in case of
a dispute, because the Bill itself is specific
on that point. The dispute goes before the
tribunal, the Chaimman of which is the Chairman of the Board of Railway Commissioners,
and his approval is in effect the approval of
the Board of Railway Commissioners, and
becomes so by virtue of this Act. So the concise answer in both cases is that where approv 1 was necessary before, it is necessary
still.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask a further
question? The right honourable gentleman
says no to all this. Would he deal with the
first question, for instance, as to the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act? The whole
purpose of Bill A is economy in the operation
of the railways; eoonomy by agreement, if
possible, between the representatives of both
railways, without their going to the Arbitral
Tribunal. Now, if the operating officers of
those two railways agree that as of a certain
date the wage rate of all employees shal be
fifty per cent less than now, will that agreement entirely obviate the necessity of going
through the ordinary procedure under the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act?
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: Not at all.
Most emphatically, no.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: All right.
The CHAIRMAN: As the Standing Committee's report recommends many amendments, it would perhaps be preferable to proceed section by section. Shall the amended
section 2, with the further amendment proposed by the right honourable leader of the
House, be agreed to? The proposed addition
to section 2 reads as follows:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

(2) Parts Il and III of this Act shall not
apply to
(a) any manufacturing, land. mining or ocean
marine. company, undertaking, property, work
or service:
(b) any transportation, communication or
hotel service whbich is within another legislative
competence tihan that of Canada or a province
of Canada or which, as between National
Railways and Pacific Railways, is not coinpetitive.
Shall this new section, as amended, carry?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I crave the
indulgence of the House to ask the right
honourable leader of the Government another
question? Paragraph a, put in by the Railway
Committee of the Senate, provides that
that part of section 179 of the Railway Act
which relates to the closing or abandonment
of railway stations or divisional points remains
But there is another part of
in effect.
section 179 involved, and that is the securing
of the consent of the Railway Commission
befo.re a lerninal or divisional point or station
is closed. I think the right honourable leader
referred to that a moment ago, but I should
like him, if he would, to do so again. My
understanding of the situation is this, that
if the railways of their own motion undertake
to close or abandon a divisional point or
station, they have fto secure the consent of
the Railway Commission, but if they disagree, and the matter goes to the Arbitral
Tribunal, then the Chairman of the Railway
Commission decides one way or the other. Is
this interpretation correct?
Right lion. Mr. MEIGHEN: What I said
was this. In the fir-t case, if before the Bill
passed they had to go before the Railway
Board, they still will have to do so. In the
second case, where the tribunal comes in, the
decision of the tribunal becomes the decision
of the board.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: And would carry
with it the intent of section 179 of the Railway Act, and secuîre compensation to the
employees for property loss?
Right lon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not say
what the decision would be, but the rights of
the employees under that would be just the
same as before.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: All right.

That is ýte say, it is noýt necessary for both
cempanies te agree te bring it befere the

Han. Mr. BEIQUE: Would the right honourabde gentleman tellme Whether that is acoeptable to the Canadian Pacifie Railway?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Wedil, I cma
say thait it is more acceptable tihan the para-.
graiph that appears in the Biël; and as fir Ge
I know, it is acce1ptable. The last time I saw
the representative of the coînpany his objection to the dofinition was thait heiore it couildbe said that suob non-competitive properties
as land, mines, etc., thet are owned directly by
the comipany, do not come within the Act, the
onus wouild 'be on. tihe comrPanY te show that
they were fot conpetitive. The representative
feit tii was an unfair onus. With respect te

such properties owned by tiheïr subsidiaries,
hin position was that the definition was quite
clear. The amendment then was revised Vo
meet 4his objection, which I thought was a
reasonable one. Under this new amten.dient
su.ch onus has been lifted and any such properties owned directly by the company would

the committee feit the proper restriction f0

for the reason that bis wbole time would be

Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I agree with the
remarks of the right bonourable leader of the
House (Riglit Hon. Mr. Meighen). In the
Bailway Comnmittee the suggestion came fromn
myself, 1 think, that we should make a compromise in this matter by precluding the chairmnan fromn being an officer of any other cornpany, but permitting himi te, huold directorships. I took, the grouind f lat we miglit as
well exeluide a man wvho was a shareholder
of any company, because a man who, in order
to become chairman of the trustees of the
National Company, resigned bis directorship
in some other eompany, would continue te
have practically as much influence with that
company as if lie hiad flot resigned. He could,
for example, exert bis influence f lrouigl some

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, I arn sure we ail desîre that this Bill
shalI be ahsolutely non-politîcal in its implications, but I am equally sure that the language
of this paragreiph wouId provide an opportunity for political appointments. The concluding sentences read:
Such board shall be convened by the Chairman of the TruoMees. In the case of an
imminent vacancy the board may convene and
act in antitipation thereof. If no suoli pa.nel
is so provided within ten days after the oceurrence of a vacancy the Governor in Council
may appoint as he may be advised.
Wben referring Vo section 3 and the possihility of the Chief Commissioner being
ternporarily unable to perform lis duties, the
rigbt bonourable leader of the House said that
ahl the Chief Commissionrr had to do was
"to do nothing." Well, according to the wording of this paragrapli relative to the convening of a nominating board to fill a vacancy, ail
the Chairman bas to do is Vo do nothing for
Van days, and Vben along cornes the opportunity for the Governor in Councîl to make
the appointrnent. I do noV anticipate that
anytbing particularly wrong is goin-g to
bappen; but there is the opportunity for some
one to drag bis feat and do notbing, and thus
open the way for a political appointrnent.
That is not wbat any of us contemplates.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable senator's initerpretation is rigbt, I think,
but I hardly know bow you can close ail doors
of that kind. I ask hirn just to summon to

Can ha imagine any trustee, with the power to

It is not buman nature; power is too mucli

(2) Thc Chairman of the Trustees shall be
appointed as such for a terni of flot more than
seven years-and so on. While I arn in sympathy with
much of this Bill, its departure from wel
established business principles with respect to
corporate management gives me considerable
uneasiness. Several generations of business
men have helped to bui]d up England's present
system of corporate management; and a
similar system is in force here and in the
United States. One of the finest examples of
this systemn is the Canadian Pacifie itself, with
its very able board of direetiors, representing
virtually every section of the Dominion. I
know it is intended to get a super-man as
Chairman of the Board, but, even so, we
must have regard fo human frailty, and seven
years is a long time during which f0 giýve a
man carte blanche for the management of a
company that represents an investmenf as
great as the national debt ief.Who is the

responsibility?
In any event be will need

the publie aýs parficularly fltted for these appointments. I cannot say that I arn in sympathy with the setting up of an autocrat. I
bave grave doubts as to the working out of
the provisions of this Bill. The rigbt bonourable leader (Right lion. Mr. Mweighen) cleared
up one question with respect to whieh I was

1 say?-pandering too muoh to publie sentinment, and relieving the Government of the
da.) of what 1 regard as its major responsibihty
-the Cariadian National Railways. This subsection provides that tlic Chairman of the
Trustees ohaîl bc appointed for seven years;as 1 read it, there is nofhiing within thle four
corners olf the Bill pnoviding for a shorfer
terni. Why flot beave it te the diseretion of
the Government -te make the appointment for
one, two, tihrce, four or five years? Týhat is
the plîrpose of my amendment.
Hon. Mr.

MCRAE.

Hon. Mr. CASG.RAIN: I arn not in favour
of rcstricting the appointment to seven years;
if wvould disqualify a very sa.tisfactory man
for reappointmen.t.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It scems to me that
in the hast analysis this will be a matter of
neg-otiation bctween the prospective appointee
and tbe Governiment of the day. I do not
think any harmn can he done by the adoption
of the proposed amendment. The appointee
might be quite willing to acf for three or five
or seven years, or even longer, and if the
amcndment were adopted the Government
would stili bave the right to make the
appoinfment for a term of seven years.
Hon. Mr. CASGRA'IN: The muan appointed
would always have the riglf teo resign.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: During the sitfings
of the Railway 'Commitfce 1 thought 1 beard
considerable argument in favour of giving a
capable man reasonable assurance of continuity of office. Is 'not this entirely in line
with the appoinfment o-f members f0 the
Tariff Board, the Civil Service Commission,
and othcr commissions? I think ,o.
This
proposed amcndment affords an incoming
Governmcnf opporti]nity to rcek revenge.
That is not wbat the people of Canada want.
Thcy want those placed in charge of the
National Railways f0 diseharge their duties
without fear or favour, relying on the assurance of reasonable continuity of office under
the principle ernbodicd in this Bill. I can sec
no good reason for an amend'ment of this
kind. If mnust he prompted by the hope,
deeply embeddcd in somebody's heart, "If we
are not sucessful in scrapping the whole
thing righf now, oh, wcll, we shaîl surely get
a chance et it twclve monflis from now, wif h
o confractual obligations to some one to
wvhom wve
bave said. 'Corne yce out from among
them and fake thiis important job.'" With
ail due resp)ect f0 the vicws of my honourable
friend from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRac),
this amendmcnt scems f0 me to be onîv part
of the game t0 scrap the îvbole purpose of
the Bill. Lect us stick where we were at in
the Railway Commiftec and give that assurance of confinuity of office f0 the bcst and
most capable man the Governmenf cau secure
to acf as Chairman of the Trustees. If if
changes ifs mind later, let it accept fhe consequences. That is what should bc done, unless
we are f0 have a hal.f-hearted, evasive plan
for the operation of these railways, with no
sincerity or baeking behind if.

FEBRUARY 22, 193326
Hon. M.r. GASGRAIN: Is there any provision by which the Chairman of the Trustees
is eecure in his appointment, just the samne,
for instance, as the Auditor General?
Rigit, Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: 1 thi.nk there
is some misapprehiension as ta the effeet of
the arndment. 1 arn against the amendment, but flot for the reasons advanced. The
amendment wouid give th~Government power
ta appoint up to seven ears, but it could
flot dismiss its appointee nor eouid its successors do so.
î
1 arn against the amen*.ent, however, for
reasons which I shall seek to advance very
briefly. First of ail], it is the recommendation
of the Commission that the man who is given
this t-remendous job should have seven years
within which Ia achieve something worth
while. The commissioners feel that the great
oentral responsibility is ta lie placed on one
inan, and that it would flot be possible for
him to discharge it within a shorter period.
I should flot like to put ýmy opinion
against -the studied judgment of the Comnmission on this point. 1 think my position,
if it needs reinforoement, is rcinforoed by the
argument of -the honourable gentleman from
Vancouver <Hon. Mr. McRae). I think lie
did the Camm'ittec a service in bringing to
bear an argument which Iargely destroys his
own contention. He says that the man who
undertakes this task wili have ta effeet
ecanomies which wiil not, be popular wherever
they are imposed; that hie will have ta eut
down services, and may have ta decide on
the abandoninent of lines; that, therefore, lie
will become unpopular, and no man wiii wan-t
the position vc.ry long. Does not the lionourable gentleman sec that thait is just the reason
why this man should take the position for
seven years, and why there sliould lie no
possibility of interference during that period?
If this is flot donc, pressure of aIl kinds will
be brought ta bear upan hlm ta induce him
ta get out. The idea is that once lie lias
undertaken the job lie lias pledged bis word
of honour ta the people of Canada to sec àt
tbrougli to compietion. Sureiy the recommendation that -the periad of commi'tment
be seven years is a proper anc. If the worst
cames ta -the worst, and the appoin*tee finds;
that tlirough ill-heal-tli or economie pressure
lie is flot able ta continue in office, then, as
some lionourabie senator lias pointed out, the
Chairnlan of the Trustees can resign at any
'time.
Another reason for fixing the scven-ycar
period is this: the whoie stagger system wouid
be shaken ta its foundation if a shorter period
were substitu-ted. For wliat length of time
are the other trustees ta bie appointed? If

anc of them is appointed for two years, in
order ta maintain your stagger system you
wili have to appoint onc for six montlis, and
another for a year. You cannat get aiong
very weii witli a shorter period than seven
years fer the longest termi.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I fuliy appreciate wliat
the riglit lionourable leader of the House
says, but this amendment simply extends ta
the Govcrnment the samne riglit with respect
ýta the cliairman that it lias witli respect ta
the ather trustees, for the Act says the others
shahl be appointcdRiglit Hon. Mr. MEIGI'EN: That is the
flrst appointment.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Yes, but there is no provision for reappointmcnt aftcr Lie-ven ycars.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes. A
trustee who takes 'the place of one wliosc
terni lias expired is appointcd for seven years.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: The abject of my propoSai is ta leave the Government in such a
position that it can negotiate and make a
cont.raet, for any term, not exoeeding seven
years, that miglit lie dcemcd proper. This,
it seems ta me, gives the Governmcnt a little
more ieeway in arranging for tlie chairman.
Hon. Mr. L'ESPERANCE: Is there any
provision to compel the retirement of the
cliairman if lie should prove incapable af performing lis duties? We have sometimes been
handi*cappcd by the fact that aur judges, and
others appointed ta high positians, have
refuscd ta resign.
RLiglit Hon. Mr. MEIGIfEN: That is ane
af thc multitude of services pcrformed by
the Standing Committee of this House. There
was no provision for that in the first place,
but 1 think that now every cantingency is
covered by the Bill.

of the repeal of the Aet would be to 'cut off

to ail sections. Such questions have to corne
before the Minister in the regular way. I
might point out that this fact is, in considerable measure, an answer to the honourable mernber's fears as previously expressed.
While no direct governmental supervision is
maintained. and the whole responsibility is
put upon the trustees, as managers, nevertheless Parliament, at the instance of the Goveroment, stili controls the purse strings.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think it is
the practice to read the numbers of the sections, and, if any honourable member requests
it, to read a particular section under consideration. Perhaps the honourahie gentleman (Hon. Mr. Forke) would be satisfied if
the chairman read the number of the section
and gave the members a chance to grasp the

The CHAIRMAN: In other words, read

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Parliament

Proposed section 12 was ag.reed to.
Proposed section 13 was agreed to.
On proposed section 14, subsection 1annual report to Parliament:
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: This is very
important. I wonder if the chairman would
mind reading this.
The CHAIRMAN:
The first clause of
section 14 reads:
The Tr~ustees sball make a report annually
to Parliament eetting forth in a suanmary
Inanner the results of their operations, any
co-operative measures, plans or arrangements
effected pursuant to this Act, any economies
or more remunerative operation thereby produced, thc amounts expended on capital account
in respect of the railwaya, works, property,
facilities andi services cornprised in the undertakings <if National Railways and such other
information as appears to them to be of public
interest or nceeary for the information of
Parliament with relation 1» any situation existing at the time of such report, or as may be
required frona time to time by the Governor an
Council.

267

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think the
importance of this section lies in the fact that
noV onlY must the trustees make an annual
report, but they must furnish special information at any time Vhey are required to do
so by the Governor in Council, even though
it may have no connection with anything
contained in their annual report.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I take it that this
section contemplates that the Chairman of
the Trustees will appear before the Railway
Committee of the House of Commons, as the
President of the Canadian National has done
in the past. Arn 1 right in that assumption?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This section
does not deal with that at all. IV merely
provides that the trustees shaîl report
annually to Parliament on certain phases and
any other phases that the Governor in Cauncil may require information on fromn time to
time. The question whether or not the chairman should appear before a committee of
Parliament is flot dealt wîth at ahl in the
Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: But it bas
been the practice for the President of the
Canadian National to appear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. Anybody who is summoned bas to appear.
Subsection 1 of proposed section 14 was
agreed to.
Subsection 2 was agreed ta.
On proposed section 15-reports Va Parliament through the Minister of Railways:
Hon. Mr. McRAE: This section provides
that the annual reports of the trustees and
the auditors shail bie submitted to Parliament
thraugh the Minîster of Railways. IV seems
ta me that if Vhis Bill becomes law there will
noV bie a great deal of work for the Minister
of Railways Vo do, and it is possible that we
may not have a Minister of Railways. In
any event, the reports will have to do laýrgeIy
with financiai mattiers, wLid it occurred Vo me
that the Ministier of Finsance might be the
,appropriate Minister ta submit them. 1
am making these remarks merely by way of
suggestion.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I Vhink the
honourable memaber will agree that while there
as a Minister of Railways hie would bie the
proper one Vo suhmit ta Parliament the reports of a great railway organization. If
there ever should come a time when there
would be no Minister of Railways in this
well-railroaded country, then, no doubt, an
Act would be passed ta provide that wherever

SENATE

268

in certain statutes there is reference to the
Minister of Railways it should be understood
to mean the Minister of Finance, or other
Minister, as the case might be. I arn sure
that the present Ministor of Railways would
not feel at, ail flattered by an.y suggestion
that he bas niot enough to do.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: How soon after Parliament meets will the report be submittod?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
upon when it is preýparod.

It depends

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: If it were submitted
during the last days of a session there would

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That would

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think the
customary time is witbin fifteen days aftor
the opening of Parliament.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It could be
limitod to fifteen (lays after the preparation
of the reports, if Parliamont should then be
sitting, or othcrwise to within fiftccn days
after the opening of Parliament. The right
honourable senator from Eganvillo (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham) wilI agree that if the

On proposed section 16, subsoction 1-cooperative measuros, plans and arrangements
by C.N.R. and C.P.R.:
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Mr. Chairman, there
is a matter upon which I should like to have
dcfinite information. Let us suppose that in
accordance with this part of the Bill the
railways agree to have a joint terminal, and
that as a result of that agreement one company's terminal is dismantled and no longer
used for anything. I should like to know
whether there would be an understanding
betweon the two eompanies that if one of
them desired to re-establish that termina] for
its separate use in the future, it would have
the right to do so. Or would the agreemnent
provide that the joint terminal is to be usod
by both railways so long as they continue to
exist?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If by mutual
arrangement, tmndor the direction of this secRilit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN.

tion, the two roads qhould corne to such an
agreement as the honourable member conternplates-that is, for the joint use of a single
terminal and the abandoniment of one that
had exiqtcd-the arrangement would hast as
long as the companies desired. Within the
four corners of the agreement there wvould
be some provision as to the disposition of
the abandonied terminal, and as to 1mw il
miglit ho made available for sorne other or
resurned use.
The railways could
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
maI50 the agreement for a period of one
hundrcd years, if they wanted 10?
Right Hon. Mr. MiiELOHEN: For as long
as thcv wanted. If ait any time one of the
conipanies thought that greater econoniy could
be effected hy a different arrangement, ilt
mnigbt ho able to get the other company 10
agree to nake a change. But if they found
agree they could go before
it imo-beto
a tribunal for a dee-iýion.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: Mr. Chairman, I arn
a little puzzled as to who shal mali the mccling.,a of representatives of the twvo comipanies.
WilI owfficers of the Canadian National or of

10 get the greater benefit if the plan is agreed
on, I should say.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: But if neither coinpany mnakes such a miove, thon what bappens?

On proposed section 17, subsection 1tribunals to be erected as required:
lion. Mr. McRAE: We have been making
pretty good progress this afternoon, and, as
we have now reached a controversial part of
the Bill, I arn sure that many honourable
members will join with me in suggesting to
the right honourabie leader of the House that
we adjourn.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I arn in the
hands of the Comrnittee. It is quite clear
that since in any event we are flot to sit
later than six o'cloek this afternoon, we canflot get the Bill over to the Commons to-day.
Whatever is convenient to the House will suit
me.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Part III of the
Bill is very important, and, as some honourable senators are Vo leave the city soon,' I
think it would be wise for us to proceed as
far as we can.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: This Bill has been
pending for several months and many people
are wondering wby we have been dragging
our feet. WVe have sat only an hour and fiftyfive minutes this afternoon, yet an honourable
member suggests that we adjourn. That
reminds me of the first session I was a member
of this House. Since that time I have heard
a lot of criticism about railwaymen's pay, but
I was paid at the rate of $M4.30 for every
hour 1 sat here during that session. Why
should we adjourn now, when the public are
waiting for us to get sornething done with this
Bill?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
The honourable
gentleman is always advocating shorter hours.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Mr. Chairman, may
I inquire whether, if we proceed now, it is
intended to take the third reading of the Bill
to-day? I must say very plainly to this
House that I arn opposed to Part III of the

269

Bill as it stands, and I shaîl require an opportunity to explain, probably at some length,
my reasons for that stand. I arn not asking
that we adjourn at present, but I do say that
we should not try to pass the measure to-day,
for every member of the House should be
given tbe fullest opportunity Vo express bis
views.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: 1 arn not prepared to
d so et the moment, but I intend Vo speak
on the third reading.
Hon. Mr. CASGRA'IN: Tbird reading could
be given to-day only by unanimous consent.
Subsection 1 of proposed section 17 was

Subsection 2 was agreed Vo.

On paragraph e-abandonment of lines,
services or fejeilitiee:

Hon. Mr. MeRAE: I doesre to correlate
tjhis psragraph with the inquiry which I
direated to t~he righb honcurable leader of
the HSS eurlier in tihe a~fternoon wi4th
respect to the righ't con.femed, S either company to caîl the other before the tribunal
to, decide any question of difference between
thern.
This paragraph dealing with the
abandonment of lines involves the capital
assets of at least one railway, and I think
we should very seriously consider its implications. There are several angles to be considered, and on the third reading I hope to
voice my objections to the paragraph. In
the meantime I wish to direct the attention
of honourable members to, what the paragraph may involve.
Paragraph e was agreed to.
Paragraphs f and g were agreed to.

Last night the
Hon. Mr. MIJRDOCK:
rigbt honourable leader of the Bouse promised
to consider a further amendaient that I then
suggested along these lines:
Nor @hall any Tribunal have the right to
set aside or abiidge any Act wbich. as a safety
social or humane mensure proteets the rightB oi
the public or of the employfes.

and humaine enactments of the past forty
odd years, for the sake of economy in the
eperation of our railways?

Arn I to talke it from tbe answer whicb he
gave me this afternoon that section 2, dealing
with inconsistent provisions, is sufficient without the placing of any limitation upon the
It
tribunal in this particular subsection?
deals entirely with limitations upon jurisdiction.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes. There are
enactments, for instance, te provide for
safet-y appliances on cars and te regulate the
heigbt of bridges and tbe building of overhead structures.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Whether or
not this Bill interferes with some very general
principle such as that embodied in the present
question of the bonourable senator, 1 cannot
say. But I do say it would be wholly unsafe
to accept bais amendment, because it would be
more like preaching a sermon than legislating
as we are accustomed to do. I do not know
of any other statutory provision tlîat could
bc described as a humane provision with
which any part of this Bill is inconsistent, but
1 should not like to say there is not one;
I do net kinow ail the laws of Canada. I du
not t.hink there would be. I would urge the
Committee te recognize net only the importance, but the overwhelming,
imperativ e
necessity, of having the Act work,, and net
seek te impose restraints here and there
wvhiolh in eifect, would really mean that this
is a fine and lovely measure as long as it gets
nowbcre.

Hon. Mr. MURDOC'K: There are many
,.imilar enacCments. I amn wendering, wbat if
the two railways said now, as they bave often
said hieretofore in attempting te evade what
the liiw appeared te contemplate wvith respect
te safety appliances, "Under section 2 of tbe
Bill wr, do net have te provide those safety
appliaiices, andl we will agrec te evade any
ordIer te that endI'? In the meantimie the
lives or- limbs of their employees or of tbe
public may be at stake.

Hon. Mr. MURDO-CK:
I arn just, as
anxious as any bonourable senater te bave
this a really workable Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHENs:

1 know.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: At tbe same time
I cannet belp remembering that fer forty odd
3 ears Parliainent bas becn eîîaetiîg mensures

Now, in tbe rnost

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Under the Raiiway
Act a new route map must be fiied for any
deviation of more than six miles from the
route as approved by the Railway Commission. Would ithat limitation prevail under
this amended subsection 4?
Right Hon. Mr,. MEIGHEN: I do flot think
it would prevai; but the honourable senator
should remember that no plan can be approvied uniess it involves economies or more
remunerative operation.
The honourabie senator from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) puta a question which
I thixik I shouid try to answer. His fears, I
arn sure, are ungrounded,--unless my law is
very bad. To say that the provisions of a
Bill shahl prevail over inconsistent provisions
of previous legisiation does net mean that two
parties making an agreement authorized by
the Bill can by that agreement nullify
previous legislation. 1 say unhesitatinglyand 1 speak ais a iawyer peqThaps more than
as leader of the Governmment-I say unhesitatingly thaît those parties must make their agreement conformi Vo the requirements of the law.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is right.
The anîendment to subsecti on 4 of proposed section 17 was agreed to.
Subsections 1, 2, 3 and 4 of proposed section 18 were agreed Vo.
On subsection 5--Tribunal may be reconvened:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I move that

On proposed section 26--quashal of a
dispute:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The bonourable senator from North York (Hon. Sir Allen
Aylesworth) bas asked me whether or not the
word "quashal," used in the last uine of this
paragraph, is the proper word; whether,
Hon. Mr. MURDOCir

271

indeed, it is a word at ail. When he spoke to
me I had to, admit that I was a little uncertain. I have looked in the Oxford Dictionary, and do not find it there; but that is quite
natural, because quite frequently when the
stem word is shown the words derived fromn it
are omitted. That there is such a word as
"iquashai" is certîfied Vo me by the fact that
it aippears in various judgments and records
of court proceedings.
The suffix "ai" is one that is very generally
used in nouns of action which have a Latin
or French derivation. Honourable members
will cail Vo mind dozens of such words in an
instýant-enewal, reprisaI, survival, perusalHon. Mr. CAiSORAIN: Arrival.

I have at least tbirty of them before meavowal, acquittai, committal, dismissal, requital, recital, refusa], transmittal, rehearsal,

opinion that it is a proper suffix in a n-oun
of French or Latin origin.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I wouid suggest that
a word that would be understood shouid he
put beside it, in parenthesis.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: The fact that we
have had Vo go beyond the confines of the
dictionary is an evidence of the labour the
Senate has put upon this Bill.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: With
reference Vo the disputed word "quashal," I
shouid like Vo suggest that when we are legisIating we had better use a recognized Englisb
word. We sbould change this Vo "quasbing."
Riblght Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The word
"quashing" wouid have the very sae effect,
but I amn persuaded that "quashal" is an
equaliy good word. However, I amn noV a

CANADIAN

NATIONAL-CANADIAN
PACIFIC BILL
THIRD READING

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN moved
that Bill A, an A.,t respecting the Canadian
National Railways and to provide for cooperation with the Canadian Pacifie, Railway
System, and for other purposes, be now read
the third time.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN.

Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, on account of the importance of the decision that we are about to re<aoh on this measure, I purpose to follow very closely the
notes which I have prepared setting forth my
views on the ssvbject.
After several weeks of somewhat strenuous
work, we at last have before us for final decision the action to be taken by this branch of
Parliament with respect to the Railway Bill
submitted to us for consideration. That the
measure in ail its features, and from every
conceivable angle, has received full and ample
consideration cannot be questioned. Thbe Bill
as reported to us undoubtedly represeints the
calm, mature, independent majority view of
your Railway Committee. There is no question at aIl about that.
Personally 1 regret very mucli that I find
mîyself unable to accept the Bill in its entirety
as it is now before us. Holding the vieivs
I do, 1 conceive it to be my duty as a member of this Chamber to give expression to my
opinions and the reasons theref or before a final
vote is taken. 1 must therefore ask for your
indulgence whilst 1 endeavour to state as
clearly and frankly as I possibiy can my objections to the Bill.
Ia order to lay a foundation for the views
to whîch I shahl later give expression, I desire
at this stage to cite certain facts and conditions, ail of which, with others, -have contributed to the creation of the railwvay problem
that now confronts us. These facts are as
follows:
(1) Owing to economic and allied conditions
prevailing the world round, all large railway
systems, wherever located, have greatly depleted revenues, with resulting financial diffiWhere the railways are publîcly
culties.
owned the State must carry the burden, but
where privately owned any loss sustained accrues to the shareholders. Ordinarily a well
managed private corporation builds up over
a period of years the necessary reserve to t-ake
care, nt least partially, of a situation such as
this. In Canada, owing to conditions existiug
in the past, it was practically impossible to
provide for a reserve for the National System.
Conscqucntly, for three years the State bias
hiad to provide, through taxation or borrowing,
huge sums of money to take care of deficitÎ.
These amount at present to more than one
million dollars a week.
(2) During recent years, on an ever-increas
ing scale, the revenues of ahl railway system
bave heen seriously affected by the automo,
bile, the bus and the truck. The rivalry for
traffic between steam and gasoline is bound
to continue and grow. It is admittedly very
doubtful that our railways may hope for any

FEBRUARY 23, 1933
material relief in this regard by any attempt
to tax, control or regulate this new type of
transportation.
(3) It is claimed to hea& fact, by those
who should know, that the McAdoo Award
as adopted and applied to the railways of
Canada gave rise to financial burdens, for
wages, maintenance and materials, that were
most onerous and inequitable when com'pared
with similar costs carried by industrial con'verns.
What I arn doing now is this: I arn trying
to point out thc causes which have contributed
to the condition that exista. 1 shall deal with
some of these later.
4. The railway mileage of Canada is far in
excess of the country's actual requirements.
For the purposes of our discussion nothing
will be gained at this juncture by questiening
the foresight, the optimism or the wisdom
of those responsible for this condition. The
bald fact stands forth that Canada is not
now, and will not be for many years to corne,
sufficiently populated to produce the traffic
necessary to pay the interest on the hundreds
of millions of dollars that have been poured
into railway expansion durîng the past twenty
years or so. There is no question at ail about
that.
5. This excess railway mileage is the cumulative result of action by Parliament itself(a) in building the Transcontinental line frem
Monicton te Winnipeg; (b) in acquiring for
the State the Canadian Northern and the old
Grand Trunk systems, the Grand Trunk
Pacific from Winnipeg to Prince Rupert, and
many if not mest of the branch lines whose
bonds were originally guaranteed by the
provinces; (c) in acquiring several if flot
many of wbat are commonly referred to as
scrap or junk railways, which neyer did, ceuld
or would pay in-terest on their cost-to say
no'thing of the deficits having to be paýid on
operating accounts; (d) in permitting, either
by charter or through a brancb of the public
service (the Railway Board), the duplication
of many hundreds if not tbousands of miles
of railway bhat should never hafve been built.
Again I repeat, it is a fact that the people of
Canada themselves, threugh their own Parliament, are responsible for the existence of
some thousands of miles of railway that have
been and will continue to be a tremendous
burden on the public treasury.
6. In Parliament, until recently, ail political
parties put their stamp of approval on the
pehicy of "Hands off the C.N.R., " "No
political interference," no publicity of its inner
workings. Whenever a member ventured to
make a pertinent inquiry regarding management or costs he was almost invariably con-

273

fronted with the reply, "It is flot in the publie
in-terest." I ask you this: Is it not a fact
that Parliament built or acquired a twobillion-dollar railway plant, and handed it ever
to, a small group of men who had not a
dollar at stake except their salaries, and
without providing anything in the nature of
adequate chcks and control as regarde both
administrative policy and expenditures?
7. Frem my general knowledge of what has
taken place in the past I have reason to
believe that the annual budget requirements
of the National System, before their submission to Parliament, have not been subjected to sufficient, expert review and analysis
to determine properly either their necessity
or the results that would fellow from the
expenditure of the moneys asked for.
To put it bluntly, I mean this. Under our
democratic form of government ministers of
the Crown are largely what I may caîl politîcal
accidents. 1 would not for a moment intimate
that cabinets, by and large, do flot contain
many very capable ministers. I do say, however, that as a general rule ministers of the
Crown, witheut proper assistance, are net
equipped with sufficient knowledge and experience to enable them-te pass expert judgment
on the complex budget requirements of a
two-billion-dollar active business concern
about which they know little or nothing. I
have been there: I have acted on committees
and have heen asked to review the budget requirements cf the Canadian. National Railways. As my honourable friend from Alma
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) said the other day, he
aIse was there, and we sat together as a committee to consider the budget requirements of
a huge railway system. I ask you, as I ask
myself, what did I know about the subject?
Wbat experience bad I that would enable me
to pass a considered, well balanced, true, just
judgment on the subject with which I was
asked to deal? I had ne experience whatever
in that field. And sucb is the position that
ministers of the Crown have been in ahl
along. My right honourable friend across the
way (Rigbt Hon. Mr. Graham) knows that.
He knows the performance that is gone
tbrougb in the consideration of these huge
budgets that must necessarily corne te Parliament. I say that in past years ministers of
the Crown and committees of the Cabinet,
because cf lack cf knowledge and lack cf
experience, bave net been sufflciently equipped
te deal with buge problems cf that kind.
In addition I must state this helief. Notwithstanding ail aur pieus expressions and hopes
with respect thereto, there must have been a
good deal cf political interference with the

not exist in writing. Neverthlîclss the populai
opinion prevails fliat it was thcrc consfanfly
exercising ifs influence for eivil. Will any
member of this Chanîber tell nie that the
National management, of its own volition and
without political interference or pressure, would
have asked for the millions required f0 construct huge hotels at Vancouver, Saskatoon
and Halifax'? Did the National management,
as thet result of sound business judgment, seek
to acquire hîindreds of miles of junk railways
at a cest of more millions? The answer surely
miust fie ne. There is onlv one inference to,
ho drawn, namely that sufficient pressure was
broughit to bear upon the management of tlic
National Systemn to cause it to include in ifs
budgets the estimates for the amounits required to do those things. I am speaking
now of the influences, the conditions and the
facts that have confributed to thle mess that
the Canadian National now finds itself in.
I also have reason to believe that the annual
budget requirements of tlîe National Sy,;teni
bave never been submnitted to Parliamient xvitlî
such classification anti detail as are nccessary
to enable members to unilerstanil clearly thieir
purposes anti effectk. Is if not a fact that

nor, in many instances, even by the Government itself. It would almnosf appear, from
what we nowv know, that the greatest ingenuity
lias been displayed in the actual wording of
the estimates to bring about this condition.
I have reason f0 believe, furfher, that the
adopted policy and practice of the past; as
regards publicity of the proposcd ani actual
ave
cm
expenditures of the 'National Sysfen
resulted in tîte gravest kinds of injustice and
liarm, net only te the people of Canada, but
te the management, of our ýstafe-owned railivays as wcll. In the last analysis is it not
a faef that the National Systero is but a
department of Goverament? Parliament cannot divorce ifsel.f from the responsibility of s0
treating if, even thoughi the actual control
anti management of the system are handcd
ever to a board of trustees. WVI», then, within
proper bouinds, should we net bave a tletailed

been Iargely shrouded in clouds of darkncss
and mystery and it his 'been only with the
greatest difflculty that certain types of expenditures and extravagances have been dragged
into daylight, where tbcy could be scen in al
their hideousncss.
I say that the Canadian National Railway
System, even if under a board cf trustees, is
merely a deparfment of Government and
should in the main ho treated as such. We
know what happens in the case of offier
departments of Government: nothing is concealed; everytliing is brought into the light
of day; printed records show wvhat bas
happened, and anynne who can read and
wvants te know can flnd ouf. But such bas

Railways are concerned. The policy pursued,

FEBRUARY 23, 1933
our railways to pay their way, 1 ask you in
ail seriousness if you are of the opinion that
our general rate structure is just and equitable. On this point we rnust also bear in
mind the fact that many if flot most of the
great railway systems in the United States
have passed through receiverships which
resulted in the wiping out of hundreds of
millions of dollars invested by the publie for
capital expenditures. Nothing of a sirnilar
eharacter bas taken place in Canada.
I have so far endeavoured to cite and
classify what I regard as the conditions and
evils that have chiefly contributed to our
existing railway problem. I have by no
ineans exhausted the list, but 1 feel confident
tihat when I add to it the unwise, extravagant
competition that prevailed between our two
railway systeins during the past few years,
but little else of material consequence
remains.
Permit me f0 place this fuýrther view before
you. The National Systern at the tirne of its
inception and creation was a hopelessly bankrupt concern. The only differene existing
to-day is that, if such a thing is possible, it
is now, owing to general economic conditions,
more hopelessly bankru.pt. The Governrnent,
under the pressure of persistent and frequent
demands for millions upon more millions to
fake care of deficits, finally conceived the
idea of appointing a Royal Commission, the
chief function of which was, after due and
proper enquiry, to recomrnend some plan
or seheme whereby the taxpayers of Canada
would obtain sorne relief fromn the everlasting
deniands on the public treasury. For the
personnel of the Commission, as well as
for its work, I have the highest regard. Its
report is, and for many years should be, a
guide and warning Vo those who sit in h.igh
places. With some if not most of its recommendations I arn in entire accord. I cannot,
however, bring myself to agree with its suggestion as to the desirability or necessi'ty for
the establishment nf an arbitral board with
powers as set out in the Bill, unless I arn
assured by the authorities of the Canadian
Pacifie Railway that sucli proposal bas their
endorsation. I have repeateffly asked myself, as I
must now ask you, why should the C.P.R. lie
dragged into this mess against its wiIl?
Wherein has it sinned against the people of
Canada? To what extent bas fit oontRibulted
to the financial stress and strain of the
National System? As a result, of the many
discussions we had in the Railway Commibtee
I have heen gradually but, surely driven to
the point where I arn compelled to hold this
view: umless it can be clearly and unmistakably shown tbart the C.P.R., by the adoption
53721-181

275

of policies or by its actions, has in &orne way
gravely injured the people of Canada, or
unless it can be similarly shown that the C.P.R.
is materially responsible in some manner for
tbe unfortunate financial condition of the National System, it should flot, be subi ect to the
provisions of this legisiation against its will,
and while Parliament bas the power to pass
this Bull, it bas no moral or equitable right to
do so.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the
bonourable senator n question? Could lie
indicaite any o'ther source anywhere throughout the length and breadth of Canada whence
there bas corne so insistent a dlaim for control and co-operation of the railways as lias
corne from the C.P.R.?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes, the C.P.R. is in
favour of co-operation, and that feature I
shaîl deal with very soon. But tbere is a
wide difference between voluntary co-operaf ion
and cornpulsory co-operation as set foefth in
this measure. In the Railway Committee 1
said I was in favour of an arbitral board, but
the position I took aIl along in the discussions
-and I bave bad occasion Vo check up the
record-was this: Yes, I arn in favour of
the board, 1 arn in favou, of having disputes
sýettled, but let me see what kind of board
you are going to have, and what its functions,
duties and powers are to be, before I place
my stamp of approval on it. In the Comrnittee flot only did I flot approve of the
principle contained in this Bill, but I always
expressed the greatest hesitancy about adopting the principle, and tirne and again I argued
against it.
Again I arn bound to ask, wberein bas the
C.P.R. sinned in the way of doing injustice
Vo the people of Canada or creating thbe
present financial condition of thle Canadian
National systern? I say it bas sinned in
neither direction.
For a moment let us analyse the causes
wbich I have cited as contributing to the
situation that exists.
I pass over the depression, the automobile,
and the McAdoo Award, and I corne to the
existence of exoess railway mileage. Who is
responsible for the condition? The blame
can be placed only ait the door of Parliament
itself. Inst-ead of contributing Vo this cause,
the Pacifie Cornpany on many occasions
warned goverfiments of the dire results that
would eventually flow from the policie-s conternplated or pursued.
Was the C.P.R. responsible in any way for
the creation of the National System? Did it
urge upon the Governrnent the taking over
of totally bankrupt scrap railways? In the

SENATE
prepared to go the limit in an effort to secure
business from its rival. And what, under the
circumstances, did Parliament itself do? What
evidence bave wve that it intcrfered to any
material extent? So far as I know, it interfered oct rit ail. But wbat we ail do know is
that Parliament aided and abctted the crime.
Thosc are strong- words, but tbey are true
words, and every member cf this Chamber
knows tbey arc truc. I repeat, year after year
during tbesc iast few years Parliament veted
millions upon millions cf dollars, placed tbemn

proper restrictions on the expenditure of that
meney. Is the C.P.R. te be blamel for fbat?
Is it to bo dragged into tbis situation because
conditions bave prevailed for which it cannot
bo asked te take responsibility at ail?
Again I must ask, wbat part did the Canadian Pacifie play in tbis new situation tbat
arose? Did it suggest to tho National System,
or aid or encourage it, te inaugurate tbis orgy
cf unnccessary, lavish expcnditurcs? Did it

last analysis was it responsible for the duplication and triplication of railways in varjous
sections of the Dominion? To be fair and
just, the answer to ail these questions must
he no.
As regards duplication 1 must ask you to
bear in mind that whercver it exists it exists
only with the formai approval of Parliament,
of the Minister of Railways, of the Governor
in Council or of the Railway Board. For a
period of twenty-five years or more the C.P.R.

were a great sinner in this respect. Such is
not the case. We must not bold that vîew.
1 repeat, for a period of twenty-five years
the C.P.R. bas net built a single mile of railway without having the full approval of the
Government of Canada throug-h its Board of
Railway Commissioners. Why, thien, shouid
we place any blame at the door of the C.P.R.
for anything that lias biappened in this
respect?

FEBRUARY 23, 1933
I May say, a very desirable abject: its one
and sole purpose is to devise ways and means
whereby, to the fullest possible extent, economies, may lie effected with a view to reducing or eliminating the perpetual drain on
the public pu-rse. We ail agree with that. We
ail say: "Goodl Go aheadl We want that
abject effected; we want it very badly. This
enormous financial atrain on the people of
Canada cannot lie continued. We must have
these economies." I agree-we ail agreewith that view. Nobody can take objection
to the abject, nor to one feature of the method
proposed, namely the fullest co-operation
between the two system to eliminate unnecessary, wasteful, extravagant expenditures
in the operation of the two systems.
The cry for economy is flot new. For upwards of two years, the world round, in every
phase of human endeavour, it lias been a case
of, "We must economnize if we are to continue
to live." What has happened in this respect
within the circles of our two great railway
systems? Have they been slow or negligent
in this respect, or, on the contrary, have they
called a hait to the ilis; of the past? Here are
the figures that clearly indicate what has taken
place and is actualJy taking place by the
separate action af the two cornpanies, and
entirely without the assistance of this Bill or
any section or clause thereof. During the year
1932 the management of the National System
reduced its operating costs from those of 1928
by 3lO0,000,000--some 39 per cent.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Deficits?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Savings in aperating
costs. I repeat that in one year, 1932, the
Canadian National Railways management, of
its own volition, effected economies wliereby
the aperating costs have been reduced by
3100,000,000 as compa-red wi'th the operating
coets for 1928.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: Is that not due ta
the fact thaýt the Canadian National was not
doing mucli business?
Nion. Mr. CALDER: It is only partially
due ta that fact.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Wliat is the
comparison wi.tli 1931?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I have taken the two
3xtreme figures. In 1931 the S'duation in
aperating costs may have been $75,000,000;
in 1930, 360,000,000. But you cannot effect
great economies suddenly. Once more I repeat that as a result of econoroiest poeactised
during this period of four years the National
Company reached a point where in 1932 it
spent for operatian $100,000,000 leas than it
did in 1928.

277

Hon. M.r. GILLIS: lYoes that include the
entire system?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The entire system.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Can the lionourable
gentleman tell us what the deficit was?
Hon. Mýr. CALDER: I have not the figures
before me.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: Could the lionourable
gentleman give us the figures of the operating
revenue and the expenses?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I have not tlie figures
before me, but they are very easily ascertainable. Thcy are in the report of the Commission.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHIJR: Has the $1,000,000
a week been overcome up ta now?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No. Far from it. I
shail came -ta that in a minute.
What was the position of the C.P.R. with
reference ta operating costs? In the very same
period, the year 1932, the reduction of operating costs by the C.P.R. was 383,50,000about 46 per cent. This is a matiter in which
my honourable friend from Pairkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock) lias a very deep interest, and
I certainly sympa>thize a great deal with the
position lie takes. This saving is not bsrought
about wiithout affecting ta a very large extent
wliat is ordinarily Teferred ta as the human
element in the situation.
This year, according toa Ml that I have
heard, the Gtovernment of Canada will lie
called upon ta provide, by taxation or otherwise, appoeoximately W5,000,000 ta take care
af the C.N.R. deficits, but if the C.N.R.
managem-ent, without this law ait ail, had
not already effeoted these huge economies, the
Government in the year 1933 would have liad
ta provide $150,000,000.
Witli these facts and figures before us, the
Senate sliould not be stampeded. The necessity and the Urge for economy exist, and have
existed in a large way down tlirough the past
tliree years. The figures I -have quoted clearly
indicate that. We need not think for one
moment that the management, the directars
and the shareliolders of the C.P.R., for example, are not deeply interested in this question. We need not think for one second thât
the C.P.R. does not desire economy, not anly
for tlie present, -but for years ta came. The
conditions now prevailing are not goîng ta end
suddeniy; it will probably be several if not
many years bef are tbhere is a return of sueh
conditions as existed in the years 1929 and
1928 and prior thereto.
But it is argued-and now I came ta the
crux of the wbole situation-it is argued there

SENATE
is another field withjn whjcha further -and even
larger economies may bc brought about. Within the twve rajlwav systemis therc exists
duplication of railway linos, terminais, equipment, plant, buildings, offices, staff and facilities and services of aIl sorts. The Bill proposes
that within this field the two companies should
co-operate f0te i fulIest extent in order to
bring about the largest measure of further
possible economies. M'len before your Coinmitteo Mr. Beatty statcd frankly and explieitly that hie weleorned this feature of the Bill
and that bie and bis company stood ceady and
willing te implement the desire of the Govoement in this respect. We alI remember
bis words, whichi he repeated in Toronto and
Winnipeg. On the subjeef of Part III of the
Bill, however, there ivas ne doubt as te the
stand hie took. H1e is absolutely opposed te
said in
aIl its compulsory features. .He

ourselves need further economies. We realize
that thcougbi ce-eperative effort i ery large

Mc. Beatty, iii the city of Winnipeg, on tbe
Sth day of this month, when addressing the
Canadian Club, gave uittecance te bis opposition to this feature of flie Bill. 1 quete his
exact %vords,se that you may have before yeu,

need, the desire and the will to effect these
economies now exist, and I feel confident they
wiil be effected without the aid of Part III.
I have already shown you the amount of
the savings that have been eifected by the
systems separately in the one year, or over a
period of years ending in 1932. The urge for
economy exists, the will to economize exists,
and when anybody tells me that without this
Bill these companies will flot co-operate with
a view to securing as large further economnies
as they can possibly secure, 1 simply canflot
accept that statement. I cannot bring myseif
to believe that it is correct.

existed until recently-

Yes.
The ocasion has never

Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: -until the last two or
three years. What was the attitude until
recent years? There was a period, a comparatively long period, in which the railway
companies stood as enemies against each other,
prepared to fight each other at every point.
We ail know the attitude that existed between
the management of the old Canadian Northern and thc C.P.R. as represented by Lord
Shaughnessy. It was a case of fight to the
death. But such conditions do not exist today. We ail know of fights in committees
of Parliament, when representatives came here
asking for charters for certain limes of railway;
of the lobbies that took place, the influences
that were set st work. But those days are
ended. As my right honourable friend (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) said the other day ini our
committee, the entire raiiway world is in a
totally different position fromn what it was in
five years ago. The conditions of the past
will neyer come back; they have gone for ever.
We have an entirely new set of conditions,
which compel railway companies to strive to
do everything conceivably possible in order
ta save the situation. The bankruptcy of railways the world over stares us in the face.
Look at the situation i the United States
to-day; look at the situation on the continent
of Europe. Point ta any section of the world
wbere that condition does mot exist. There is
none. So it is useless ta talk of what lias
happened in the past. We must talk of the
present and take conditions as they are, and
I say that conditions as they are to-day are
such that the C.P.R. itself is compelled ta

279

praceed ta the fullest possible extent ta effeet
the econamies desired, and that no compulsion
such as provided in this Bill is at ail necessary.
But there is far more than the question of
economies at stake; in my opinion, a much
bigger thing. Permit me to submit ta you,
before you put your stamp of approval on
this feature of the Bill, this other consideration. The honourable senator from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) brought my
attention ta this point when he spoke in committee. I had neyer thought of it at all. Since
then I have made inquiries and have become
more fearful of what may be, flot merely the
possible, but the likely consequences of aur
adopting Part III of this Bill. The Pacifie
Company in the past has of necessity had ta
borrow huge sums of money. Whetre did it
get them? By far the greater proportion of
its securities--probably 80 ta 90 per centincluding its preference shares, its bonds and
dêbentures, and its treasury notes, lies in the
vaults of England. It has been the constant,
fixed poiicy af the C.P.R. ta place its borrowings as far as possible in that field. On the
other hand, the British investor over a
pcriod of some forty years has had the greatest confidence in the security af investments
in the Pacifie Company, and in its sound business management.
By this Bill, as I see it,
we propose ta impair seriousiy, if not ta
destroy, that confidence. We should not be
led astray by any argument ta the eifect that
the operation of Part III of the Bill can only
result in good ta the C.P.R. We must not be
led away by any such argument. It cannot
be disputed that Part III does take out of the
hands of its management many matters over
which it now has full contrai.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: In whose interest?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: In the interest of
the sharehoiders.
Hon. Mr. MIJRDOCK: No; the people
of Canada.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Not at ail.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Order, order.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Parliament lias set
up a Board of Raiiway Commissioners that
wili deal with any injustice that the people
may think they suifer in the matter of service
or rates, wherever the people are aifected by
the operations of the Canadian Pacifie, and
Pari:ment may add ta the powers and duties
of the Board in that respect. No; the control
ta which I refer is exercised in matters concerning the interest of the shareholders, not
of the people of Canada. 1 repeat, Part III

280

SENATE

does take away from the Canadian Pacific
Railway powers, duties and responsibilities
that it has exercised all these years. To this
the Canadian Pacific and its shareholders do
object, and there is the danger that if this
Bill becomes law investors will look very
suspiciously upon what Parliament bas done.
After all, whom are we dealing with? The
great bulk of these millions of securities belongs to English people, not to Canadians, and
we must remember that the average Englishman, because of his experience and training,
looks upon securities and the operation and
management of companies in a way entirely
different from ours. I say there is the greatest danger that if Parliament passes Part III
of this Bill, taking away from the management of the Canadian Pacific certain powers,
duties and repsonsibilities that it has enjoyed
in the past. we may destroy the credit of the
Canadian Pacific. Is that desirable? Which
of these two things is to prevail? Are we,
not because of anything that the Canadian
Paciýfic has done, but simply because we may
wish to reduce the drain on the public
treasury, to injure the Canadian Pacifie by
interfering with and possibly destroying its
credit? Well, I say we should hesitate. I
say we should think twice before we -take that
step, especially as very large savings can, I
am certain, be effected by voluntary ceoperation, though it may not secure all the
economies we desire.

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? Should the shareholders of the Canadian Pacific find that as
a result of this legislation certain economies
will be effected, would they not be pleased
if the value of their securities were thereby
increased?
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
I dare say they
would. But that is not the point. The average investor in the Old Country will not look
upon it in that way at all. The average man
who makes an investment in a bond or
security does so because, in the firet place,
he has confidence in the company itself,
based on its management and past record,
and, in the second place, he believes that the
company will be able to operate under sane
and sound legislation. Let it once be heralded
in the English press that the Parliament of
Canada is doing what is proposed in this Bill,
and what would be the effect upon investors?
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: The effect would be
good.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I do not agree with
my honourable friend. I should say it would
be the reverse.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I am not making

and do not want to prejudice my right to

the shareholders of the old Grand Trunk
Railway were not consulted in 1919, when the
honourable gentleman was a member of the
Government? He was one of the artisans of
the kind of work that he is objecting to
to-day.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No. The two situations were entirely different; and, besides,
the shareholders themselves voted in favour
of the Government's taking over that road.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: There was a very
small minority of shareholders who objected.
This Bill was initiated in this Chamber,
which in the past bas established a general
record for exercising sound and sane judgment in dealing with large questions involved
in measures that come before it. I do not
for one moment contend that all my views
are correct, and I do not ask honourable
members to accept them in their entirety,
if at all. All I have attempted to do is to
express my opinions and the reasons why I
hold them, and if in any way I have been
helpful to any ihonourable member in reaching a decision on the points now before us,
I shall be well pleased. In expressing my
views I speak for myself alone, and for no one
else. I have not been subjected to any influence whatsoever, either directly or indirectly. I attended practically all the meetings of the Railway Committee, and from the
outset I followed its proceedings very closely.
I think that as long as I have been in public
life I have never before had as much difficulty
in arriving at a decision on a question as I
have had in this case.
I quite understand the object of the Bill,
and I approve of that object. In brief, it is
the securing of economy. We all want that.
We are sick and tired of the existing drain
on the public purse, and we hope that the
day will come, and is not far distant, when
that drain will cease. For myseif, I cannot
see immediate relief; at least I cannot see
sufficient immediate relief to stop the drain.

FEBRUARY 23, 1933
It may be reduced, but I think it will be
many a long year before it entirely ceases.
1 have one further objection, of a negative
character, to the Bill. That ie, I have an
objection because of eomething that the Bill
does flot contain. In the course of my remarks
I have endeavoured to point out, as I did in
the Raiiway Cornmittee, what I regard as a
situation that lias con-tributed very largely
to the present state of affaire. That is what
I may cal, in the f¶rst place, the lack of
proper budgeting, and, in the second place,
the lack of proper consideration by Parliament of the budgets presented. I arn sure
that ail honourable members of this bouse
who have been members of the House of
Commons and have watc.hed proceedings
there over a period of years will agree with
me when I say that, generally speaking, the
members of that House, and in corne cases
ministers of the Crown, do flot clearly undlerstand wbat they are doing on these railway
matters. I say it advisedly. I have been
there; I have gone through the experience.
I say that the Parliament of Canada bas not
tihe opportunity properly to digest, consider
and adjud!icate upon tbe budgets that corne
before it. Now that we are atternpting to
correct the abuses and the ehorteomings of
the past, I say that at corne place in this
Bill an attempt, at least, should be made to
better conditions in this respect. I know it
will be difficult to do so. After alI, we have
democratic institutions, and alI dernocracies
make mistakes, sometArnes great mistakes. As
for corne of the thinge to wbich I arn referring, it is quite possible that we could not
effectively provide against thern in the Bill;
but I do believe tbere is sufficient ingenuity
arnong the members of both Houses of
Parliarnent to devise some checks and control that will totally prevent the recurrence
of what bas happened in the past. Wc bave
not tirne to deal witb that fea.ture bere, but
I trust that wben the Bill passes to thbe other
place corne member or group of members
will take th-is view of the situation and
endeavour ta prepare sorne clauses that will
cbeck and control things of the sort I have
i mmnd.
Let me give you an illustration of sornething that could be done, though I arn not
sure that it could be provided for in the Bill.
When a municipalîty, board of trade, group of
politicians, or any other body asks the Canadian National Railways for soniething which,
if granted, would mean a capital expenditure,
would it help to prevent the recurrence of
what has happened in the past to have a law
requîring that every sfuch application must
be in writing and bear the signatures of the

applicante? Had such a provision been in
effect in the past, would so rnany requeste
have been made? I doubt very nuch. that if
the law bad dernanded that the name o! every
person who joined in such an application
shculd be rnade public, the Canadian National would have miade certain capital expenditures that have been mnade. However, it
is quite coniceivable that it rnay not be possible to go very far in rnaking provisions in
the Bill along this line.
Honourable members will no doubt have
inferred from my rernarks that I would conclude with an amendment. I now move,
seconded by the honourable member frorn
North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth):
That ail the words after the word "lie" to
the end of the motion be left out and the
following substituted ýtherefor:
amended by etriking out Part III, subelau9s
a, and b and h of clause 3, and the reference
to Part III in su'bclause 2 of clause 2.
The effect of that would be to strike 'out
Part III and the reference to Part III elsewhere in the Bill.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWOiRTH: Honourable members, I wish to second the motion of the honourable member from Saltcoats
(Hon. Mr. Calder), and to say a few words
in support of my position in doing so. I speak
on thîs subject with very great hesitation.
I confeas myself to beý in my own judgrnent,
but little competent to discus a matter of
this nature and of sueh importance. But 1
feel very strongly on the question o! the propriety o! Part III o! the Bill now before the
House, and it ie, I take it, my humble duty
to Mnlain to my fellow mem-bers, as beet I
can, my reasons for opposing the adoption of
that part.
Wjth regard to other parts of this Bill, I
wish to say but a word. I have followed with
all the care I could the proceedings o! the
Cornrittee which has had this Bill under consideration., and 1 would say only thie, that I,
at any rate, ar n ot able to suggest any iiprovement upon the work of that Cornrittee
se> far as Parte I and II of this Bill are concerned. May I say thet in rny opinion the
Cornmittee welh deserved the compliments that
were interchanged arnong the leading members at the conclusion of its labours.
But the position with regard to Part III
of the proposed statute seerne to me entirely
different. I bave asked myseif many tirnes,
while reading the proceedinge before the Standing Committee, and thinking over what it
was doing during the hast tihree monthe, what
reason there was for needing the work of euoh
a special and unusual kin.d o! tribuna a
that which is proposed to, be set up by Part

SENATE
III. It is, I take it, plain that thcre was no
neoil of any such tribunal so far as the
National Systemn is concerned. That system,
in substanace, is oivned by the people of
Canada; there are no other stockholders. The
people of Canada, speaking by thoir representatives in Parliament, control the whole
undert-aking of the National Svstem, just as
ordinary sharehelders control the management of tiheir own prcportv in the case of
anv private company. Apart altoget.her f rom
the legisiative .iurisdliction over the National
Company posse-'sedl by the Parliament of
Canada, there i., that absolute control whieh
shareholders have over the property and
management of any compa.ny in which they
own the majority of the stock. Accordingly,
there was no need of any special arbitral
board to control the Canadian National lines.
The management must obcv any mandate that
Parliament chooses to express. So these
clauses of Part III can be, needed only for
control of the comipeting company, the
Canadian Pacifie.
Nonw, I ask inyýelf, is that a fair plan? I
should be inclined to go, and I venture to
go, a step further and express the opinion
personally that it nover was fair play te the
Canaîlian Pacifie t.o have set up as a coinpetitor tbe whole poople of Canada iii 1)5esinof the Canadian National lices.
I
should like to adopt, an(l nake themi my
own, the sentiments expressed in that respect
by Mr. Beatty, the president of the Canadian
Pacifie Railway, ia a speech delivered by him
te the Canadian Club of Toronto on the lfith
day of January last. He said:
We have set up a railivay system owned by
the State in competition-at tirnes unrestraineýd
and sev'ere conipetition-with a privately owned
eoiiipacy- apparently under the delusion that
cempetition of that kind could contain any
elenients of fairnes9s or equality. Caa the State
comipote fairly with a citizen of the State?
Most aisstiredly it canniot. Can a private coinpany conmpete on anythiag like f air terras with
a railwav systemi backed by the long purse of
the State?
Again, it cannet.
Should the
180,000 sceerity and share ho-lder.s of the Canadian Pacifie 6ee their henest inveistnient, hased
on confidence in Canada and i.ts Government,
maenaeed by suchl conipetition, even if the credit
of the country coul(l sustain, whieh it cannot,
the losses incidlent to that systein of administration of a great public utility? The answer
again maust be no.
1 can only say that those are my sentiments,
and I îvanted the opportunity to put them
upon record here.
Noxt I should like to point eut who are the
sharehelders of the Canadian Pacific Railway,
or at least indicato in a general way their
distribution. I have in my hand a copy of, I
think, the latest annual report of the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company, the report for
lon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH.

the Year ended fourteen menths age. Lt is
îssued. as of March, 1932. The statemont is
made that the holdings of ordinary and prefercace stocks of the Canadian Pacifie Railway
Company in December, 1931, were distributed
in this way, as shown in the sohedule: 0f the
total holdings of urdinary and common stock
cf tho company sixty per cent-three-fifths of
the property-were thon held by sharehiolders
resident in the British Empire outside cf
Canada. Those are mon, women and children
w~ho have no representatien in the Parliament
cf Canada, ne one te rise and speak, on their
behaîf. Canadians own less than fiftoen per
cent. It is only that comparatively small percentage cf the shareholders of the Canadian
Pacifie wvho by their cwn represontatives have
a voice in this Parliament.
Dees iL net beheeve us, thon, te look the
more jealously and carefully after the interests cf those people w-ho, te se large an extont, have contributed te the building up cf
this company? The Canadian Pacifie Railway
as an institution in this country is just as
much a part cf the federal compact as the Intercelonial Railway.
The Intercolonial was
liiilt, by the people cf Canada. The Canadian
Pacifie Railway wvas built by private individuels eut cf mcney tlîey hiad, or were able te
raise, but it wvas built 'as a condition of the
entrance inte Cenfederation cf British Cclumibia, just as the Intercolonial, as a part cf
flic foderal compact, wvas built fer the bouefit of the Maritime Provinces. The Canadian Pacifie Railway to-day, and its shareholders, wherever they may be resident, are
entitled te just as great a measure cf fair play
at the hands cf the Parliament cf Canada as
is any citizen cf this country, or as is the
whole country combined in its ownership cf
the Canadian National System. Te my mmnd
the shareholders of the Canadian Pacifie are
net getting that measure of fair play at ail if
ycu subj oct thema te the control cf this arbitral board which Part III cf the Bill sots up.
I have tried to indicate why iL seemns tc
me it nover was a fair thing on the part cf
t.he Parliament cf Canada tc set up a coinpotitive umdertaking as against tlîe Canadien
Pacifie Railway. If you net only establisha
such an undertaking, but insist on the
continuation of the competition, yen are
perpetuating the evil, and, in my humble
judgment. attempting te have something done
which hu.manly is flot possible.
In trving to realize in my ow-n mind the
present situation as between the two competing coccerasq. I cannet think cf any better
illustration than that cf a couple cf sehoolboys struggling la some athlet-ic compotitivo
effort. Suppose vou have tîvo boys engaged

FEBRUARY 23, 1933
in a wrestling match who at the start of the
contest are fairly eve.nly matiched. One of
themi happens to be the schoolmaster's son.
The schoolmaster is necessarily the umpire.
The wrestling goes on until the scîhool'master's
boy is apparently flot making much of a suecess in the struggle, and is even showing signe
of being tired out. Then t.he master interferes
and takes each boy in hand. He says to
them: "You two must keep up this competitien. It is essential. You have to go on
with the struggle until even your laat breath.
But to make this a littie fairer 1 arn going te
change the rules. You have got to ce-eperate;that is to say, each of you must help the other
as much as hie can. I can handie my own boy:
hie is mine. As for you"-turning to the other
boy-"'I think it would be better to tie one
of your hands, if flot both, behind your back;,
then you mus't go on with the competition."
Some Hou. SENATOR.S: Oh, oh.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLE.SWORTH: Well,
that seems to me to be exactly the situation
that wili exist if we pass Part III of this Bill.
lJndoubtedly it is going to hamper the operations of the Canadian Pacifie management. It
cannot hurt the National Raiiwaye, because
that road, wîth ail it.s works, is already under
the control of Parliament-practicaiIy of the
Government. No matter how many trustees
or dîrectors you appoint, Parliament, or
rather the flouse of Cemmons, holds the
purse strings, and they cannot get a penny
of money to spend on any of their proposais
unless Parliament chooses to give it to them.
So Pa.rliament already controls the National
Company to the fullest extent.
What will the clauses of this Bill do in the
establishment of this tribunal so far as the
Canadian Pacifie is concerned? Well,' to the
hest of my power I have given honest consideration to the clauses in arder to try to
make up my mind as to how far they go.
The language is so general, se wide, that for
my part I certainiy arn not able to formi an
opinion. But I should like to state, because
to me it is a part of the trouble, just one
thing that occurred to me as I was on the
train Tuesday afiternoon. Fromn Toronto te
Belleville the tracks of the two lines, the
National and the Pacifie, are side by aide fo,
mile after mile; nothing wbatever between
the two rights of way except the boundary
line. But one of those two roads is doubletracked, and the other is not. Suppose the
Canadian Pacific Company, which at present
has enly a single track between Toronto and
Montreal, wanted to double-traek. It says,
"We have the money, or we can raise it, and
we intend te double-track our road se it can

compete on even terms with the National."
That might be made a matter of dispute, and
therefore referable te this arbitral board if you
set it up. I cannot tell deflnitely, but I think
fromi the language of this Bill there would be
ample reem for the opinion that in those circumstances, if the Canadian National Railway
or its Iiminarement did net feel disposcd te
agree te the Canadian Pacifie Railway doubletracking its road hetween Montreal and
Toronto, the arbitral board, through the Chief
Commissioner, could veto the "proposai " and
say, "Ne, we wîil prevent yeu."
Even if that opinion is net correct in the
instance I have given, there are certainly
many cases in which the Chief Cemmissioner
would have that power of veto. Is it net one
of the greatest handicaps under which any
railway company could be placed? If you
take from it the dominion over, and the control of, its own property, are you net in substance expropriating for the general benefit of
the people of Canada the property of the
Canadian Pacifie Railway Company? It would
certainly seem se te me, and 1 liken the
situation te the nearest parallel I can think
of at the mement-the position that any
ordinary farmer would be in, suppesing hie
were competing wîth his neighber, as of course
every farmer muet be, and the legislature
chose te say with regard te bis farm: "The
owner shaîl ne longer have the right te decide
what crops hie will plant, or how hie will run
his farm; but a judge, or the sheriff, or some
impartial third person, shahl do the deciding
and shaîl tell him whether hie is te plant bis
farmi in wheat or is te turn it into a dairy
farmn or te grow cabbages or onions." The
moment such legislation is enacted, the value
of that piece of land is lesened, net merely
in the hands of the landowner at the time
of the passing of the -legislation, but in the
hands of any possible future ewner or possesser. As a piece of property it is net worth
as much as it was when the owner had absolute
dominion over t.he uses te which hie should
put it.

That is simply partial expropriation.

If the people of Canada are advised te
exprepriate the whole undertaking of the Canadian Pacifie Railway, of course they must
pay for it. That is the general law; that is
natural justice. Is it any the less natural
justice, whether or net it is within the four
corner,- of the Exprepriation Act, that if you
are geing to lessen the value of the Canadian
Pacifie Railway undertakmng for the benefit
of the generai public of Canada you ought te
pay compensation? 1 urge that it is ne lesa
natural justice, and I respectfully submit that
the passing of this Bihl with Part III inciuded,
or the taking away of the control and manage-

284

SENATE

ment of their own property from the sharehoiders and directors of the Canadian Pacifie
Company, is in substance an expropriation
pro tanto of the property of those men, and
ought never to be permitted unless fair and
proper compensation is paid for the depreciation which will ensue.
Those, in brief, are some of the reasons why
I certainly feel entirelv unable to support any
such arbitral-I alrmost said arbitrary-tribunal as the one which this Part III of the
Bill creates.
I want tosay merely one other word. Everybody, I suppose, agrees in the opinion that
the present Chief Commissioner of the Railway Board, who is to be the arbitrator, is in
every way a superior man; that there could
not be found any better man to be named as
chief arbitrator or controller under the provisions of this Bill. But we are legislating not
merely for to-day, but for untold time in the
future. Who knows how long the country
may have the services of the gentleman who
is now the Chief Commisisoner? Who knows
who his successor may be? Or, I might add,
who knows how fit that successor may be to
discharge these duties?
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators-speaking to the amendment-I yield
to no member of this House nor to any man
in this country in my respect for the achievements and prestige, and the hopes for the
future, of the great Canadian Pacifie Railway.
Even so, I regret more than anything eise that
I have experienced in many moons the discussion that has developed this afternoon on
the amendment proposed by the honourable
senator from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder). It
seems to me that the amendment as proposed
and the discussion that has taken place on it
have raised issues of far greater importance
than any question affecting the railway situation of Canada.
Let us for a moment talk of the railway
situation. Much has been made of it by all
classes of Canada's citizens during the past
few months, even the past few years; and
very properly so. There has been an enormous-yes, I think it might be said to be an
unnecessary and unfair-financial exaction
from the Canadian people by reason of the
railway situation. But is the condition of the
railways in Canada to-day any worse than
that of the great agricultural industry, which
is so important to Canada, or of the great
paper industry, the great lumber industry, the
great fishing industry, and many other industries that I might enumerate, which are of
equally great importance to Canada? No. The
railway situation appeals to us because we
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH.

regard it as imposing upon the Canadian
people an unduly heavy load, a charge of
$1,000,000 a week, and because we want,
through the exercise of business judgment and
reasonable and proper economies, to stop the
loss of $1,000,000 a week from the pockets of
the Canadian people. That point of view is
altogether commendable.
I sat for a number of weeks in the Railway
Committee of the Senate of Canada without
being informed that the situation really involved some questions I know nothing of, and
that, more important than the desire of the
Canadian people to reduce the operating costs
of the Canadian railways and secure economies,
there was another consideration, namely, the
idea that some great industry or public utility
was to be regarded as "holier than thou," and
as untouchable, even when the interest of the
Canadian peopile was invodved. I know that
for many years it has been said that the
Canadian Pacifie Railway made and unmade governments, and dictated government
policies, but never until this afternoon had I
heard such a complete exempdification of the
beliefs of certain distinguished gentlemen in
that respect. Again I say, I give place to no
man in my respect for the Canadian Pacifie,
past and present, and my hope for its future,
but if that is the issue now, let us deal with it
and find out whetther or not the Canadian
Pacific is in such a position that in the interest of Canada's ten mi'lilion citizens it may
not be controlled or in any way prevented from
fohiowing its own sweet will and doing whatever it wishes.
This afternoon we heard our good friend
who does not like to be questioned, and who
bas left the House, express what to me seemed
very peculiar views. I an going to try to
deal with some of them. First he touched
upon a question that is close to home: he
spoke of the McAdoo Award as one of the
causes of the present situation. Ail right, let
it go at that. Let us admit that. Who, may
I ask, gave effect to the McAdoo Award in
Canada? The honourable gentleman was a
member of the Cabinet that passed Privy
Council Order No. 1768, from which I quote
the fohowing:
and it further appears that the railway conpanies are of the view that the wages paid
railway employees in Canada ought to be the
saine as that adopted in corresponding territories in the United States, as the c ass of
work is the same in both countries. That there
is a large interchange of traffic, and that as a
result, many employees w-ork in both countries;
and on the further grounds that different organizations are international in their scope, and that
heretofore, the wage scales in both countries
have been relatively the same.

FEBRUARY 23. 1933
In the same Order it was ruled:
That the scale of wages of railway employees
as fixed by the McAdoo Award in United
States territory, including any aanendmnents or
extensions thereof, be applied in Canad.ian
territory, in s0 far as al i nes of railways
owned, operated or controlled by the Goveonment, are concerned.
But now cornes the gemn of Privy Council
Order 1768, issued on the l6th of July, 1918
-w.hat appears to be the gem when we recali
the considered arguments presented by the
honourable gentleman this afternoon. In
July, 1918, he and bis associates said:
That the wage ocales of privately owned
railway companies in Canada should be simila.rly
advanced.
Why, 1 ask, in the light of this dictation
or suggestion to the great Canadian. Pacifie
Railway by the members of thc Government
in power ini 1918, is it en.tirely improper to
suggest to it in 1933 that in thc interest
of the Canadian. people just a littie control
may be needed? That it is entirely improper
is what we are asked to accept and swallow
to-day.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Will my honourable
friend allow me?
Hon. Mr. MURDOGK: No.
Some Hon. SENATORS:, Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: There is nobody
who fears questions much less than I do, but
what is sauce for thc goose is sauce for the
gander.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable members, 1 riscHon. Mr. MURDOCK: Wýill my honourable friend kindly sit down?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: 1 rise to a questionThe Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable gentleman, I understand, rises to a point
of order.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I rise to, a question
of privilege.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I understand it to
be the rule of the otiher House that a inember
may risc to a question of privilege at any
time.
Hon. Mr. .CASGRAIN: Not during the
discussion.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Is that the rule of
this House? I should like to have a ruling
on tha.t.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Proceed. 1 should
have let you do so before. I amn sorry.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: I waited un Vil the
honourable gentleman had completed lis statement a.nd was about to staa't another before
I a.sked tlie privilege of correcting him. What
I said was this, that it had been stated, by
those who should know, that the McAdoo
Award as adopted ini Canada had increa.sed
the oost of m.a&trials, wages and maintenance.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Everybody admits
that.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is ail I said.
Why all the excitement? 1 arn not denying
at ail that that was donc, and the honourable
gentleman should not att.empt, I thinkHon. Mr. MURDOCHÇ: The honourable
gentleman madie his speech. W4ll lie please
let me make mine?
Hon,. Mr. CALDER: Do iit fairly.
Hon. Mr. MURDOOX: I lcnow it is a
favourite pasti-me of some gentlemen who
want to tiekie VIe car of the unknowing public
Vo refer to the McAdoo Award and sudh
things; in othier words, to place the onus on
the victim. That lias been tIe policy and
procedure of many distinguislied gentlemen
tlirougîout Canada for a number of years,
aind it will do no harrn Vo, give the reai facts
of tlie case. Tliat is tlie only object I have
in view.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: My lonourable fricnd
las just admitted tihat what I said was truc.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCIK: That is ail right,
and we will let tInt point pass.
Now, our lonoucable friend went on at
considerable length. Let me sece if I cmn
quote lis lainguage. Re was altogether opposed to (Part III of Vhs Bill that we now
have under considecation.
And lere and
now, perlaps, 1 sliould make tIe confession
tliat i the Senate Committee I moved. a
couple of motions, maybc more, one of wliich
was Vo substitute for the Arbitral Tribunal
rühe Board of Railway Commissioners. I was
opposed to tIc Arbitral Tribunal as tIen proposed. Another motion VInt I made was to
substitute for tlie tribunal an aribitration
board, Vo ha chosen ini the way in which such
boards are usually closen. 1 was firmly of
tIe view that sudh a board would be preferable
to wîat was proposcd in Part III of tihe Bill.
I lava since cîanged my mind absolu.tely,
because this afternoon tlie honourable gentleman raised an issue much larger tlinn anything
involved in the discussion lieretofore. I repeat
this because tlie lon-ourable gentleman was
not in his seait wlen I sta.ted it before. The
question now is wîether a very important, big
public utility, which, it has been charged, lias

tbe strcet, the tail can wag the dog; or
wbether the Canadian Pacifie Railway can
(lictate ternis tu the Caniadian people-yes,
to the Senate and te ftic Parliament of Canada. If the Canadian Pacific Railway or any
other industrv that is dependent for its revenuies and welfare on Canada and the Canadian
people is to be eonsiddcred untouchable and
unapproachable because of ýthis, that or the
other thing, the time bas surely corne for us
to bave a reekoning with ourselves.
On the sixtb day of this montb I listened
to a very sympathetie and impassioned
address by tbe dean of this Cbambcr (Hon.
Mr. Poirier), and at the tirne I tbougbt tbat
some of bis remarks were far-fetced, hased
on a mistaken viexv of tbe facts, and out of
place as utterances cither in the Senate or
elsewbere in Canada. I want to quote a
couple of paragraphs from bis speech and to
admit frankly that maybc I have flot as sound
a grasp of certain affairs as be bas. Tbese
%vordsof bis will be found on p>age 207 of the
Debates of the Sonate:
The miurmiur that reacbes Parliamient from

It is net. I rose
te a point of order, and I amn going te ask
His Honour the Speaker te make a ruling. I
say the bonourable gentleman bas ne rigbt
te attribute te me opinions and utterances
that I bave net expressed. In fact, I made
a, statement contrary te what be says I made.
I said t'hat Parliament had the right, and
should exercise it, te inte.rfere whenever a
private corporation did anything te the public
injury. We all know that Parliament bas

interfered. Why have we a Board of Railway Commissioners? Parliament has taken
from the Canadian Pacifie Railway and other
companies vested rigbts that they hadHon. Mr. MURDOCK: My honourable
friencl talked for one hour and forty minutes,
and he 'has now had another five minutes. Is
hie through? I have the floor, and I arn prepared to stand by what I say.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Be fair; that is ail
I ask.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The honourable
gentleman continually insisted to this House
that there muet be economies, that there must
be control, -but ail the way through bhis remarks there was the intimation that the great
C.P.R. must not be controlled, that it muet
have an absoiutely free hand to do as it sees
fit. In other words-Hon. Mr. CALDER: Mr. Speaker, I rise
again to a point of order, and I asic for a
ruling. I have objected that the honourable
gentleman has no right to attribute to me
words and opinions that I have flot uttered
in this Chamber, yet hie continues to do so.
I say decidedly that I did flot express to this
House the opinion that Parliarnent should
say to the C.P.R., "We will flot touch you,
because you do flot want us to." On the contrary, I say that Parliament has the full right
to interfere, and should exercise that right,
whenever the Canadian Pacifie does a wrong
to the people of Canada. The honourable
gentleman bas no right to charge me with
worde that I have neyer uttered; but, apparently under the impression that hie bas such
a right, he persiste, and I think, Mr. Speaker,
that you should stop him. 1 asic for a rulîng,
Mr. Speaker.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Any denial by
an honourable gentleman must be accepted. I
understand that the honourable senator froni
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) is giving hie
own intrepretation with respect to a speech
that has been delivered, but he cannot go so far
as ta attribute ta another honourable member
words that that bonourable member denies
having said.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I arn greatly
gratified ta have the honourable gentleman so
prom.ptly put us a1l right as to what hie meant.
The amendmrent that hie fathered proposesf
to do what? To put into the hande of the
Canadien people a stuffed club to be used in
controlling our great transportationi services
and securing economies. If the amendment
carnies and Part III of the Bi-I is stnicken out,
we shah bhave to say ta the Canachian Pacifie:

287

"Please, now, corne ]et us reason together and
bring about econornies. Please do not do
certain things." Should the Canadian Pacifie
reply, "We are gomng ta do those things,>
there would be no way to stop them, even
though it were desirabte to do so in the
interest of the people; and if that cornpany
were wrong or unfair in is attitude.-supposing thnt to be possible-it could not be
brought to task. Is that what the Canadian
people are looking for? I doubt it very rnuch.
I shaîl be very much interested to read the
speech that the honourable gentleman bas
made this afternoon, for I really feel that the
issue now is whether the Canadian Pacifie is
in the untouchable ciass. Thousands-I do not
think I should be exaggerating if I said millions-of people in Canada have tbought for
years that it i8 in that clams. If I may make
a confession here, I will admit that 1 voted
in a federal election before I was twenty-one
years of age. At London, Ontario, a very
distinguished citizen was running on the right
side of polities, and though I was just an
ordinary, rough fellow, a rig was provided to
rush me to the polis so that I could mark my
ballot.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Shame.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Does sonieone say
"Shame"? I admit it.
Hon. Mr. MeMIBANS:
Two dollars and
coste.
Hon. Mr. MURDOC.K: But why was it
done? It was part of the "untouchable" campaign that wa-s carried on down through the
years. I am flot criticizing it; I arn merely
stating the fact. I will fight just as long as
wili the honourable gentleman frorn Saltcoats
(Hon. Mr. Calder) for fair treatment for that
great public utility, the Canadian Pacifie Railway, but I say that anyone is making a great
mistake who undertakes to set that company
above the people and Parliament, and to
nullify the weeks of labour that the Senate
bas spent in trying to prepare a Bill that will
bring about real economies. Mistakes of that
kind, if many of them were made-I do flot
tbink there wilI be many of thern-are the
very things that would bring about the conditions against wbich the honourable gentleman
from Acadie (Hon. Mr. Poirier) warned us.
Last night someone asked me if I was going
to make a speech on the Railway Bill, and I
said I boped not, but I did not know. I
shouid have preferred flot to speak. But
yesterday, I amn told, this note was sent to
the gallery from the floor of the Senate:
The fight will be on the third mailing. Tear
Up.

SENATE
The note wvas torn up, but sorneone got it,
pasted it together and brought it to me. Well,
the fight is on the third reading. I have heard
it said that, fot only is there this plan to try
to, mutilate the Bill andl make it non-effective,
to make it a sort of stuffed club in the hands
of the Canadien people. but that if that plan
fails there xvill be an attempt to give the Bill
a six-înonths hoi'.t. Now, no senator represents as manv as I do of the indix'iduals who
are going to make sacrifices on account of this
Bill. Thousands of railroad men are walking
around, through no fanît of their own. with
nothing to do.
Hon. Mr. POPE:

And a lot of others, too.

Hon. Mr. MURJDOCK: They were drafted
into the railway gamne, in thousands of cases,
through the ill-considered building of this, that
and the other line et the expense of the
Canadien people. And now that the thing bas
hlown up, those individuels are cast adrift,
to shift as they mray. If Bill A, or any other
measure, is going to bring about real economies in the railwav'N gamne of Canada, there
will bave to he many more sacrifices made,
anti they will ho borne largely hb' the rank
anti file, many of xvhom bave given the best
years of their life to the railway service.
There is a real neeessity of (loin., something
hiere that will in-.ure co-operation for the purpose of efferting economics, and if they cannot,
be serured 1w volunitary co-operation there
ouglit to bc some compulsory means of settling differonces between tho companies. The
hionourahie gentleman froma Saltcoats (Hon.
Mr. Calder) bas told mie that I misunderstood hima thiis efternoon. I distinetly drew
from his remcrks the conclusion that if the
Cxqnadian Pacifie Reilway-this great, publie
titility, wbich lias been holding vested rights
in Canada for over fortv vears-insisted, for
instance, on taking over the passenger service
l)etwecn Montreal and Ottawa, or the "ib
hall' passenger serv ice h)etw'cen Mýontreal and
Toronto, no one sliould saY it nav; no one
should go so far as to tcIl it that it was not
justified in doing that. It mnust not ho told
that, because it is in the 'btolier than thon"
class. It is time that the honourablo gentleman, and others whio are like minded, divested
themiselves of those ideas and realized thet
the rank anti file of Canadian citizens are
looking et things throughi different, spectacles
to-(lay, that most of thein are willing to play
the ganîe and are sick and tired of thiis noverending catering to the rirhi or noarlvY rich,
and the hig fellow. There lias been too muchi
of that sort oi thing in the past. 0f course,
1 am not making any charge against my

honourablo friend in this respect. But I cen
tell him, this, that hie made one real convert
to-day, when hie convinced me that it is high
time to put into effeet, Part III of the Bill
as it was brought into this Huse, in order
that some of the real economies that Canada's
welfare demands mey ho brought about; if
possible, through co-operation and good feeling between the responsihle officers of hoth
railways, but if thet is not possible, thon

Hon. F. B. BLACK:
Honourable senators, I arn moved to, mako a few remarks
on this emendment, not, I am sorry to sey,
boceuso I arn in complote accord withi any of
the add-resses made by the three honourable
senators who have preceded me. With a
great deal of wbat the honoureble member
for Seltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) said 1 egree
en-tirely, and I aecept bis recital of the conditions that have bmought our railweys into
their present chaotic state.
I am not, a memher of the Railwey Coinnxittco, but I ettendcd as meny of its meetings as I possibly could. Wlhen I first reed
the Bill I was oppo-sed to Paît III, providing
for compulsory arbitretion. It seemced to me
thet it wves a dangerous prineiple and that
hy introducing it, 11o might do certain things
wvhiclî, as legislators, we oughit not to do.
May I also sey that I cm not, a public
owtîeripl man. The history of the operation
of p)ublic utilities in Canada cloarly demonstrates the tact that, under privete control
they siîcceed, whercas under public control
they feu. I do not think any honourable
member cen cite a single publie utility controlîrd by the Federal Government or hy a
provincial govoromient, that lias been a financiel snccess. But publie ownership is not the
question before us to-day. As a matter of fact
the trend of publie opinion, as expressed by our
legislation. is entirely along the lino of
govomnment control of publie utilitios.
I pay very great deference to the greet
legal attainments of the honourable seconder
of the amcndment (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth), but I cen not fully share bis vicws
withi respect to the mnanner in which Part III
would adx ersely affect investors in prix e
comnpanles. What are the faets of the case?
Canada bias alreadv declared for government
control of public utilities. AIl railway, telegraphi and telephone companies operating
tînder a Dominion charter are subjeet to the
jurisdiction of the Railway Commission; those
operating under a provincial charter are subjeet to, the jurisdietion of a public utility comnmission. I cm advised that even the radio
system is to corne under similar control. The

FEBRUARY 23, 1933
Csinadian Pacifie Railway and every other
railway declared to be "for the general advantage of Canada" are subi ect to the provisions of the Railway Act; in other words, they
are controlled by the Board of Railway Commissioners; and, after ail, the regulative powers
of the Railway Commission do nlot differ in
principle fromn the powers with which we propose to, clothe the Arbitral Board to be set
up under Part III of this Bill. Therefore I do
flot share that feeling of "Hands off!1" which
bas been so energetically expressed by the
honourable mover (Hon. Mr. Calder) and the
honourable seconder (Hon. Sir Allen AylesWorth) of -the amendment. We are simply
going just one step further. In rny opinion
the onIy justification for doing so is the very
serious present condition of the railways of
Canada, regardless of what the railway condition may be in other parts of the world.
It is ail very well for us to say to ourselves
-and I said it to myself several times during
the sittings of the Railway Comrittee-thatt
we are taking a further step towa.rds interierence with private enterprise. We are; there
is no question about that. In part, we are
going to interfere with the rights of the stockholders of the Canadian Pacific Raîlway Comnpany. Are we justified in doing so? Personally, I have corne to the conclusion that
if we are not justified this Bill should neyer
'have been submîtted to us. I have considered
the Bill very carefully, and I have reached
the opinion that without Part III it is useless.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear hear.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I subrnit that the tirne
spent by the Duf! Commission and by the
Railway Committee is simply wasted unless
Part HII is passed as an integral part of the
Bill.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear hear.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: The honourable seconder
of the arnendment gave an illustration of two
ipchoolhoys engaged in a wrestling match. Is
it not a fact that the National Raîlway and
the Canadian Pacific Railway have been in
what might be termed a state of armed
neutrality towards each other? That is,' they
have raid, "We wiIl work together when we
hbave to, and only then." I arn quite in accord
-wîth the opinion expressed by rny honourable
friend that the competition of the Canadian
National was unfair to the C.P.R., and should
neyer have been perrnitted. I do not think
that any one who has to consider business
matters as they should be considered can takre
any other view. But it Is an accomplished
fact, and we have to make the best of the
situation in which we find ourselves.

289

When the late president of the Canadian
National Railways took over the system what
did he do? He created an esprit de corps
among the rank and file. I have no fault to
find with him on th4t account, except for the
fact.that he created that esprit de corps at an
enormous expense to the people of Canada.
H1aving done that, then undoubtedly he embarked on a camýpaign of competition with
bis only visible rival, the C.P.-R. He did it
by the use of the public purse, which was not
safeguarded by the members of these two
Houses of Parliarnent. He spent hundreds
and hundreds of millions of dollars, in part, to
improve the system itself, and, in part, for a
competitîve club to use agaînst the Canadian
Pacific Railway.
We had a number of years of that cornpetitive condition. One company would build
a hotel, then the other company would buîld
a rival hotel; one company would put a new
passenger boat into service, the other company would immediately follow suit; and so
on aIl down the line. This ruinous cornpetition
continued year after year. Does any one think
that that spirit of competition is dead? I
assert it is not dead. It may be dormant at
the present moment, but it is not dead, and
the mere fact that the head of one of these
two great railway systems bas left our shores
will not change that fundamental condition of
affairs. Consequently I subrnit that if you
have no better means of getting the respective
mnanagemnents of the two railway systema dloser
together than you have at the present time,
those basic economies which should. be put
into effeet wîll neyer be undertaken. It is
not in human nature for us to expect otherWise.
This caîls to mind a point to which I shall
direct notice, to prevent misappréhensi<m. The
mover of the amendment said that between
1928 and 1931 economies had been effected
to the extent of $100,000,000. 1 arn very sorry
to say that that is not a fact.
Hon. Mr. CALDER.- No. If the hionourable gentleman will allow me-I said in 1932
the operating costs of the C.N.R. had been
reduced by 8100,000,000 as compared with
those of 1928.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: If the honourable gentleman will refer to Hansard to-morrow he
will find that he used the word "economies.»
I do not think he intended to use the word.
I would point out te the honourable gentleman that if you use one side of the balance
sheet without taking into account the other
you do not get a true picture of the operating
resuits. Accepting his statement that there
was a reduction in operation costa of 8100,000,-

53721-19
REVISEfl EDMTON

SENATE

290

000, let me ask, how was it brought about? I
submit, flot because economies were effected.
If he will study those figures he will find the
actual economies amounted Vo hetween $Il,000,000 and $12,000,000, owing Vo the fact that
there was less freight and passenger traffie, and
consequently trains had Vo be discontinued.
That is, while the operating costs were $100,000,000 less, on the opposite side of the shield
ýthere was something to offset this reduction;
SQ there was very littie actual saving.
I desire also Vo direct attention to a point
that I think was deait wit-h in the Railway
Committee; if not, it was brought Vo my
notice by a railway man. While we have
made very material economies in, the operation
of the Canadian National Railways since the
resignation of the late president-economies
very largely due, I think, to the energy displayed by the Minister of Railways and hy
the present head of the Canadian National
System in their efforts Vo get down Vo an economical basis--yet I amn told the operating
resuit for last montb is even worse than that
for the corresponding month of 1932. What
does that mean? Simply that sometbing must
be done to bring about the utmýost economy
in the operation of our railways.
I do not think we can bring about that
economy without the help of an Arbitral
Board suoh as is provided for under Part III
of the Bill. I submit that only under this
Arbitral Board wiIl it be possible Vo bring
about the basic economies necessary Vo put
the C.N.R. in shape Vo operate even for a few
years more; and in my opinion iV will help
the Canadian Pacific Vo operate very mueh
more cheaply. Why? Because there exists
between these two roads a fundamental antagonism which is noV Vo be wiped out in a day.
You may caîl that antagonism competition,
for that is what it is. But it is not dead; it
is simply dormant for the time being. I may
point Vo sometbing comparable Vo this state of
affairs in the antagonism that has existed between France and Germany since the days
of Bismarck, sometimes under the surface,
sometimes above. Suppose you were Vo ask
France and Germany Vo geV together on a
voluntary reduetion of armament. France has
a superior navy, Germany a superior air force.
Germany would say to France, "Yes, you
must reduce vour navýy." France would say
to Germany, "But you must reduce your air
force." Do you think that if France and
Germany were let alone they would ever
agree on a reduction of armament?
An Hon. SENATOR: ThD League of Nations
might hring iA about.
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

Hon. Mr. BLACE: That is, in mny view,
exacetly what is goingVo happen with these two
railroads if you have not some effective moeans
of bringing about joint action. If theîtwo railway mnanagements are noV confronted with this
statute providing for com.pudsory arbitration,
I arn afraid there will be very littie use in
j oint termninads, very littile abandonment of
]ines here and! Vhere; in a word, thei'e wil be
failure to bring about those basic economies
whicb are neoessary 'for the protection, anid
contin-ued operation of both t-hese great railway systems.
Yesterday 1 distiened with a great deal of
interest Vo the remarks of thbe honouabde
senitor frorn Bedford (Hon. Mr. Pope). My
only regret is that he did, noV give us a little
more information as to what parts, if not ail,
of the Canadian National lines the syndicate
whidh he mentioned was ready to take over;
and if he had given us something more definite
regarding the syndicate, he would, I think,
have -donc a still greater service to the country.
1 hope he will go furt.ber and lay before the
Governiment the seheme which he then gave
us onily in outline. If as a resudt of bie efforts
sorne private corporation makes an offer to
take this railway burden off the shoiders of
the people of Canada, and that offer 15
aec.eptcd, I -can assure hum he will earn the
gratitude of many generations to corne. There
is nothing in this Bill Vo prevent -the Governr.
ment from receiving such an offer with open
arms. I refer to this because from my point
of view we ohould be ready to go into -the
merits of any reasonable suggestion that .may
býe offered to lighten the burden now pressing
so heavily upon the shoulders of the taxpaye.rs
of this Dominion.
Unless Parliament is prepared to carry out
almost in their entirety the principles of the
Duff report, then we had, better k-itl this Bill.
Personalily I cannot aecept the amendiment.
Its adoption would vitiate the whole Bila; it
wouild take away its teeth and tender it of
no practicall value.
I dio flot aocept the view that Part III means
confiscation of the C.P.R. As I have said, we
have almost as much confiscation of the rights
of the railways in the regulative powers now
cx<rcised by tlhe Rai.way Commission as would
bc possible under the proçposed tribunal. The
arbitral powcrs can be invoked 'by either party,
if it can convinoe the Chief Com:missioner that
a tribunal is nec.nssary. The preoent Chairmnan of the Board of Railwvay Comrnissioners
is exceptionally wedl qutallified Vo discharge the
duties of his office. 11e havin.- decided that a
tribunal is ncessary, of whora is it cornposed?
HIe him.self beicomes the pre-siding officer, and

FEBRUARY 23, 1933
he is assisted by a representative frein either
road. I think it wibl be admitted thiat that
should be a pretty fair tribunal, a tribunal that
is not likely to confiscate the property of the
Canadian Pacifie. Indeed, confiscation is flot
the purpose of the tribunal; its purpose is to
conserve railway property.
Honeuraible members, I hope the Bill wili
be given third reading and tihat it wâl be
endorsed ia its entirety by the other Chamber.
Hon, C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable mesnbersSome Hon. SENATORS: I-t is six o'clock.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: May I during the
short interval before recess place before the
House a statement that the honourable member for De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique) fi-as
requested me to read. He had te leave unexpectedly by the afternoon train. This is
the statement:
Honourable niembers, I need net say that I
arn net a prophet nor a son of a prophet, but in
the exerciee of a very ordinary judgment, in a
letter written, I think, in 1917, te fr Henry
Drayton, then Minister of Finance, 1 said that
our purchasing the Grand Trunk Railway, and
Government operation of railways, would bring
the country to ruin. I have nlot at present a
copy of rny letter, but -with the leave of the
Senlate I will have an extract of it placed on
Hansard.
(The extract eubmitted by Hon. Mr. Béiqýue
is frorn a letter addre6sed to -Sir Henry Drayton
under date of October 14, 1919, and reads as
followe:
"Te my mind the nationadizatien policy of railways cannot be further continued without bringing the country te ruin.")
If the Heuse prefers te rise now, I shall
reserve my rernarks until 8 o'clock.
At 6 o'clock the Senate took recess.
The Senate resumed at 8 e'clock.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I rise to a point
of order. Rule 65 of the Sena-te reads:
A senator may, at any time before a Bill is
passed, move for the reconsideration of any
clause thereof, already passed.
Then there is a reference to Bourinot, page
526, where I find the following:
A senator may, at any time before a bill has
passed, move for the reconsideration of any
clause thereof already passed.
The samne practice sometimes obtains in
Commons committees, but it is nlot one to be
encouraged, since it is obviously at variance
with the sound principle wbich prevents either
the bouse or committee paseing on the same
question twice. The proper time for the reconsideration of an, amnended bill is after report
from cemmittee, when, under Englieh practice
-wbîcih might advantageeusly be followed ia the
Canadian Comions-it is competent to mae
amendmnents, and reconsider the bill; or in any
53721-19à

291

case, it may be sent back, and the cemsnittee
regularly aut-horized te reconsider it in an>'
particular.
I should like teo drs.w the attention of the
House to the fact that at yesterday's sitting
of the Committee of the Wýhole we passed
Bill A, including Part III, with certain amendments, and reported it to the Senate for third
reading. It would have been quite within the
conipetenoe -of the henourable senator frem
Saltceats (Hon. Mr. Calder) te move to-day
for a refer-ence back of the entire Bill for
the. purp ose of reconsidering Part III; but it
seems to me te be entirely eut of order, the
Bill baving hef t the Committee of tJhe Whole
yesterday, for the honourable senator to propose, in amendment te a motion which onl.y
contemphates the third reading of the Bill as
adopted lin Committee of the Whao1e, te
strike out Part 111. 1 take the position that
the entire discussion of this afternoon should
have taken place in Committee of the Whole,
after a reference back of the Bill for the purpose of reconsideraitim.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable members, speaking te the point of order raised,
I quite agree that that ruhe exists. 1 was
quite aware of it, but 1 took the opportunity
to consuit those who should knew what the
practice of the Senate has been, notwithistanding the rifle, and 1 was assured that for
many years pa.st the course that 1 pursued
had been followed in this Chamber. However,,
lest Mr. Speaker should rule that my amendment is eut of order, I have prepared an
amendment which. is in accordance with the
suggestion of my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Murdock). No good purpose would be served,
however, by myself or any person else being
put te the necessit>' of moving it. The question
ie before the House; we ail know what it la;
it would be onhy a matter of going through
another forrnality, which is net necessary. Se
I wouhd suggest t.hat if the honourable member presses bis point of order Mr. Speaker
give bis decision.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I would respectfully press my point of order. I think we
should keep within the ruhes of order as much
as we can.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: As I said, the practice is welh recognized.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Ia answer to
the point of order ralsed by the honourable
senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock),
I find tha:t clause 92 ef the Forme of Preceeding of the Senate of Canada reads as follows:
New clauses may be added or other amendmente may be made te a public Bill at its third
reading or passing.

In Bourinot, at page 531, 1 flnd the
following:
In the Senate, bis are constantly amended
on the third reading witbout going back to
commit tee.
Under these circumstances I arn of the
opinion that our proceedings are in order,
and that the point of order is flot well taken.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable gentlemen, the ground has been so well covered
by our honouraible colleagues fromn Salteoats
(Hoo. M*r. Calder) and North York (Hon. Sir
Allen Aylesworth) that I shall make but a
brief reference to only two points. I cannot,'
however, pass on without some allusion to
the pronouncement of our honourable colleague from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock).
When he spoke of what he called the privileged classes, I detected in bis voice what
I should cali a professional vibration. From
bis attitude I could almoet imagine him
addressing a crowd of so-called downtrodden
people, for wbom the privileged classes, of
course, have no compassion. Perbaps my honourable friend will agree with me that the
privileged classes bave gone-by the board, or
that to-day their only privilege is that of
bearing beavier debts, heavier responsibilities,
and heavier taxes, out of which tbe proletariat
is fed, clothed, and protected. There is a
French proverb that says, "You cao always
find a man more miserable than youraelf." I
cao tell my bonourable friend that the accusations whicb be hurled witb a liglit heart and
a vigorous band at what be calîs the privileged classes are, strange to say, levelled at
bimself. Tbe aristocrats of labour!l Time and
again tbis bonourable gentleman who points
with scorn to the .privileged classes lias been,
s0 to speak, banished fromn tbe proletariat. He

emerged from tbe old days, fromn the days of
the Frenchi Revolution, when everybody was

Well, I do flot
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
mind tbat remark in the slightest,' as I was
talking of the bonourable gentleman. Tbis is
Wby sbould my

special reasons-I will not namne them-to

way problemr, and, if my bonourable friend
will permit me to say so, it ivas absolutely out
of place.
There are two questions that I sbould like
to ask with reference to tbe Bill. Tbe first
one is tbis: Is it necessary tbat we sbould
pass Part III? I humbly submit that it is
not. I shaîl try to state my reasons briefly.
Tbe Government bas prepared the Bill for
the purpose of creating machinery to bring
about economies in tbe operations of the
railways, and as part of that macbinery three
trustees who wi.ll be put in charge of tbe
Canadian National. Now, is it conceivable
that the trustees, wvhose appointment will be
made only after a great deal of care on tbe
part of the Goverument, would do less than
their utmost to effect ail practical economies
on the publicly-owned road? In my bumble
opinion it is 'not. If tbey failed to do so
they would be acting directly contrary to tbe
purpoýse for which tbey were appoiýnted.
Goodness knows tbat tbe country will be
able to use for other purposes aIl the money
tbe trustees are able to save. These men
mwould sacrifice their reputations and their positions if tbey did not rcasonably fulfil the
hopes reposed in tbem, and they would be
relicved of office as soon as possible under
the law.
What about tbe Canadian Pacifie Railway?
Can anyone imagine tbat tbat company would
dcliberately wish to compete witb tbe Canadian National, which is backed by the
national treasury? Tbat is flot imaginable.
In the past the Canadian Pacifie bas comnpeted, for defensive reasons; but does any
honourable member tbink, that it would
engage in extravagant competition with tbe
Canadian National to-day?
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: It bas been trying to
do so?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Wben?
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: For many years.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Tbat is just wbat
I said, that in the past it did compete, for
defensive reasons. But is it conceivable tbat
between n0w and next session tbere wilI be
extravagant competition between the railways?
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Not after tbis Bill passes.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
My honourable
friend will not answer my question. He knows
very well that tbat is impossible. For one
tbing, tbe companies bave not tbe money that
would be required. He also knows tbat public
opinion would not stand for extravagant comn-

petition. Therefore, I submit there is no
danger that within a year the two railways
will compete in a way that would be injurious
to the treasury of Canada.
Furtbermore, during the past two meonthe
representatives of both roads have been sitting
down together and considering a numiber of
proposed measures of econorny. What hais
heen the resuit? They have agreed upon
every point so far. That was stated to the
Railway Committee by Mr. Grant Hall, represe;ýting the Canadian Pacifia, and Mr.
Fairweather, representing the Canadian National. Then, why is it necessary to regard
this legisiation as urgent? It bas been said
here that the Bill would be of no use if Part
III were eliminated. I entirely disagree with
that.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Would rny hontourable
friend permit me to ask him a question?
Hme. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Two.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: W.hen Mr. Hall aind
Mr. Fairweather were before the Railway
Cornrni'ttelhey we!re sled to furnish partiSkIrs of eemnornies thaM had been effected
dui~rig the paiet two months, a>nd nei-ther one
could, give us any informnation of what had
been done i that respect.
Hon. Mr. REAUBIEN: I tthink my honourable friend is quite right. These two gentlemen stated that representatives of their
respective railways had been negotiating for
two menthe and had agreed on ail the matters
submitted to them. The important fact is that
they haïve ap'eed aind. have had noe need of
enforoed arbitration.
Ycu camnot expect
geater reSuits tha.n that in two m'on-the.
I nK>w corne rto my second question. Since
Vis legislation la not urgenjtly required, cam
we nlot pestpene the passage of it until next
session, aaxd pas lt. then, if it sh-ould be f.ound
neceseary to do so? I amn sbool.utely convinced that if the Bill becomes law Part III
will neyer be resorted to, between now and
next session, at ail events; and I think I can
go se far as to say thet a greait mainy of my
celleagues in this House are of the same
opinion, aind it is for this reasen that they
are ready to agree to Psrt III.

FEBRUARY 23, 1933
House that the Bill seeks to be a solution of
a very serious railway condition, going indeed
to the financial stability of the whole
Dominion, and, further, to imipress upon the
House that a really critical situation confronte us--that we are nlot dealing with something *hich is merely incidentai and wthich
an ordinary amendment or something in the
way of a direction can be expected to cure. We
are dealing with the heaviest burden that
overhangs tihis nation; we are dealing with a
problemn that has baffied some of our clearest
minds, and with a difficulty from which some
of the brightest men of our Confederation
fecl we can neyer escape.
We are the owners of a railway system in
whîch some 82,600,000,000 is now invested. As
such owners we are in competition with another great railway syst>em, into which a lesser
sum, but stiil a gigantie total, has found its
way. We are draining the treasury and exhausting the borrowing powers of our country
to make good gigantic annual deficits aggregating sncb a figure s would have appalled
us in other years. Su.rely this shouid summon
us te meet the difllculty to the very utmost of
out resources. A million dollars a week has
been mentioned to-night, as the deficit that
we face now, but that million a week is the
annual interest that muet be met on the debt
due the public by the National System. The
railway is not paying, even aside from its
obligations, and in addition to the interest
obligation which I have named there is another total, comuparable with that, due the
Federal Government as jnterest on loans. AU,
this is overhanging a country of 10,000,000
people, and overhanging it at a time of sore
distress in which we take our place and struggle
along with ail other peoples of the world. It
is in this position we find ourselves to-day.
In the short reviefw that 1 intend to make I
shail try to gather the minda of honourable
members around the central problem that is
before us, the implementing by statute, if we
deem it wise, of the report of a commission
which made definite and specific recommendations. I have nlot heard very mucli said of
that report in any of the speeches made to
-date. Indeed, I have flot heard any speciflo
reference to any clause of the Bihl, and very
much as I respect Mr. Beatty in the excellent
addresses he bas given, I venture te suggest
that the report and the Bill itelf are actually
of more consequence now than the addresses
of the President of the Canadien Pacific. We
have te study, and study carefully, the contents of both the report and the Bill in order
intelligently to discharge the crucial duty that
devolves upon us to-night.

295

Why we are in this impasse I do not intend
te discuss, at ail events to the extent of
belabouring the issue. I do refer to it merel.y
that I may make what I hope will be an, itelligent reply to certain allegations of the
honourable senator from. North York (Hon.
fr Allen Aylesworth). I do not want to
assume that we are in titis difficulty because
we have adopted a wrong principle in foilowing the path of goverument Qperation of railways. I have neyer been an impassioned,
partial advocate of governmnent ownership and
operation of railways, but I take exception to
the statement. that it simply camiot suoceed,
that it is wrong in conception and wrong in
principle, and that that is why we are where
we are to-day.
There are to-day many public utilities
operated by stes or by provinces the world
over, and some of them operated with a very
great degree of success. Speaking as one who
I think should k'now, and certainly speaking
conscientiously, I say that in this Dominion,
I believe, we have perhaps the most conspicuous instance of successfui operation of
a great utility by the State that can be found
in the world. Many a city operates its
utilities, and operates them well. We cannot
say the prînciple is wrong. It snay be wrongly
applied, it may be wrongly executed, but it is
not because of anything wrong in the conception that we are in this difficuIt position.
The ownership of this great system, with the
duty of operating it, is not ours because of conscious, determined choice on the jart of sny
Governinent of this country. It is born rather
of a conjunction of events and of economie
forces that compelled u.s to take up this burden and se discharge it, rather than accept
any alternative which presented itself to the
people of Canada.
Early this session I ventured to say that we
in Canada had nlot given a fair chance to the
National Railways. To that position I still
adhere. I neit-her boust for com-plain of being
called the father of this now contorted creation. Sometimes it is laid at my door and
I am told: "LIt is yours. Ail that now clings
to it and ail its diseases are yours." Ail right,
if to somne degree they are mine I accept the
responsibility. I do not complain of being
charged with the parentage of the child; but I
do complain of its treatment at the hands of
its foster father.
Whatever may be the history, wbatever
may be the errors--and I know it is possible
to exaggerate errors--the fact is there bas
been a running into debt, a care-free extension
of liabilities here, there and everywhere, of all
sorts and sizes, and, whoever may be respon-

296

SENATE

sible, this bas brought us to the position where
we find ourselves 5912,000,000 more in debt
after just nine years, with ail the fixed charges
on that debt heaped upon our backs; and we
find ourselves in that position at a time of
world depression, when the burden is heavier
than it otherwise would be, and when the
rneans of extrication are less clear.
I hope I shall fot be charged with having
expected of the management of the Canadian
National anythig more than ordinary shrewd
business capacity; that I shall not he charged
with having said they should have foreseen
the depression. I would be the last to lay at
the door of anyone blame for not having
foreseen this depression. I did not foresee it.
But I do think had there neyer been any
depression our position to-day would be only
less difficuit, but stili ail but impossible for a
nation of our size to maintain. Failure to
foresee a depression is neyer an excuse for
extravagance in management, nor is it ever an
excuse for extravagance in capital outlay. Al
must be governed by the principles which
govern the management of ail buisint es-bIy a
carefully calculated belief that the outlays can
earn a dividend. The outlays that have been
made on this road could never have been
made after any such calculation.
Now, the honourable senator for North
York (Hon. Sir Allen Ayleswort.h) affirms
that, we are unfair to the Canadian Pacifie
in managing this ais a national system. With
'bis position I have som-e measure of sympathy. I have always felt that it would be
very difficult for the State to manage its
own system, and man-age it fairly, competing as it does directly anid at every point of
contact with the private system. That difficulty I do not think any of us ini former
years fai]ed ýto sce. But we could not do
otherwise. We had to latinchi upon it or allow
an alternative condition of affairs, which,
I venture to think, not a fraction of the
people of Canada would ever have justified
us in doing. But the duty was upon the
Goverciment of the day and those it chose
to assume the burdün of management to sec
to it that the road wvas so eonducted as to
relieve the country, as far as it could be
relieved, of the charge of unfair operation
as against the private system. Economical
opera-tion would have been the way, and I
do believe that if the management in control up to the end of 1922 had been retained
in control we should have had that economical
operation. and 1 do net believe the Canadian Pacifie officiaIs to-day would even allege
that there ivas unfair competition from the
Canadian N-"ational, though there was efficient
Rigbt Hon. '.\r. "MEIGHEN.

competition, up to the end of 192.
There
Nvas no race like that of tlhe Gadaiiene swiiie
to the precipice, in the way of extravagant
luxuries and de luxe services as deseribed in
the report of the Royal Commission. That
frenzy did not go on at aIl. Lt commenced
after the end of 1922, and hecause of it the
Canadian Pacifie is ini a position to complain
that it has had unfair competition at the
hands of the ýCanadian National.
Buit this is sometthing that we cannot now
cure. It isd&ne. The best wean do is to see
to it thait any legielation we now pass helps,
n-ot one -roid akmne, but both, aind that it is
not unfair to, either. Nýow I veniture toe xamine thie legislition more closely aMd to
apply to it that very test. Is there within the
four corners of this Bill enmthing unfair Vo,
the Canadian Pacifie? Is there anything here
that can work injuriously to that company?
1 do not think the inquiry into that issue bas
heen very close up to this point in the debate,
but I venture to submit te honourable gentlemeni that it ought to have been, because we
never can ansiver to the people of Canada for
legislation whicb in any respect is unfair to
the C.'P.R. I for one, bearing my share of
responsiility-and it is considerable-in respect of the Bihl now before us, cannot assume
that until the Canadian Pacific agrees we have
no right to pass it. The honoumrble sennito
to my lef t (Hon. Mr. Calder), whoee very
vigorous and ca"rfuily thouglit out speech we
were ai glad to bear-we aire glad that he
was able to, corne back agann in 'health to
this flouse aind address us as he did--se-emed
Vo proeeed on thbe aesumption.-where he got
it I cannot, fathom-tbat this Bihl is in the
nature of penal legishation; that it is to punish
bad boys for not having done -the right thing
by the people of Canada. It is ail right, he
sa.id, as applied Vo, the Canadian National
Railways: they have been extravagant; they
have got us into ýthis awful mess. But the
Ca.nadian Paeific people were not bad at ail;
why apphy this Bill Vo them?
This is nýoV penal legisîstion at ail. There
is nothing 'h«e in the nature of oriminal or
quasi-eriminal legislation. Iit is intended not
Vo punish ainybody, but to asist and rescue
the Cenadian National on the one band and
the Canadian Pacifie on ýthe other; and unleoe
it is of value from. that stancdpoint we have
no right to pass it at aIl. We are noV heme

FEBRUARY 23, 19.13
huave an equally greMi intexeet, and of which
they am~ equedly proud.
Now 1 corne stili more closely to the inquiry. Will this Bi-I do what we intend it
to do? What is the object of this Houseý and
of this country, as represented by the Government? I hope I have got to the stage where
honourable gentlemen will agree that sorne
definite and very important step has to be
taken. The competition in services, the competition in capital investment, the race for
business, the constantly competing pride of
the executives of the two companies, unrestrained on the one hand by those who
should have restrained, and uýnrestrained on
the other hand because of fear for their position, have brought us to where we stand.
That something must be donc, I think everybody admrits. What is the alternative to this
Bill? Everybody knows that the only alternative presented to the Royal Commission
was a unified management, some means by
which the Canadian Pacific would corne under
the operation of the Canadian National, or
the Canadian National would corne under the
operation of the Canadian Pacifie. The second
proposition seemed to be the more seriously
considered as being practîcable. We have not
heard much of that alternative in this debate
-this unified management that Mr. Beatty
is preaching in the addresses he is delivering
throughout thîs country.
For unified management as a business arrangement, a very formidable argument can
be made. That greater economies can be
achieved through a single management operating both railways than can .possibly ha
attained by the co-opeLative agencies we are
creating here, I do not doubt. I believe that
we can save millions, under this Bill, but that
under unified management, it we could adopt
it, we should save millions more. That economiea could be effeoted which arm beyScd the
range of these oo-aperative agencies I do flot
question, and I can understand the position of
honourable gentlemen who say: "We realize
the position; we realize the difficulties; we
realize that the mountain ahead of us is a
colossal one. But here is the alternative that
we support--single control and management.
This is something masculine, this is something practicable. Let us adopt it."
Before its adoption, however, I should like
to off er a few oonsideratio>ne. These considerations are flot new, they are not original with
me at ail; that they have been in the mind
of every member of t.he Railway Commit-tee
1 do flot doubt.
We already have two gigantic industrial entities in the life of our country. The United
States have two hundred, and in that country

,the power of each is proportionateiy diminished. In our country we have only two. Because of fortuitous events the evolution of
our railways has gone much further. Each of
these great entities is tremendously powerful.
Unite them and you will have a power which,
in the hands of conipetent, shrewd, far-seeing
men, could be made an almost insuperable
factor in the political life of this Dominion.
Some attach to that spectre more sinister and
more terrible consequences than do others.
That it is undesirable I admit-that it is very
undesirable I admit; and I say most emphatically that the great mass of the Canadian
people consider it so undesirable that so long
as the democracy that reigns in Canada is the
democracy of mind that now reigns, there is
no possibility of bringing about such a condition of affairs. Those who say that this is so
only in regard to political matters--that we
are being political when we ought to be business-like-are really îndictîng democracy. It
is not at all a political party that is being
ohallenged, but democracy itself; and I do
flot know that demnocracy is altogether fooligh in7 seeking to guard itself against what conceivably, because of its immensity, might become domination.
In the Railway Committee there was a very
thorough review of the advantages of unification. That Mr. Beatty put his case before
the Committee with convincing power there
is no doubt. But the Committee, after considering the situation from every angle, by a
vote of twcnty-four to one, decided that it
could siot take such a course. Perhaps it is
because of the overwhelming majority in the
Committee that we do not hear of this alternative under rcview in this debate. The Duff
Commission rejected it, and, I venture to say,
largely for the reasons which I have indicated
to-night.
Is there any other alternative? The honourable senator from Montarville (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien), the honourable senator to my left
(Hon. Mr. Calder) and the honourable gentleman from North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) say: "Cut away Part III and we will
acccpt the Bill. That is the alternative we
want." I will examine now, perhaps somewhat hurriedly, the proposition that the Senate
of Canada should pass Bill A with Part III
Iopped away. If that part were cut sway,
what would remain of the Bill?
Part I of the Bill provides that the Government of the day may dispîsce the present
board of directors and appoint three trustees.
In reality "trustees" is only another name for
directors. Their functions are not different;
thcy cannot be. That feature of the Bill

298

SENATE

would remain. We should have three directors, or trustees, instead of thirteen.
The next feature of the Bill is contained in
clause 16, being Part II of the Bill, which is
a direction to the two companies to appoint
representatives of their respective organizations for the purpose of meeting together and
seeking to agree upon plans, measures, and
arrangements which will effect economies and
more remunerative operation.
Honourable
gentlemen will flot ask me to, read that clause.
I ask them, though, to remember the words
which I quote fromn it. It is a direction to
the two roads to appoint a committee, and
it authorizes thema to make an effort to,
achieve mutual eoonomies by plans, measures
and arrangements. My reason for emiphasizing that is this. Clause 16 is sn worded that
no dispute whiohi arises in the efforts of the
cornmittee composed of the two sets of representatives can be sucb as to be heard before
an arbitral tribunal unless it arises out of the
terms of an arrangement, plan or measure by
which economies can be effected and more
remunerative operation brought about. To
he still more clear: unless it is flrst established that, by a plan submitted by one of
the roads, and rejected for some reas9on by
the other, greater economies can he effected
and more remunerative operation brought
about, no arbitral tribunal can be formed,
and no arbitral tribunal can give a decision.
So far as clause 16 goes, and so far as Part II
of the Bill goes. it is merely a request that
tbey comne together and endeavour to reach
a conclusion.
If the word "requested" had
been used instead of "directed," it would have
been just as effective; and if we had stopped
there we should sim 4ply have been layin-g this
request at the feet of the two systeRns.
1 hope that honourable gentlemen at thîs
point are able to estimate just what would
remain of the Bill if Part III were abandoned.
You would have three trustees instead of
thirteen, or eighteen. or whatever the number
may be. and you would have a reqiiest to
the two compaaiies to behave better in the
future than they have done in the past.
I ask honou-rable niembers not to hesitate
to, challenge me if I have in, any way misinterpneted the Bill as it woul<l be if it were
truncated in the way suggested by the honourable member for MUontarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien). The honourable senator says, "I arn
quite sure they will behave better, and I amn
quite sure thev will not need Part III."' Why
i4 he so sure? Because, he says. they are so
poor they cannot help behaving better. That
wvas the argument advanced by the honourable
senator fromn Montarville. and that was the
rea.son for the hope of the honourable senator
Rtight Hon. Mr. MEIGEEX.

to my Ieft (Hon. Mr. Calder). He says that
they have been chasltened by misfortune; thait
theY are now experiencing the bitter remoorse
of the morning after a night of int.oxicationi,
and lie lenows that they "wiIl neyer do it

But where would. this House, stand before
the people of Canada if after four months of
dýeliberat-ion and debate, and after a year of
investigation by a commission, it solemanly
placed upon the Sta.tute Book a piece of legislation th-at named tharee trustees and then
prayed th-o parties to be gond? If we did th.at
we should have nothing but a car without an
engine, a churcli wi.thout a doctrine-just a
collection of pleas aind prayers and supplications. We sh.ould have direotion without sanction, and hope without any guarantee. SurelY
honourable members do not suggest that this
buse should present such a spectacle as that
before the people of this Dominion. It were
far bettier to be manly about it and abandon
the whole Bill, tor there would be notbiaag ef t
worth preserving.
Maybe we are unwise in passing the mnsure. I do not think we are, but 1 would
rather that we should make the error of not
passing it at aIl than that we should put upon
the Statute Book the poor, pale, pitiful produet suggested by the honourable senator
fromn Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) and
the honourable senator to my left (Hon. Mr.
Ca;lder). It were far better, I say, to make
the error of defeating the Bill than to present
to the people of Canada the anaemic creation
for which we should be responsible if we passed
only Parts I and IL.
What is there about Part III that we fear?
To hear honourable gentlemen in this buse,
one would think that the gates of destiny, so
far as the Canadian Pacifie is concerned, were
hanging on our decision as to Part III; that
a timorous congregation of shareholders in
England were shivering for fear this awful
blow would be struck. Surely we should be
playing our parts better if we endeavoured to
show themn what Part III really is.
Part III is only a means of deciding disputes
that may take place under Part II; it refers
disputes that may arise between the two
companies in their efforts to agree, to a tribunal which stands impartially between thcm,
and whicb cannot give a decision unless it is
flrst persuaded that it will be of benefit to
bot h.
At this point, hecause the thouglit occurs
to me, I want to refer to the illustration advanced by the hionourable member from North
York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylcsworth). There ib

FEBRUARY 23, 1933
no easier way of turning an audience, or
Parliament, away from. a real issue than by
giving a clever but inapt illustration. The
lionourable gentleman said that a farmer does
nlot want ta be dirocted by legislation as ta
wliether lie shall s0w beans or peas; that it
is his awn riglit ta decide; and that if something is taken away frorm him--sucli as a
piece ai land for a raad-lie has ta be campensated. Tliat, tlie liono'urable senator says,
is British iaw. And sa it is. But wliat liappens is this: a court is provided by the
nation's Parliaiment ta decide upon the value
of wliat we have taken froin him, and lie mugt
acoept the valuation of that court. Re cannlot say, "I will not do it unless it pleases
me'; he lias ta take tlie judgment of the
court. Now, if, after the court lias decided,
that fariner does nat have ta be asked whether
or not lie thinks the decision benoficial ta
lim, or fair, then wliy is tlie Canadian Pacifie
Railway entitled te be asked wlietlier or flot
it considers a plan beneficial ta it, or fair,
aiter the court lias decided that it is? In
the opinion af the lionourable senator from
North York (Hon. Sir Alilan Ayleswortli),
wliat is fair for the farmer is not fair for the
Canadian Pacifie.
It is true that the tribunal may make an
errai. It may decide that a proposed plan
would work out beneficially ta the Canadian
Pacifie Railway, and that decision may later
prove ta have been wîang. But alI courts are
hiable ta err, and tliere is fia reasan wliy a
tribunal appainted under the provisions af
this Bill sliould be more prone ta make
mistakes than is any other court. Ordinary
disputes between the Canadian Pacifie Railway
and the Canadian National Railways, as
between John Brown and Bill Smitli, are
referred ta the courts of the land. If twa
parties have a disagreement, Parliament does
net say: "We do not believe tliey will quarrel
and fight if they are given an(other year ta
settle matters themselves. They have had a
bitter fight and they are bath pretty tired, Bo
we wihl ask themn ta came together, embrace
and agree, and we will wait a year ta see if
they do so." No. Parliament provides a court,
and it says. "If twa parties cannot agree, eitlier
one of them may ask that the issue be tried
in court and a judgment given." A similar
procedure is provided by this Bill. But it is
felt that the regular courte are not equipped
ta decide questions as ta plans, measures and
arrangements invalving new adjustments,
allocations and abandonments as between
great railway systems. Theref are it is proposed that there shail be established a court
which is qualified ta decide sudh questions.

299

.We say "~st the Chairman of the Board of
Railway Commissioners, whoever lie may be,
is probably the best qualified person in Canada ta decide whether a proposed plan would
-effect an economy for the two systems. If
in any case lie decides Vhat it will nlot do se,
fie doee nlot go any further. And if after
hearing the argumenta of hoth railwaye he
is of the opinion that the scheme would nlot
resuit in more remunerative operation, he
-bas noa jurisdiction to order that it lie put
tinto operation. Now let us suppose, for
example, that the two systems could nlot agree
upon teins for their joint use of a terminal
owned hy one of them, and that, after licaring the representations of hoth sides, the
chairman gives this judgment: "You must
effect this economy upon such-and-such
terms. 1 apportion between you the benefit
and the burden, and the ultimate resuit will
help you bath." What would the share'holders over in London bave ta fear from
such a judgment? How would it be in any
way an invasion of the administrative rigdits
of the company? The company would still
he adrninistering its own road. Unless the
Bill were violated, unless the court were incampetent, the Canadian Pacifie could not
possibly be hurt by any decision.
It may be said, "If sîl that is true, why does
the company not support the Bill?" Well, I
do flot like ta suggest any reason for an
action af another persan. These Canadian
Pacific men are intelligent and know their
business. But I can conceive that possibly it
may be the part of shrewdness ta have the
whole burden and re.spansibility for this legislation rest on the shoulders of Parliament and
Government, and nlot be in any sense shared
by these men. I ar n ft at ahl sure that if
I were president end approved of -the legislation I should feel it my duty te say that
I approved of it. I am not impugning the
sincerity of their position, but 1 arn saying
that I cannot follow Mr. Beatty in saine
of his reasaning. I am ab-le ta, follow him
wheu lie says, "We can effect greater and
eaxlier econamies if you let us manage the
whole thing"; but when lie says, "We are going ta be injured-we are going ta have the
management taken from us and disaster wil
result," merely because tlie court is given
power ta decide disputes between the two
systems, but with the provision that fia order
can be made that will nlot help both roads,
I cannot, for the life of me, follow him. Under
this legislation we are simply interposing what
we bplieve is the most competent court that
ean be erected for the settlement of difficulties
and disputes ai a new class.

300

SENATE

It is also contended-and this point is very
rnanifest in the speeches of the President of
the Canadian Pacifie Railway-"You cannot
have competition and co-operation.
Your
Bill provides for compu]sory co-operation, and
that is inconsistent with rivalry." My answer
is that co-operation and competition are going on every day in every country, and the
only reason there is not more co-operation
than now exists is that the law prevents it.
Will any honourable member suggest that
there are no industries in Canada to-day
which co-operate and at the same time cornpete? Do not, think that I arn attacking
industries. In the great process of economnie
evolution
we are
getting
farther and
farther away from the policy of unrestrained and universal competition.
That
policy cannot everywhere prevail. It becomes
destructive. It was destructive for our railways.
Will any honourable rnember deny that
there is co-operation in practica]ly every great
industry in ail countries? By an industry I
mean, flot a company, but ail who are engaged
in the production of a sirnilar commodity. For
example, in the sugar industry and the oil
industry, and in ail other great industries, is
there not co-operation in order that destructive competition may be as far as possible
eliminated?
Does that practice flot prevail
in the United States and in every advanced
commercial couintry, as weçll as in Canada? Ith
does. But the ]aw preventis the carrying of
co-operation beyond a certain point.
You
cannot use it to the extent of unduly raising
your prices against the public for your own
benefit. That is where the line is drawn, but
up to that line you can co-operate as freely as
youl wish, with a view to avoiding destructive
competition.
If the law did flot draw this line, there
would bu vastly more co-operation and ]ess
competition in big industries thun is nowv the
fact. After w-e pass this Bill and provide for
a measure of co-operation and a consequent
saving of large suma of money, there stili will
be a tremendous area in which our railway
systems can compete. But I venture to say
that as time gocs on this area of competition
wvill be gradually redueed, while the arca of
co-operation will be proportionately enlarged.
That is, to my mind, an inevitable trend in
the progress of economie law, and it is only a
step in that progress that we shaîl he taking
to-night if we pass this Bill.
I urge upon honourable members the fact
that in taking such a step we shaîl flot be in
any wvay invading the sacred rigbts of anyone.
We shaîl simply be providing a neccssary control for two great corporations; a means by
Right Hion. '%r. M.EIGIIEN.

which they shall be rcquired to do what they
have failcd to do during the last, eleven years;
a means for relieving public sharehiolders of
the one corporation and financial supporters
of the other from some of the tremendous
burdens wbich both groups have been bearing
in years gone by.
If it be said that this is to some extent penal
legisation-of course, it is not that, in any
sense at al]-we must caîl attention to the report of the Royal Commission. That report,
not merely in one paragraph, but in ut least a
half-dozen pages, attributes a share of the responsibility for the present situation to the
Canadian Pacifie. It is quite true that the
greuter share of eulpabilitv is charged against
the Canudian National, but the Canadian
Pacifie is by ne means exculpated. The cernrni8ioners attribute to that eompany even a
lack of sense. They dlaim that the course
pursued lias meant wvaste to the company's
shareholders. I could read extracts from the
report te support whiat I arn now saying. What
lias huppened lias been due, net to a lack of
capaeity on the part of the Canadian. Pacific's
nmanagement, but te an absence of provision
fer ce-eperation on a fuir basis. When there
is ne sueh provision, an attempt on the part
of either eompany te effeet more economical
or more remunerutive operation by mutual
airrangement becomes more like a poker game
than a serieus effort te bring about practical
result.q. The company that stands to reap the
greater benefit, from any proposed sehemne is
the one that is the more insistent to have it
put. into operation. The other company hangs
hack, reahizing that it will bu pursued. and it
strives continually to drive a harder and harder
barguin.
This is the kind of thing that lias gone on
an(I will continue to go on if we do not
provide a means of escape. Give the comnpanrues a means of escape, of bringing their
disputes to a tribunal, and 1 venture to say
that that tribunal will be very seldorn resorted
te, that the mere realization that such a court
exists and inay bu appealed to by either cornpany at any time, for the settlement of a
dispute, will in itself go vcry far towards the
solution by thu railroads tbernselves of diffieulties whiclh arise between them.
For these reasons I commend, and eommend
earnestly, the third reading of this Bihl to the
Senate of Canada.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourablu senators,
after the very able presentathon in favour of
the Bihl by the right honourable leader of the
buse, I may be regarded as bold indeed in
nîaking a few observations. The honourable
senator trom Salteoats (Hon. Mr. Calder)
and the hionourable senator from North York

FEBRUARY 23, 1933
(Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) have spoken at
length in support of the amendrnent, and 1
want to express rny agreemnent with what they
have said in that respect. At the same tirne
I wish to add a few pertinent remarks concerning the Bill.
I think that the right honourable leader of
the Bouse has covered the outstanding points
of this proposed legisiation, and in doing so
ho hais rather confirrned the impression I previously had, narnely, that the results which the
people of this country are iooking for will not
be obtained under this Bill at ail. For my
part, I should rnuch prefer to vote against the
Bill rather than support the arnendrnent, because I arn satisfied that a year frorn now,
when we are faced with practically the same
deficits that are staring us in the face to-day,
the people will -have become disillusioned.
When that timre cornes i would raîther be on
record -as voting against the Bill as it stands.
The riglit honourable leader lias quite
properly referred to the bearing whicli this
railway subjeet has on the financial stability
cf the country. The finances of Canada are
indeed intirnately affected by the position of
the Canadian National, which now lias a
deficit cf a million dollars a week. Are we
going to continue, for another year or two,
that deficit? I rnay say te honourable rnembers who are net on the Railway Cornrittee,
or who did net attend its sitîtings, that we
had before us there the efficiency expert of
the Canadian National Railways, who said
that under this Bi-I it would take five years
te give effect to the economies recornmended
by the Royal Comm'rission. Do honourable
senators realize what that means? It will be
five years before the present deficits are wiped
out, if it cen be accornplished even by that
tirne. On that besîs, next year the deficit
would be 340,000,000; in 1935 it would be
330,000,000; in 1936, $20,000,000, ini 1937, $10,000,000; end sorne time in the distant future,
if businessl does not get any worse-and it is
getting worse this year as compared with lest
-we may balance the account.
Iît seerno te mie tbsst~ in the discumSn on

streng reports. I behieve that thus Bill, which
is based on the Royal Commissien's report, is
net sound in principhe. You miglit as well
try te mix cil and water, as conipetition and
enforced co-operatien. They will net mix. As
a resident cf Western Canada, I was one of
those who had a share thirty years ago in the
building up of competition whicb we felt was
essentiel at that time. If conditions were
different, it would be a good thing to have
a continuation of that competitien new. But
we are far frorn those days. Let me say that
in the development cf transportation, with its
competitive service, hurman progrese cannot be
permanenthy restreined by rates, penalties,
licences or anything else. We cannot turn
back the hands of progress.
The. transpoe'teaiocompawe e, not only in
Canada but asil over thnl continent, are faoed
with the necessity of niaking drastie readjustrnente. M~ay I ref an honourable senators

extent with the majonity report, but used bis
own language te express bis conclusions.
Briefly, the Commission recommended tliat
the railways cf the 'United States as reorganized should have in view one unified systern.
Men cf autliority on Arnerican railway affairs
have expressed the opinion that aIl their railways wihl be opereted by the Gevernrent

they are ail likely to continue opereting at a

If we are to bave railway unification in

tage and conduct our business without the
competitive feature.
I do flot think any honourable senator
should criticize this Bill without having in
In my
mindt some alternative suggestion.
humble judgment the only way out of our
present difficulty is unification of management. That does not mean unification of
assets. It would be absurb for this country to
take over the asýebts of the CYP.R. at this
time. Railways, like traction companies, are
rapidly getling out of vogue.
To-day the
motor truck and the motor bus are laking
away a great deal of the railway business, and
they are going to take away more. I doubt
if in len years from now we shahl see any of
the mails carried by train between our populous centres; in ahi probabilily this service
wihh be donc by the aerophane. Cerlainly express shipments will go by air. There is an
ever-increasing Iraffle by motor buses and
motor trucks. In order that honourable members may realize the rapid development of
road transport, I may say that there is a
motor-truck service between this city and
Windsor, and a very profitable business bas
been devehoped on that five-hundredmile run.
In my judgment there is no bright spot around
the corner so far as our railways are concerned. In any event, they will have to go
through a proeess of reorganization, and 10
that end il hehooves the Canadian National
and the Canadian Pacific 10 make whatever
adjustments are practicable 10 bring about the
greatest possible economy of operation.

Hon. Mr. AfcRAE.

Some people are worried about our becoming partners of the Canadian Pacific in this
railway venture. Let me point out that this
country is already in partnership with the
Canadian Pacifie. The credit of Canada is
wrapped up in the credit of Ihe Canadian
Pacifie Railwav, and you cannot hurt one
without hurling the other. I submait Ihis is
not the lime 10 injure the credit of either. It
must be apparent to those of us who have
travelled across the Dominion that wjthin the
next four or five years our raihways wihl find
their track and rolling stock in such a condition of disrepair Ibat they will be faced
wilh an expendilure of hundreds of millions
of dollars. There are thousands of freight
cars on the sidings to-day that will not be
fil for use in another five years' time. Even
if our railways gel back 10 a paying basis
within this period, thi'y will need ten years'
earnings 10 make good the depreciation. Let
us take a reasonable view of the situation.
Let us not entertain the idea that within the
nexl five years, if the railways gel back bo
a paying basis, there ivill be a surplus available for the payment of dividends. 1 do net
wan, te1, depyreýciate itihe C.P.R. stock; il is
aiready at 100 great a discount. The Canadian Pacific is a magnificent transportation
system. But il must not hc forgotten that, as
I have said, both the Canadian Pacific and
the Canadian National have been obliged
lhrough lack of business to put many engines
and cars on sidings, and il is very questionable that Ibis rolling stock wihl ever ho put
,back int service again. It will probably be
necessary 10 incur heavy expenditure for new
equipment, new rails, new tics and new rolling
stock when improved business conditions
ronder this possible. Worse stilI, our railways
will have 10 make even greater expenditures
if lhey are te, meet tbis ever-increasing competition of modern transportation methods.
Where is the mono',' to bc found? Wedl when
we again have the courage 10 step int the
money markets of the world we are going 10
have 10 borrow hundreds of millions of dollars
10 put the National Railway mbt shape, and
tbe C.P.R. will have 10 do likewise.
I desire 10 compliment the honourable
qonaý-tor fromn Salt-coat.-, (lion. Mr. Calder) on
the suggestion hoe bas made with respect te
the budget, in order te insure te Parliament
an opportunity 10 know what is really being
chealt witb. I think that suggestion should
ho incorporatcd in the Bill. I recahh that while
I was a mexnber of the otlher lieuse the Canadian National budgets gave us little informatien on wbich te base our vote.
The right honourable leader of the bouse
bas vcry elearly stated ýhis position with re-

FEBRUARY 23, 1933
spect to t'he Arbitral Tribunal. The honourable senator for North York (Hlon. Sir Allen
Aylesworth) has referred to the duplication of
raiiway tracks betiween Toronto and Belleville. He spoke of the p'ossibility of doubletra.cking the C.P.R. Let me give the House
the other side of the picture. To those of
us who are not as optinxistic as the honourable senator for North York it seems that
it would be a measure of economy to abandon
one of those parallel Uines. If it were suggested that the C.P.R. line should be abandoned, its management miglit say, "Thaît is
an integral part of our system, and we cannot think of scrapping it." We will suppose
that the Chairman of the Board of Trustees
of the National Railways goes to the Chairmain of the Raiiway Commission and says,
"I want that line scrapped." Then, under
this Bill, the case is heard by the Arbitral
Board and an order miglit be issrued for the
abandoament of the Canadian Pacifie line.
That, I admit, is an extremne case, but when
passing legisiation we should bear ini mind the
possibility of such an extreme case arising under -it. That is what the Arbitral Tribunal
has power to do.
Now I want to say a word for the Canadian
Pacifie Railway. During thie course of the
debate this afternoon thoee honouýrable senators
who made bold to speak in such a way
that their remarks miglit be interpreted to
be in sup>port of that great Canadian institution were under-what shaîl I say?-well, at
least they were under a cloud of suspicion. 1
think in that regard I arn as .free as any
honourable member to express an opinion,
for it has neyer been my good fortune to be
in any way aseciated with the Canadian
Pacific Railway; in facet I have neyer owned
a share of stock in that company. This being the case, perhaps my remarks may be
taken at par when 1 say that, as with every
other Canadian who lias travelled, my heart
always dilated with pride whenever I saw the
bouse flag of the C.P.-R. flying on its ocean
liners in foreign ports, and on its offices located
in the principal cities of the world. The
C.P.IR. has carried the name of Canada to
every quarter of the globe, with credit to the
company and to Canada.
This afternoon it was said that the Grand
Trunk minority shareholders were complaining of the loss of their secuTities. I believe
the agreement for the acquisition of the Grand
Trunk had the approval of a miaiority of the
shareholders and was approved by Parliament.
ljnfortunately, ithe arrangement was not satisfactory to a few shareholders; hence for the
last fourteen years we have had a series of

complainte from those minority shareholders.
Those complaints, which still continue, have
very seriously injured the credit of Canada.
The honourable senator for North York (Hon.
Sir Allen Aylesworth) told us this afternoon
that of the shareholders interested in the
ordinary and preference stock and other securities of the Canadian'Pacific Railway, more
than sixty per cent were resident in Great
'Britain, and only fifteen per cent in Canada.
Out of the total of 180,000 investors interested
in the C.P.R. this would mean, roughly, 108,000 in Great Britain. It does not require any
great stretch of the imagination 'to picture the
tremendous dissatisfaction that would be
arouscd by any srbi.trary action on our part
which miglit interfere with the actual management or the charter rights of the Canadian
Pacifie Railway. Is this necessary? Let us
give the company time. If to-day the Canadian Pacific management were prepared to
say, "We will go fifty-fifty with you ini this
ba>d businesgs-we will apiply to this situation
the best business principles," I think we should
bce prepared to sit down with them and come
to an arrangement. We have seen something
along this line hsppen ini the last few weekB
in Toronto, where three principal jewellery
firms merged their respective businesses into
one store. Why? To reduce overhead. expenses, eliminate competition and try to make
both ends meet. That is what we want these
two railways to do. But how can you have
full. co-operation unless you have unity of
management? Surely it should be possible to
bring this about on a fifty-fifty basis through a
managing company with a neutral chairman
acceptable to both railways, with the public
interest further protected by the Railway
Commission and the ever-present pressure of
public opinion through the Government of
the day. It should be possible to set up a
court which would arrive at an equitable distribution of the net earnings of the joint operation. This is the only way I see in which
effect can lie given to the economies the public
demand and have the riglit to expect.
Honourable senators, I regret that I have not
that command of language essential to impresa
upon you what I regard as a very serious
threat to our national credit, to the credit of
the C.P.R., and to our improved trade relations with Great Britain, which we all so much
desire. In my heart I f eel that this is the
gravest question that we have to consider. I
shall vote for the amendment as beîng one
way out of our difficulties. I regard the Bill
as injurious to the national credit and still
more dangerous to our financial and trade
relations with the Mother Country.

SENATE

Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable members,
I shou]d flot have taken part in this debate
had flot the amendment been moved this
afternoon to strike out Part III of the Bill.
I have carefully studied the report of the
Royal Commission, and, aithough flot a
mexnber of the Raiiway Committee, I have
closeiy followcd its discussions with respect
to Part III. I have also iistened attentively
to the arguments advanced to-night in support of this part of the Bill. But I arn not
convinced that the best intercst of Canada
xviii be served by the adoption of Part III.
Let nie state very briefly why I take exception to Part III. If we had a multiplicity
of raiiways to deal with, the situation wouid
be different; but we have two great railway
systems. One is owxned by the people of
Canada, who, through Parliament and the
Government, can teli the management to do
as they sec fit. The Canadian Pacifie Railway is equaliy national in character, enjoying certain rigbts and priviieges under its
charter, and subject to the regulative control
of the Board of Railway Commissioners.
I think we ail realize that we are in a period
of transition, and no one who has studied
the 'railway probiem of this country can say
that we shahl ever sec a return of the
railway conditions tihat existed some five or
ten years ago. In my judgment Parliament
wouid be weil advised to indicate to the management of these two systems--botb of which
are national in character and closely interwoven with the affairs of the Canadian people
-that they are expected to co-operate and
bring about economies which wili be of bencfit
to the treasury and to the taxpayers of Canada, and that if they eliminate the useless
and costly -competition that has heretofore
prevaiied, the identity of the two systems
The right honourable
will be preserved.
leader says, "That is ail right, but there is
no punch to it." I amn quite satisfied that
under existing conditions we as a Parliament
can safely trust the executives of both these
roads to confer and to bring about every
major economy that is possible.
Why shouid we as a Parliament intrude in
the affairs of a corporation whioh is privateiy
owned, and wihich bas the rights of a privatciy
owned corporation? Why should we impose
upon it, legisiation that wili cocnpel it to go
before a tribunal for the settlement of disputes that may arise from time to time?
Wby should not these executives be given an
opportunity-during a period of th.ree or four
years, if you wish-to confer? We could add
to the Bill a provision stating that they
should report to the Government with respect
Hon. Mr. MeRAE.

to the plans and

efforts they

are making

towards co-operation, and the success with
which they are meeting. That would be quite
proper. But I think it highly improper and
undesirable at this time to impose upon them
the requirements of Part III of this Bill. If,
as some think, the period of reasonabiy profitable raiiway operation is at an end, our intrusion at this time may have the resuit of
brin-ging another great raiiway to the doors
of Parliament, with the request that it be
reiieved of its obligations to its sharehoiders
beecause of the interference brought about
through the introduction of this part of the
Bill.
Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: Honourable members, I had intended saying something about Part III of the measure that is
now before us, but after iistening to ail the
speeches that have been made, I think it is
altogether unnecessary.
Some Hon. MEMBERS: Go ahead.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I must chide

of a certain chiid, but says that bis successor
spoiled the baby. 'I go a littie further. I say

boards of directors, not one. However, be and

I want to, expiain my own position, and I do

When this Bill was introduced I was rather
hesitant about accepting Part III, and so cxpressed myseif in this House. But since then
I have had a better opportunity than any of
you, perhaps, to sit still and listen te ail the
arguments advanced on cither side of the question. Every detail of the Bill was threshed
out in committee, and the longer the discussion continued the more thoroughly was I convinced that if this Bill was not to be a nonentity, or worse, it would have te contain the
principie e.mbodied in Part III. Parts I and II
of the Bihl are the crystailization of good, pious
wishes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEJOHEN: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I hope I shahl
flot be thought vain if I say that ne man in
this lieuse bas had any mýore experience than

stented to the extent of meeting my desires.
That is an indication of what is likely to happen if we eliminate Part III.
The railways have very zealous and very
able executives, each trying to the lirnit of
its powers rto have its own way; and they,
being human like the rest of us, will not find
it easy to fail into line and embrace ecd
othe'r, even in the adjustment of smali differences.
To a certain extent I agrec with the honourable gentleman frorn Montarville (Hon. MT.
Beaubien)-which is something new-that this
tribunal proba.bly will not have very much
to do. But we do flot abolisi a court because
at a particular session there are no prisoners.
We do not say that we shall fot need the
coiurt any morre. The fact that wc have courts
and tihat there is a process of law is a grcat
detevrent of crime. In saying this I arn not
cornpariing the possible action of the railways with crime, but arn me-rely peinting out
my candid convic-tion 'that if wc pass Parts I
and(l , and leavo -out Part III, there will be
less co-4opemtàion b>etw'cen 'the railways in
future than there bas been during the past
ciglit rnonths. As I say, I do net believe the
tribunal will have very much to do, but the
fact. that irt exists and lias certain powers will
bc an intimation to both roads-without financially hampering them, cither-that thcy
are eý.%pected to co-e-perate as far as possible,
and that the tribunal wvil1 help thcrn if thcy
cannot corne to an amicable arrangement unaided.
That is not a ncw principle at ail. Alrnost
ce-cry diiy thc two railways are disagreeing
a-bout something. Whcn I %vas Minister of
Railways they were almost constantly appearing before me with respeot to the location of
hues. In tiose- days that questien came before the Minister;- now it cornes before
the Board of Railway
Commissioners.
Before the Board of Railway Commissioners
was cstablished conditions were altogether different, but ail the 'rnilways of Canada acquiesced in the appoointrnent of a board to
which their differences could be referred. Today the two companies are under the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commisionors, the ohairman of which will be the chairman of the court set up under Part III of tic
Bill. Therve niay be a littie extension of authority, but it is not an in-novation, and the
powews of the board will be no More arbitrary
than they previeusly were. The tribunal will
flot deal with big questions. Such matters
as the pulling up of miles of railway are questions of policy, and probably will never corne
befere thc tribunal.

305

Notwithstanding the fact that I ar n ot
enainouried of a board of three trugtees-Il
think five would bu better-I yield to the
opinion of the Cornrittee. Neitier arn I
enarnoured of the Arbitrai Tribunal. At one
time I thought tic Board of Railway Commissioners as now constituted would bu able
to handle 'the situation, but the more I icard
of the reasens advanced in support of the
,creation of a separate body the more convinced I became that I ought te favour the
Bill. So, witiou-t trying to influence anybody
else, I rnay say that 1 arn going to vote against
the aniendrnent aind in favour of the Bill.

Now, let i.' sec what other nations are
doing. The following item appeared in a New
York newspaper:
Unitcd

And in the New York Herald Tribune of
December 2, 1932, thiere was thîs:

The Herald Tribune also carried these
dispatches:

nuttober of Frenchi notables, including three

been involved.
Sonie 200 clients of the hank have appeared

thein face heavy fines. The bank has about

Mr. Aibertin said hie h.ad a copy of the list
of those who availed themacîves of the good
offices of the Swiss Bank.
Last, but not ieast, let me quote this dispatch
from Washington to the Montreal Gazette of
February 28:Andrew W. Mellon Defendent in Suit.$220,000,0-00 Action taken against U.S. Ambassador and two others.
Andrew W. Mellon, United States Ambassador to Great Britain and former Secretary
of the Treagury, aud two former officiais of the
Interxuil Revenue Bureau to-day were named
defendants in a $220,000,000 suit charging
alleged connivance with officers of foreign
stea mahip conipanies to evade just income taxes.
Namied with Mellon were David H. Blair,
one ýtime Commissioner of Internai Revenue,
and Alexander
W. Gregg, former Acting
General Counsel of the Bure-au.
The suit was filed in the District of
Columbia Supreme Court hy David A. OIson,
who resigned recently as investigator for the
Senate Stock Market Inquiry Commi.ttee after
charging that his efforts were being blocked
hy Senator Norbeek, South Dakota Republican,
andi others on the commnittee.
The papers charge that Mr. Mellon flot only
failed to coileet $100,000,000 in delinquent taxes
from foreign steamship interests, but placed the
United States Government in such a position it
wvas compelied to refund some $10,000,000 to
the comnpanies. The identities of the companies
were not discloSd ini the suit.
The suit was based upon a statuts of 1863
which prohibits the defrauding of the Government hy trickery and makes Federai officiais
liable for double the amount of damages
suffered by the Government.
Although filed in Olson's namne, it is on
behaîf of the people of the United States, so
that any (lainages awarded would revert te the
Treasuiry Department.
OIo.through hiq a.ttorneys. alleged that the
Federqal autiorities wrongfuliy permitted the
foreign companies t0 make amended tax returns
based on the Revenue Act of 1921 instead of
the Acts of 1916, 1917 and 1918. It was contended that the comipanies had refused te make
,tax paymcnts on the latter three years.
Now. it is not aIl iip to Mr'. Bennett nor
to the oficers of the National Revenue Department to admonish those human icebergs;
rather it is up to the evaders to do their duty
to the State, and more particularly to the
poor.
May I suggest that the Governinent appoint
a body of men, sa>' five experts, to examine
ail bonds and other securities before ailowing
t-hem to be offered to the public, and thereby
in great measure prevent the frauds that have
been perpetrated upon our people, running
into millions of dollars.
I do not think that an>' amendnients to the
i->resent Income Tax lsw to effeet the purpose
I have in view should be retroactive except
in flagrant cases, for we must bear in mind
that man>' persons, not being accustomed to
making income tax returns, may have been

For example, ftha physical houndary line between fthe two dioceses, the division of property, and the, setting up of the new diocese
of Saskatchewan itself will be dealt with by
the Legislafure of the Province of Saskatchewvan. Ail that is desircd by tbis Bill is an
alteration in fhe incorporating Act of 1882.
whereby the nime will be changed t0 tbe
diocese of Saskatoon and that diocese will be
permitted f0 function under the charter of
fthe original diocese of Saskatchewan. The Bill
of 1882 came f0 fthe Faderai Parliament biecause the Province of Saskatchewan was not
esfablished. until 1905. The present Bill is
non-confenflous. and bas already been passed
by the other House.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I arn nof opposcd
to the Bill, but as this is a religious matterHon. Mr. HORSEY: It will go to the coinf0

nîitfae, of course.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No doubt about
that. There are many dioceses in the province from whichi I corne, in Onfario, and elsewhere. I have been liere for fhirfy-fhree years,
and if seemns strange to me that this Hanse
sbould be called upon f0 make such a change.
This is a church business, and surely any
church, whafever ils denomination, should
have the right f0 make a diocese wherever if
wishies Wr' are very fort unate in having such
a1leader as we have in this House, and parhaps the right bonourable gentleman (Righf
Hon. Mr. Meigben) would be good enough
f0 enlighten soine of us with respect fo this
Bill, for we always Iike to bave some idea of
w-bat we are doing.

Hon. Mr. HORSEY:

The objeet is merely

fo have an amendinant made f0 the Ac, of
1882, so thaf the sout.hern part of the prese(nt
diocese of Saskatchewan w-uT become known
as~ the diocese of Saskafoon.

What I arn suggesting may not be of very
much consequence; but 1[ imagine it would
ha better te have the soutiern diocese namned

Saskatchewan, or of Prince Albert.

Hon. Mr. HORSEY: The Episcopal Church.
The petitioners have asked for these names,
and I think they ought ta know what names

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: It seems ta me that
it is rather a mistake to have the dioceses
named as the honourable gentleman says they
are ta be.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHA'M: Change the
Bill in committee, if a change is desired.
Rigit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The point
raised is one wiich I tiink would occur ta
the mind of a thougtful person. Wieai I read
the title of 4?he Bill I was at a bass ta understand why the Parliament of Canada should
be dealing with a provincial diocese. It appears, thougi, that if the diocese is te ba
divided it must be done by Dominion statute,
since the synod of the diocese waa incorporated by the Dominion in 1882, before
the Province of Saskat.chewan was established.
The Ghurei now desires to have two dioceses
instead of ane. The local Legiélature will
create the northern d.iocese, and under this
BibI thie southern diocese would be known as
the diocese of Saskatoon, named after the city
ivhich. appa.rently is the churci capital of the
southern part of the province. The jurisdictien undoubtadly is provincial now, but the
Acts ini force iat the tima of the establishment of the province can be amended only by
the Parlianient whieh passed tham.

FEDERAL ELECTION COSTS
INQTJIRY AND DISCUSSION

Hon. W. E. FOSTER rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That lie will cail the attention of the Senate
to the abnormal cost, both to cand-idates and
the country, of f ederal elections, and inquire
if the leader of the Government would consider
the question of the appointment of a select
committee of this House to consider and report
upon such action as would materially reduce
the cost thereof.
He said: Honourable members, had 1 given
Ihle su.bject-matter of this inquiry some further
consideration hefore placing it on the Order
Paper, I might perhaps have altered it 6omewhat, particularly as it relates to members of

the other branch of Parliament and may ha
regarded as something with which this House
should not deal. In the second place, I might
have hesitated to discuss it because many
honourable members, having had wide experi-

ence in public life, have had opportunities,
ta be-come conversant with the cost of conducting elections as that cost affecta the candidates, the political parties and the country.
That experience has been gained from the

either as premiers or as leadecrs of the opposition. Indeed. one memiber of this House is
an ex-prime minister of the Dominion. Those
of our members who have nlot taken such
tin active part havec at sundry times contriliuted toivards the party funds, in order
that their partv mach-Iiner-v migbt function
Sli(ccssfully and p)lace their party in office.
If any hononrable mernbrs have not so contributed, seme perhaps have solicited funds
oni bebaîf of their part '. That they were
rho-.en to do so is proof of the confidence
reposed in therm bv their party leader. At
times we have heard these activities condlemned, but I tbink the thanks of the people
of Canada should bc teîîdered tu any linourable gentleman wlîo in a proper and
logitimate maniner h'i; solicitcd party funds
in order that our parlianicntary institutions
înav be ca rried 0n1.
When I first placeil this inquiry on the
Order Paper an bonourable nîember asked nme,
"Wby sbould you w-orry about the cost of
elections?" I replied: 'I am not worrying. 1
have already hiad nîy xveîries." But, under
rapi(lly changing conditions like the present,
one neyer knows wlicn one may, for some
reasen or other, be seeking the suffrages of
tÂte people. Qutite apari frorm olîr personal

tends to produce a larger number of individuals wbo are willing to performa voluntary
services for their respective parties; therefore
1 think it well that such organizations should
be maintained, and I believe they are productive of 'much goodý. The enormous sum of
money required for ail these things which I
have .menitioned, and which are essential
under our present system, must Iae founid
somnewhere, and the task of fanding it is
becoming more and more difficuit.
Without wearying the Bouse with details,
I should like t0 point out, if I may, some
of the things which go to the building up of
the large expenditure under our present system of establishing our government. First,
as honourable gentlemen know, when the dissolution of Parliament takes place, it is
thouglit proper-and I think it is well that it
is so regarded-tha.t the leaders o~f our respective parties s-hould tour the country from
coast to coast, so that the people at large
may be-come more familiar with the issues of
the day and the policies that the parties havç
to place before them. Naturaily, such an
ljsually thie
undertaking is very costly.
leader of a party is accompanied by some of
lis lieutenants. As they tour the country,
going from place to place, meetings fitting to
the occasion must bc organized and conductcd
at various points. 1 know that in a city of
50,000 people, in order to provide proper
,arrangements for such a meeting, including
radio broadcasting and certain other necessary
things, a minimum expenditure of 81,000 is
required. The utilization of that great invention, the radio, including hook-ups, so that
the people may hear their master's voice, as
it were, involves the expenditure of a very
substantial sumn of money; and it has been
said that flot less than $1,000,000 is required
for the proper organization of a central office
for the carrying on cf a political campaign.
This monev is used in a perfectly legitimate
manner, but sometimes I think it is spent
too lavishly.
-NowI come, for a few minutes, to another
phase of providing for our system of party
government, namely, the expenses of the
candidates in the two hundred and forty-fivc
constituencies, extending from the Atlantic to
the Pacifie. Figure it out for yourselves ani
yon will find that the total involvcd would
be tremendous, even if a minimum amount
were spent in eacb of these constituencies.
You will find that the cost in each ie entirely
100 great for an ordinary individual to assume,
and that a candidate, if he is to make any
showing at alI, cither must have consideirable
ineans of bis own in order to carry on an
independent cam.paign, or must depend upon
party funds.

313

Let us examine the situation from the standpoint of the cost to the candidates and to the
country. We all know that following the
announcement of an election nominations take
place in various constituencies, and that if a
candidate has not at bis disposal sufficient
means of his own lie must be furnished with
funds to start the machinery in motion. For
the biring of premises as headquarters, the
preparation of lists, the expenses of speakersfor these and various other purpoRes money
must be .paid. Our system demands that that
money be raised somewbere in order that the
people of a certain iocality may have a representative in the House of CommonE. Those
who have taken part in elections in recent
years wiIl bear me out, 1 thi*nk, vhen I say
that the purcbasing of votes, 'or corruption of
that kind, lia not of late been praütised to
any great extent. For this I think we should
be very tbankful. But expenditures for legitimate purposes, some of which 1 have mentioned, have increased by leaps anîd bounds
and the problem confronting party manager-~
and candidates to-day is such that, in my
opinion, in the interest of the country generally, some action sbould be taken to minimize such costs.
I think I am safe in saying that that
is a problem which cannot be solved by
one party accusing the other of doing tbing-,
it should not do, or of employing methods
whbich are not iust wbat they ought to
he. Neither can tbe situation bc remedied
simr)ly by some apostles of purity hiolding up their bands in holv horror whpn
they discover tha-t some individual or corporation bas miade a contribution f0 party
funds, and perhaps the passing of certain
legislation, wbiclb bas noither lyrejudiced nor
belpe<l anybody, bas thereby been facilitated.
Even the press in some parts of the country
bas been critical of tbe wayin whîch money
bas been contributed to political. fonds,
although some of tbese newspapers bave
received a portion of tbat money through
advertising revenue, and in many cases the
rates charged for political advertising are
bigher than 'the regular rates.
Money is obtained in various ways, most
of which I believe are legitimate and fair, in
order that the expenses properly incurred by
candidates snay be paid. We all know, and
the public know, that these things are done.
But I believe that the country is too poor,
under present conditions, to continue the
crude and expensive inethods wbich bave
been practised in tbe past, and I tbink it is
high time that the ýproblem ho squarely and
fairly faced. Ronce my b'ringing this inquiry

SEN ATE

The question is, what can be done to reduce
thie costs that; now have to be borne by
candidates on both sides, hy their parties and

1 have already stated that
perhaps a commnittee of this House may not
be a proper body to undertakze an inquiry
into this sthj<et, heeaîîo-, there might be a
feelingý that xve were infringing on the prerogatives of another branch of Parliament.
But if, as I have suggested, a committee
were appointed, it would not, I tbink, biave
very inucli difficulty in obtaining cxpert
advice along the lines that I arn going to
mention. It would not have to go very far
afield to get valuable information with regard
to the present cest of carryîng on electiens.
The scope of the reference would bave to be
xvide, the committec being- directed to examine into the whole question of the cost of
running a political party, and the nature of
campaign
expenditures. and to consider
how the Eleetion Act miglit he amcended. and

Then in every constituenn. tbe candidates
require the nise of buildings or halls for thc
pui-pose of addressiog the electors. Ail over

buildings, nîany of mvhicb arc oNviicd by fie

After alI, these buildings. aie uened by tlic

material. A great deal of political publicity
matter, when mnailed froin headquarters at
Ottawa, is carried free; but 1 ar n ot suggesting that canlpaign literature be sent free, even
when addressed by a candidate to electors in
his own constituency. My idea is that during
a campaign candidates sheuld be pcrrnitted to
deposit such literaturo in post offices and that
this should be distributed witbout cost, to
persons who eall for their mail; and that in
rural sections the litera ture should be distributed along the routes within the vicinity
of the post offices in which it is d'eposited.
Such a service would flot resuit in a material
cost to the country, but it wouLd save candidates a lot of money.
Under the law, candidates are required to
have a repres-entati%-e in each polling suxbdivision, and many of these repreýentativeýs
have tn bc paid. I haive always theught it is
most unfair that a candidate 'should be
required to bire someone and pay him to esut
in a polling booth for the purpose of seeing
that the law of the country is carried out.
After aIl, that is the reason the representafive
is there, and surely it is only right that the
country 9hould .pay for service of that kind.
My experience bas shown me that the compiling of lists in cities could be improved on
te a very considerable extent. At present
these lists are made up in alphabetical order,
but I believe it would be better to have
streets made the basis of the lists, and the
voters listed in the order in which their residences are numbered on the streets. If this
rnethod were followed, the compilation could
be more rapidly and less expensively done'
and some cf the impersonation carried on
under the present system would be prevented,
for tbe voters when reading the lists would
readily detect any error in the names of their
neighbours.
The extension of the franchise bas meant
a large increase in the campaign expenses of
candidates. The practice of conveying voters
to the polIs, although illegal, is carried on
openly. with the consent, no doubt. of both
parties, and the expenses in this connection
have grown so rapidly that they have become
almost intolerable. Yet, but for this system,
I believe, the number of votes polled in an
election in our country would be very srnall.
I find that in the 1921 election 70 per cent
of the voters on the lists polled their vote;,
in 1925 the percentage was 69; in 1926, 70;
and in 1930, 76. I have here a list showing,
by provinces, in percentage, the number of
votes polled in the 1930 election, in proportion to the number of names on the votera'
lista. It will be seen that the Iargest percentage, 89, ivas in Prince Edward Island, and
the smallest, 66, in Alberta. It rnay be that

there was some special reasen for the cernparatively small vote in Alberta, and that some
honourable member will be able to enlighten
us in that connection. The percentages were
as follows:
Fer cent
Ontalrio............
Quebec.............
Nova Scotia. .........
New Brunswick.........

* 71

* 76
* 83
* 83

Manitoba..........
British Columbia.......

* 75

ýSagskatchewamn.......
Alberta...........

* 81

* 73

Prince Edward Island......

* 89

Yukon.............

* 66
* 82

I think honourable members will agree that

the percentage of votes polled was, on the
wvhole. reasonably high. But, as 1 have
alieady said, inuch of týhat good record is
attrihutable to the fact that large numbers
of voters weTe conveycd Vo tthe polis a-t the
expen&e of candidates. I believe that this
custom can bu largely wiped eut by the

adoption of compulsory voting, which. I
pers6nally favour, on the priaciple that the
franchise bar, ceased to be a favour conferred
and bias becorne a duty imposed-a duty cf
citizenship, and that no one who is able to
go te the polis should bc allowed to evade
that duty. Certainly candidates should net
bu -ohiiged. 'Vo pay for the transporting cf
voters ýti the polis. As I say, I believe tha~t
if voting were compulsory it would no longer
bu necessary to convey electors to the polIs;
but if 'the people are in favour of a continuation cf this transportation seTvice, the
only way to relieve 'the candidates of the
costs, it seeans to me, would be bhrough
conscription of the requisite numbur cf motor
cars. This would become necessary only once
every four years, or whencver an election was
on, and the burden would flot be very great.
Gompulsory votin-g is not a new thing, but
perhaps I may ha a little in advance of public
opinion ia advocating it for this countrv. I
arn net aware of just, wha't eountries have
adopted it.

Some time agio I wrote Vbothe

Chief Electoral Officer of France and obtained
from him a icopy cf the election Iaw of that
nation. and in 'that law there are mnany
features whieh, . 'beilieve could be adopted te
afivantage here. I aIse, obtained a cepy of tbe
Australian election iaw from the Chief Elect oral
OffierT of the Commonwealth, who informed
me that compulsory veting was introduced in
bis countryv bocause of the very smaîl percentage of votes pollcd in the electLon of
1922. it having been contended that the will
of the people was not properly reflect.ed h.such a vote.

He pointed out that in 1922

xviii Ne at oiice apparent to ail lionourable

MARCH 8, 1933
memibers that the commitfee to which this
Bill is to be referred, and indeed this House,
will have a formidable fask before them.
We in Canada, throughout our history,
have not had the responsibilify of regulating
Canadian shippîng in its entirefy. Our shipping has been regulated under the provisions
of the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act. The
responsibility cornes to us now because of
the passing of the Statute of Westminster,
which enables the Parliament of Canada, if it
s0 desires, f0, repeal sections of Imperial
statutes applicable to this Dominion and to
substîtute some law in lieu thereof. The Bill
is intended f0 meet this provision of the
Statute of Wesfmninister, and at tihe sarne
time to remnodel thse Merchant Shippidng Act
of Canada so as f0 bring it more into conformity with present circumatances and
developments; and, as well, if bas for its
objeýct thse embodiment, and indeed tise inferpretation, of a considerable number of
conventions on the subi ect of shipping, one
enfered into by the nations of the British
Commonwealth, the others, fhrough international conference, by rnany nations of tise
world.
The latter phase of thse Bill I will deal with
firat. The purpose of this review is that
honourable members may have upon to-day's
Hansard a sort of manifesto on tise general
terma of the Bill and rnay refer f0 this in
preparation for fise work to corne before us
more immediafely, and in better forrn, next
week.
The two agreements known as the Safety
Convention and the Load Line Convention
are tise results of international conference and
have already been in existence sorne years,
having been adopted in 1929. Tisese conventions, however, are noV by .this Bill simply
recifed and made part of tise law of Canada
by statute. The Britishs Parliament adopted
a different metisod. Instead of merely makin- thse conventions law, it passed an Act
which interpreted the conventions as applicable to the United Kingdom. In thiis way
the duty imposed upon the courts was not
the duty of interpreting tise meaning of the
conventions as actually arrived at isy the
pienipotentiaries, but ratiser the duty of interpreting the will of Parliament as to the meaning of tise conventions. This may strike
honourable members as a somewisat unusual
method of adopting a convention, nevertheless
it is tise method followed by thse Imperial
Parliament. I dare to presume fisat tise
interpretations there given are not in direct
violation of the language of the conventions.
Inasrnuch as the British Parliament bas followed this course-for this reason and perhaps

317

for others--we adopt it here, and Parliarnent
will be asked to, express in this Bill its interpretation of the provisions contained in the
conventions and of their general effeet.
Four other conventions are also, in a sense,
made part of this legisiation:
(1) The International Convention concerning Seamen's Articles of Agreement, adopted
at the International Labour Conference at
Geneva on the 24th of June, 102.
(2) The International Conventioni concerning the Reparation of Seamen, adopted at the
International Labour Conference at Geneva
on the 23rd of June, 1926.
(3) A Convention as 'to the Marketing of
Heavy Articles.
(4) A Convention as f0 the Inspection of
Ships' Tackle.
These conventions involve a large number
of changes in the law of shipping, and their
incorporation into the fabric of our existing
shipping law bas turned out to be a sornewhat
laborious performance.
At this point I think I might terminate rny
references to tbe Bill in so far as it seeks t0
ronfirm, existing conventions. For the rest,
it is in the main a rewriting and improvement of the pyreseKnt shipping law; but as well
it is an incorporation into the shipping law
of certain other legislation, already in effeet,
which more appropriately cornes under shipping legislation as part of the Merchant
Shipping Act, and wbich in process of incorporation is also subWet f0 certain intended
improvements.
In this connection I rnight refer, flrst, to
the Maritime Conventions Act, Chapter 126
of the Revised Statutes of Canada. This Act
bas been incorporated in the new revision and
is now made a part of the permanent shipping
legislation of Canada.
Another Act, the Water Carniage of Goods
Acf, Chapter 207 of the Revised Statutes of
Canada, is of such a nature that it would be
appropriate to embody it here, but inasmuch
as there may be reason for the repeal of this
Act ivithin a relafively short space of time,
it bas not been thought fit to make it a
part, of the present Bill.
The Radiotelegraph Act, Chapter 195 of
the Revised Statutes of Canada, was considered, and under the advice of the Radio Branch
if was decided to amend the Act by elirninating ail provisions therein contained relative f0
radio telegraph apparafus on ships, and to incorporate in this revised Canada Shipping Act
so much of the Radiotelegraph Act as relates
f0 ships, with the necessary arnendrnents f0
bring it info conformity with the Badio conventions. The altered provisions will be found
in Part VIII of the present measure.

MARCH 8, 1933
While 1 arn on my fret 1 should frankly
tell the Huse that die Bill has not yet been
printed for distribution. The translation into
French, of necessity, takes a long time. I
understand it will not be ready f ar distribution until next week. I intend to move later
that when the House adjourns to-day it stand
adjourned tili Monday at eight o'clock, in
the hope that by then the Bill will be ready.
Meantime, if honourable gentlemen do not
object, it mighit be well to give the Bill the
second reading. allowing the appropriate
reservations to be nmade. As this is distinctly
a matter of commerce, I think the Bill could
properly be referred to the Committee on
Banking and Commerce. That committee is
of a size to deal withi so important an enactment, Mhen, the Bill having been referred
to that comnhittee, we mighit adjourn on the
understanding that the committee wilI flot
undertake its work until honourable members
have had a reasonable time to look over the
provisions of the Bill and prepare for -their
labours in the committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
%vasread the sýecond time.
On motion of the Right Honi. Mr. Meighen,
the Bill was rcferred to the Standing Coinmit tee on Banking- and Commerce.
PRIVATE BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. HORSEY moved the third readinig of Bill 16. an Act respecting the Synod
of the Diorcse of Saskatchewan and to change
its name to "Synod of the Diocese of
Saskatoon."
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Honourable members,
wben this Bill came up yesterday 1 asked
the honourable gentleman in charge of it
whether it related to the whole of the Province of Saskatchewan. It is rather uinfortunate that fuller explanatory notes were not
available, for they would have saved a good
deal of bother. Since 1882 we have had in
Saikatchewan the diocese of Qu'Appelle and
the diocese of Saskatchcwan. The abject of
thi's Bill is to divide what is known as the
diocese of 'Saskatchewan into two parts. To
that there is not the slightest objection, and
if the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr.
Horsey) had exeplained that inýstead of two
clioceses in Saskatchewan there would be
three. I should nor have objected to the third
reading.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
wa rcad the third time, and passed.

CHARITY SWEEPSTAKES BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. A. D. MeRAE moved the second
reading of Bill I, an Aot with respect to
Charity Sweepsgtakes.
He said: Honourable senators, it was in the
absence of 'the honourable senator from
Vietoria (Hon. Mr. Barnard) th-at I assumed.
the responsibili'ty of asking the Senate ta
consider again the legalizing of sweepstakes
in Canada. 1 arn sure that aIl honourable
senators join with me in exprecsing pleasure
at seoing the honourable senator again in his
seat, and I know .they will appreciate my
embarrassment in speaking to this Bill when
,the father of the measure is hcyre in person.
Hawever, as there are a few sligh.t changes
in the Bill, i!t is perhaps; well tha.t 1 should
make my remarks on it at this time.
It is not neceasary for me ta review the
debate that took place on a similar Bilil last
year. I wish, hawever, 4to refer ta one statement I made at that time, namely, that in
my opinion the majority of the peaple of
this country were in favour of legalized
sweepstakes. I refer to this because of the
devclopments which have taken place since.
At that time, as 1 remember it, the hanourable senator from Red Deer (Hon. Mr.
Michener), in queetioning the soundie8S of
that observation, saîd th-at I was taking in
too wide a circle; and perhaps some other
honourable senators febt the samne way about
it.* As a mabter of faet, I afterwards learned
thait the press of my own city had similar
vicws on the subject, and in rather critical
odit.orials taok me ta, taek for speaking in
support of the Bill intvoduoed by the honourable senator frorn Victoria.
The Daïily
Province of my home city, under da-te of
February 13 of last year, had this to say in
eoncluding an editoiial on the subjeet:
If we are a bit surprised al Senator MeRae'i
advooacy of this fallacious thing, we are not
one littie bit impressed by it.
I mention this as being indicative of the
public sentiment in my home city at that
tinie. Yet, ten months later the swing of
public sentiment in regaxrd to this matter was
so great -that the City Counicil was obliged
to submit a plebiscite on the subject of
sweepstakes te, the people of Vancouver at
the municipal elections held in thmt city on
December 14. My atteubion is called to this
by a hetter frorn the City Solicitor, who
sends me a statement prepared by the

320

SENATE

rchurning officer giving the 1resoits of the
p1ebiscite poli. The plebiscite is:
Are cou in favour of legalized sweepstakes,
to he operated uiider the direct control of the
British Columbia Gýovernicient for the henefit of
hospitals within the province?
The vote on that question xviii: Yes, 25,735;
No>, 9,774.
In other word-, seventvy-thrce
per ccnt of the total vote~s cast were in favour
of Government-controllcd sweepstakes, and
only twcnty-scvein pcr cecnt were agarnst themn.
IRoughly, that is in the proportion of thrce
to one.

Closely folloxving that vote was the votc of
the British Columbia Hospital Association.
0f the ninetx--scx en members who met in conference at that time, seventy-seven xoted for
legalized sweepstakes, and twenty against
thein. That is four to ene in faveur cf swc-)
stakes.
Following that again, on the lst of March

a recent news item that the mnembers cf the
Labour Congress of Canada have expresscd
themnselves favourab]y in regard te it. 1 hav e
in myv hand a letter fromn the Office cf the
Prime Mini-ter of Ontario, saying that on
January 4 of this year a deputation fromn the
Trades and Labour Congr-ess of Canada waited

ncvertheless that resolution may wclI be taken
as an expression cf opinion of the Trades and
Labeur Congress of this country.
H1on. Mr. McR.iE.

Now, honourahle s.ýnators, perh9ps I should
give a terse revie-w cf the Bill whieh is submittcd fer your consideration. In doing se, I
take it that if the principle cf the Bill is
approveil by this honourable House, the
measure itself xvill in due course be referred
te cenmîttee. whcre the various clauses wili
be considercdà in detail, aud, if necesm;-ry,
a mended.
In gencral, this Bill is the' saine as the
Hospital Swveepstakes Bill, which xvas introduced in the Senate laýt session. hi keeping
with the more general use for the moucys
which it is proposed by this Bill te raise
thrcugh sweepstakes, the title cf the present
measure lias been altered te read "An Act
with respect te Charity Sweepstakes." Section 2 cf the Bill cf last year previded that
the Attorney-General cf nv province mighit
authorize :
a sn\eep.,talkes fer the pi icse of rai-ing niciteyý

Those xvords have been changed te rend:

iti

Througheut the Bill the word "chairitv" or
"charities," as the case may be, bias been 0 îîbel
stituted for "heospital" or "liospitals" as
in the previcus measure.
The enly other outstandiog change is in
section 5. This section cf last y1eir's Bill reaul
as folews:

Ncxv, as I see it, the difficulty in coonection,
with that clause is te be feund in the fact
that cur mails, as we ail know, are being and
will continue te be used for the ferwnrding
cf lettery and sweepstakes tickets. 1 beliex e
it is net good policy knewingly te make n
large number cf our citizens lawbreakers, as
they are te-day. Therefore the follewing lias
been proposed as the present section 5:

to our people who live in provinces that may
not authorize sweepstakes the right to purchase and receive tickets by mail.
Except for these changes that I have mentioned, the present Bill is the samne as the
one of last year. I might, perhaps, remind
honourable members that the object of that
measure was to authorize the conduct of a
sweepstakes in any province that desired it,
by and under the direction of the AttorneyGeneral of such provinee-mn other wordB, the
Provincial Governrnent. If honouTable members will read section 3 and its nurrieous
subsections they will find that very careful
details have been worked out for safeguarding
the sale of tickets under the direction of the
Attorney-General of any province that may
authorize sweepstakes.
We have heard. many estimaçtes with respect
to the revenues which miglit accrue under
this Bill. I have gone to considerable trouble
to ascertain the incomes of the Irish lotteries.
The London Observer of Novem-ber 22, 1931,
reports that the net receipts to Irish hospitals
fromn the four sweeps of that year were over
two million pounds sterling, that is, over
$10,000,000, after ail expenses had been paid.
This morning I recetived a cable from a recognized authority, and I pass on the information
therein contained with confidence that it is
correct. This information is that from the
three sweepstakes held ini Iýreland in 1932 the
gross receipts were eleven million pounds
There were given
sterling, or 855,000,000.
away in prizes approximately seven and a
haîf million pounds sterling, or $37,500,000.
The estimated expenses are one million pounds
sterling, or $5,000,000. And the Government
lias taken its tax, as it does frorn our pari
mutuels. The sum turned over to the Irish
Government in taxes last year was haif a
million pounds sterling, or 82,500l,000. There
was left for the hospitals the net sum of two
million pounds sterling, or 810,000,000. This
is practically the samne amount as the previous year, which goes to show that there is
no depression in the sweepstakes business.
Reduced to percentages, the sum given away
in prizes was, roughly, 68 per cent of the total
receipts9, expenses were 9 per cent, taxes 5
per cent, and the net contribution to. the
hospitals 18 per cent of the total takings.
The only other information I have been able
to gather is with respect to our own Army
and Navy Veteran-s' sweepstakes, which were
formerly conducted in Newfoundland and are
now, I arn told, operated from Queibec City.
This organization is doing a very cominendable
work of charity, and aithougli it is operating
under great difficulties, it succeeded in col-

321

Iecting on the Derby race alone last year
something over $1,100,000. 1 hold in my hand
a memrbership ticket which says:
l9th Charity Distribution Fund, $1,000,000.
Distribution decided by the Grand National.
That indicates confidence in this year's programme. 0f course these operations are carried
on within the law. It is to be nioted that this
is the nineteenth charity subseription, and I
arn informed that very large sums of money
have been given *by this Association to the
Red Cross and other outstanding charities for
the relief of our citizenis who are in need.
If Southern Ireland, with three and a half
million people, can carry on sweepstakes so
successfully as it lias donc for some years, we
can diraw our own conclusions as to what
should be possible in this country, with its
eleven million people of similar inclinations
and with neiglibours as rich as those of the
Irish. Certainly the prospects of revenue are,
to say the least, dazzling to those endeavouring
to meet the demand of charity in the present
situation. I sometimes wonder-and I say
this without any offencehow long it would
take to pass a Bull of this kind -if it were
supported by every honourable senator and
every member of the Huse of Commons who
lias a sweepstakes ticket in his pocket or who
lias possessed one in the past year. Not long,
I shouild say. In the presenft seirious situation,
honourable senators, we cannot afford to be
hypocritical. It is a bad thing to, have a law
that is openly broken by the major;ty of our
citizens, to the general knowledge of everyone,
and, may I say, with general approval. No
useful purpose is served by legally denying
our people what they are determined to have.
It is unneoessry for me to remind honourable
members of the long struggle that was carried
on in connection with prohibition, when
attempts were made to prevent entirely the
use of liquor. Our neiglibours to the south
prooeeded almost to the brink of rein in trying
ta enforce a prohibition law which the great
majority of Americans did neot want, and
which their Government is now in the process
of repealing.
After aIl, the moral question involved in
sweepstakes is flot greatly different from that
which was involved in the liquor problem.
We have not hesitated to take profits from
the lîquor business in this country. Tens of
millions of dollars have corne to the treasuries
of the provinces and of the Dominion fromn
the sales of liquor. We have accepted the
principle of lotteries in the pari mutuels, from
which our governrnents also receive a revenue.
In Ireland, where the Church lias
charge of the morals of the people, do you

53721-21

flnd any strong pretests against sweepstakes?
Indeed, do you find any protests at ail? And
church bazaars, which involve the same principle that is the basis of sweepstakes, tbough
in a modified form, are in vogue in almost
every country.
Furthermore, why net give our people the
opportunity cf a little relief fromn the gloom
of depression, especially when the resuit would
be to the benefit of the sick, the destitute
and the blind, and crippled vetera.ns? Surely
in se deing we should not be undermining the
morality cf the Canadian people.
I know that many persons oppose sweepstakes because of the fear that they would resuit in decreased direct contributions te
charities that did not, get a share of sweepstakes revenues. I think that fear is net well
founded. Net many contributors te general
charities will deduct froma their givings the
few odd dollars that they may spend in
sweepstakesý tickets, whilo thousands of people
who are nover reached in the ordinary
charity campaigo will purchase tickets in a
sweepstakes.
I hardly need call the attention of lionourable senaters te the dire situation that confronts the people vhîo arc endeavouring to
meet the rapidly incrcasing dcmands cf
charity. As wve ail know, the depression lias
resulted in greatly decreasing the number of
subseribers te charity, whose hearts are the
same as they were in the past, but whose
poekets are now ompty; and many of those
subseribers who continue te give bave been
forced te reduce the amounts of their contributions. In fact, many parts of this country
are facing nothing short of bospital bankruptcy. Io the eity from çwhicli I cerne, the
Vancouver General Hlospital, which is in the
first rank of the fine hospitals of this country,
owes the banks $250,000 and cannet borrow
anv more money. It is faeed with the nocessity of cutting down its services at a time
when they are needed more than they ever
wvere hefo(re.
Many people say that we should have increased provincial grants for our hospitals.
That is something I have long advocat cd,
but there is ne use in talking about that

obliged te make drastie cuts in their budgets
and they are ail certain to reduce hospital
grants. Our cities in British Columbia are
finding it equallv difficult, te raise sufficient
revenues fer theijr necds, and 1 suppose that

the country. I rond in a newspaper that the
Citv Council of Moose Jaw stated the estimates for the year would have to ho reduced
Hon. Mr. McRAE.

by $170,000, in or(ler that the mili rate migît,
be kept unchanged. on account of the failuro
of sO many people to pay their taxes. The
newspaper article went on:
On motion of Aldermnan Fletcher, seconded
by Alderman T. Warner, City Council moved
that the cost of hospital-ization of indigent
patients be taken over hy the Government.
Aldermani Fletceher said the city could no
longer provide hospital facilities for those
unable to pay. The deficit for 1933 would bc
$24,000 in addition to the fixed charges of
$15,000. The motion was unanimously adepted.
With t.he economnic situation gradually becoming worse, and the increasing of demands
upon our governments and people to holp the
unemployed, some charities which in the past
used to touch our hearts most deeply, such
as those that care for the blind. are nowv
almost forgotten. In the light of t.he facts
I have mentioned, can we and should we
deýny to any province that wants to avail
itself of the unexplored source of revenue proposed in this Bill, the right to do so? I say
candidly to honourable senators that this is
alrnost the only source of revenue that has
not bcen explored. It should be borne in
mind that the rights given by the Bill would
be exercised by a committc of citizens whose
status in charitable work is rccognized in their
province and who have been appointed by
the provincial Attorney-Gcneral. The whole
operation of the sweepstakes would ho safeguarded in every respect by the AttorneyCencraI and his Provincial Government.
U-nder such conditions. I ask again. should
we deny thnt, right to any province which
desires it? The Bill merelv proposes to give
the right to a province that w enta it; no
province would be compelled to adopt sweepstakes. Furthermore, it prevents the advertising and sale of sweepstakes tickets in any
province other than one that authorizes the
sweepstakes. I do not wish to assume the
responsibility of denying to our prov inces
this source of revenue, which promises to
give somne relief in meeting the rapidly increasing calîs for help frorn our unfortunate
fcllow citizens-the sick, the destitute, and
the maimed.

SALARY DEDUCTION BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGIIEN moved
the second reading of Bill 38, an Act to amend
the Salary Deduction Act, 1932.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The effect of this and
the preeeding Bi is to impose a super tax.
Rig-ht Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: AIL taxes are
super taxes now.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: This is class legisiation. This Bill applies to members of Parliarnent, and the preceding Bill applies -to
judges, whiIe other members of the ommunity
are not similarly taxed. Although there is
a good deal to be said in favour of this legislation, stili it is cIass legisiation.
Rîglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Other niembers of the community have had their remuneration reduced by other means, and it
is flot necessaxy for Parliament to interpose.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Does flot the sarne
thing ap~ply to members of Parliament and
judges?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Not in
respect of their indemnîties and salaries.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: No; but certain rnembers of the cornunity, beicause of thieir
business activities, are in receipt of very large
incomes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEI'GHEN: Not many.
Hon. Mir. HUGHES: Some, at ail events.
They are escaping such a tax as this. Why
should it not apply to everybody?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourwble
members, I supported similar legislation last
session, and advocated such a measure as this
before it was introdLuoed,. It struck me
at the time that when people were being
taxed nearly ail they could bear, those who
enact legisiation taxing their neighbours
might well set an example by reducing their
own incomes from government sources. I
think that was really the reason for the legislation. True, we are ail taxed the sarne as
53721-21à

our felow citîzens outside of this House, but
in addition to income such as the rest of the
cornrunity may get from their businesses we
get an indernnity from the public treasury. I
for one think týhat as an example, in times
like these, we might well approve of this
measure and thus show the people throughout the entire country that what we advocate
for thern we are willing to apply to ourselves.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: But we are doing
more than that.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I understand
that fully. but we are in a different position:
we are drawing from the treasury of the
Dominion an amount that other citîzens are
not drawing. There is no boss on our indernnities. Mapiy a mnan who has had a large
incarne in the past would be quite willing
to-day to take any of our places and aecept
a $3,600 icorne.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I arn certainly
in favour of this legislation so far as the members of hoth Houses are concerned.
Hon. Mr. FOR KE: Honourable members,
I arn in favour of this Bill, but I think this
is the time when it rnîght be well to point
out how different is the position of honourable
members frorn the far East aind the far West
as compared with the position of honourable
members who, living in Toronto, Montreal or
places similarly distant, are able to go home
over the week-ends. During the two months'
recess honourable members frorn Manitoba
and the other Western Provinces had to retain
their apartments here while they were at
home. I have been attending Parliarnent now
for eleven years. Not having been used to
handling large surns of money, $3,600 looked
very impressive to me, but I have neyer found
it a money-rnaking matter to corne to Ottawa
for tbe parliamen'tary sessions. I do not find
fault with the ten per cent deduction; in fact
1 arn ready and willing to pay it; but 1 think
it just as well to mention how differently the
indemnity affects varîous members of this
House.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

From 1914 to 1918 the people of the whole
world, and particularly Canada and the rest
of the British Empire, were engaged in a game
of chance, gamnbling for home, for the future,
for human safety, for everything that is worth
while in life, and while engaged in that gamble
manéy millions of men died. And we must ahl

irbile 9,774 voted no, and. I presume, indicated
bt' sucb vote their opinion that they are ready
ta go down iuta their poekets-and that is
where they sbouid go-for the sake of sweet
charity and the hospitals.

When the honnurable senator from Vancouver

MARCH 13, 1933
Those are the views of the late Right Hon.
Sir George E. Foster.
Now, to get down to brass tacks, what is
proposed by this Bill? The Senate of Canada
is supposed to be tihe safety valve of the
nation, and tio conost of intelligent, capable
and dependable oitizens who have diacharged
their responsibilities to the community, and
Who stand ready to require that o4ihers shahl
do likewise. The honourable senator (Hon.
Mr. MoRse) in mnoving the second reading of this Bill gave the House the impression that Vancouver, generaily regarded
as a very prosperous coast city, is pretty well
up against it to secure the wherewithai for
the care of its sick and of the stranger within
its gates who needs hospital treatment, and
that it owes $250,000 to the batik. Apqparently the city of Vancouver is not propared to go down into its jeans--pardon the
expression-and dig up the necessary money
so that it may do the decont thing by distressed humanity within its municipal bordera.
In order to secure the necessary funds the
city proposes to launcli a big sweepstake. No
doubt we shahl be told that this sweepstake is
to be confined to the Province of British
Columbia. But everybody knows that it will
flot be so. Everybody knows that flot a single
gentleman behind this proposal ever contemplated that ail the money was te, be raised
within the province. Everybody knows that
the labourer out in far northern Saskgtctlw'an
will be invited to buy a ticket for 82.5. With
what hope? With the hope of winning a prize
so large that it will put him on Happy Street
for the rest of bis life. The sbeep-berder up
in the wilds of Wyoming, across the international boundary, would in some way have
brought to his notice the prospect of winning
$150,000, or wbatever the prize may be, at a
cost of only $2.50. The section-mani up in
nortbern Alberta would be told of the wonderfuI possibilities in the purchase of a $2.50
ticket. In other words, bundreds of tbousands of tickets would ho issued as sucker hait
to coax 82.50 out of the poor mati who bas
dreamed of possibilities that migbt ho bis if
onily hie won one of these alluring prizes.
For a numbor of years I bave seen the evil
to the ordinary working mani indulging in
gambling. In my .iudgment no habit has
wrought s0 much unbappiness in the homes of
working mon in this and other countries as
the gambling habit on the part of the breadwinner. I have seen the evil of this gaxnblitig
habit aIl over the United States and Canada,
and I could cite numerous cases of the distress
and bardship suffered among the familles of
our working men once those men have become
infected with the gambling foyer. Yet Vancouver is ready to say: "For sweet cbarity's

327

sake give us a chance to get somne money to
pay our hospital expenses without putting an
additional tax upon our citizens."
This question, in a measure, was dealt witb
the other day by a distinguished world citizen
when he gave utterance to 'thoughts on some
of the elements involved in this charity sweepstakes proposaI. In a message to his own
people, referring generally to just the class of
persons that are bebind this proposal, hie said:
Tbey know only the rules of generations of
seif-seekere. They bave no vision.
These generations of seif-seekers have always
been ready, and they are ready to-day, to
go into any reasonably logitimate game if
tbey cati unload their responsibility and their
municipal tax burdens for bospitals upon the
"bunky" in the Nortbwest, the section-mati
in Alberta, the sbeep-herder in Wyoming, or
the sailor in Seattle; in the naine of sweet
charity they are quite willing to unload alI
their responsibility onto others, far away, at
$2.50 a bead.
This samne distinguished world citizen
uttered some other impressive thoughts on
this question, which we ought not to overlook, for some of us need to ho spoken to
in plain ternis. He said:
There mnust bo an end to opeculation with
other people's rnoney.
This Bill proposes speculation and gambling
with other people's money; with the 82.50
a bead that cati ho socured from the "hunky"
in northern Saskatchewan, the section-mati
in northern Alberta, the sheep-herder in
Wyoming, the sailor in Seattle-ten dollars
ail told, atid with millions more to came from
similar sources-from the poor and unifortutiate wbo, in their chance of drawing the lucky
number, see notbing but the glamour of a pot
of gold at the foot of the rainbow.
To the careful tbought of my honourahie
friend from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae)
and of other honourable gentlemen wbo tbitik
it is ail right for us to try to gamble ourselves
into prosperity witb other people's money,
1 commend the policy which the samne
authority presented in these wvords:
The policy of the good neighbour-tbe
neighbour wbo roooluteiy respects bimseif and
hecause ho does so, respects the rights of
others; the neighbour wbo respects bis obligation and respects the sanctity of bis agreement@
in and wîth a worId of neighbours.
Under the conditions so prevalent throughout
the world to-day, and fairiy prevahent
throughout Canada, there is an obligation
devolving upon us to dig down deoper itito
our pockets for sweet charity's sake, rather
than unload our obligations u-pon the less fortunate in the haphazard way proposed hy this
Bill.

SENATE
This samne authority when spcaking to bis
people the other d-ay referred to the consolation which cornes from paying our taxes to
take care of ail legitimiate fleeds, ani abova
ail to take care of the sirk and indigent in
our hospitals. H1e said:
Ilappineffl lies flot in the mere possession of
mioney: it lies in the joy of achievement, in the
Theso dark days
tlhrill of ereative effort. ..
wviil bc worth ail tbey cost us if they teach
us that our true destiny is not to bo ministered
unto, but te minister to ourselves and our
fellow mien.
Apparently many peoplc in this country
wilI flot ho able to realize that "happiness
lies flot in the more possession of money"
until they get a still more severe joit than
they have yet experienced during this depressien.
To my mind, honourablo senators, it is
nothing short of a national misfortune that
the Senate of Canada, composed prosumably
of gentlemen who can "stand thc gaf' of
paying their way and deing that wbich as
upright citizens they are expected to do, should
be seriously discussing tbis proposai to unload our obligations upon tbe less fortunato,
upon tbe poor and the dlowntrodden. pcrbaps
upon the poor fellow working in a northern
Ontario camp for bis board and five dollars a
month. Such a man would be tempted to buy
one of theso sweepstakes tickets for $2.50, or
50 per cent of bis month's salary.
So it seems to me that this proposai sbould
not go one step furtber in the Senate of
Canada. I can imagine the eloquont ploas that
will bo madle to show tbat it is perfoctly
legitimate to inveigle tbe other fel]ow into
assuming burdens that are flot bis owýn,' and
handing ever bis gond money. wbich perbiaps
he cannot afford to give. That practico bas
been going-- on for years. That is one reason
wby the world is in the situation that it
occupios to-day; tint is wby the banks of the
United States bave bad to, close for tbe past
few days; and that is wbat is going to cause
hardship and disease to a degroe greater tban
has ever before been known in Canada, unless we give a reasonable load, tigbiten up
our beits and sbow a disposition, man-fashion,
to play the gamo and assume tbe obligations
that belong to us. Therefore, I very rnucb
hope that this Bill will be kilied as promptly
as possible.

MARCH 13, 1933
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Honourable senators,
it seems extraordinary that some honourable
members who come from large cities should
speak in favour of this legislation. The
honourable gentleman who has just taken his
seat (Hon. Mr. Rainville) comes from Montreal, the commercial capital and, I suppose,
the wealthiest city of the Dominion, and if the
Bill were passed and the legislation were
adopted by the Province of Quebec, people in
various other parts of the country would be
helping to support hospitals and charities in
that great city. Out in the West we find it
hard enough to support our own institutions,
let alone contributing to those in larger
centres which surely ought to be able to take
care of their own hospitals and charities.
I hope this Bill will not pass. and I want
to do what I can .to prevent it from passing.
I suppose it is not necessary for me to reiterate
what I have said on other occasions against
the principle of the measure. I had hoped
that we had heard the last of it when we concluded our consideration of it in the preceding
session, but it keeps bobbing up persistently.
The sponsor of the present Bill, the honourable gentleman from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
McRae), has elaborated somewhat more than
the sponsor of the original Bill (Hon. Mr.
Barnard), but lie has failed to advance any
additional arguments likely to convince anyone that the legislation is desirable.
When I was speaking to him a few days
ago he intimated that since last year certain
changes had been made which he thought
might meet with general approval, but on
examination I find that this Bill is practically
the same as the one we had before the House
on previous occasions. In fact, the honourable gentleman has admitted that there has
been no change in principle. The title has
been changed, but that is of no consequence.
The only alteration of importance has been
in section 5. It will be remembered that when
the Bill was before the House last year an
attempt was made to confine participation in
sweepstakes to the particular provinces that
might desire to have them operated, and section 5 prohibited the selling of sweepstakes
tickets through the mails except for delivery
within the province wherein such sweepstakes
had been authorized. That section has been
eliminated, and the present section 5 provides that:
Notices for the sale of tickets for a sweepstakes .

. .

may be advertised in newspapers,

magazines and periodicals published only in the
province within which the sweepstakes is
authorized.
So far as I can see, that change is not a
good one. For example, suppose the Bill were
to pass and the Province of Manitoba auth-

331

orized sweepstakes. In that province there
are two or three large daily newspapers published, and they are read all over Western
Canada.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: All over the world.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Not all over the
world, but I should say all over Western
Canada. Advertisements published in them
would be read by people in a number of
provinces. A similar situation would prevail
- in any other province that might authorize
sweepstakes. Therefore, in my opinion, section 5 of last year's Bill was better than the
present section 5.
Of course, we appreciate the financial difficulties that our hospitals and other charitable
institutions are encountering just now. Even
under normal conditions it is difficult enough
for them to raise the necessary funds. But,
fortunately, all these institutions have been
able to struggle along; at least, I do not know
of any that have been forced to close their
doors. When the honourable senator from
Victoria (Hon. Mr. Barnard) was introducing
his Bill in the session of 1931 he made the
following statement, among others:
Conditions to-day, however, are such that it
is practically impossible to get any further aid
from the municipalities or fron the Government.
That was two years ago, yet, thanks principally to generous support by the public,
none of the hospitals in British Columbia, I
think, have been obliged to close their doors
since that time.
We should be fortunate, indeed, if only
hospitals and charitable institutions were
suffering. The depression that has been in
existence for the past three or four years has
caused serious trouble to federal, provincial
and municipal governments and to industry
in general, particularly to agriculture, the basic
industry of Canada. In the face of these conditions our people are meeting their difficulties bravely, and in my opinion they would
be strongly averse to legislation of this kind,
as it would not in any sense relieve the
situation.
It is unfortunate that the sponsors of the
Bill are forced to take the Irish Free State
as their model. I have nothing to say about
the people of the Irish Free State, but at the
same time I think that the average Britisher
to-day does not entirely approve of certain
actions of that country. However, that is
neither here nor there. But if we want to
follow an example, why not take the action
of the British Parliament as our guide? In
a speech in this House in 1931 the late Right
Hon. Senator Sir George E. Foster pointed
out to us that a motion was made in the

SENATE
British buse two years ago for leave to
introduce a Sweepstakes Bill, and that motion
was rejected by a vote of 181 to 58. The
rigbit honourablo gentleman referrod to the
great popularity of sports in Eng-land, and he
thought it very significant tbat Parliament
sbould refuse to adopt a motion even to give
leave t.o introduce a Sweepstakes Bill.
Outside of the Irish Free State, no part
of the Empire bas evor considered the adoption of a law of this kind. In December
last some 25,000 people of Vancouver voted
in faveur of sweepstakes, and thore wvas a
favourable vote shortly afterwards by the
Britisb Columbia Hospital Association, but
apart fromi tbese two instances
no province,'
city or otber municipalit.v. nor even a
hospital board, lias roquested the passing of
legislation sirilar te this. 1 submit tbat it
would be unwise for us to pass this measure
before tbere is some definite dýemand for it,
not only in Britisb Columbia, but tbrougbout
the Dominion.
After aIl, wbat particular bencfit would
accrue te tbe public fromn tbis measure?
Probably one man in 1O,COO migbt be fertunate
enougb te wvin a prize : tbis weuld mcan tbat
9,999 other persens !bad 'contributed towards
tbe purcbasc of it. Two or tbree days age a
gcntlorman froma the
ase
Townships told
me that in ne community down tbere a man
had wvon a sweepstakes prize of $8.000. and th(,
wbole cemmueity went simplv wild about it.
I asked him wvbat in bis opinion wvas tbe
amoueit contributed by tbe people of tbat
?articular place towards th(, next drawieg for
sw'eeptakos, and be said: "I am safe in Saying
that for evory dollar tbat, man recoived the
communjtY contributed tbrce or four dollars;
possibly $25,000 or more altoge-ther."
The
seheme is net a profitable one, and in my
opinion it will net tend te impreve the
moralitv of tbe country, nor assist our people
in aey sbape or form.
For these reasons I am 'strongly opposed to
tbe passieg of tbis Bill. 1 moe, secoeded by
tbe honourable sena-tor from King's (Hon.
Mr. Hughes) :
That this Bill be net now read a secon(l time,
but thait it be rend a second tiîne tbis day six
nionths.
Hon. G. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Honeurable
senators. whcen this Bui wvas before us last
session I expressed wbat 1 theugbit were somo
very cogent reasons why it sbeuld pass, but
apparently tbey did net appeal te tbe majerity
of bonourable members.
Tee many of us
were wandering in dark places and unable te
sstbe ligbt.
Ilon. Mr. GILLIS.

I confess tbat wben I heard the heartrending appeal bx' the boneurable senater from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) I fearod tbat
my hair migbt rise like quilîs upon tbe fretful
percupine; but on put-ting mv band up te my
head I found tbat net a bair bad moved. The
boneurable gentleman said that ail over
America tbe people are imbued with the vice
of gambling, and that up and down the United
States and Canada ho bas seen its dire effeets.
From this it wouild appear tbat it would be
just as reasenable fer a man te undertake te
teach his graedmether tbe gentle art of extraoting the yolk from an eggl as te suppose
that any legisiation we pass here wvill cause
our people te, indulge in tbe gambling habit.
I have net heard anyene say that anvthing we
mnigbt do would induce people te ferm the
habit of gamhling, for everyoe wbo would
buy a sweepstakes ticket bas the hahit already.
Som-e bon. SENATORS:

No.

Hon. Mr. LY-N'CH-STAUNTON:
Seme
benourable gentlemen say ne. Perbaps tbey
could net be induced te gamble. Tbey are
like the late right bonourable senafor fromn
Ottawa, who made such a wonderful speech
two years ago. Ho knew just as much about
gambling and tbe habits of tbe people as he
did about delirium tremens. If 'vo already
indulge that habit, if we do gamble, tbe
preps are taken from tînder tbe argument
that by passing tbis Bill w-e are geing te
introduce a new vice into Canada.
I amn
surprised that an honourable gentleman with
imagination sbould stand up in this bouse,
and say that ho trusted the Sonate of Canada would net, disgrace itself heyond redemptienHon. Mr. MURDOCIÇ:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

-by de-

ing such a horrible thing as te pass this Bi11
and se autbeorize the Attoreey-General of
British Columbia te permit the charitably
minded people of the province te centribute,
throughi a lottery, te the support of a hu-pital.
That is a staggering crime. I appreciato that
enly the lurid imagination of the honourahle
senator from Parkdalo (Hon. Mr. Murdeck)
could get a thrill eut of opposing such a
moasure.
New, honourable senators, lot us lock inte
this subjeet of gubn.I
would remied
the House that, with the exception of
lotteries ,an( of card pla *ving-on railway trains,
overy kind of gamhîling is encouraged and
protected by law. Last session I heard an
honourable senator declare that steck spoculatin was net gambling, but was mcrely a

MARCH 13, 1933
commercial avocation. Well, a gentleman
who to-day is heard frequently over the radio
characterizes those who indulge in stock
speculation "Wall Street crap shooters." To
encourage tbis so-called crap shooting on the
stock market we have passed mining laws
which allow the issue of penny stocks. We
have enacted legisîstion to cover wifb the
protecting cloak of the law the mosf abomin-able frauds. There is no fraud these company
promoters and stock speculators can devise
thaf is nlot protected by the laws of this
country. We encourage hundreds of thonsands of our people to indulge in the most
extravagant and viciaus form, of gamblinag.
The promot-ers of fhese garnbling transactions,
which bring tens of thousands to financial
ruin, have been so protected by statute that
tbey have devised the most perfect gambling
machine imaginable. Yet the men who justify
those laws express histrionie horror when if
is proposed to .pass a measure to allow people
to contribute f owards the expenses of a bospital. I regard with the greatest indignation
the laws of this country which. proteet and
indeed encourage the vilest forms of gambling.
I hear witb amazement bonourable gentlemen
denouncing lotteries when they know that
every f orm of gambling frorn crap éhooting
to three-card monte is lawful in Canada. These
honourable gentlemen denounce gambling.
WeIl, that old satirist Samuel Butler wrote
of certain people that they "Compound for
sins they are inclin'd to, by damning those
they have no mind to."
As one of our newspapers said yesterday,
these anti-lotfery laws are a form. of national
hypocrisy.
They give an opportunity to
raise a great clamour over nothing, to obscure
the islIe in a cloud of duz-t. Lt is as tbough
with self-righteous air an honourable member
should ýsay: "Look upon -ie! I allow no
gambling. I a.m shiocked t0 t'bink thaf the
people of Canada should be encouraged by
this grave and reverend Senate t0 induce a
poor sheep-herder in Wyoiming-innocenoe
abroad !-to sp.end $2.50 on a lottery ticket.
Don't encourage him t0 do that. Let him
waste his: money on the raee-frack, let 1dm,
wager it on a three-card monte gam-e, or on a
cock fight-on anything he likes; let this
highly moral mernber of the comrnunity
squander bis money in a bucket àhop, let
him. waste it anywhere, but for thbe love of
Mike don't let him risk it on a lottery ticket."
In England a Royal Commission, composed
of men quite as respectable as any bonourable member of this House, bas been inquiring into the evils or the benefits of lotteries.
Recently 1 read in the London Observer, a

very respectable newspaper, thaf this Royal
Commission is about f0 report in favour of
lot teries.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: In England, and I think in this country f00, public
opinion bas come around emphatically in
favour of these harmless amusements.
Now, I do not tbink that my honourable
friend who grew s0 eloquent in bis denunciation of this Bill would objeet to a man
giv-ing 82.50 to a ho.spital. 1 snay lawfully go
to that man and asic him to contribute $2.50;
I could shame him into it before *his friends.
But should 1 tell him, '11 you give mne that
$2.50 you will have one chance ini 500,000 f0 get
a prize," that is wrong, that is wicked, fhat
is making him a gambler, that is imperilling
'bis eternal salvation. I cannot so regard
it, However, fo-nighf I may be overly sfupid.
The question, bonourable members, is not
whether we shaîl create a gambling spirit
among tbe people of tbis country. Those
who bave resisfed the temptation all their
lives would not be seduced now sbould this
Bill become law. I arn quite sure the honourable senator fromn Toronto would not fail into
evil waysHon. Mr. MURDQCK: Parkdale, if you
please.
Hlon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Parkdale. I am sure he would not faT into evil
ways sbould we legalize lotteries. Having
passed by the bueket shop, the race-track, the
card game, without turning bis head, surely
he would be able to resist the lure of a
lottery, as would any other of bis kind. So
by passing fhis Bill we are merely going to
let those vicious people wbo to-day take a
Blutter on the stock market, or on the racetrack, or af fhree-card monte, spend tiheir
money in another way. I thinkimost honourable senators will agree wifb me that if is
certainly less damnable f0 put one's $2.50 on
a 'bospital Ioftery t.icket than on a horse-race.
If may be presumed thaf onily those wbo now
indulge in race-frack befting will avail tbemselves of this measure; tiherefore we are nof
degrading those persone; we are really lifting
tbem. f0 a somneveat bigber plane. I wish
honourabie senators would think th-is over
very carefully before voting on the Bull, for
I know if fhey vote against if they will do so
for appearanoe sake only.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The honourable
gentleman ought net to impute motives.

Hon.
G. H. BARNARD:
Honourable
senafors, I should have preferred f0 rnove
tlic adjournment of tho debate at this hour
of the nigbt.
I desire to thank, the hionourabie gentleman
%vho introduced the Bill (Mon. Mr. McRae)
for the very kind manner in whichi lic referred
to me in bis opening remarks. Lt bcd been
m.y intention to introduce it at flic opening
of the session, but I was aware tînt a Royal
Commission in England iras investigating thle
subject of lotteries, betting ancl other forms
of gambling, and 1 thoughit tlîat the report
of tînt Commission would be of assistance Io
some lionourable senators in conîing to a conclusion on the monits or denîerits of flîis
question. 'l'ie Comnmission lias ot yot macle
ifs report. Officiais from tie Home Office,
niembers of the police force and of religions
bodies, andl a nîîmber of social workers gaveo
evi(lence. I do nt tliîîk fliaf any~ person
of uinbatd mind, reading t be ex idence so far
is
î it relates fo lotteri.s, would iliffer vcry
miucli from the conclusions to wlîicli I have
corne.
Aly first 'conolusion is fliat public opinion
in Gro.at Britain is in favour of sweepstakes
f0 sucb an extent fliat the practice of pinrclnsing tickets is xidespread tiihongit
Grea;t Brifain; so much so fliat fliose responsible for the enforcernent of the law
against lotteries bave thrown Up thîeir bands
in despair.
Secondly, the law is being broken to such
an extent that it is being brougbt into contempt and ridicule; and it is being broken
with the connivance, and almost the approx aI,
of the Benches bof ore whom offenders are
brougbt.
To show you how widespread is the practice,
I will quote shortly some figures whicli appear
in the evidence of Sir Ernley Blackwell,
K.C.B., Legal Assistant to the Under Secretary
of State for tbe Home Office.
1 hiave ere he figures of the suliscriptions
received in Dublin for the lire mweeps, previous
to thc sWeep on the 1932 Derby. I will just
gi ve the totais: £13.800,000 is the total subscribed in those live sweeps. That includes the
sellers' commnission.
The amount rcceived in
D)ublin is £11.500.000.
The sellers' commission
amotints to £2.300.000; that is, il in every £6
subscribed efays in the sellers' pookets. If he is
dealing in these tickets bore lie seINs tlîe twelve
tickets in the book, for £6, pots £1 in his pocket
and sends £5 f0 Dublin.

MARGH 13, 1933
Sir Sydney Skinner- That is 16# per cent?
-Yes. Expenses in addition to sellers' commission arnount ta £1.041.000. The hospitals have
received £2,800,000 and £7,675,000 bas been
distributed in prizes.
He had previously given particulars of the
attempts made by the authorities to prevent
the transmission of rnoneys for these sweepstakes from Engiand to Ireland, and hae now
states that in spite of ail they could do they
were only able ta stop the transmission of
about £100,000.
Now I wish to quote from a memorandum
submitted by the Chief Constable of the City
of Manchester to the Commission:
Since the Irish Hospitals sweepstakes were
instituted. 20 persons have been proceeded
against for selling tickets for the Irish sweep,
and of this number one was fined 10 shillings,
nine were flned 5 shillings each, one was fined
4 shillings, seven were fined 1 shilling each, and
two were ordered ta pay coste.
It will thus be seen that the fines imposcd
at the Courts were merely nominal, expressing
very clearly the view held by the Justices in
regard to offences of this oharacter. On several
occasions Justices have comrnented in Court on
the ridiculous procedure in bringing sucb cases
hef are themi and have then contented themselves
by inflicting the smallest possible fine.
It ii well known that the sale of tickets for
the Irish sweepstakes bas reached enormous
proportions, net only amongst that section of
the public well able ta afford the price charged,
but amongst -the poor classe&-where it is quite
com-mon for syndieates ta be formed, each person
in the group becoming the owner of a share in
each ticket purchased by the group.
When Sir Ernley Blackwell was giving bis
evidence, the Chairman asked hîm the following question:
What is the romance in the Manchester
Novemiber Handioap?-There is the sporting
interest in racing that makes a trernendous
appeal ta, the people and that, I imagine, is
the reason of the popularity of the Dublin
sweepstakes.
Chairman: Yeu cannot possibly enforce the
law against it because there would be more
people to prosecute than there would bie ta
prasecuite them.
Would it be fair ta say that the present law
s0 f ar as the suppression of sweepstakes ie concerned bas almost been reduced to a farceTCertainly.
Another question by Sir F. S. Jackson:
You have stappcd £ 100,000, but that is all yau
have been able ta do by your efforts ta make
the law operaîte ?-And prosecute in certain
cases. T arn bound to say in London our
Magistratee have taken a different view f rom,
e]sewhere, though I do not think they have been
severe; but in the country the Benches have
treated prosecutians in a very derisory way.
Sometimes it has been said fromn the Bench,
"We have ail got tickets!"
Then again, in the evidence of Mr. Maxwell, Chief Constable of Manchester, I find
the following:

335

I suppose, in the noiith, as elsewhere, every
clams of society indulgeo in the Irish sweepstakes?-Yes, undoubtedly.
I suppose that when alI classes of society
are going in for the Irish sweepstakes, it is
impossible to corne down and infiot these heavy
penalties in the case of a particular man when
hie is caught?-That is quite the position. In
one Lancashire town a very short time ago,
ane of these cases was brougbt before the
Courts and the presiding Magistrate nid that
hie personally had several tickets in bis pocket
at the moment. He was prepared ta nay that
everybody in the Court with perhaps the exception of the Cle-rk ta the Court would also
have tickets.
Why hie picked on the Clark of the Court
as the ona innocent man in the room, history
does not relate.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
the price.

He did not have

Hon. Mr. BARNARD:
Now, just one
reference to Scotiand. 1 amn sorry mny friend
from. Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Gillis) is flot
here, hecausa, knowing his nationaiity, I ara
sure hae would appreciate what I am going ta
read. This is an extract from a statemant
submitted by the National Scottish Leagua
against Batting and Gambiing:
The flippant manner in which certain magistrateis have administered the law when dealing
with cases of violation of the Lotteries Acta,
has been nothing less than scandalous.
In April of tis
year, we reported ta the
Secretary of State for Scotland the case of a
Bailie in Aberdeen, wbo when dealini with a
maýn who had infringed the Lotteries Acts,
said: Persan-ally lie had taken the risk himself
of buying coupons in the street, and if a policeman saw him, hie miglat land himaself in the
saoee position.
Thera is ana more statement by this Leagua
that I think honourable membars of this
House, and mambars of tha House of Gomnmons, will take ta heart:
Lt is not surprising that the Lotteries Acts
are regarded with contempt when it is possible
ta read in the press that "sweepstake tickets
are ail but openly on sale in the Houas of
Parliament. . . ."
When members in the
Hous-_ of Parliarnent treat as an excellent joke
the oalling to the attention of the Speaker of
a fellow-Member filling up counterfoile of sweepstake tickets, it cannot be expected that the
public will treat with respect laws which are
publicly made the subject of ridicule by t-heir
legi-siatars.
Here is the crux of tha whola matter.
Again let me quote from Sir Ernley Blackwell,
in answer ta a question put by the Chairman:
Small penalties are i.mposed ?--Small penalties
are imposed. No peal-ty at ail is imposed iii
many cases, and, of oourse, there is a great
reluotance on the part of the police ta take
any steps at ail.
The feeling is in everybody's mind ths.t everybody is in it?-The real misohief, for I think
I arn right in describing it as a miochief, is

ridicule; and that people shouid be openly
hreaking the liw with the connivance. anti
ajlmost the approval, of the Benches before
wiîon tiîcy arc brotiglit,
It is very bad iii.leed ? I tluinki~t is a
terrible evil. It mealus eitiier that the ]aw i,
,
i-d a t anuy
a lxii oîie aiid oîîgh t to lx, rcp
rate altercd, or that so)me measurres shouid be
takenl to rcrnedy the present statc of affairs.
I thjnk I have rcad enough to show the
House the state of affairs and of public
opinion in Great Britain in regard to this
rnatter. I do flot profess to speak for the
other provinces of Canada, but 1 amn absoiuteiy
convinced that so fer as rny own province
is conccrned the great majority of the people
sec no harm in buying a ticket in a iottcry or
a sweepstake; and ail the laws in the world
will neyer make thern sec that it is moraliy
wrong to do so. Therefore they wiil continue to do it, despite the iaw, and that, I
say, is a highiy undesirabie state of affairs.
I do not think that public opinion throughout
the rest of Canada differs from that very
ranch, and I do not think I amn in the least
overstating the feet whien I say that a very
large surn of money indeed goes out of the
Dominion that might vcry wcii be retained
here and put to our own uses.
The next conclusion I carne to in reading
that evidence avas that there avas very littie
specifie evidence of any great cvii resuit
either to the individuals indulging or 10 tlheir
There are statements made by

virtuaily ail the religious bodies, on moral
grounds, generaily condemning the practice
aund alcging that great harrn is done; but
f ew l)articuiar instances, if any, are given
except in one or two isolated cases. On the
other hand, there are very definitely cxpressed
opinions by sorne of the higher authorities,
and by social workers, that no harm. is done.
I arn not going to quote in respect to that
at any great icngth, but I wiil give one or
two citations just to verify what I say. Again
in the mernorandum prepared by the Chief
Constable of the -City of Manchester il is
stated, ina paragraph 9, as a considered
opinion:
Large scule or "commercial" sweepstakes
operated on the systeins at present in vogue do
generaily, have any apparent
'lot, spcîakingeffect on those persons participatdemioraiizing
myscîf, frorn my own experience,
ing. nor have I
corne in contact îvith any case where persons,
aiho have indulged in tîjis forrn of gambling,
iiegleetcd their ordinary occupations, dutie8,
farnilies or social ife generally.
Then I find at question 646:
Do you think that tbis form of lottery does
much harm?-Persoaly I have neyer seen any
evfil rnailts at ahl from it.
You mean it is inerely a way in whichi certain

but it does not end in any great public cvii
ike the destitution of farîiiies or leading people
into crimie?-No, I do flot think so.
Tiuc evidence of Lieutenant-Colonel Brook.
Cliief Constable of the West Riding of Yorkshire, is as foilows:
Do you thiuik the Inisl Swccp, or anytiaing of
that size, does any reai hiarr? Is il only
people hiaving flutters, or are they beggaring
theinselves by going in for it? I have heard it
suggested oultside tbis roorn tbat in other
countries, ani I have lîcard it suiggested of
Ireland, people will starve thenmselves and their
fainilies iii order to accuioulate enougu inoney
to get as many tickets as tbey cao in onie of
these big sweepstakes. Have you any experience
of that sort?-Yes, I have had experience of
isolatcd instances of that. In every forna of
amusement or interest there arc sonie excesses.
During flic lest sweepstake, with -wlih I have

of miles away, who wîrote pathetic letters aftcrw-vards saying that they lied been saving rip
sixpence a week, in order 10 have their tin
shillings in tliese sweepstakes, and no doubt to
these people the loss is a serions iatter. But
I1 lbink those cases are jsolated.
Onu more quotation, from the evidence of
Mr. Sidlney Burgess, Court Mi.-sionary and
Probation Officer at Higligate Police Court.
Hr, said:

The point 1 makie from Ihat is thet wbile
the religiouS bodies are, as a malter of principie, opposed 10 gamhiing, tlueir opposition
h. to anY formi of grniing. Tlîey do not
endrevour. so far as I ean sev from reading
this ex idenre. to show any specific cases where
peî'ticuir form of what they eall
gembiing lias donc env harm to any in(iividuiel or env family; andi, as 1 say, Ihere
is direct evidence of opinion quite to the
contrary, heid lw people Who are wcll quaiified
to iuhru
One of the arguments against the Bill is
that 10 seli sweepstake tickets is inherentiy
wrong; that is ho say, that il is a moral wrong.
But, as was said by Rev. F. E. Watson, one
of the witnesses before the Royal Commission
ia England, the man in the street would no

luis

337

MARCH 13, 1933
more take his ethics from a committee who
tell Mim that it is morally wrong to commit a
certain act, than a member of such a committce would take Mis ethica from the man
in the street. In my opinion it wili never be
poible to convince the mai ority of the people
in tMis or any other Anglo-8axcon country that
there is anything morally wrong in the purchase of a sweepstake ticket; and for that
reason, if for no other, I say that there should
be a change in the law.
The second argument is that tMs legisiaion would dry up the springs of charity.
Well, I do not think there is very much i
that contention. That argument was ad-.
vanced before the Royal Commission in Eng[and. If my understanding is correct, the
hospitals in that country are maintained by
charitable donations, and professional men
give their services free of charge to indigent
patients. Now, under our system-I speak
of my own province only--charitablc donaLions are made towards capital expenditures,
aund the cost of actual maintenance is defrayed
by revenue from three sources: the Provincial
Government grant, the municipal grant, and
receipts from paying patients. The amount
contributed towards actual maintenance is
very small, in comparison with the total maintenance costa, though it is true that ladies'
guilds and similar societies do raise some
money for tMis purpose. And even if the
hospitals were maintained at the Mighest possible peak of efficiency, there need be no fear
on the part of my honourable friend from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) or anyone else
of lack of opportunities to contribute to other
charitable institutions.
The hour is late and I am trying to make
my remarks as brief as possible. It appears to
me that there would be the following advantages from passing this legislation: First,
by lcgallzing a practice which bas grown up
in defiance of the existing law, a practice in
which the great mai ority of the public, including the beat and most responsible of our
people, sec no moral wrong, the Bill would
eliminate the great evil of a gencral disregard
,of that law. Second, it would result in obtaining funds for dcserving institutions that
are sorely in need of money, and a large part

of the funds would comc from people who
,otherwise would neyer contribute to these
objecte. TMird, it would take a heavy financial
burden fromn provincial and municipal governments, whose taxpayers are already groaning under the present load.
I belleve these advantages far outweigh
.any harmn that can be donc by the passing of
the Bull, and for that reason I shall vote for

the second reading and against the amendment.

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, I think I owe it to the House to express, before the vote is taken, my view, net
se much on the main motion as on the motion
to adjourn the debate. I do not think that
the Senate is se busy that we ought to try
to rush a vote to-night. We have flot a mass
of business on the Order Paper for temorrow, yet it seems to me that it is essential
we should meet to-morrow. I have ne very
streng views, one way or the other, as te, the
measure before the House, but I do think that
on account of the importance of that measure
we ewe it te bonourable inembers who bad ne
very good reason te expeet a vote to-night
that they should be given an opportunity te
expresrs their views and te vote. I hope that
the motion te adjourn the debate wvil1 be
carried.

The Hon. the SPEAKER:

THE SENATE

at

The Senate resumcd from yesterday the
debate on the question proposed. by Hon. Mr.
Foster:
Toe ail the attention of the Senate te the
abnornial cost, hoth te candidates and the
,eoîntry, of fedleral elections.
and inquire if
the leader of the Government would cofiBider
the question of the appointment of a select
cornrnittee of this Heuse te consider a.nd report
upoix sucb action as would materially reduce
the cost thereof.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
Honourable senators, 1 understand that my honourahle fricnd frem Westmorland (Hon. Mr.
Black) movel the adjournment of the debate
merely te give an opportunitv te any hionourable members who might desire te express
their views on this question. I liad notifled
my bonourable fricnd who introduccd the
inquiry (Hon. Mr. Foster) that I wished te
voice some views which I hold on the subject
of federal election cests, but 1 must confess
that in doing se, I forgot, and net until yes-terday did I remember, that I had stated
those views last session. However, when 1
spoke on this matter a year ago honourable
members of this llouFe and of another place
were
concentrating
their thougbts
upon
inother subject, and I tlîink that very littie
attention was paid te my remarks. At any
rate, I saw very littie reference te thema in
the press.
I desýire te repeat as bricfly as possible
what I said last year. But first may I say that
in my opinion the suggestions of the hionoiurable gentleman fromn Saint John (Hon. Mr.
Foster) are excellent, and should bc kept in
mind by members of the present Gox ernment
if any attempt is made te deal with this
important subjeet, and should be incorporated
in any Bill that may be draftcd te improec
the present election laws,.
Ail parliaments in demiocratic countries
c,,- at varions tinmes grappled wvîth the
probleni of hew best te conduet elections, and
the gencral aii bias hee te reduce their
cest. A solution bas bcen souglit in limiting
the arniunts that mighit legallv be spent by
can(hidates, and in rcquiring that publicity
in sonne form or uther shomld bc given to
campaimtn subscriptions. But I believe the

MARCH 14, 1933
cure of the evil is flot to be found in either
of those directions. So long as the present
financial requirements exist, the money will
have to be found somewhere. It seems to me
there ougbt to be a reduction in the amount
of money needed for election purposes, and I
do flot know of a rnuch better plan for reducing
the costs than compulsory voting.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In the days of
absolute monarchy, as I stated last session,
it was the priviloge of the king to choose his
ministers, and if he failed to do sa and allowed
state affairs to drift, bis reign moon came to an
end. Ta-day, under our parliamentary institutions, the people have the right, which tbey
may exercise every four years or so, to elect
their Government. I believe it is flot only their
privilege, but also their duty, and therefore I
would suggest that voting should be made comnpulsory. The adoption of compulsory voting
would eliminate a large proportion of the
expenditure which an election entails to-day.
In my opinion the recomanendation of the
honourable senator from Saint John. (Hon. Mr.
Foster) that federal elections should be held
on a legal holiday is well worth considering.
H1e has suggested that Sunday be chosen for
this purpose. I arn not averse to, the suggestion. Indeed 1 think in many countries ini
Europe that day is selected for the holding of
elections. The impression may go abroad that
the noise and excitement incident ta an election. would be unseemly on a Sunday, but I
think compulsory voting would do away with
most of the noise and clamnour of bringing
electors ta the poli, for tbey would simply
corne of their own volition. I think also that
the holding of our federal elections on aSunday would impress an the electors that it was
a day consecrated to God and to their country.
But it seems to me that, mast important of
aIl, compulsory voting would bring about a
substantial reduction of electian casts and so
avoid the necessity of collecting funds from
party devatees or from persans having an
axe to grind. My experience of conducting
elections bas been mostly in the city of Montreal, and there the cost of preparing the voters'
lists has mounted s0 higb as ta have become
almost intolerable ta candidates. I think the
State sbould assume the responsibility of preparing these vaters' lists. For tbis purpose I
would suggest that in large towns and cities
permanent returning afficers should be appointed ta keep the lists up ta date. This
macbinery wauld perbaps be somewhat costly,
but I feel tbat the State should furnish th.
macbinery for the registration of vaters. I
cannot express an opinion as ta the necessity
of appointing permanent returning afficers for
the rural ridings.
No doubt honourable
53721-22àj

339

gentlemen, especially tbose in the other
Chamber, would give us the benefit of their
views an this point. But I bold tbe profound
conviction that in towns and cities of from
50,000 ta 100,000 population the registration of
voters after the writs are issued constitutes
a veritable scandaI. Tbe race is on, the
candidates are chosen, and naturally they try
te, arrange tbe lists in such a way as ta favour
their respective parties. In large cities such
as Montreal and Toron-to I think it is imperative,' if we are ta bave a dlean election, based
an fair lists, that these lists sbould be prepared. and from day ta day kept in order, by
permanent returning officers, who would be in
constant toucb witb tbe electorate.
These permanent returning officers should
select the polling baotbs and immediately
after nomination day notify the electors where
tbey are ta vote. The reception of the notification card would as well, of course, remove
any doubt in tbe elector's mind as ta wbether
bie was on the voters' lists. The snunicipality
of Montreal bas adopted such a systein. At
the last election, althougb there were frorn
180,000 ta 200,000 electors, every elector was
notifled in due time where hie was ta vote.
Witb cornpulsory voting, permanent lists
and notification ta the electors by the returning officers, the only expense ta be incurred by the candidate would be for publicity, which should not be a very heavy item
to-day, since most of the electors could bie
reacbed by radio broadcasts. By these means
we ehould purify the campaigu atmosphere
and free Parliament fromn the domination of
big interests, thur, permitting freer scope for
tbe exercise of democratic power.
1 made tbese suggestions last session, and I
think tbey are worth considering, for the
cost of conducting elections has becoine altogether too burdensome. In Montreal no
candidate can expect ta conduet bis election
campaign without expending at les.st $25,000.
Some years ago a successful candidate in one
of the city's electoral divisions, in a sworn
statement, placed his campaign expenses at
$47,000. His vanquished opponent bad ta
admit that hie bad spent as mucb. If under
sucb conditions it is necessary tbat money
should be contributed, we cannot expect ta
stop tbe gatbeqing of money ta meet that need.
I think the only way ta cure the evil-I amn
speaking only of the large towns and citie-is ta, red-uce the need which has existed in the
past by having the State assume a sbare of the
expense of registering electars and notifying
tbem wbere ta vote; and in this way the
attention of electors would be directed ta the
duty tbey owe ta the country.
On motion of Hon. Mr. McRae, tbe debate
was adjourned.

down wherever tried; and that, therefore,
we should legalize and promote ganibling.
Surely this deduction cannot properly be
drawn. Such reasoning is an attempt to compare two things that are not comparable.
While drunkenness is a wîdespread social and
moral evil, and total abstinence, if undertaken
voluntarily, a most heroic virtue, this virtue
can neyer be enforced by law; and it is
immoral to try to enforce it by law, because
the use of alcoholic beverages in moderation
is neither sinful nor improper. Our Lord Himself flot only partook of wine in moderation,
but provided it for others, and in consequence
was called a wine bibber and a glutton by
certain people in His day. But even those
people neyer called Hi-m a gambler. The
prohibition-ists made the mistake of trying to
add another commandment to the -ten, and
of course they failed. But siirely it is the
negation of rea.on to say that because prohibition failed, and was bound to fail, we
should promote garnbling. I cannot find a
single argument worthy of the name in favour
of this Bill, except the very specîous one that
a part of the ill-gotten gains would be given
to hospitals and other worthy objects. Surely
the Senate of Canada will neyer make merchandise of its moral principles. Every proper
human law is founded upon, and must be in
-conformity with, the divine law, and every
member of this honourable House .should
be able to see that there is a vast difference
between prohibiting a thing that is flot
contrary to divine law, and legalizing a thing
that is, to say the least, morally doubtful.
If we refrain from passîng this Bill, we shall
be on safe ground; if we pass it, we shahl,
as I see it, be taking a momnentous and
dangerous step-one that we may regret, but
cannot retrace. I hope the Senate will not
pass the Bill.
Hon. L. MeMEANS: Honourable members,
I tbink I owe it f0 this buse to give my
reason for supporting this Bill. During my
early experience in political matters the doctrine of provincial rights was pretty well
beaten into me. We know that in the old
days that doctrine was a very burning question in the Province of Manitoba, and
in some of the other Western Provinces, and
as a provincial representative I feel t.hat a
province should be accorded any right that
belongs to it. I think -it is part of the
duty of every senator who enfers this House
t0 look after and proteet the intereste of the
province which he represents.
The Bill, as I have if here, merely throws
upon eac'h province the responsibility of saying whether or not it wishes to authorize

lotteries or sweepstakes for the benefit of the
hospitals in that province. The responsibility
rests not upon this House, but upon the provincial legîslafures and upon the people of the
various provinces.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: They cannot act without this legislafion being passed.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Why not?
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: That is what the legislation is for.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I kn.ow that is what
the legislation is for, but the responsibility is
theirs.
I should have thought the proper place for
the honourable member for Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock) f0 deliver his fervid speech
would be before the people of Ontario rather
than in this House. If you look over the situation in the Dominion at large you will find
t.hat the prineiple I have enunciafed applies
generally. Take the Sunday observance law
for instance: while it specifies rnany effences
and fixes very severe penalties, if winds up by
saying that no preseoution. shaîl take place
under that law unless the Atforney-General
of the -province assents thereto. Thaf is an
acknowledgment of the rights of the provinces.
WNhat has happened with regard to prohibition? There was a grea-t agitation for
Domninion-wide prohibition. The people of
Quebee did flot like it, however, and said:
"No, you must flot interfere with our province." Then the right was given te each of
the provinces t0 do as they pleased in that
matter, and nearly ail of fhem pawed prohibition legislation. Then, again, the provinces said: "We are restricted by the Dominion law in stopping the import of liquor
into the provinces. We wanf the rîghf to stop
the import of liquor." What happened? The
Dominion Parliament gave themn that right.
What is the purpose of this Bill? If is
simply to give to the provinces the right,
which they should have, to attend te an affair
of their own. This is a question for them f0
decide, and I for one see no0 reason why they
should not be permitted f0 decide if. I do
not know why there should be so, much agitation about this proposaI. So far as I can see,
the action of the honourable gentleman from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) springs from
a laudable desire to* assist charitable institutions. However, I arn going fo vote for the
Bill on the ground of provincial righta.
In view of the objections raised by fhe
honourable members from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdoek) and Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr.

MARCH 14, 1933
Civilization in Europe is older than in
America. In Europe, except in Irel'and, it
bas been found that it is dangerous and
undesiraible for the State Vo encourage
the speculative urge; that nothing is of
more value to a country than the industry and courage of its citizens. In some
parts of Europe there are so-called lotteries,
but there is no comparison between themn and
sweepstakes as proposed under this Bill. For
instance, the city of Paris did operate a lottery,
but every person who bought a ticket had the
a:bsolute assurance that ail the money paid
out by hlmi for that ticket would be refunded
somne day, with at least three per cent inVerest. The gambling in those lotteries was
limited Vo that portion of the interest which
exceeded three per cent. Therefore the purchase of a ticket in that kind of lo'ttery carrnes
with it an investment. But the purchaser of
a sweepstakes ticket makes a real gamble, for
he will either lose everything that he puts up,
,or win more, perbaps considerably more.
1V has been said that there is a degree of
ehance in everything. That is true. Lif e
itself is sometimes a great venture, and the
element of chance enters into the most ordinary transactions.
When a man buys a
property hie does noV know whether the value
,of it will go up or down. But how can there
be found in these welI-known facts any argument Vo support sweepstakes?
In conclusion. honourable memibers, mav 1
make a suggestion? If this Bill goes to a committee, would it noV be possible Vo provide
against the operation of numerous sweepstakes
throughout the provinces and to authorize
only one lottery, that to be carried on under
federal control? If we must have sweepstakes,
let us keep the number down to a minimum.

not adhered to, I Leed at liberty to offer sucb
observ ations on election reforin as my short
expericuce in party management lea<1ls nie to

I can assure hionourahle

the finanejal huirden of an election prevents
many patriotie citizens, c-peciallv well quialilied for puiblic service. froru attempting to
enter parliamentacv life.

The voliint arv and nacre prominent svorkers
pec-haîcs xorlk iii hope of a rcward. But the
promise of jobs and favours iý not a conveutional offence; it is nu violation of thec
Ton Commandments.'
It is said that President Andrew Jackson and
bis so-called "Kitchen" Cabinet originated the
modern practice of giving jobs as rewards for
party services. To-day our Civil Service Act
seriously interferes with the practice in this
country. The incentive for party wock is
thereby largely removed, and as a rule you
must pay your party wockers as you go. The
expenditure in this connection formis a large
part of election expenses.
It is surprising bow many of our citizens
feel that in vuting for a candidate tbey are
doing him. a great favour. During the short
time that I was a member of the other flouse
I was approached for contributions by many of
my electors, even by the Cloth, on the ground
that they had supported me in the election.
As indicative of the public attitude in this
regard, I recall that in my constituency, as the
non-resident Member, I contcibuted to no less
than seventeen churches and similar organizations, but when I became the defeated candidate not one of those organizations asked me
for a renewal of my subscription. And we
sbould flot forget the innumerable sporting and

other organizations which invariably eleet their
Member cf Parliament as their houoracy
president, later cal]ing on hira for financial

assistance.

In short, bis constituents regard

the purse of their Member as legitimate
plunder. In thîs respect I do not believe we
are improving.
It bas been said that only two classes of our
citizens sbould be in polities-the man wbo bas
so0 much money that he dues flot need any
more, and the man who bas nothing. My
answer is, if they stay in politics long enough
botb will be in tbe samne condition of ira-

poverisbment. Our political bighway is strewn
witb the financial wrecks of men wbo bave
given the best years of their if e to, public
service. Few of tbema bave received the only
reward worth wbile-tbe gratitude and appreciation of the Canadian peuple.
It would seema that tu-day the mai ority of

the public business urganizations, the Press,
vecs. even the (Jhureh. juin in the popular
pastinx cf flayiug the politician. forgetting

MARCH 15, 1933
that ini so doing they are depreciating Canadian citizenship itself. Who are the so-called
"politicians" but the chosen representatives of
the people? Invariably the politician ie one
of the best men in the constitucncy, far above
the average citizen. Indeed, it is my humble
opinion that the honouraoble members of this
House, with their long years in publie service
and in 'business, with that understanding of
public psychology gained only through political
experience, are better qualified to deal wîth
the issues of the dey than any body of business men that can be assembled in this country.
The demand to-day wouild appear to be for
statesmen. It bas been said that statesmen are
born, not made. 1 do not h.old that view.
Confronted by the many instances where successful business men have made a short and
unsuccessfui stay in parliamentary if e, I dlaim
that a statesman is a sucocssful politician, ane
who bas taken a postgraduate course.
I have the highest regard for the honesty
and sincerity of the members of both Houses
of Parliament. I know some of their difficulties in carrying on their public duties in
these trying times. Tbey do nlot need criticism; they do need support. May I appeal to
those of our countrymen 'who are criticizing
our public men to remember that it takes all
classes to make a nation, and that representative government, embodying this principle,
cannot ýbe expected ta please us all in every
particular?
The honourable senator framn Saint John
(Hon. Mr. Foster) estimated the cost of a
general election at one million dollars. This
estimate doubtless referred ta the cost to
one party only. There are 245 constituencies
in Canada. An expenditure by each party
averaging 34,000 a constituency is, I believe,
the minimum. This would mean a cost of
$2,000,000 for bath parties. We have been
hearing of city seats that cost a very large
amount of maney. I confess it cost me
several times $4,000 to be the defeated candidate in the hast election, and it cost my
opponent, se the report goes, very considerabiy more to win. Honourable senators who
are curiaus as to just how the expenditure
was nmade up, may, so far as I arn concernied,
sce it on record with the judgc in my constituency who approved it.
It is difficult to estimate at aIl accuratcly
wh.st an election costs. Election moneys
came from so many sources that it is wellnigh impossible to keep track of them.
First, there is the money the candidate furnishes himself. Then there ie the money
he gets from friends inside and friends outside the riding, who contribute directhy and
indirectly. Certain moneys for expenses corne

3545

through provincial or general funds. Travelling expenses of speakers are usually paid
fýrom funds outsidc of the riding. Advertising,
radio and general propaganda expenses are
not allocated ta any constitutency. There is,
therefore, no way of accurately estimating
the total amount of money spent hy any
party in an election. However, for the purpose of this discussion, the $2,000,000 estimated
as the expenditure by aIl parties in the hast
election may be taken as the minimum.
It will surprise honourable gentlemen ta
know just how much was expended by the
Federal Gavernment in connection with the
election of 1930. 1 find that the cost ta
the country of that election was $2,127,893.60.
It is interesting ta note how that expenditure
was made up. The figures are as follows:
Preparinag votera' lis.. .. ..... $1,113,250 41
Overhead: returning afficers. etc.. 912,139 83
Preparation in advance for election 102,503 00
It is interesting also ta observe that in the
last election, 5,153,971 voteirs were registered.
0f this number, as stated by the honourable
senatar from Saint John (Han. Mr. Foster),
3,922,481, or 76 per cent, vated. From these
figures it will be seen that to register the
voters cost the Government 21 cents per
name, including the 4 cents per name paid ta
the returning officer. Adding the Government's expenditure ta the estimated expenditurc of the political parties, we find a minimum cost for the last election. exceeding
$4,000,000, or more than Si per vote polled.
This total expenditure is, I think, unwarranted. Whilc party money goes for the payment of so-ca]ied legitimate expenses, the
higgledy-piggledy method of conducting electiens encourages very many expenditures that
are uselcss and. needicas. There is altogether
too much duplication, too much waste effort,
anc party trying ta protect itself againat the
other.
Among the ways and means of reducing
ciection expenses the first and most important
thing ta he considered, I think, is the time
at present required for an pipction campaign.
Six weeks is cntirely too long. In these days
of rapid transportation, with the help of the
air force ta deliver the ballot boxes in the
far-flung constituencies, and with the radio
bringing the issue direct ta the electorate in
ahi ridings from the day the clection je called,
enabling party leaders ta talk direct ta the
voters, and thus eliminating the necd for the
aid barnstorming campaign, it should be passible ta reduce the time necessary for an
election campaign ta three wceks; and in the
occasion-al deferred election that may be
necessary, four weeks should suffice. This
cutting down by haif of the time required for
an ciection campaign would, I estimate, re-

316

SENATE

duce the expenditure of each party by at least
00e-quarter. This alone would result in a
saving in the clection expenses of ail parties
of at least haîf a million dollars. I think
honourable senators wbo have been active in
election campaigos, particularly the recent one,
will realize what a great effort is rcquired
during the Iast two or three weeks to keep
up the political "whoopee" and to maintain
un interest that otherwvise would wane. That
effort, and the con.sequent expenditure of
money, are in my judgment entirely unnecessary.
The main item of expense to both parties
in an election is, as I think ail honourablc
gentlemen will appreciate, the preparation of
the voters' li.st. It must be apparent to all
that when the Governinent is already spend-

ing

.S1.100

in the preparation of a list

that list sbould be of such a character that
neither party need worry about its accuracy
or completeness.
I am in favour of adopting the Australian
systemn of compulsory voting. We have heard
a good deal about the Australian Compulsory
Voting Act, but I doubt whether many are
familiar with it; so, at the risk of wearying
bonourable senators, I shiaîl read a short
analysis of the salient points.
First, the Act provides that every elector
residing witbin five miles of a polling place
must record his vote.
Second, it places a duty on the Divi.sional
Returning Officer to compile a list of those
clectors who have flot votcd.
Third, it provides that within the prescribed
period after the close of an clection the
Divisional Returning Officer shall forward a
notification to each eloctor who bas flot voted,
requiring himn to giv e a valid, trutbful and
su-fficient reason for his failure to vote. This
notification contains a form to be fllled in by
the elector and returned to the Divisional
iReturning Offleer, stating the truc reason wby
sucli elector bas failed to record bis vote.
Fourth, it contains a provision wbereby, if
the elector is unable, by reason of absence or
personal incapacity, to complete and returo
the form, this eau be donc by some other
elector wbo býas peraonal knowlcdge of thc
facts.
Fiftb, it gives the Divisional Returning
Officor discretion to decide whethcr or flot the
reason containcd in the form shall be considered a sufficient excuse for not having
votcd.
Sixth, it provides that within tbrce months
after the election the Divisional Officer shahl
forwvard to the Chief Electoral Officer a list
showing: (a) the names of the electors who
Hon.

Mir. MeR.XE.

did flot vote, (b) the names of the electors
wbo did flot vote and who have forwarded
their reasons for flot voting, and (c) the
names of the electors wbo did flot vote and
wbo failed to forw-ard any excuse.
Seventh, ià excuses from the provisions of
tbis Act any elector serving outside of Australia witb the forces of any British Dominion
or allied country.
Eightb, it provides a penalty of onc pound
sterlingý for the offence of failing to vote. without suficient reason, or for failing to forward
an explanation of bis failure to vote, or for
.u}nitiga fal-e reason.
Ninth, it provides that proccedings for any
of these offences sbould flot be instjtuited
except by the Chief Electoral Officcr or upon
bis authorization.
Tcntb, it authorizes the Divisional Returning Offleer to remove f rom the votcrs' list
any elector who bas flot voted and who bas
failed to forward tbe prcscribed written cxplanation of bis failure to do so.
Those are the important clauses in the
Australian compulsory Act. It will be ohserved that tbey are flot very stringent, yet
iînder this Act, as the honourable senator from
Saint John (Hon. Mr. Foster) pointed out the
other day, the number of voters increaseil
until in the 1926 election 93 per cent of the
regi.stered votes were rccorded.
The next important item in clection cxpenses is the cost of getting out the vote.
Transportation, the purcbase of which is prohibited by law, forms an important part of tbis
item. Tbe bonourable senator from Saint
Jolin suggested that motor cars might be
commandeered for the voting hours on election
day, and this is a contribution that citizens
who own cars might well be called upon to
make in the intcrcst of good government. To
make clection day a holiday, as the bonourable
senator also sýuggested, if with pay, migbt
sufficiently compensate the voter tbat be could
afford to provide lais own transportation to the
POlIL
I would also make registration compulsory.
In this connection I would suggest that
bonourable members considýer the advisability
of baving our postmasters in villages and
rural districts used as permanent deputy returning offleers; and local reg-istrars; of voters.
It would seemn a simple matter indeed for ail
persons who get their mail at a post office
to register tbemnselves there as voters. It
migbt be neeessary to bave some additional
arrangements for voting in cases wbere the
distance of votvrs from the po-st office would
justify the elect oral officer in establishing extra
polling booths. It will be obscrved that under

MARCH 15, 1933
the Australian Act the limit for compulsory
voting is five miles. A similar limit might
be provided in this country, and that would
take in probably 98 per cent of our electorate.
In connection with eleetion expenses I have
a suggestion which I think might make
for a more acceptable, reliable and complete
registration, namely. that the serutineers
should be appointed in advance, on the recommendation of the two leading politicai parties
in the respective constituencies at the last
election, and paid for by the Governiment.
IJader such a plan an annual registration
would ensure a complete voters' liat ready for
an election at any time. If that suggestion
were followed the expense of the whole electien machinery would be borne by the Govermment, and the resuit should ba absolutely
fair and honest elections.
Ia the cihies, of course, a different arrangement would have te he made. Steps certainly
should be takea to ensure honest elections in
our large centres. Impersonation, or so-called
telegraphing, must bc discontinued, and I
know of no more effective way of discouraging
it than the imposition of heavy penalties for
ýoffences. Gertainly it is more seriou3 for a
man te take away the voting privilege of a
fellow citizen than it is to forge the signature
on a note; yet the offence of foTgery is
punisl!ahle hy a much more rigorous penalty
than is impersonation.
Other election expenses, such as publicity,
including newspaper advertising, radio broadcasting, and se forth, wbile rlinning into considerable sums of money, are of secondary
importance. Now that the Government controis radio and owns a number of stations,
special rates might well be quoted for political
programs and a reasonahie division of time
allotted to the parties. Certainly the press,
which bas some responsibility in this matter
and frequently gives us lectures in its ediLorial
columns on the scandalous expenditures connectcd with elections, should be restrained
fromn charging double rates for political notices
and advertising.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Many other mat ters of
minor importance need righting. I could give
a list of at least a dozen such 'matters, the correction cf wbieh. by legislation would suake for
a much better working cf the Election Act.
One point that must be apparent to everyone
is that our voters' lisits sbould be applicable
for provincial as well as federa:l elections. It
seems absurd in these times to have two
separate voters' lists, with ail the inconvenience and expense their preparation and maintenance involve.

After ail the suggestions that have been
made in this debate, it must be evident to
honourable senators that very substantial reductions can and should be made in election
expenditures. With a fifty per cent reduction
in the time for conducting campaigns, with
compulsory registration and compulsory voting, and with various other means of economizing that bave been suggested, I believe
that the present ridiculous expenses of
candida-tes for Parliament can be reduced by
at least two-thirds, and thus brougbt within
the bounds of reason. Somehow, in some
place, either in this House or the otber. and
at soe time in the near future, before the
next election is on us, definite conclusions in
this matter should be arrived at and given
effeet to by legisiation if future elections are
te be con ducted on a basis in keeping with
the highest standards of Canadian citizenship.
Honourable
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
senators, I think Parliament and the whole
country owe a debt to the honourable member from Saint John (Hon. Mr. Foster) for
introducing in the Senate a discussion on the
question of electoral reform. It is true that
as individuals we are net so keenly interested
in this matter as were some of us a few
years ago. Like the honourable senator from
Saint John and the honourable sanator from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae), I have had
experience in election campaigos over a considerable period. The speeches of both these
honourable membars contained some very
sensible and useful suggestions; but as I
listened to them. I recalled that in my election camipaigns funds were net, in my opinion,
the determining factor in the constituency
where I ha.ppened te be a candidate. I felt,
and still feel, that outstanding public issues
were the cause of the people voting as they
did, and although the political organization
possihly had considerable influence, very little
change in opinion was brought about by campaign funds.
I think the political parties of the country
are largely te, blame for the high cost of
elections, because they have created the
belief that there is ne need for the electors
to contrihute anything towards campaign
expenses in their own constituency; that al
the costs will be defrayed by moneys coming
from some unknown outside source. If I were
to make any suggestion for raforma in connection with electoral expansas, it would ba
that the funds of the central organizations
should be expended on publicity only-for
use cf the radio, for literature and whatever
advertising was necessary-and that the money
for ail othar axpensas in a constituency should
ha contributed by the local electorate.

SENATE
It might be argued by those who live in
large centres that this plan would be impossible for them; that the expenses would be
too great to be borne by the people of city
constituencies. In my own province there is,
I think, very good proof of the fact that it is
possible for local electors to bear all campaign
expenses apart from those for publicity. In
Alberta a political organization known as the
United Farmers of Alberta bas been very
active since 1921, not only in provincial but
also in federal affairs. It is true that the
candidates of that party contest rural seats
almost exclusively-that they very rarely run
in a large city riding. I am satisfied, however,
that the U.F.A. conduct campaigns at very
little cost. Whatever expense the organization
incurs in any constituency is borne by the
local members of the organization. Those
members are so zealous for the welfare of their
cause that out of their own pockets they pay
a small fee towards the expenses of the local
campaign.
If publicity expenses only were paid by
central organizations and all other necessary
money were raised in the particular constituencies where it is spent, the cost of elections
would probably be reduced considerably. Once
the electors realized that they themselves were
sharing in the financial burden of a campaign,
they would not want to be paid for acting as
canvassers or scrutineers, or in any similar
capacity. For such service they now accept
payment largely because they feel that there
is plenty of money coming from outside
sources. The other day a colleague in this
Chamber told me that in his experience he
found it necessary to pay even some of the
speakers who went out to address public meetings, because these speakers knew that there
was a fund out of which payment might be
made. I have never had such an experience
rnyself, and it seems to me that if things have
got to that stage it is time to make some
reforms.
I think this debate will be of some value

net only to Parliament, but to the country at
large. After all, it is the country that needs
te be converted to a different view, rather
than members of the Senate and the House
of Commons. Many people express righteous
indignation at exposures of large expenditures
of campaign funds, and at certain practices
that are resorted to when an election is on.
My experience is that most of such people are
interested in elections only after they are over;
it is almost impossible to get some of them te
come out and vote, and certainly impossible
to induce them te take an active interest
in a campaign. If that element in our population would only interest themselves in a
Hon

.Mr. BUCHANAN.

campaign while it is being conducted, we
might far more rapidly reduce the cost of
elections and do away with practices that are
criticized.
I do net want it to appeai1 that any
remarks I may make with regard te newspaper advertising arise fron self-interest, but
since I am speaking from experience I may
as well say that during the years I have conducted a newspaper I have found election
advertising to be the most unprofitable of
any advertising that I have published. Some
of the election accounts are paid, but seventyfive per cent of them are not. It does not
inake much difference what rates you charge
if you receive no payment. And as a newspaper publisher I should like to say that, ev en
if advertising rates for election notices are
high, it must be kept in mind that the
newspapers of this country give free of all
charge a vast amount of publicity to both
In every political campolitical parties.
paign the Canadian Press, of which I am
a director, at its on
expense sends representatives te travel with the political leaders
andi make rcports of their -peeches, andgenerous space is given to the publication of these
reports in news columns. During a campaign
every newspaper finds it nece(sary te assign
reporters te cover political meetings, and considerable expenzc is incurred by the papers
in this way. Of course, that is quite proper,
for a newspapcr must give the news of what
is being done, not only by any one party
which it may support. btut by all parties,
and these reports should be as fair and unbiased as possible.
I am in accord with what has been said
about the necessity for some form of conpulsory voting, and believe that we shall have
to corne to it in this country. It may be
asked, Why force a person to go to the poll
and vote if he is net interested in the result
of the election? Well, I would compel people
te go to the polls even if they spoiled their
hallots when they got there. Such compulsion would eliminate the necessity of arrangements by candidates to bave voters conveyed
te the booths. There is no need for me to

say more about compulsory voting, for strong

arguments have been advanced in favour of
it by the honourable gentleman who has proposed the inquiry (Hon. Mr. Foster), as well as
by the honourable leader on this side of the
House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), and the bonourable senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
McRae).
I am in sympathy with the honourable
senator from Vancouver when he refers to the
way in whichi members of Parliament are

MARCH 15, 1933
often imposed upon after tbeir electien. In
trying to maintain happy relationships with
bis constituents, a mem.ber bias to continue
making payments out of bis o>wn pocket. I
arn reminded of an incident which may be
familiar to the rigbt bonourable leader of the
Government (Right Hon. Mr. Meigben), sine
it relates to a constituency in Manitoba
wbich be at one time represented. The story
as I was told it is that a former member for
that constituency, baving been defeatedi and
left stranded with virtually no means of support, was walking down a street in the city
of Portage la Prairie and in a store window
saw a silver cup whicb ho, wbile a member
of Parliament, had donated for a football
longue, and bie exclaimed, "Ob my! I wisb I
could moît that thing down, because I sbould
like to have the worth of it to-day." I tbink
many merabers of Parliament have been more
eT loss stranded fxnancially as a resuit of the
domandLs made upon tbom aftor their election. I repeat tbat the responsibility for the
propor conduct of elections is on the people
tbemselves, and if reform is to be brougbt
about it must be tbrough a change in the
public attitude.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:

gentlemen, 1 intend to refer

Honourable

briofly to certain

observations made hy the honourablo senator
from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) and the
honourable senator who bias just taken bis
sent (ion. Mr. Buchanan). They stvessed the
necessity for compulsory registration and compulsory voting. The difficulty that would confront any gentleman wbo might seek to represent a large Montreal caonstituency in the
House of Com-mons would not ho to compol
people to register or to vote; for, as tbose
of us who have been parliamentary candidates know, in Mentreal many more men
and wemen vote than bave ever lived in tbe
constituoncy. Consequontly I sbould liko to
see the Dominion Elections Act se amendod
as to impose severe penalties for impersonation or "telegrapbing."
In the Province of Quebec women bave not
yet been given the provincial franchise, and
therefore tbey bave te register for the federal
franchise. I know from bitter experience that
hundrede, if flot thousands, of women register
wbo bave neyer lîved in the constituency at
all. The fraud is practised in this way. A
certain class of women are given a list of
names. Eacb woman goes to a registration
booth. A very modest, looking young lady,
wo will say, presents berself as Miss Jessie
Brown, and on being asked wbere she lives
sbe answers, ",I arn a maid at the Windsor"
-or at the Ritz or one of the large apart-

349

ment bouses. As a mattor of fact she is not
engaged tbere at ail. In this way, I arn convinced, thousands get on the voiters' lists
f raudulently.
Witb regard to the men, if my honourable
friend from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. MeRae)
Iived in my city, and did not go down fairly
early in tbe morning to vote, hie would very
likely find that some otber gentleman bad
voted for bim.
H-on. Mr. CALDER: A terrible place!
Hon. .Mr. BALLANTYNE: No, I do not
think Montreal is worse tban any othor city
in this respect. But "týelegrapbing" bias always
been practised there wliolesale. By enacting
legisiation to discourago impersonation in
large cities, if flot to stamp it out altogether,
Parliament weuld confer a great favour on
parliamentary candidates and very much
reduce their election expensos.
The honourablo senator from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae) bias told us that the election expenses of a candidate seoking parliamentary honours weuld on an average
amount te $4,000. In a large division in Montreal this suma would not last him a week. It
will ho seen tbat in my city a parliamentary
candidate lias to incur very beavy expenses.
The election expenses in certain of tbe Montreal constituencies are fairly moderate, but
in the densely populated districts, where al
classes and creeds live, the only roasonable
chance a candidate bias of being elected is te,
go te the enormous expense of engaging men
te, makeQ door-t(>door canvass and write down
particulars of every mnan and woman voterthe colour of their hair and eyes, and the num'bers of their residence and business telephones.
This information is bandod te, the scrutineer,
se that whcn a voter says, "I arn John Jones,"
the serutineer may make sure that his personal
appearance tallies witb the description of John
Jones. Like othor bonourable senators, I arn
fortunato te find myself in this Chamber; but
for the henefit of tbose wbo from time te time
may he parliamentary candidates, 1 sbould
certainly like te soe the Dominion Elections
Act se amendcd as te ensure more bonest
elections than we bave at the present time.
1 bave heen told on pretty goo>d au«hority
that if you run in certain divisions in Mont.

the price, they will guarantee yen majorities
at certain poils specified in the oontract.
Under the other oontract tbey will not
guarantee you sucb mai orities, but they will

te sny that in my city the women impersonate

SENATE

The Dominion Eleetions Act should Le
:inended so that persons found guilty of
the se corrupt practices would be punished
with a heavy fine, and even imprisonmienit.
1 arn ves'v glad indeed that the honourable
s.enator from Saint John (Hon. Mr. FoSter)
!ias brought this matter to the attention of
ýhe House, and that. he and other honourable
7srnators have spoken so, ably thereon; but I
sincercly trust that in addition to aeting on
the solind advice tendered with regard to the
rural ridings, the Government wiIl takze steps
to amend the Dominion Elections Act so as
to brin-, about the reforms that 1 have
siagýested witb respect to the conduet of
Clections in our large constituencies.
Right Hon. ARTHIUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, when the bonourable gentleman fromi Sainit John (Hon. Mr. Foster)
placed bis inquiry on the Order Paper, my
first impression was that the subleet came
peculiarly within the purview of the other
House rather than of our own, and that if
might be unwise on our part to, assume the
offiiýious attitude of seeking to pre.seribe ruiles
and regulations applicable, not to ourselves,
but to those who aspire f0 become members
of the other branch of Parliament. I must
admit, however, that the course of the discussion bas somewhat altere(l that i(lea-a
proof that debate is not fruitless, at least in
the Upper House. 1 incline now f0 the opinion
that perhaps a better review of the whole
position coul(i Le obtained by a committee
of this House.
In such a committee there
would be Iess danger of controversy on purely
parfy lines, and principles might Le laid down
which would Le fair te, ail sections aspiring
f0 strength in Parliament; particularly principles not especially advantageous to the party
which bas the largest inferests affiliated with
if financially, or f0 the Government of the
day.
Consequently, my first observation is that
I have no objection at aIl to answering in
the affirmative the question immodiately put
in the inquiry. It bas become quite evident
from the discussion, if it was net already
evident te those who have had very close
association with elections over a peýriod of
years, that the infirmities of democracy are
many and serious, and have not Ly any means
been overcome w'ith the advance of time. The
admission of women fe, thle franchise has multiplied such infirmities and (loubled the burden
of election contests, and I fancy there are
those wbo to-day question w'hether the benefits
have oîîtweighed ail the disadvanfages.
The discussion bas largely centered around
spccific suîgestions which miighit coec fore

MIr. BALLANTYNE.

ý:ich a conmfâtee.
The main sugg-esien is
th:ît there should be cempubeory veting.
Our Dominion Elections Act is exceedingly
draFtie.
Reading the Acf, eue comes very
quickiy te the opinion that there is almost
notbing in tbe m-orld a candidate is a.llowed
te tlo-exept te work bis head off speaking,
and te pay bis own expenses. The number of
prohibitions is simply multitudinous. If that
Act were followed strictly, I do net know how
elcectiens could Le conducted at ail. There
may bc some isolated exceptions, but, in my
judgmenf, generally speaking, you cannet go
any further in the way of strait-jacketiug the
candidate and bis immediate supporters; certainly you cannot go any furtber in the way
of prohibitions applicable te the man who is
carrying the load.
The path of reform, I fancy, is probably
the path suggested both by the honouraýble
member for Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae)
and the honourable member for Lethbridge
(Hon. Mr. Buchanan.), of seeking te impose
some obligations on the public tbemselves and
te limit the field within which money can Le
spent, rafLer than seeking te limit the sources
from which. muney can Le obtained. This is
'tîie especially for the reason that in practice
it has proved utterly impossible te limit tho..e
sources. Se long as there is a place te which
meney can go te the cdx antage of those
whe advance if, meney can Le .secured on
the part of one side or the other. If, *however, we could move in the direction of narrowing the field into which money can go,
we mnight possibly add -omewhat te the
commen sense wif h which elections are conducted. That compulsory voting would Le a
step in this direction, and a very long step,
I have personally no doubt.
The debate bas proceeded new over several
days, and, curiously enougb, not a single member of this House-and most of us have Lad
te de with elections over a long period of
time-Las spoken eut flatly against cempulscory \ oting. If the electur can Le cempelled
te do his duty te the State-and everybody
realizes that te vote is a ditty te the Statethen, at lecst, the field for application of
meoney in bringing him te the poil will Le
very impertantly narrowed. There will net
Le se much that the dollar can do. At least,
the dollar will net have te Le applied towards
that objective.
I de not think the honourable senater from
AlIma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) exagges'ated the
ex il practices that have grewn up in the conduct of electiens in or berger cities. He says
it is net se important te compel people
te voe as te prex cnt these who bave not

MARCH 15, 1933
the right to vote from impersonating those
who have. He is quite correct. 0f course,
the Dominion Elections Act does put a very
heavy penalty upon impersonation, but in
densely populated centres like Montreal it
bas proved to be very difficult; to enforce that
penalty. Before prozeedings can be taken
the impersonator has disappeared into thin
air. He neyer is any.body well known; very
likely hie neyer lived in Montreal; probably
hie was brought up from New York or soine
other distant city; and even if a Montrealer,
hie is obscure and probably posing as a servant.
H1e votes early in the day, and wben the
rîghtful voter seeks to exercise bis franchise
hie finds that it has already been exhausted.
It would appear to me that compulsory
registration would go a censiderable distance
towards preventing that masquerading. If
tbe person ent.itled tic vote is compelled to
register, and a penalty is imposed upon hiý'
or hier failure Vo, do so, then tihe habit will
grow up among those h-aving a right to vote
of getting *their naines on the registration,
lists, and it will become very difficult for
others to register in their places. It will not
bhe impossible, cf course, for impersonstors tO
vote, but the very same principle applies: if
thos, who have a right Vo vote are compelled
teo vote, they are very likely Vo vo>te early,
and so theïre is less chance of the fraudulent
votcr escaping. It is not ur»likely tha-t the
person who bas a right tic vote will bave
c-xercised his franchise, and the peTson who
romes as a criminal Vo steal that right wilI
find hirnself to>o late. The double liabili'ty of
compulsory registxration and compulsory voting
wouild at frae- mark a very considerable
advance against the impersonator or telegrapber, whose dificulties would be m.ultiplied.
Co-nseqiiently I Vthink tihis double liability
onght Vo make stili narrower tihe field in
whirh money can be applied and the field inVo
which at election times the evil-doer can
coule.
Something has been said as to reducing
election expenses in other particulars. The
honourab]e senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McRae) should know more of that than
1, and I take no exception Vo any of the contentions hie bas advanced. I affi in favour of
his argument that advertisements tendered
by election candidates should compulsorily be
admitted at the regular rates cbarged by the
newspaper concerned. I arn afraid I cannot
concur with the bonourable senator from
Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan). I do not
doubt bis statement that election advertising may prove to be the least remunerative

351

to newspapers, but if it should be the least
remunerative, the rea.son would be that it,
bad not been paid for. He must conduet
bis paper on more generous principles than
those with which I came into direct contact
myseif. I did not notice that any honourable members from Montreal cited anyex-perience of similnrly generous treatment.
In the larger places great care is taken
that the price is paid; and quite rightly
so.
But I cannot admit the prineiple
that any person, merely because hie is in a
position to do it, should- have a right to
penalize a candidate for public office. Norbave 1 ever been able to convince myseif
of the equity of another practice on the part.
of newspapers-to charge for advertisements
dýiscriminating rates wbich have to be accepted, no matter wbat they are, because insertion of the advertisements is required by
law. I do not think anyone wbo seeks te
tbrow bis niind into the fundamentals of the
question can aorgue in favour of sucb discriminaition. No une would want Vo take the
position that the advertising rates ohaMred by
the press of our country sh'ould be low.- They
sh-ould be remunerative rates, they should
under aIl circumstances be fair rates, but they
sbould be applîed geneTally; advantage should
lot be taken cf special persons meTely because
that advantage accrues by virtue cf the legislation cf our land.
This comprises aIl I had intended te say.
May I add my word cf commendation te the
compliments already tendered the honourable senator for Saint John (Hon. Mr. Fester)
on bis bringing the question te our attention,
and may I express the hope that at a later
date the House wiIl see fit te act upon the
suggestions bie bas made.
Hon. J. S. McLENNAN:
Honourable
senators, I should like te caîl the attention
cf the House te what seems te me a misunderstanding with regard te the advertising
tariffs cf newspapers. Even te the general
public there is a great difference between the
ceet cf contract advertising, wbich appears
regularly, practically day in and day eut, and
the cost cf casuel advertising, which appeara
only once, twice or maybe tbree times. Wbile
I cannot speak off-band as te the relative proportions cf the rates, I know that the rate
applicable to current business dees net apply
eitber te political advertising, which appears
for only a few weeks, or te legal notices.

EVASION OF INCOME TAX
QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE

Hon. LAWRENCE A. WILSON: Honourable members, I rise to a question of privilege.
My attention has been drawn te an article that
appeared in the Financial Counsel of March
11, four days after my speech on the floor of
this House. That journal is published in
Suite 1505-1507 in the Royal Bank Building,
Saint James Street, Montreal. On page 4
the editor says, amongst other things:
The bond-buyers of Canada are amongst the
most potent influences towards the maintenance
of the credit of the country-much as the
depositors in the savings departments of the
banks are the ones who provide the funds
wherewith credit is extended to keep up
commercial operations. Both are bulwarks of
industry and finance, and it ill becomes a
politician at Ottawa, simply because (with
governments in power during the past 15 years
that neglected to take the most obvious steps
for tightening up the income tax regulations
in conneetion with bearer coupon bonds) a
percentage of bondholders took advantage of
the negligence, to include every holder of a
bearer bond as a class that deserves ridicule
and condemnation. The whole situation should
be so clear that it calls for no indiscriminate
criticism, but having received this, perhaps a
few words of protest may be pardonable at this
time.
Honourable members, no person has questioned what the coupon clippers in general
have done towards the building up of the
Dominion of Canada, but those whom we
have fearlessly questioned are the holders
who have not included the clippings in
their income tax returns. The editor admits
in paragraph 3 that there have been dodgers
of the income tax, and that it has been easy
for them to escape because of the neglect of
our governments to supervise and colleet, as
the present Administration intends to do. If
the editor had, taken the trouble to read
my speech of the 7th instant lie would have
seen my statement that hundreds of men in
affluence had evaded, in part or in whole,
the payment due to the Government from
their revenue. But when lie says it was asserted that every holder ef bearer bonds
evaded the tax, I can only refer him to our
Hansard of November 16, 1932. There he will
find that I asked this question:
How do you expect the Government to get the
money if some of the people are evading the
income tax?
These speeches were favourably commented
upon by all the independent -press of Canadaand there are a few such papers left.
Honourable members, may I refer the
editor of the Financial Counsel also to page
3543 of Hansard of May 18, 1926. On that
date, in my speech on the budget, I said,
amongst other things:
53721-23

I wish to say something regarding concealed
bonds and securities. I want to impress upon
the Minister of Finance that there are concealed bonds, coupons and securities hidden
away in strong boxes throughout this country,
not paying their honest taxes to the Government. I waut to say on the floor of this flouse
that I believe some people are concealing their
securities, bonds and coupons payable to
bearer, and thus cheating this country of its
just dues. These men are despicable; they
should not be called Canadians, and I claim
that the Minister of Finance, who has it in
his power, should start the machinery to break
into these strong boxes, if necessary, and make
the owners of these concealed bonds pay what
is due the Government. I am not exaggerating
when I make that statement. By what means
can he do it? It is rather difficult to know.
It is almost as difficult as to find eut in the
Customs probe who is doing the smugglingdifficult when you get all sorts of people
coning forward who will swear, but not bet.
I caim that the Minister of Finance and the
Government, who are striving by every means
to increase the revenue of this country, should
see to it that the man who is hiding coupon
bonds and trying to defraud the Government
and the common people of this country who
are earning their living by the sweat of their
brow, should be brought before the criminal
courts of this country. How are you going to
reach them, Mr. Minister? Reach them, if
necessary, by printing a proclamation in the
newspapers of this country stating that in the
ease of any man who conceals bonds and does
not report his income therefrom in the regular
way, when he dies and a statement of his
affairs has to be made to the Government of
the province in which lie lives, for succession
duties, his whole estate will be confiscated.
That man will then start thinking of hie
family and pay his honest debts. That is my
advice, Mr. Minister, on that question, and I
think in that way the treasury of this country
would be the richer by several million dollars.
If able and intelligent writers, such as I
take the editor of the Financial Counsel to
be, do not assist independent and fearless
men and the Government, and if they decline
to lend a helping hand to pull unfortunates
out of the ditch, they must bear the terrible
responsibility for the spread of poverty and
crime, and for Communisa and Socialism invading our peaceful Canadian homes.
May I take this opportunity to suggest that
poor men, with famillies of ten or more
children, should be exempt from any income
tax payments?
It has been said that "the pen is mightier
than the sword." But I know of something
a million times more powerful than ink and
paper, and that is the starving and enraged
people.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. H. MACDONELL moved the
second reading of Bill 29, an Act to amend
and consolidate the several Acts relating to
the Board of Trade of the city of Toronto.

REVISED EDITION

SENATE

354

He said: Honourable senators, this is a
Bill to amend and consolidate the several Acts
relating to the Board of Trade of the city of
Toronto. This Board was constituted in 1845
and has been functioning ever since. In the
meantime there have been passed a number
of statutes dealing with the original Act of
incorporation and with powers thereby conferred, a list of which statutes appears in
schedule E at page 14 of the Bill. The promoters of this measure desire to have the
several Acts referred to amended and consclidated for the purpose of avoiding confusion.
The Bill, which is a lengthy one, was passed
by the House of Commons with only one small
amendment, and this was agreed to by the
promoters. After second reading here, I intend to move for reference to the Committee
on Miscellaneous Private Bills. At that committee the promoters will be represented by
counsel, who will be prepared to give any
information desired.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. F. L. BEIQUE presented the report
of the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills on Bill I, an Act with respect
to Charity Sweepstakes, with some amendments.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall the
report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Now.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: We do not know the
nature of the amendments.
Right lon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should like
to have the amendments taken into consideration later, so that we may have an opportunity of reading them. Would next Tuesday
satisfy the sponsor of the Bill (Hon. Mr.
McRae)?
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Well, that is a fairly
long time.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: To-morrow?
Hon. Mr. McRAE: AIl right.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators,
I am not a member of the Committee on
Miscellancous Private Bills, but I was present
at the meeting this morning and heard the
amendments. It seems to me that every
member of the House is entitled to an opportunity to 'read these amendments carefully
and sec what has been donc in the making
of them, for in my opinion the principle of
the Bill has been entirely changed in committec.
It would appear that the word
"charity" was only camouflage, and that it
is now proposed to pass a Bill that is in a
different form from that which we adopted.
i certainly hope we shall have printed copies
of these amendments before we are asked
to consider them.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is moved by
Hon. Senator Béique that these amendments
be taken into consideration on Tuesday next.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
onourable
senators. at first I suggested Tuesday next,
but when I turned to the honourable member
who has charge of the Bill (Hon. Mr.
McRae) he preferred to-morrow. For myself
to-morrow is all right; but this is a private
Bill and I have no more to say about it than
has any other honourable member. I think,
however, that the day preferred by the

MARCH 29, 1933
sponsor of the Bill is the day that should be
li the motion put to, the House.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM. Would it be
in accordance with the rules of the House
to take these amendments into consideration
to-morrow?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes.
Right Han. Mr. GRAHAM: I arn inchined
ta think that the honourable sponsor (Hon.
Mr. McRae) had better flot press for consideration to be given ta-morrow. It is abso]utely unthinkable that we could know by
that time what these amendments mean.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: They will be
printed then, and the right honourable gentleman can read.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Perhaps my
honourable friend will vote without reading
them. As a matter of fact, many of us will
have no time ta look at them this afternoon,
for we have ta attend a committee meeting,
and we shall be in thie same position tamorrow marning. Sa how can we be expected
ta know ail about them to-morrow afternoon?
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I arn quite agreeable
ta having the report considered on Tuesday
next. But may I observe that the honourable
senatar £rom ParkdaJe (Hon. Mir. Murdock) la,
I think, under a misapprehiension as ta what
was done in committee this morning. I arn
not a member of the committee either, but I
understand the only change in the Bill makes
it read that the sweepstakes, instead of being
far the benefit of the sick, the destitute and
the inaimed, shahl be foar the beneýfit of
hospitals. This follows the wording of the
Bill which was bef are the House last session.

THE CATTLE INDUSTRY
MOTION FOR REFEIRENCE TO COMMITTEE

Hon. D. E. RILEY moved:
That the Standing Committee on Agriculture
and Forestry be authorazed ta consmder and
inquire into the conditions of expart trade in
cattie and the oattle industry generally.
He said: Honourable snembers, in speaking
ta this motion I wish ta draw the attention
53721-231j

355

of the House ta the importance ta Canada, in
a national way, of the live stock industry, and
particularly the production of cattle,
The keeping of flocks and herds is the irsf,
industry of which we have any record, and ail
down through the ages it has been one of the
principal occupations of mankind. To-day in;
Canada, a eountry in which agriculture la conceded ta be aur greatest and most enduring
natural resource, live stock is #,lhe most
important part of aur agricultural life. The
cattie mnen were the pioneers of Western
Canada, as they have been the pioneers of ail
agricultural cauntries. After the disappearance of the buffalo from the plains of Western
Canada, great herds af cattle, mostly from the
Western States, toak their place, and the raising of commercial cattie was the *most important business of the country. This continued until, in the nineties, settiers began
ta pour into the Canadian West, and the cattie
men, with their herds, were driven ta the
rougher parts of the country, chiefly the foothis and lands adjacent to the Rocky Mountains. Then it was proved that thase lands
that were thought ta be good only for grazing
purpases would produce wheat of the finest
quality. I arn free ta say that it wauld have
been better for ail cancerned if some of those
lands had remained grazing lands. Fram that
time, however, wheat has taken a leading place
in the minds of the people of Canada fram an
agricultural standpoint.
I do flot wish to minimize the value of
wheat nor what it lias done for Canada. It
ham made this cauntry one af the great expartîng countries of the world. It lias been
the means af settling the Western plains and
lias brought untold wealth ta Canada.
The prominence that ha.s been given ta
wheat bas been brought about ta a large extent by the efforts of the farmers, and their
representatives in the press and in Parliament,
ta pravide for themselves a transportation and
marketing systern that would give them the
world's market -price less the carry-ing charges.
To-day, the crawning resuit of thase persistent
efforts is found in the Canada Grain Act, a
monument ta those men who were instrumental in bring it about.
I have already stated that live stock is the
most important branch of agriculture, notwithstanding the importance of wheat production. I know that many wiHl not agree
wi*th suoh a statement, and I wish ta quote
some figures wbioh will prove my contention
ta be correct. They have been obtained frorn
Gavernment statisties for 1931, the latest year
for which figures are available.

SENATE

356

In 1931 Canada produced 304,000,000 bushels
of wheat. At 38 cents per bushel-the average price to the farmer that year-the value
amounted to $115,520,000.
In the same year Canada marketed through
stock-yards 600,000 head of cattle. There
were country-killed 900,000 head. The 900,000
is an estimate only, as no record is kept
of the cattle killed in the small towns
and villages and on the farm. These figures
are supplied by the Department of Agriculture. Taking the cattle marketed through
the stock-yards and those killed in the country, we have a total of 1,500,000 head. Putting
the average price at $40 a head, the value is

figure to the $60,000,000, we have a total for
cattle and cattle products of $298,000,000or more than twice the value of our wheat
production.
The figures I have quoted are, I believe,
a conservative estimate, and over a number
of years are a fair comparison.
Again, only a comparatively small area in
Canada is suited for the production of wheat
on a commercial basis. while on every farrm in
Canada from coast to coast cattle can be, and
are, successfully raised. In what bas been
called the best agricultural province in Canada the people raise only enough wheat for
their own use, but their barns are full of
cattle. They raise a surplus there, as in other
parts of Canada. The iow price of cattle
affects adversely more people in Canada than
does the price of wheat. The price level of
our agricultural products, which are in excess
of our consumption, is set by the price level
of our export market. The small number of
cattle exported for some years past must
not be taken as a standard of our productive
capacity, for under the stimulation of good
prices Canada in 1919 exported 550,000 cattle,
most of which went to the United States; and
to-day we could produce an equally great
surplus if prices justified us in doing so.
In oui efforts to foster and build up a
profitable trade with Great Britain-the only
market which we bave to-day-the winter
feeding and finishing of high-class beef cattle
lias been gradually growing in the province
from which I come. These cattle are produced by the rancher and fed by the farmer
under a feeding arrangement. In this way
the farmer ca dispose of his coarse grains
and find employment for himself and others,
and, could a fair price be obtained for the
finished product, the result would be a profitable transaction for both rancher and farmer.
Ifon. Mr. RILEY.

Another branch of the cattle industry has
been fostered in the West through the red
label branding of beef. This business started
in Western Canada and has grown to tremendous proportions. In the month of February this year there were sold as branded beef
5.000 head of bigh-class animals, or almost
double the number sold last year. Only the
choicest beef cattle that can bc raised are
eligible for this brand, and they must bc
finished properly. This means that for three,
four, five or sometimes six months they must
be fed on grain. Many people think that we
eau produce red label and blue label beef
by turning the animals out on the luxuriant
grasses of the Western plains and finishing
them there. That is a mistake. The cattle
eligible for those brands, and fit to be shipped
to Great Britain, must be finished on grain.
Experience has shown that it is not profitable
to-day to ship cattle finished on grass, and as
a result the system bas changed entirely.
The feeding of red label beef gives employment to many farmers. All the feed the
ranchers can rustle is required to feed their
producing stock; so the other animals are
turned over to farmers who are qualified and
equipped to feed them. No monecy changes
hands. An agreement is made whereby the
cattle are weighed in at a certain time, and
four or six months later they are weighed out,
and the feeder is paid for the difference in
weight on the basis of the selling price. This
busine.s bas assumed considerable proportions. At present prices, however, I am afraid
the industry faces extinction.
At present there are in the Province of
Alberta 13,000 high-elass beef cattle, ninety
per cent of which, I think I am safe in saying,
are graded. I may say in this connection that
the Department of Agriculture issues a
monthly statement showing the number of
graded cattle produced in each province of
the Dominion. I think I can safely say that
the Province of Alberta produces more branded
beef cattle than any other province; but
under the system of tabulation adopted by
the Government the province in which the
beef is branded gets the credit for producing
and finishing the cattle. Beef cannot be
branded until the hide is taken off, and as
cattle shipped from Alberta to Winnipeg are
butchered and branded by the inspectors in
Winnipeg, Manitoba gets the credit. I am
very jealous of the reputation of my province.
I think it should get the eredit for what it
bas done. As I said before, there are at
present in the Province of Alberta 13,000 highclass beef cattle, of which some are now ready
fer market, as al1 will be within a short time.

MARCH 29, 1933
But at the present price of 3½ cents the producers are facing ruin.
There is another phase of the question to
which I should like to draw your attention.
One of the few benefits which the low price
of wheat has brought to the Western farmer
is that lie has been forced to go more and
more into diversified farming. There are today fewer cowless, sowless and henless farms
on the Western plains than there were when
wheat was selling at $1.50 a bushel. While at
present prices cattle hold out no more promise
than does wheat, the fact remains that we
can have no permanent and successful agriculture unless we have diversified farming, a
system in which live stock plays the most
important part.
What can be done to help the situation that
exists to-day? One has only to walk down the
streets of Ottawa, Montreal or Toronto, or
any other city or town in Canada, and make
a comparison between the prices charged the
consumer for meat, as displayed in the shop
windows, and the prices paid to the men who
produce and finish it, to realize that some
reorganization and control of our distribution
system are urgently needed. Until something
of this kind is done agriculture cannot be reestablished.
At the present time the only market for our
surplus cattle is 'Great Britain, and the price
that comes back to the producer sets the price
on our home market. While we have no control over the prices paid in the Britiish markets,
we could improve the price at home by lowering the cost of shipping our small surplus to
Great Britain. A reduction of rail, stock-yard,
and ocean rates on our cattle would tend to
increase and stabilize the price to the producer on the home market. Considering that
last year we exported only 17,000 head of
cattle to Great Britain, and that our home
market absorbs one and a half million head,
everyone will appreciate that our home market
is most important and that we must endeavour
to :protect it; but as the price secured for the
small surplus exported fixes the price on our
home market, the necessity of endeavouring
to obtain a better price for that small surplus
must be patent to everyone.
The cattle men have solved the problem of
production. They are producing and finishing
a high class of beef animal, which finds high
favour in the Old Country, both as store and
beef. Our need is markets. What the Government has done within the last few days,
in providing a stabilization fund to take care
of the difference in exchange, comes as a great
relief to live stock men at a time when the
cattle industry is in as bad shape as I have
ever known it to be. It means that the value

357

of every cow in Canada is increased, and it
adds materially to the seourity of the farmers.
This measure, however, is only a palliative,
and some constructive national marketing plan
must be put into effect before agriculture can
be re-established.
In my humble opinion a national live stock
marketing board, with wide statutory powers,
is absolutely necessary. At the present time
our cattle are sold in the most haphazard way.
Certain classes of export cattle are shipped to
places where the trade demands other classes.
That is to say, certain classes are in demand
at certain seasons, or in certain markets, and
there is no supervision of the distribution or
selection. Some supervision of this phase of
marketing is needed in order that the producer may get the benefit of the better price
prevailing at a particular time. This is only
one of the rmany functions which a live stock
marketing board would perform.
It is my humble opinion that agriculture
can be re-established and made prosperous by
means of a national live stock policy, and that
the prosperity of agriculture will be reflected
in every other line of industry in Canada.
I am hopeful that by reference of this matter
to the Standing Committee on Agriculture of
this Chamber, there may be worked out some
practical, sane plan which the Government of
the day will see fit to put into operation.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable members, it must be apparent to every member
of the Senate who has followed the remarks
of the honourable senator from High River
(Hon. Mr. Riley) that he has been speaking
of a subject in which lie takes a deep personal
interest and of which lie has a very wide
personal knowledge. With most of lis remarks I am fully in accord. He bas very
properly pointed out to you the important
relation which the cattle industry of this
country bears to other agrieultural pursuits;
and the comparative figures that he has given
of the value of our cattle products and the
value of the wheat grown in Canada will,
I think, be news to many of you.
I take it that bis remarks apply very largely
to beef cattle. I come from a section of the
country where, although there is some dairying, the majority of people specialize in the
production of beef cattle. We have for some
time been complaining that our cattle were
not permitted to enter the British market
on the sane terms as Irish cattle, and I believe I voiced that complaint here last session.
To-day, however, we are fortunately in a
different position. At the Imperial Conference
an agreement was entered into whereby our

SENATE
cattle are permitted to enter the British
market on the same terms as cattle from
Ireland; furthermore, as a result of a duty
imposed by Great Britain on Irish cattle,
which corresponds to our cost of shipping
overseas, we are to-day on terms of equality
with the Irish people so far as sending cattle
.o Great Britain is concerned. That is a
factor which, I think, will tend very considerably to improve the cattle situation in
this country.
As has been mentioned by the honourable
senator (Hon. Mr. Riley), the stabilization
fund provided for in the budget brought
down in the other House last week greatly
improved the trade situation. The effect is
that if you send cattle to Britain you will get
$4.60 for the British pound, which at the
present rate of exchange would be worth
around $4.12; so actually one-eighth is added
to the value of our export cattle. As the
honourable senator has pointed out, when the
value of export cattle is increased the value
of cattle on our home markets is also increased, because the surplus is taken away.
Therefore the value of the cattle on the
home markets is very largely fixed by the
value of cattle in the export market.
The honourable gentleman has suggested
that we should have better shipping facilities.
One of our principal difficulties at the present
time is that of securing space. If you read
carefully the Toronto market report for this
week you will see that no export cattle were
bought, the reason being that no space was
available. I am not finding fault with the
gentlemen who had cattle bought and who
for business reasons had secured space in
advance. But if you wanted to ship cattle
to-day you would be unable to get space.
Shipping at the present time is very cheap,
and one of the remedies suggested is 'that the
Department of Agriculture be authorized by
the Government to buy two or more ships
and fit them up for the cattle trade. My
honourable friend who is a shipping man
(Hon. Mir. Casgrain) shakes his head. He
does not like any suggestion along that line.
I am told, however, that a few years ago the
live stock commission firm of H. P. Kennedy
& Sons, of Toronto, did that very thing with
satisfactory results.
The honourable senator (Hon. Mr. Riley)
has pointed out that there is seme dissatiafaction throughout the country with respect
to the facilities for the marketing of cattle.
I am aware that among those who produce
cattle there is a great deal of discontent.
Perhaps the Senate will bear with me while
I give in some detail a description of the
method of marketing cattle in this country.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY.

We have a number of live stock marketsstock-yards, as they are called. I shall speak
of the Toronto stock-yard, for it is the one
with which I am familiar. The stock-yard
in Toronto is owned by an incorporated company. In Montreal and Winnipeg the stockyards are owned and operated, I think, by
the railways. There has been a great deal
of complaint about the charges for yardage,
feed and such things. While the stock-yards
are owned by the companies, they are operated by what are called live stock exchanges.
These live stock exchanges are made up very
largely of live stock commission men who
deal in the different yards. Their operations
are strictly regulated by an Act of Parliament
passed about ten years ago. The charges and
fees for selling, for yardage and for feed must
all be approved by the Department of Agriculture, or by an inspector of that departWe hear many farmers say, "Why
ment.
should we pay $27 a ton for hay for our
cattle at the Toronto market when loose hay
is selling at home for $3 or $4 a ton?" They
also say, "We pay to-day for the marketing
of cattle on the Toronto market the same
price that we paid during war-time, when
cattle prices were high." This is true, and
perhaps there is some justification for their
complaint; but I am disposed to think that in
some cases the complaints are not well
founded.
The cattle are billed through to the live
stock commission men. A drover, or any man
who makes a business of dealing in cattle, is
compelled by the Live Stock Act to place his
cattle under the control of the commission
men, and the cattle are sold under a fixed
rate, which at the present time is $17 per carload, and if delivery is made by truck the
rate is $1 per head. There is an exception
made for farmers who sell their own cattle,
they being permitted to make sales on the
market, but they have to pay for yardage and
feed. Each commission firm is bonded to the
extent of $10,000; so the farmer or dealer
who consigns cattle to these firms is absolutely protected. The commission men are
compelled by the same Act to deposit the
proceeds from the sale of cattle, or money
that is sent to them for the purchase of cattle,
in a trust fund in a chartered bank, and that
money can be withdrawn only under certain
conditions, such as for the payment for cattle
a,nd the settling of expenses necessarily incurred in the sales.
I have had some experience on the Toronto
market, and I may say that the men engaged
in the cattle business are very alert and keen
business men, and they have a high sense

MARCH 29, l9N3
of honour. At times a deal involving thousands of dollars will be -made in a f ew minutes,
without any written agreement of sale; a -man
will simply nod, or hold up his hand, and that
will settle the bargain. In thirty years 1 have
neyer heard of a man defaulting or going
back on a bargain that was so made. 0f
course, I amrn ot saying that there is no room
for improvement. It is just possible that
charges could be reduced.
The conditions of marketing cattie have
changed a good deal in the past ten or flfteen
years. Fifteen years ago practically ail cattie
going to the Toronto market were conisigned
by car, and at that time iAwas not an unusual
thing to flnd six or seven thousanld head there
on Monday morning. To-day two thousand
cattie there are looked upon as a large market.'
The explanation is that certain dealers throughout the country, who have the confidence of
the packers, send their products direct from
the feeder to the .paoking-houses, to avoid expenses connected with marketing and feeding.
An accurate count is kept of the kill-out, and
the price is based on the price paid on the
market for cattie of a similar quality.
The cattie producers of Ontario complain
that there is practically no competition on the
market to-day. Whereas ten or fifteen years
ago there were the Davies Company, the
Harris Abattoir, Gunns Limited, and the
Canadian Packing Company, four sets of buyers
who were bidding for cattie, there i.s to-day,
as a resuit of amalgamation, only one set
of buyers representing the four companies I
have just named. True, there is the Swift
Company, which is connected with the Amenicani firm of the same name, but, rightly or
wrongly, the cattie men believe there is an
underistanding between the 'Swif t Company
and the other huyer. When there is a large
run of cattie it is not an unusual thing to
have no buyers on the market for a couple of
hours. But I may say that an independent
company bas been operating for some time and
is paying a very fair price for cattle of the
kind that it desires. There are also some
local butchers, and some buyers from. outside,
but it is felt that on the whole there is not
sufficient competition.
I notice that the honourable senator from
High River (Hon. Mr. Riley) referred to the
large number of cattie produced in Western
Canada. I may say that the Province of
Ontario still produces some, cattle, the volume
passing th.rough the Toronto market being
greater than that which passes th-rough any
other market in Canada.
The honourable senator's motion is "that
the Standing Committee on Agriculture and
Forestry be authorized to consider and inquire

into the condition of export trade in cattle
and the cattle industry generally." Speaking as the chaîrman of that committee, I am
inclined to think that a useful purpose might
be served by the committee in taking up
this work. We may be able to, suggest better
facilities for exporting, and some means of
lowering the cost of marketing; and the
information obtained at the hearings xnight
result -in eiiminating: the misunderstandings
which I believe exist between the producers
and the paekers. I am not one of those who
think that the packers make exorbitant profits
always. W'hen there was a market for lumber
I did a littie lumhering, and I had occasion
to purchase ment and meat produets fTom
packers. Knowing as I did at the time something about the value of live stock, I came
to the conclusion that the packers worked on
a very small margin of profit, and that the
money they did make came froma the volume
of th-eir turnover.
As I have said before, there is a great deal
of unirest and general dissatisfaction with
regard to, the whole cattle industry. But
possibly it is too, late for the comrnittee to,
deal fully with this question at the present
session. In order that the whole subjeet
should be gone into properly, the committee
would need wide powers. It would be necessary to hear cattie dealers and producers,
representatives of the live stock exehanges,
and officiaIs of the Department here, as well
as those engaged in the transportation of
live stock. Considerable time would be
needed, and there would- be some expense.
However, if the motion is pnssed, I think I
can say on behaîf of ail members of the
committee that we shahl be pieased to do the
very best that can possibly be done in
the matter during the short time at our
disposal.
I may have something more to say on this
at a inter time, and, if there is no objetion,
I move the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGR.AIN: Honourable
senators, I intend to make only a few remarks,
and not a speech. I like the honourable
senator from South Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donnelly)
so welI that I would not wish him to be a
shareholder in any stock-yards. I was for
ten years a director of the Montreal stockyards, and I lost my money-not ail of it,
but a good share. The honourable gentleman
referred to hay selling at so much a tonHon. Mr. DONNELLY: I was only repeating complaints that we hear throughout the
country.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There is a saying,
"Don't believe ail you hear, nor more than

SENATE

360

hait of what you sec." Anyway, it is flot
merely the cost of the feed that the stockyards have to take into conrideration, but
also the wages of the men who look after the
cattle and the cost of shelter. Live stock that
is exported is kept in the yards for a day or
two before being put on the boats, and there
are vcry strict gox'erniment regulations re,garding the condition in whichi the yards have
to be kept. The Canadian Pacifie Railway
bas been running stock-yards in Montreai for
thirty or forty years, and 1 think it bas
always lost money on them. Whien I xvas
in the business the Grand Trunk yards were
heing used, and we paîd nothing foir the lease
of part of our ind so long as wc kept our
stock-yards in operation. Yet ex un under that
condition wc couid not make the business pay.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question is
on the ad.Ioitrinent of the debate.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is right, but
I shail not be herc whien the dehate is resumed. The honourabie senator from South
Bruce (Hon. Mir. Donneiiy) xviii he able to
reply to my remarks when lie is speaking on
the suhject agarn.
My real object in getting up now is to
compliment the honourable senator from High
River (Hon. Mr. Riley). Whien a mnan knows
a subjeet very well it is easy for him to speak
about it, and this was prox'ed by the speech
of the senator from Highl River. Perliaps no
other member of this House is so familiar with
the cattie industry as hc is, with the possible
exception of the honourable scoator from
Calgary (Hon. Mr. Burns).
It was cnlightening to hear about the extent of the cattie industry, and t0 learn that
wheat is not the bigges't thing in this country,
after ail. I have aiwavs contended that the
raiiways did flot mate vei'y muchi money out
of carrying wheat, ani that this product xvas
not ail-important, as many people seemed to
believe. And now xve are toid that the value
of thc cattie produce.d in this country exceeds
the value of our wheat cr011.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I have iistened te

MARCH 29, 1933
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: No doubt there is
some-thing wrong with the methods of conducting elections, not only in Canada, but aiso
in most other countries, tbat have democratie
institutions. I rememiber very well a conversation that I had witb a friend of mine
wbo was, persuaded to be a candidate in an
election eampaign a few years ago. He went
thriougb witb the thing in a very creditable
manner and reeeived a fine voite-, but hie was
perhaqs more fortunate than some of the rest
of us, in that bie was not eieeted. Somne time
after the election I was speaking to him and
asked him bow bie feit. Ifle said: "This was
my first experience as a candidate a2nd it will
be my lsst. 1 did not know wbat eiections
meant until 1 got into on~e. If the election
Iaws we-re carried out, I should !be in the
penitentiary for the rest of my life." And I
may say bie neyer ran in another election. The
rîgbt bonourable leader of the Hlouse (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) bas referred to tbe stringency of our election laws, but we ail know
that many of the statutory provisions are
altogetber inoperatîve to-day.
In tbe course of tbe debate a number of
valuable suggestions bave been made for
improvîng the metbods of conducting elections and reducing the costs to the country
and tbe candidates, but aIl these suggestions
bave been based on the assumption that we
shahl continue to use polling bootbs. 0f
course, polling bootbs have been in existence
as long as tbere have been elections, and
gradus.lly there bas been developed tbe
systema of xegistration and publication of
voters' lists. We bave in Canada to-day
a very flnely conceived election law, based
upon tbe idea of the registration of electors
and voting at pol-hing booths. We know
that it is impossible to make our system perfect, that tbe voters' lists will contain names
of some people wbo are dead, that tbere will
be unavoidable duplications, and that inevitably the names of a number of persons
entitled to vote will be omitted from the
lists.
Under our law polling bootbs are divîded
into two classes, rural and urban. In tbe
rural constituencies a great advance bas been
made during recent years in tbe matter of
As ail honourabie members
registration.
know, it is not necessary for a rural voter to
bave bis namne upon the iist at ail: if bis
namne is omitted 'bie can vote upon being
certifled to by, I tbink, two electors.
I am going to make a suggestion to-day
whicb is somewbat revolutionary. It did not
originate witb me. Several years ago one of
the most experienced parliamentarians in
Canada, a man wbo bad spent flfty years in

361

political life, suggested to me sometbing
which at the time I did flot consider to be
very practical, but the more I thought of
it afterwards the more Teasonable and practical it appeared to be. I make this revolutionary proposition with a good deal of
trepîdation. That reminds me of a friend of
mine wbo, wben making bis first speech in
the Legisiature, said lie rose with feelings of
turpitude. This is my suggestion: scrap the
polling booths, and do away with registration.
0f course, if you scrap the polling booths you
do flot need registration. It bas been stated
during the course of this debate that the total
cost for the last election was $2,127,000 odd,
of which 31,113,000 odd represented the cost
of regiistration.
I have obtained from the Chief Electoral
Officer the figures which I am about to give
the House. In the urban districts there were
10,482 polis, and in the rural districts, 17,732;
or a total of 28,214. The deputy returning
officers are paid $7 and the polling clerks $4
for their services. Under present conditions
I tbink we migbt well reduce the deputy
returning officers' fees to $5, and make a
corresponding reduction in tbe polling clerks'
remuneration. Under tbe present scale tbe
total cost for deputy returning officers and
polling clerks is $310,354. The rent of polling
bootbs is $10 in the eity and $5 in tbe country, the total cost being $193,480.
Now, 1 tbink bonourable members are al
familiar with tbe fact that tbese polling bootbs
are flot satisfactory. Tbey are set up in
barber sbops, in littie rooms in private homes,
and in ail sorts of makeshift places. Very
often tbe voter bas a great deal of difficulty
in finding bis polling station. On tbe ground
of expense it would be entirely out of tbe
question to provide permanent polling booths
tbrougbout tbe Dominion. As we ahl know,
tbe main trouble in elections arises around the
polling bootbs, wbere the bubbub and excitemen afford favourable opportunities for telegrapbing or impersonation. Tbe major portion of the candidate's election expenses is in
connection witb polling bootbs and tbe biring
of automobiles and of inside and outside
cbeckers and agents. By doing away witb
polling boot'hs we should eliminate ail the
incidental expense. On registration alone we
could save one million dollars at least.
Honourable members will naturally ask bow
elections would be conducted in the absence
of polling bootb.s and registration. As an alternative I would suggest tbat we appoint tbree
times as many deputy returning officers and
polling clerks to take care of the 5,100,000
voters. There is an average of 180 voters for

SENATE
a polling booth. If my suggestion were
adopted there would be one deputy returning
officci' and eone polling clerk te every 60 voters.
I would have each deputy returning officer and
polling clerk accompanied 'by a representative
of each candidate, if you like-take the vote
bc,îî'e hy bnîîse. In other words, give the
home the status of the polling booth, and
aillow none to be prescrnt but these officiais and
the persons entitled to vote there. By this
micthod voters could be registered as the voting
proceeded.
1 have flot thc slightest doubt that many
lionourable membeýrs will think it impossible
to take the vote in this way, but 1 believe
ilhat on careful reflection they wvill realize it is
î ra eticable.
An Hon. SE-NATOR:
out anywhere?

Has it been tried

Hon. Mr. IIOBINSOLN: I do flot know that
r lias been. ln the past wvehave copied other
ceuntries in framing our electoral law. For
instance, we have copied Australia in reference to the ballot, and it has been suggested
during the course of this debate that ive go
'till further and adopt co.mpulsory \ oting as
110w operativ e in that country. It has worked
out fairly successfully in Australia, and if we
aîre to retain our present election systcm I
think it would be worth while to adopt comnpulsory x oting. But compulsory voting adds
hîrgely to the co'st of conducting elections,
and eo the work of the deputy returning
officers.
I ami confident that if my suggestion were
workced out intelligently it would save the
co untry a million dollars at least; it would also
.ect a substantial reduction in the candiiLites< expenses; and we should have one of
the quictest and most Sunday-school-like electiens imaginable. There would be these furtber
.dvantages: a full vote; no opportunities for
impersonation; an absolutely up-to-the-minute
regidýration.
I submit there i. a good deal of menit in
tbis suggestrion, and that it is workablc. Let
us take the initiativ e in election rcformn and
flot be content 'to copy some other country.
In this connection may 1 quote these few
phr'ases from a rccently publisbed book, by
Presiclent IRoosevelt, for in mv opinion tbcy
are very mucbi te the point:
The. country needs, and, unless I mistake
its; temrper, the country demiands, hold, persistent
experimnientation. It is comamon sense te take
a iiiethod and try it; if it fails, admit it
frankly andI try aniother. But, above ail, try
soiiietliin.
That is mv suggestion, boneural)le members.
antd I think it weh wortlî con'sidering.
lion. Mr. ROBINSON1.

Hon. G. LYNCH-STAUNTON. Thc bionourable senator w'ho lias just resumed bis
seat bias taken the wind out of my sails. I
was geing to suggest tbe abolition of the
veters' h-st. I arn told they bave no voters'
list in the United States. I do not know
wvhether tbey have any zsuch list in France,
but the otber day I read that whether at
home or abroad every Frenchman is allowed
te vote. As illustrating this. it Ivas stated that
rccently the Frenchi Governmncnt bad sent
a warship down te Baîcelona. where a number
of Frcnchimen are employed, and had taken
tbem outsidc the three-mile limit to enable
themn to vote in a gencral clection that was
tîmen proceccling in France.
It must bo b orne in mind that our election
üxpcnýýcs are net confined te the federal carnpaigns. Foir instance, in Ontario we bave a
provincial election once in every three or four
years, and municipal elections ev ery year. It
costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to cleet
an army of mayors, controllers anti aldermen.
Jndeed, the setting in motion of our geo ernmental machine is enormously cxpcnsivc, and
I think this question of the cost of clections
is very epportunely lauincbied.
With our
plethora of gev-erniment.s--fcdcral, provincial,
muinicipatl-we hav e te conduet more elections
than any orbcî' country I know of cxcept perbaps the U~nited States.
Now, why should wc comipel people te vote?
This is a free country. I (Io net se wlhy 1
should be marched up to the polling booth
to voe for somcbody if I do net choose te
do se. Thie opinion of lialf the electors is

twenty-one years of age: 1 suppose their
collective wisdom. is a wonderful guidance ta
the -Government of this countryl What do
they know, and what do they care, about
national affaira? Why should you drive them
to the poîi ta vote? 1 can neyer understand
the reasoning of those who advocate compulsory voting, unless it be that with compulsory voting in effect they would not have
ta pay the cost of transporting voters to the
pal.
It is considered quite proper ta elect a
man ta Parliament for a five-year term,
but bighly improper ta elect a mayor or
alderman for a similar terma. Why should
we have municipal elections every year?
Surely if you can tjrust a mayor or an alderman for one year you can trust him for five.
By arnending aur municipal law and providing
for elections onîy once every five years we
should save millions of dollars to aur municipalities.
To do away with the votera' list would do
no harm in the rural districts, for there everybody knows everybady else, and there would
be very little opportunity for impersonation
or telegraphing. In the cities it might nat be
practicable ta take this course; but surely it
is not beyond the capacity of men of affairs
ta devise some practical way out of this
eleoition mess.
I cannot conceive why I shauld not ha
allowed 1,o voote anywhere in the Dominion
for a candidate for the House of Commons.
An Hon. SENATOR: Often?
No; I
Hon.* Mr. LYNCH-.STAUNTON:
shouhd be tao tired ta vote more than once.
But if in Montreal why should I flot be
allowed ta vote for one of the local candidates? If elected he is supposed to be a
representative of the Donânion. Why compel
an elector ta vote in his own electoral
division? And why should not a commercial
traveller be allowed ta vote in lie town
where he happens to, be on election day? 1
may be tohd there would be impersonation.
But there is impersonation now. And supposing there were impersonation, there would
probably be as much impersonatian by the
supportera of one party as by those of the
other party, and so the ultimate result would
not ha materially affected one way or the
other. In any event we should have a greûter
number of votes polled at less expense.
I do not think there is anything s0 antediluvian as aur present plan of herding the
electorate ta the polis. My honourable friend
from Moncton (Hon. Mr. Robinson) said
there were 5,000,000 votera in this country. I
cannot understand how that can ha sa. Are
haef aur people over twenty-one?.

Right Han. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes; the
reason being that people live longer after
they attain twenty-one than they do before.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I do not
agree with that at ail. If I arn eighteen and
live to be sixty, I shall have lived longer than
a person who is twenty-one and lives to be
sixty.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
So the
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
people under twenty-one live longer than the
people over twenty-one.
Riglit Hon. MTe. MEIGIIEN: That is not
the point.
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable senators, this subjeot is becoming more interesting
the longer it is discussed. I was very mucli
struck by the suggestion of the honourible
senator from Moncton (Hon. Mr. Robinson)
that the polling boath should be abolished.
My honourable friend who sits beside me
-he is not in his seat just now-has presented
ta me what I think is a far more useful and
economical sugestion: that we should abolish
the House of Commons-Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: -which is the root
cause of ahl this election expense. I arn sure
that honourable senators will he in perfect
agreemnent with me when I state that if
the affairs of this country had been in the
hands of the Senate during the last ten yeart
there would not be so much financial difficulty
as confronta us to-day.
Somo Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: However, honourable
sonators, we have a number of important
matters ta deal with this afternoon, judging
by the Order Paper, and as the next general
,election is flot likely to be hield for two or
three years, and we are thus afforded ample
time to consider this matter further, I move
the adjournment of the debate until next
Tuesday.
The motion was agreed to.
INCOME WAR TAX BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. METOHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 11, an Act to amend
the Income War Tax Act.
He said: Honourable members, this is a
taxation measure, and does not caîl for that
detailed attention at the hands of this House
that most Bis are entitled to receive. Neyertheless it is only right that a brief explanation

364

SENATE

should be given so that all may understand
just what changes il effects.
The first portion of the Bill deals with what
are called personal corporations. As honourable members know, a personal corporation
is a corporation owned by an individual, or
by an individial along with his wife and
family. There was a time when in computation for the purposes of income tax Žuch
corporations ixere not considered to exist.
There grew up the device of incorporating a
personal comopany to hold the assets and receive the revenues of individuals. As the
revenues came to the company, and the individual drew no dividends, he escaped paying income tax upon those revenues. The
effectivene-s of that plan was brought to an
end b' the legislation of 1926, if I remember
rightly; and now personal companies are incorporated mainly in order that the estate
of an individual may not be subject to
succession duties except in the province in
which lie resides. However, the plan bas been
further extended, and certain people have
incorporated companies in Haiti, Hawaiii, or
some other country at a distance; and because
of the wording of the clause respecting personal corporations there bas arisen a doubt
as to whetlier it applied to a company incorporated in another land. The purpose of
this amendment in respect of personal corporations is to make it plain that there is no
escape, even if the company be incorporated
outside of Canada. There are two sources
of doubt, and both are removed-one by
section 2, and the otcr by section 3.
Section 4 merely provides for the filing of
statements of personal corporations.
There is another important clause, which is
intended to make impossible the device of
issuing redeernable stock for the purpose of
giving a profit to the shareholder at certain
specified times by the redemption of the
stock at a price above the issued price, and
thus enabling him to escape the income tax
simply because the added price in the redemptien figure is in the form of a profit rather
than income.
A further clause makes ministers, high conmissioners and other servants of the Government of Canada who are resident outside of
Canada liable for the income tax which would
be payable by them if they lived in Canada.
There is also a ver' important clause proxvidin.g that an asses-menit shall not render the
assessor-tbat is. the Minister-a mere functus
officie, and that he may subsequentlv re-assess,
or make an assessiment de novo, if be so
desires.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

I do not think there is anything else that
requires explanation. If there is, I am prepared to do the best I can.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The tax on redemption stock when issued against capitalized
surplus--clause 9.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes. The
power to seIl out, and thereby to distribute
surplus without its becoming taxable in the
hands of the distributee, is done away with.
It was done away with once before, and for
some years any surplus so distributed was
taxable, but in 1929 companies were a:ain
permitted to seld to another company their
assets, including their distributable surplus,
and in that way to capitalize the distributable
surplus and render it immune from taxation.
It is the 1929 amendment which is in effect
done away with by the clause which now
appears in this measure.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Is it possible
under this measure for our representatives,
say, in France, to be taxed by the French
Government and by the Canadian Government
on the same income?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. I understand that our representatives in certain countries are taxed by those countries. The
effect of this measure is, I think, to enable
them to deduct the taxation paid in those
countries from any taxation they pay here.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
enjoy diplomatie immunity?

Do

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

ther

not

Ne.

There is diplomatic

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is no
established practice of diplomatic immunity.
In certain countries it is effectjive; in others
it is not. I think honourable members will
sec that under this Bill a man does not escape
taxation in Canada merely because he is
appointed High Commissioner in England;
but if he lias to pay a tax in England he is
enabled to deduct that tax frem the tax
assessed in this country. I understand that in
the past our representatives have been immune
from taxation in Canada, and that as they
xvere also immune elsewhere, representing
Canada was a treniendously remunerative
business.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:
May I ask if
the terms "personal corporations" and "family
corporations" are synonymous?

MARCH 29, 1933
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. I do
not think the family corporation is dealt with
here. A family corporation is one in which
the stock is all owned by a certain limited
number of stockholders. They are given
certain rights in respect of assessment and
taxation. This has to do solely with personal
corporations.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I did not quite
understand the explanation of the right honourable gentleman in regard to the revenue,
profit or dividends that would go to a shareholder by the redemption of stock. Does it
make any difference to the Income Tax
Department whether it is called a dividend,
a profit or an income? Is it net all in the
same category, and taxable?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I shall
explain again what I had in mind. Suppose
a company is formed and this device is
adopted. The purchaser is offered two hundred shares of stock, or any mutiple of two
hundred, at $100 a share. One-half of these
shares are redeemable each year at, we will
say, $105 each. He is gaining five per cent.
If it were redeemable at $110, as would be
more likely, he would be getting ten per cent
on one-half of his total purchase, and as this
return is in the form of a profit on his investment, it is not taxable. So five per cent on
the total investment, or ten per cent on half
of it. really becomes non-taxable. There is
therefore a considerable inducement to a purchaser to buy that class of stock, especially if
he is comfortably well off. I know of that
device having been adopted. It is a method
of escaping taxation by converting income
from the nature of dividends to the nature of
profit.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: But as I understand
it, heretofore when stock bas been redeemed
at a premium of that nature the premium
has been taxed.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Yes.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I know of a case in
which stock was redeemed in 1931 at $110, and
in which the Income Tax Department claimed
the $10 was taxable. My idea is that this
provision is already in force.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It may have
been altered; but I know that that plan was
adopted some years ago.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I may be rather
dense, but I am net quite satisfied with the
explanation that has been given. There are
many bond issues which provide for redemption within a certain number of years at a
certain price.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Bond issues?

365

Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: It is the same
thing. I am coming to the income tax return,
which is the crux of the whole matter. If you
have a $2,000 bond redeemable at $2,200 you
will have a $200 profit over par that is supposed to be taxable; but if you receive an
additional number of shares instead of cash,
of course you will not be taxed, because your
enhanced value wil'l be represented by shares.
Where you get a return in cash I cannot see
how you are going to evade the tax.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It may be
that one cannot do so now. I shall read an
explanation of section 9 which has been
handed to me, and which deals with this very
class of stock:
Section 9 of the Bill is designed te render
liable to tax at a flat rate of four per cent
redeemable stock issued as fully paid up by
capitalizing accumulated earnings of companies
as and when the stock is redeemed. A dividend
payable out of accumulated earnings would be
taxable, and in order that the incidence of the
tax may be made to bear somewhat equally on
those same earnings when paid out either by
way of dividend or on the redemption of stock
issued fully paid up, it is proposed to collect a
tax of four per cent.
The necessity of this legislation arises
through a series of technicalities, court interpretations and amendments to the Income War
Tax Act, and may be shortly stated as follows:
In 1920 or thereabouts it was decided by the
House of Lords that a company, though it had
earned surplus on winding up, could distribute
that earned surplus along with its other assets
and the recipients would not be liable to Income
Tex.
I do not see any use in proceeding further
with the explanation of that. I have already
made it clear.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
What I do net
understand is the assumption that up to this
time a premium on redeemable stock has not
been taxable. I have knowledge of a case
in which the Tax Department is now claiming
that the premium on preferred stock, issued
twelve years ago, and maturing in 1931, is
tax-able. If things are as I understand them
ta be, the Income Tax Department is wrong.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I shall read
further. I see that Mr. Fraser Elliott, who
gives me this memorandum, makes a further
reference to this clause. It is:
Section 9 of the Bill is designed to impose
a flat rate of four per cent to be paid by the
company effecting the redemption at the time of
redemption. This flat rate of four per cent
has been ascertained, I am advised, as approximating the average rate of tax paid by all
dividend recipients, both large and small,That is to say, it is the average of the big
taxpayer and the smaàl taxpayer.
-- when the accumulated earnings are paid out
from year to year over a series of years, and
for that reason is thought fair and reasonable.

SENATE
The imposition of such a tax has the further
favourable feature that it keeps faith with
those shareholders who received the earnings of
comcpanies by way of ordinary dividend in
years prior to 1930 by making the new company distributing those same earnings as tax
free in the hands of the shareholders pay a
tax of four per cent, for it is to be remembered, whether the company as such, or the
shareholders thenselves, bear the tax, it all
comes out of and is derived from one source
-the earnings of the company.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: We cannot amend
this Bill. It is a money Bill.
Hon. Mr. MeRAE: Would the right honourable gentleman give nie a littie light on the
difference between a personal company and a
private corporation? Just where is the line
drawn?
Right Hon. M. MEIGHEN: I think I have
here the exact definition of a personal conpany. I have given it rather roughly. Yes,
the defliition is in the Bill:
"Personal corporation" means a corporation
or joint stock company, irrespective of when
or where created, whether in Canada or elsewhere, and irrespective of where it carries on
its business or where its assets are situate,
controlled. directly or indirectly, by one individual who resides in Canada, or by one such
indiridual and his wi.fe or any member of his
family, or by any combination of them or by
any other person or corporation or any conbination of them on his or their behalf, and
whether through holding a majority of the
stock of such corporation or in any other
ianner whatsoever, the gross revenue of whieh
is to the extent of one-quarter or more derived
froin one or more of the followiug sources,
namely:(i) Froi the ownership of or the trading
or dealing in bonds, stocks or shares, debentures, mortgages, hypothecs, bills, notes or other
similar property,
(ii) From the lending of mouey with or
without security, or by way of rent, annuity,
royalty, interest or dividend, or
(iii) From or by virtue of any right, title
or interest in or to any estate or trust.

Hon. Mr. McRAE:
uals.

Or by several individ-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. or by
several. And if it did not derive its revenue
in the way and to the extent described here,
it would net be called a "personal corporation"
for income tax purposes.
Hon. Mr. MeRAE: Does not the definition
there mean that this is just another species
of family corporation, but that a closed private
corporation with, say, half a dozen shareholders, would net come under this Bill?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, it would,
if it were controlled by a man, or a man and
his wife or any member of his family in any
combination, or on his or their behalf. and
if one-quarter or more of its earnings came
from investments of the character referred to
here.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: But if it were controlled
by three or four individuals, then it would be
what is called a closed private corporation?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If it were
controlled by a man, or a man and his wife
or any member of his familyHon. Mr. McRAE: No; I am speaking of
a corporation that is controlled by a few individuals who are not related at all; in other
words, there would be no family control whatsoever. Would such a corporation come within
this amendment?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No.

vastly more within its compass than did the
term "personal corporation" in the statutes
of a few years ago. The company must be
one that is "controlled, directly or indirectly,
by one individual who resides in Canada, or
by one such individual and his wife or any
member of his family, or by any combination of them or by any other person or
corporation or any combination of them on
his or their behalf," and the gross revenue of
which is to the extent of one-quarter or more
derived from one of the sources named, that
is to say, from investments. Now, I am not
sure what a "private corporation" is. I suppose it is a corporation owned by an individual and engaged in commerce.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
senators, immediately after the second reading of this Bill we passed the third reading,
and we did so not because we are pressed for
time, but simply as a result of the habit into
which we have fallen of paying no attention
to our rules. When quick action is necessary,
I am strongly in favour of making the rules
subservient to the Senate rather than the
Senate subservient to the rules, but it strikes
me that when we are not in a hurry a Bill
of this kind would be dealt with in a more
orderly manner if it were referred to Committee of the Whole, where it cou;d be discussed freely and every member could
properly speak as often as he liked. Instead

EXCHEQUER COURT BILL
SECOND READING
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 44, an Act to amend the
Exchequer Court Act (Exclusive jurisdiction).
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill,
like Bill 40, which we have plaped down for
second reading on 'ruesday next, is cousequential upon the .Sbatute of Westmuinster. It
adds to the jurisddetion of the Exicheque.r
Court of Canada powers in relation to habeas

snd other processes as applied to certain persons and entities over which, by virtue of
that Staitute, wc n-ow have jurisdiction. 'The
Biii specifies very clearly Vo what this added
ju.risdiction applies, namely:
Evcry application for a writ of habeas

or a writ of prohibition, or a writ of mandamus,
iu relation to any officer or man of any Canadian Naval, Military or Air Forces serving
outside of Canada, or in relation to any proceedings, or to any aot or omission respecting
any such officer or man, to the samne extent
as -and under similar circumistances in which

Right Hon. Mr. MFIGHEN: All right.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE
On motion of Riglit Hon. MT. Meighen, the
Senate went into Committee on tihe Bill.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien in the Ch-air.
On section 1--exclusive original jurisdiction:
Hoýn. Mr. GRIESBACH: Honourable sen&tors, flot having been aware that this Bihl
was coming Up to-day, I bave not sbudied. it,
but I notice that it refers to, offiers or men
of any Canadian naval, military or air forces
serving outaide of Canada. How can the
Exohequer Court have jurisdiction over a
man who is outaide of Canada?

367

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The giving
of 'that jurisdiction is the very essence of the
Bill. Great Britain, as a sovereign State, had
jurisdiction in respect of bier citizens not only
within bier own borders and the three-mikp.
limit,' but extraterritorially. The British North
America Act vested in Canada intraterritorial
jurisdiction, which. is exercised either by the
Dominion Parliament in respect of the subi ects
assigned thereto, or by the several legialatures
in respect of other subjects. That is, we had
jurisdiction within our borders and the threemile limit, but we did not have extraterritorial
jurisdiction. I arn not arguing that it is very
vital that we should or should not have extraterritorial jurisdiction, but the fact is that by
virtue of the Statute of Westminster such
jurisdiction, which was long sought by many,
is now ours; therefore it is essential that the
powers of the courts be added to in this regard.
The Bill before us gives the Exchequer Court
jurisdiction to deal with applications for writs
of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, certiorari
or mandamus, as applicable to officers and men
of the Canadian naval, military or air forces
scrving outsidc of Canada. At the present
time, if any such application were made, the
court would not have jurisdiction to deal
with it. WelI, no other court in the world bas
such jurisdiction, and if any court should have
sucli j urisdiction it ought to be a Canadian
court.
Hon. MT. GRIESBACH: I take it that
the practicoal application of this section woiild
be that if an officer or mnan serving outside
of Canada were brough-t before a mihlitary
court, a writ of habeaïs corpus might be presen-ted fromn our Exchequer Court requiring
the person charged Vo be taken out of the

DOMINION NOTES BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 54, an Act ta amend
the Dominion Notes Act.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: I understand that
under the law the Government is required to
hold twenty-five per cent in gold for the first
850,000.000 note issue, or 812,500.000, and that
for every further note issue there must be
a full gold reserve, or dollar for dollar. In
anoler place it was stated that there was
a 868,000,000 note issue behind which there
was no gold at all. I have been told iat
that statement is hardly correct. I have not
had time to verify my information, but
would not such a statement, if it is incorrect,
injure the financial poition of this country?
I have also been told that for cvery dollar
of note i-sue the Governiment now holds forty
par cent gold. Perhaps the right honourable
leader of the Hause will be able to give us
the necessary information.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am not the
Minister of Finance, but I think I can speak
authoritatively in so fiar as I may venture to
answer the honourable senator (Hon. Mr.
Hughes). He is correct iii stating that twentyfive per cent is required to be held in gold
against, the currcncy issue of 850,000,000. The
reason for this low reserve is that it is estimated that 850,000,000 is about the anount
of money that ordinarily would be in circulation for hand-to-hand trade transactions.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:

All the time?

Ordinarily;
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
and consequently it would not likely he presented for redemption in gold. But for any
further issue of currency the gold reserve
requirements are dollar for dollar. This is
our law prosubject to one modification:
vides that in certain periods of the year, for
the purpose of financing the rapid exit of
our grain, a further issue of currency nay be
made against certain securities, for the most
part Dominion bonds. That temporary enlargement of the note issue is quickly
removed fror circulation after it has served
its purpose. I do not hesitate to say, even
without any specific inquiry, that as so
defined the law is wholly complied with.
The honourable member says he has heard
that our gold reserve is about forty per cent.
That is the general understanding. The gold
reserve requirements of the nations of the
world vary, but usually a gold-standard
nation maintains a reserve of about forty
per cent. We have issues of currency beyond

MARCH 29, 1933
the 350,000,000 already mentioned. The average applicable to ail aur note issues runs
about forty per cent, too. Wlien 1 last made
inquiry aur gold reserve was substantially
above the legai requirements. AIl tihis Bill
does is to amend the present law by enabling
the Governor in Council to suspend the
obligation of actuai gold redemption of
Dominion notes, if lie should be s0 advised.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Has it not been
that way for some years? A bank wiii not
give you any goid.
Right Hon. Mx. MEIGHEN: I sliould not
like ta say it would not do so.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I have tried it
repeatedly.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It may be it

better without the gold.

the basis of that currency. As every one knows,
the banks of Great Britain are fairly well
under operative control, systematized and
thoroughly organized and developed through
the centuries, and they take care to maintain
never less than from ten to fifteen per cent
of currency-at the present time I think it
is very much higher-in relation to their
aggregate deposits. In the United States the
currency held by the banks at no time
reached ten per cent, and undoubtedly in
1928 it was not even five per cent of their
deposits. But the point I am making is this:
it does not seem very logical to say, "You can
issue only so much currency as against your
gold base," and yet fail to say, "You can issue
only so much credit as against the currency."
If the restriction is needed in the lower storey
of our credit structure, surely it is still more
needed in the higher storey.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

CONSIDERED

IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen, the
Senate went into Conmittee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien in the Chair.
On section 1-redemption in gold; power
to suspend operation:
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
senators, I still maintain that we ought ta be
very careful as to how the public may be
impressed with this legislation. Dominion
notes are supposed to be redeemable in gold.
For all practical purposes, what good is the
gold reserve to the man in the street if he
cannot get his currency redeemed in gold?
This Bill empowers the Governor in Council
to pass an Order in Council instructing the
banks not to honour the obligation to redeem
Dominion notes in gold. It is a pretty wide
power to give to the Governor in Council.
Perhaps it is essential, but I think it should
be presented to the public in such a way that
it will not tend to cause any fear. In my
opinion there is nothing that causes distrust
and lack of confidence more quickly than the
giving of an order on a bank which the bank
cannot honour. If a man has a deposit in a
bank and he cannot get his money, he is
very much perturbed. What would be the
effect on an ordinary man or woman who has
always been given to understand that a Dominion note of $1 or $2 must be redeemed
in gold, if he or she were told that under the
terms of an Order in Council the bank did not
have to pay gold?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: While we may not have
had any order of the Government, or of the
Governor in Council, to this effect, is it not a
fact that for eighteen months past the banks
have not been paying gold for currency? This
measure simply authorizes a practice that
exists, aven though it may have been established without authority.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
The Receiver
Generaj is conpelled to pay in gold.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I know beyond contradiction that for eighteen months the
ordinary citizen of Canada has been unable
to get gold for cheques or currency. I myself
have been refused gold. On one such occasion
I said, "There is no law to this effect, and if
you cannot show me any authority I will try
every means to get gold," and I got $100. 1
knew there was no authority for refusing it.
But every citizen of Canada knows that for a
year and a half the banks have been refusing
to pay out go-d. What difference does it make
to give some legal authority to the banks to
(lo what they have been doing for eigliteen
months?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: This has to
be borne in mind.
Bank bills are quite
different from bills bearing the stamp of
authority of the Dominion of Canada. I can
quite well realize the position of the banks,
never having a full supply of gold, in
thinking it the part of wisdom not to be too
generous with what they have. But what I
have in mind is the fact that the Dominion of
Canada has given a note payable in gold, and
that we are asked to give the Governor in
Council authoritv to say that even a Dominion
note does not have to be redeemed. Is that
not dangerous?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Imperial
Parliament suspended the gold standard
directly by the following words, which appear
in the Gold Standard Amendment Act, 1931:
Unless and until His Majesty by proclamation otherwise directs, subsection 2 of section 1
of the Gold Standard Act, 1925, shall cease to
have effect.
The happy fact is that there was no panic
in Great Britain, and there certainly was no
intensification of the depression.
As time
elapsed Britain ascended high in the realm
of financiai success and now she is sitting
almost on top of the world.
This clause merelv brings the statute into
conformity with reality. Once a nation prevents the export of gold there is mighty little
purpose in demanding redemption in gold.

Wbat good would gold be to you if you could

applications to the Receiver General for gold.
The gold would flot be of any use.

the duty of the Government to protect its
bonds in the United States rather than its
notes in Canada.

Hon. Mr. CORDON: I do flot think the
ordinary citizen to-day is thinking much about
gold so; long as he can get currency. It is
just as good as gold, and is more convenient
to carry. I imagine the object of this measure
is to retain as much gold as possible in the
treasury, because the Government has already
intimated that it is going to endeavour to
meet in gold ail obligations payable in other
countries. If the people of th-is country were
to decide ail at once that they preferred
gold to legals or good, sound batik notes, and
if they had the power of withdrawing gold
upon presentation of legals, it might mean
that the Governmcnt would be short of gold
to meet its foreign payments. 1 think this
legisiation is wise and well conceived, and
in accordance with what virtually al the
people of Canada want, or what they have
been getting ever since Canada has been
Canada. No person has been using gold.
Even with this legisiation on the Statute
Book, manufacturers wiil stili be entitled to
get as much gold as they require for use in
their business. That is ail that is necessary.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM. The man ini
the United States must have gold or its
equivalent. We are going to take away the
gold behind our Dominion notes in order ta
give it ta a creditor in another land. That
may be essential, but we should be sure of
what effeet it will have on the people.

statement of fact. Britain went off the gold
standard. It occurred to me that a similar
clause here would answer very well. We are
off the gold standard, as bas been stated on
many occasions, and 1 should have thought a
sîmilar paragraph would describe the situation
very clearly and remove the camouflage.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: There are two
things that strike me. Great Britain deliberately. openly and statutorily went off the
gold standard. If that is what we aire doing
-nd I arn not going to say it is wrongI think we ought to make it quite cîcar that

FREE ENTRY OF PALESTINE ORANGES
PROTEST FROM JAMAICA

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. H. J. LOGAN: Honourable senators,
I have received the following telegram from
Jamaica:
Kingston, Jamalica, March 29, 1933.
Senator Hance Logan,
Parliament Buildings,
Ottawa, Ontario.
.Jamaica citrus industry knowing your early
pioneering work behalf Canada West Indies

National ships will lose large revenue which in
few years doubtless be sufficient offset their
Jamaica will
present revenue deficiency.
appreciate your efforts their behalf.
Citrus Producers' Association.
I am very well acquainted with the
people who comprise the citrus producers'
organization, having been associated with
them in Jamaica for some time, when we were
trying to work up the West Indies trade
agreement, and it docs seem to me that
the budget proposal referred to will place
them at a disadvantage. The Imperial Conference at Ottawa established the principle of
promoting trade within the Empire, but now
it is proposed to give special treatment to a
country which is not part of the Empire and
whose people are not British subjects. I
would call the attention of the right honourable leader of the House (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) to this telegram, and, through him,
ask that the Government give due consideration to the request of these people in Jamaica.
They are in a bad position now, and they will
be in a still worse position if the budget
proposal referred to becomes effective.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I will sec
that the contents of the telegram are brought
to the attention of the Minister of Finance.
It is true that Palestine is not a British dominion or colony, but it is a mandated territory for which Britain has very large responsibilities.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

On motion of Hon. Mr. MeMeans, Chairman of the Committee on Divorce, the following Bills were read the third time, and passed:
Bill K, an Act for the relief of Auguste
Burdayron.
Bill L. an Act for the relief of Nora Tulloch
Carr.

RELIEF BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN moved
the second reading of Bill 55, an Act respecting Relief Measures.
The motion was agreed to. and the Bill was
read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This is an
important measure, and in deference to the
right honourable senator from Eganville
(Right Hon. Mr. Graham) I move that the
Senate go into Committee thereon.
The motion was agreed to, and the Senate
went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Copp in the Chair.
On section 1-short title:
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: May we bave
an explanation of this Bill? I suppose it is
really a re-enactment of the previous Bill,
with some few changes?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. The
Bill of the preceding year, after reciting the
depression and its very slow lifting, authorized
the Government, upon such terms and conditions as could be agreed upon, to enter into
agreements with the provinces respecting relief
measures, to grant thema financial assistance

MARCH 30, 1933
by way of loan, advance, guarantee ar atherwise, and alsa ta boan or advance money ta
or guarantec the payment af money by any
public body, corporation or undertaking. The
Bill also autharized the Gavernument ta take
ail measures which in the discretion of the
Gavernar in Cauncil might be deemed necessary or advisable ta protect and maintain the
credit and financial position of the Dominion
or any province thereof. Those, very briefly,
are its important features. This Bill does
precisely the same except that instead of the
last clause that 1 read there is substituted the
f allowing:
When Parliamen-t is net in session, ta, take
al such measures as in his diecretion may be
deerned neeessary or advisable ta, maintain,
wijthin the competence ai Parliament, pence,
order and good government througiîout Canada; and at alI times ta take ail such measures
as in his discretion may be deemaed necessary
or advisaýble ta pratect and maintain the credit
and financial position of the Dominion or any
Province thereof.
It will ba seen that the important difference
is the added power now proposed ta be given
ta maintain. peace, order and good government within the competence of Parliament.
Thoire are minor differences. For example,
last year the Bill provided that special
relief measures might ha undertaken in the
national parks of Canada and in the drought
stricken areas of Saskatchewan. In tbis Bill
the language is more general; the irelief is
made applicable ta "the national parks of
Canada and elsewhere."
This clause is added ta the main clause
exnpowering the Government ta deal with
the provinces:

And in respect ai such loans, advances and
guaranitees, may accept such security, enter into
such agreements and generally do aIl such things
as the Governor in Couneil may deern neceseary
anid expedient in the publie interest.
This enables the Government to take scurity
for advances.
The other clauses are the samne as last year,
except that the total amount expendable for
direct relief under the Act this year is lîmited
ta $20,000,000.
Ràght Han. Mr. GRAHAM: Caould my
right honourable friend tell us approximately
how much hms been expended by the FederaI
G overnienit?
Right Han. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. 1 have
an immense amount of data liera.
Under the provisions af the 1930 Act the
Dominion Governiment ta January 31, 1933,
contributed ta public works tha sum of
814,396,976.81; ta direct relief, 83,547,135.08;
ta cost of administration, 843,061.97. The
total contributions under the Act by the

;374i

Dominion Government amount to $17,987,173.86. This expenditure resulted in thecarrying out of publie wooeks ta the extent
of approximatcJy $69%000,000, including the
contributions of the provinces and
nidcipalitiee. Direct relief expenditures by theDominion, the provinces and the municipai-lies, total1ed 311,000,000. Relief works carried
out under the provisions of the Act afforded
work ta 337,M3 persans, the number of manday's employment thue afforded being 7,481,449.

Under the 1931 legisiation the Dominion
agreed to, provide, and did provide, the sum
of $34,008,878.29, ta be applied towarde the
carrying out of work by the provinces, municipalities, and fedes'al departments. The total
cost of this work ta ail parties responseible
was approximately $81,000)00.
Wh-en the Act
expired on May 1, many works which had been
undertacen, and many commitiments which
had been made with the provinces, had not
been completed. In the opinion of the provinces the comnpletion of these works was very
desirable, and an extension of time became
ne-cessary for thie purpose. The grass cost of
the wo'rks ondes, the extension was approximately $14,778,000. The expenditure of the
Dominion Government for direct relief under
the 1931 Act amounxts to $11,668,783.79. This
includes a contribution of $5,288,085 ta, the
Saskatchewan Relief Cýommission. The expenditure for public woùrks under the 1931
Act gave envpioyment ta, 583.4e2 people, and
the total amaunt af wages paid was $39,532,
328.42. This -afforded a total of 13,274,436
man-days' work.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBAGH: Are the figures of
1931 exactly comparable ta the figures of 1930,
as given?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They are
fairly comparable.
Alter a survey of employment conditions in
the Cana<lian National Railway ishops it wae
decided ta maintain aperations in arder ta
permit of intermittent e.mployment, being given
ta as large a number of employees as possible.
In the month of September, 1931, the Ca.nadian
Pacifie Railway Company was compelled ta
shut down its shaps. Many applications were
made ta the Governiment for assistance an
behaîf af the men -thus thrown out of employmuent. Artangements were made with the company ta open its shops on the 17'th day of
November, 1931, and ta keep them open until
the Slst day of ]Yecember of the same year.
The Government laaned ta the compa-ny
$1.447,222.71 ta enabie the wages of sucb
employees ta be paid. The total n-umber af

railway shop employees thus provided with
employment xxa 8,455.
Now I corne to 1932. Sucb an immense
amount of material bas been furnished me
that 1 hardly know how to condense it. Perhaps the most interesting way in wbich it can
be presented is by provinces.
Let me deal first with the cost of the arrangements made with the provinces with
respect to, the settlement on farms of selected
families-families with previous farm experience, and receiving direct relief. It will
be recallýed that a policy was adopted of cooperating with the provinces witb a view to
selecting families that, would be capable of

earning their own way on the land. The
amnount which it was estimated would be required to support themn on direct relief was
advanced to themn to assist them in establishing theniselves on farms. This amount, set at
a maximum of $600, was to be contributed to
equally by the Dominion, the province, and
the municipality fromn which the family was
taken. Noýt more than $500 ivas to be paid
the first year, $100 being reserved for the
second year in case aid towards subsistence
should become necessary. Under these arrangements the f ollowing commitments were
made:

I will now try to summarize the activities
of 1932, commcncing with the lst of May of
that year.
Prince Edward Island: The Dominion contribution amounted to $5,328.24, being 50 per
cent of a total labour cost of $10,656.49. This,
with the direct relief disbursement, makes a
total disbursement to date of $14,630.10.
Accounts do not reacb the Department of
Labour until iseveral months after the actual
expenditures bave been made by the province or the municipality. The amounts paid
are given here by montbs as well, but I will
flot read these.
Nova Scotia: Under the heading of "Repariation of miners to their native homes"
,here was a total expenditure of $19,893.53,
of whicb the Dominion proportion
wvas
ýS7,957.41. On provincial higbway construction
the total expenditure approved was $80,000,
of wbich the Dominion proportion was
$32,000. On the Trans-Canada Highway construction the total expenditure approved was
$133,647.90, and the Dominion proportion was
$66,823.96. The payment of excess cost of
Nova Scotia coal delivered to Toronto was
$6,087.22, the Dominion proportion being
$3,043.61.
Tbe disbursements made by the
Dominion in respect of these projects to date
are $77»22.54, and for direct relief the
Dominion bas paid $213,628.25; the total

Ontario: Total disbursements in regard
to the Doininion's share of direct relief in this
province to date amount to $2,633,427.18.
Manitoba: Accounts have been received and
paid for relief settlement and other projects
amounting to $87,694.93. In addition to this

The credits or repayments
total 82,814,481.01.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: 1 understood tbe total
advances wvere about 38,000,000.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIIGREN: The balance
outstanding is $8,096,148.44. 1 imagine that is
what, the honourable gentleman refers to. Tbe
various purposes for wbicb the money wvas
advanced are set out in the document I bave
bere, and I will state tbem if any honourable
member desires. In the Province of Manitoba
up to December 31 a bonus of 81,169,025.47
was paid on 23,380,509 bushels of wheat. The
disbursements in regard to the Dominion's
sbare of direct re lief in Manitoba, up to
February 24, were 8911,056.18.
Saskatchewan: In this province the figures
were mucb lower tban for the year before. I
tbink that perbaps Saskatchewan had the

most creditable organization of any province, in view af the gigantie task which
that organization accamplished in 1931, and

connection with relief settiement and other
projects to date amount to $19,096.71, and
the expenditure
for direct relief was
$136,602.99. The total number af persons
reoeiving assistance through the province
increased from 17,936 in May to 42,134
in the following JanuaTy. The number af
those receiving assistance through the Relief
Commission decreased from 140,233 in May
to 20,182 in September. By last January the
number had risen ta 68,510. The loans or
advances ta Saskatchewan total $29,811,293.23,
against which there are credits or repayments
of 89,907,371.57, leaving a net balance outstanding of $19,9W3,921.66. The wheat bonus
was $5,669,919.78, in respect of 113,398,395
bushels af wheat.
Alberta: The total dishursements to date
in respect of the Federal Government's contribution ta direct relief and other projects
are $521,029.67. The boans or advances ta
Alberta amount ta 88,132,000, and there have
or repayments ai $1,953,954,
been credits
leaving a balance outstanding ai 36,178,045.83.
The wheat bonus that was paid up ta the
3lst ai December amounted ta 85,857,735.42,
in respect ai 117,154,708 bushels. The Provincial Government lias iurnished an estimate
ai the numbers ai persoa who received relief
during the nine montha froma May ta January,
and I ask permission ta place this statement
on Hansard:

The brief also contains a statement of the
number of persons estimated to have received
assistance in each province, for each of the
nine months, but I do not think I should
burden Hansard with these idetails unless
specifically requested to do so.
Honourable members will see that the totals
are gigantic, if not appalling. The Dominion
as a whole-these words apply particularly to
our Eastern provinees-has dealt in a spirit
of liberality which I think should for ever
cause the people of Western Canada to remain attached to tlieir Eastern brothers.
Right Hon. G. P. GRAHAM: Honourable
members, I desire te call attention to the
first six words of paragraph b of section 2
of the Bill, "When Parliament is not in session." T.hese words are new. One of the
objections to the way in which relief has been
administered by the Government up to this
year was that the Governor in Council took
power under the statute to get funds at any
time, irrespective of whether Parliament was
in session or not. I am not very strong on
constitutional law, but I think the inclusion
of the words I have referred to will make
for an improvement that will satisfy Parliament and the people. When we, the representatives of the people, are in session, requirements for relief should be referred to us
and not dealt with by the Governor in Council.
As the right honourable leader of the House
has said, the figures are appalling. I like his
remark concerning the generosity of the East
towa.rds particularly one or two Western provinces. And not only have the federal, provincial and municipal governments been generous
whenever appealed to, but the people of this
country have responded magnificently to the
calls made upon them. I appreciate the situation, for I have been in a position to observe,
in a limited way, how gladly-I use that word
advisedly-our people have contributed when
any appeal has been made on behalf of their
unfortunate fellow-citizens, many of whom

prier to the depression were in comfortable
circumstances.
I am inclined to think that we are not so
far away from better times as some people
imagine; but although net versed in intricate
finance, it strikes me that we shall never approximate to the point from which we have
descended until the products of the farms, the
forests, the mines and the fisheries can be
marketed at fair prices. I have heard my right
honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
miake an eloquent speech on the virtue of
silver currency, and I have listened to wonderful addresses in New York on the gold
standard, how to keep the Canadian dollar at
par, and matters of that kind, but until the
primary products that I have mentioned can
be marketed at remunerative prices, the gold
dollar may as well be hoarded for all the
beineit we shall get from it.
How can that improved condition be brought
about? In my opinion, only by the restoration of mutual confidence among the various
nations of the world. At the present time no
nation will trust another very far; but in this
respect a slight improvement is apparent.
This being so, I believe we should encourage
a feeling of optimism throughout the country.
I mean net undue optimism, but a sane
optimism based on a realization that already
there are many bright spots in the general
situation.
Perhaps some of my honourable friends may
think me foolish when I express the opinion
that the opportunities which we have had,
and are still having, to cultivate a spirit of
altruism and to engage in charitable work will
exert a strong influence in bringing about a
better citizenship in this and other countries.
Many of us have not yet been hurt seriously
by the economie depression through which we
are passing, and it may be that we shall have
to learn our lesson. Prior to the depression
too many of us were trying to make a living
without working for it, and when the time
came to face the stern reality that gold was
not to be picked from mulberry trees, we fell

MARGIH 30, 1933

down badly. But the great body of the people
of Canada have not failed ta discharge their
social responsibilities, and I repeat, I am confident that the opportunities they have had
ta help their less fortunate fellow-citizens will
tend ta develop a better citizenship in this
country.
As for the Bill itself, I am sorry it is
necessary ta appropriate so large a sum for
direct relief, but as a member of this House,
and as an individual citizen, I gladly acquiesce in the decision of the Governmentand in this decision the people are behind it
-ta stand by those of our fellow-citizens who
are not able ta look after themselves.
I have one criticism ta offer. Perhaps the
principle adopted is unavoidable, but I deplore
the fact that apparently we are compelled ta
hand out direct relief. No doubt the expenditure on public work ta meet the present
condition of unemployment would have ta be
on too enormous a scale for the Government
to attempt it. But, unfortunately, direct relief is having a very detrimental effect on our
young men. I live on the highway, and very
few people travelling on foot pass my house
without paying me a visit; therefore I am in
a position ta observe the disposition of many
of the unemplayed. Of the older men I have
nothing ta say. The younger men, from
seventeen ta twenty-two years of age, invariably come ta my house in pairs, and they
seem ta have no thought of anything but
direct relief. I am afraid that by the time we
are in a position ta tell them, "You can have
no more direct relief," their habit of roaming
from place ta place and not working will be
too firmly lixed ta be easily eradicated. One
of the results of direct relief is that the
younger men now entertain the idea that the
world owes them a living, and consequently
they do not want ta work. I fear they will
hold ta that idea for the rest of their lives.
I do not exaggerate when I say that out of
the thousands of younger men who have come
ta my house ta ask for assistance, not more
than six at the outside have sought to do
something in return for what they got. Some
of these men have been visiting me year after
year until I have become chums with them.
I wish it were possible ta say ta the younger
men: "In return for what you get you must
do some work in order ta preserve your manhood. In every way it is better for you ta
give a quid pro quo-for the relief granted ta
you." I am alarmed by the attitude of our
younger men, some of them mere boys. I
suppose that during the last three months the
proportion of mere boys as compared with
the older men who have called at my place has
increased fifty per cent. It may be that these
youths are just giving rein ta a spirit of ad-

377

venture, but I fear they may become confirmed loafers. That is an appalling condition
ta contemplate.
Some of the municipalities have a very good
scheme of local relief. I may instance what
Brockville is doing. We have what we call
a community chest. The unemployed have
their own organization, which co-operates with
the executive committee handling the finances
of the community chest. The men do a good
deal of the work and this gives them a feeling
that they are doing something ta help themselves. Indeed, it takes away the stigma that
they and their families are on unemployment
relief. For instance, Brockville bought a
wood lot, where the unemployed cut wood
under the supervision of the town officials, and
they are very happy ta do the work. I call
attention ta the way in which Brockville is
handling the problem in the hope that it will
encourage other municipalities ta do something along similar lines ta enable the unemployed ta take their part in looking after
themselves, and so preserve their manly selfrespect.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That would be
quite feasible where the proportion of the
unemployed ta the total population is small.
I do not think the scheme could be applied
where you have, we will say, an eighth of the
population on unemployment relief.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Perhaps not ta
such an extent. But ta my mind it is not se
much a question of the number of unemployed
as of the necessity of providing machinery to
permit those out of work ta retain their manhood by earning a part at least of what they
are receiving by way of relief.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: A social service
agency.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Yes. I have
found that ninety per cent of the unemployed
are not at alil unreasonable. In my town
when one of the unemployed becomes a bit
unreasonable he is fired out of the organization, and he does not get any relief until he
ceases ta be unreasonable.
I think Canada is doing wonderfully well in
looking after those of her citizens who are out
of work, and I for one would not say a word
that might be construed ta suggest any
diminution in that assistance ta the unemployed.
Hon. J. STANFIELD: Honourable members, these appalling figures in relation ta unemployment relief make one shudder, and
wonder how much longer the country can
carry the burden of taxation. I am sorry ta
say that unemployment in the Dominion is
not decreasing. We cannot allow our desti-

378

SENATE

tute fellow-citizens to starve, but where are
we going to get the money to provide further
relief after the present appropriation is expended?
I know a littie about industrial conditions,
and I can assure the House that our manufacturers are eutting down their overhead to
the fullest po-sible extent, and yet many of
them cannot keep out of the red. With few
exceptions, the annual reports that appear in
the press from time to time show that our
industrial concerns are operating at a ios.
To-day a manufacturer thinks himself very
fortunate indeed if he cean keep out of the red.
If our municipalities, our provincial governments, and the Federal Government would eut
down their overhead as drastically as have
our manufacturers, tbey could save millions
of dollars.
Unfortunately, too often the
tendency is in the other direction. We have
an example in the announcement made recently that the Radio Commission-which
seems to be my pet aversion--is to be given
a million dollars to spend. I would urge that
we eut out such needless expenditure. We
do not need a Radio Commission. I could
cite other instances where economies might
be effected, but I refrain from doing so at
the moment.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I do
not know very much about the expenditure
to which the honourable senator (Hon. Mr.
Stanfield) refers, except that it is in accordance with the policy recommended by all
sections of the other House.
I rise merely to read an extract that I
have received to-day from a retired farmer in

a small town in Western Ontario.

Certainly

he is an intelligent man with a well balanced
mind. I give the quotation in confirmation of
tome of the remarks of the right honourable
senator from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr.

Graham). This retired farmer says, in part:
J am acting as relief officer in our municipality

this wiater, and w hile some cases are both
pitiable and deserving, the majority of them are
simply naddening, when the law compels me
to tax thrifty, hard-working, honest, law-abiding
citizens, many of whon are striving to pay
their debts by doing with the bare necessities
of life, in order to provide the absolutely
shiftless with food, clothing, fuel and shelter,
the vicious with hospital and doctors' bills, and
the criminals with palatial boarding bouses
where their every need is supplied. Is it any
wonder if those of us who give the matter
serions thought are pessinistic as to the future
of our once splendid, if rugged, civilization.
when thrift and industry cean be taxed out of
their homes and off their farms to support the
lazy. shiftless. vicious and criminals in confort?
While I have asked the question, I do not
expect an answer.
Hon.

Mr. STANFIELD.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Why is it that the
unemployment machinery set up in the early
stages of this depression broke down so
lamentably that it cost about tan dollars
for every dollar of relief that reached the
needy?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, no.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Well, it broke down,
anyway.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Why was it abandoned?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It was not
abandoned.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: We are giving direct
relief now.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is not
the machinery; that is the system.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:
abandoned?

Why was the system

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
much.

It cost too

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Exactly. Why did it
cost too much? It appears that in some way
or other the administration broke down.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

No, no.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: What happened that
we had to abandon what would appear to be
a sound for an unsound principle?
The works
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
were undertaken and supervised by the provinces and the municipalities. The defect of
the method was inherent: while it was better
than granting direct relief, it cost too much.
The administration was not defective.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:
much?

Why did it cost too

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Because of
the cost of labour and material. Certainly
it would be botter to give indirect relief if we
could afford it, because those who receive
it give their labour in return. But the provinces represented to the Government that
neither they nor the municipalities could
afford to bear their share of the cost, and for
that reason the present policy of granting
direct relief was adopted. The honourable
senator has stated that under the former
policy it cost about ten dollars for every dollar
that reached the men. In reply I would say
that the cost was only about one-tenth of a
cent for every dollar of relief.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Could not an arrangement be made with the provinces whereby

379

MAROH 30, 1933
the sluins in our large cities could be cleared
away and decent homes provided for our
workingmen? Surely it is not beyond the
capacity of the people of Canada te devise a
better system of unemployment relief than
that now in operation, for, as pointed out by
the right honourable senator from Eganiville
(Right Hon. Mr. Graham), there ie no doubt
that many of our u.nemployed young men
are Uiely to become confirmed loafers.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Correct.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Even if we had to
spend a larger amount, it would be well worth
while to do so to prevenit such a calamity.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Where could
we get the money?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The present appropriation might well be expended to save the
character of the people.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It might save
the character of those who would work; but
if only the same amount were expended there
would be a great many who could not be
helped at al, and they would starve.
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Honouraible members,
1 can give an instance of work of that nature
that was undertaken ini 1931. Camps were
estahlished nt certain points for the purpose
of clearing land. From 250 to 300 men were
engaged at a smaîl wage varying from $5 to
810 a month. The supervision of the work,
the building of the camps and the wages paid
to the men cost a great deal of nioney. Last
year, înstead of continuing that system, it was
decided that it would be very mach cheaper
to give the men who were in actual need a
supply of food which would be just sufficient
to meet their requiremnents. I could cite
several instances in which the Government &ê
the province found it necessary te maice a
similar change in order to save money.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: How long will this
have to go on?
Hon. GIDEON R.OBERTSON: Honourabie members, I think it only proper that I
should cay a word for the information of the
honourable gentleman from King's (Hon. Mr.
Hughes). He las mentioned a Proportion Of
ten to oen referring te the cost of administration. I remember very welýl the system
of relief undertaken in 1930, when thils Parkiament voted some $20,000000 as the ferlerai
conVrihution towards u.nemploymenit relief. If
the honourabie gentleman wiil refer to the
report on uncmpioyment relief for that year
he will sec that the cost of administering the
$20,000,000 was $26,000.

Hon. JOHN LEWIS: Honourable members,
it seems to me that the inherent difficu.lty lies
in the fact that in these days of me-chanization
you oachot give employmeflt to a certain
number of men and pay them wag-es for their
work unlees you expend a arger sum on
materials and machinery than is expended on
wages.
Righ-t Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Tha.t le right.
Section 1 was agreed to.
Sections 2 and 3 were agreed to.
On section 4-payment for direct relief not
to exceed $20,000,000:
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That îs new?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Section 4 was agreed to.
Sections 5 to 8, inclusive, were agreed to.
On section 9--uration of Act:
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: This clause
only extends the duration of the Act for one
yeax.

Section 9 wae agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.

COAL CREEK MINES
INQUIRY

Before the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. H. KING: I wish to inquire of the
Government whether it has any knowledge of
the reported closing of the coal mines at Coal
Creek, British Columbia. As many honourable members know, these mines are tributary
to the city of Fernie. I would also ask
whether the Government bas considered any
means whereby this reported permanent closing of the mines could be delayed or prevented.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have no
definite information as to the particulair mine
referred to, but I do know that because of
the keen competition of British coal shipped
to Vancouver, due to the advantage that
vessels have of obtaining return cargoes of
wheat at that port, the mines on the Pacifie
coast are having an exceedingly difficult time.
The subject has been under consideration, and
it is possible that I shall be able to give
further information at a later date.
CHARITY SWEEPSTAKES BILL
PROPOSED) AMENDMENTS

The

Senate

CONSIDERED IN

COMMITTEE
proceeded to

consider

the

amendments proposed by the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills to Bill 1,
an Act with respect to Charity Sweepstakes.
On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen,
the Senate went into Committee on the Bill
and the proposed amendments.
Hon. M-r. Beaubien in the Chair.
On section 1-short title:
The CHAIRMAN: The first amendment is
to substitute the words "Hospitals Sweepstakes Act" for the words "Charity Sweepstakes Act." The section as amended would
read:
This Act may be oited as the "Hospitals
Sweepstakes Act."
The proposed amendment was agreed to.

381

On section 2-Attorney-General of any
province may authorize sweepstakes for charity
within that province:
The CHAIRMAN: The amendment is that
for the words "welfare of the sick, destitute
and maimed within such province," in lines
fourteen and fifteen, the following be substituted: "benefit of one or more hospital or
hospitals within such province."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Mr. Chairman,
speaking for myself, I shall not object to these
amendments as they are read, but shall await
the motion for third reading of the Bill, when
I may again challenge the principle of the
measure.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Mr. Chairman,
when we were in committee it was intended
to make this section provide that not more
than one sweepstakes could be held in any
one province in a year. I move that the
section as amended be further amended to
read as follows:
Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the
Attorney-General of any province may not more
than once in each year authorize by a certificate
under his hand the conduct within such province by any person or persons therein named
(hereinafter referred to as "the Committee")
of a sweepstakes for the purpose of raising
money for the benefit of one or more hospitals
within such province.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHIEN: Mr. Chairman, I suggest it would be much more convenient that the honourable senator should
move his amendment in the following form:
That after the words "from time to time" in
the third line of section 2 the following words
be inserted: "but not oftener than once in each
calendar year."
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Yes; that would be
the same.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: Of course, even under
a section of that kind each of the nine provinces would have the privilege of running a
sweepstakes ut the same time?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: A nice situation!
The CHAIRMAN: My attention has been
drawn to the fact that we are now considering, net the original sections, but simply the
amendments.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should be
surprised to learn that the Committee of the
Whole could not consider any section as
amended.
The CHAIRMAN: Then every clause as
amended by the Standing Committee is now
before us?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly.

SENATE
The CHAIRMAN: The objection is that
we are in committee to consider the amendments and not the Bill.

The CHAIRMAN:

Amendment 5-page 1,

lino 26: for the words "charity or charities"
substitute "hospital or bospitals."

The proposed amendment was agreed to.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We are in
committee on the amendments, but surely
we can consider any clause as amended.
Surely this committee is not hamstrung so
that it cannot vote yes or no on the amendments, or cannot alter any amendment as
it wishes.

line 9: for the words "charity or charities"
substitute "hospital or hospitals."

The CHAIRMAN: It is moved in amendment by the honourable senator from
Repentigny (Hon. Mr. Rainville) that section
2, as amended by the Standing Committee,
be further amended-

The CHAIRMAN: Amendment 7-page 3,
line 35: for the word "charity" substitute
"hospital."

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: By inserting
the words "but not oftener than once in each
calendar year" after the words "time to time."
The CHAIRMAN: The rest of the section
is not just the same in the two amendments.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But that is
the change the honourable member has in
mind. I would ask him to accept his amendment in this form, because it is much simpler
than the one he proposed and does not run
the risk connected with his abbreviation of
the first part of the section. The simpler
form would reach his objective with less
alteration of the section.
The CHAIRMAN:
Section 2, with the
amendments now proposed, would read as
follows:
Notwithstanding any law to the contrary and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other Act, it shall be lawful from
time to time, but not oftener than once in each
calendar year, for the Attorney-General of any
province in which the same is to be conducted
to authorize by a certificate under his hand the
conduct within such province by any person or
persons therein named (hereinafter referred to
as "the Conmittee") of a sweepstakes for the
puîrpose of raising money for the benefit of one
or more hospital or hospitals within such
province.
The proposed amendments were agreed to.
On section 3-Attorney-General may make
regulations; powers defined:
The CHAIRMAN: Amendment 3-page 1,
lino 22: for the words "charity or charities"
substitute "hospital or hospitals"
The proposed amendment was agreed to.
The CHAIRMAN: Amendment 4-page 1,
line 24: for the word "charity" substitute
"hospital."
The proposed amendment was agreed to.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

The CHAIRMAN:

Amendment 6-page 2,

The proposed amendîment was agreed to.
On section 8-Criminal Code not to apply:

The proposed amendment was agreed to.
On the title:
The CHAIRMAN:
tute "Hospital."

For "Charity" substi-

The proposed amendment was agreed to.
The Bill was reported as amended.
THIRD READING POSTPONED

The Hon. the SPEAKER:

When shall this

Bill be read the third time?
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Now.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

To-morrow.

Hon. Mr. MeRAE:
Honourable senators,
I regret that it will not be convenient for me
to be here to-morrow. The Bill has been
pretty thoroughly discussed, and I would ask
that it be given third reading now.
While on my feet I may add that since
this Bill was introduced several of the provincial treasurers have brought down their respective budgets, and I have no doubt honourable
senators have noticed that in every case the
appropriation for hospitals has been reduced.
The operation of the Bill being now restricted
to one objective, namely, hospitals, and to
the operation of one sweepstake for each
province, I would ask, in view of the urgency
of the situation, that the third reading of the
Bill be not postponed.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Honourable
senators, on a question of minor importance
I would do anything to suit the convenience
of my honourable friend from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae), but he has thrown a very
disturbing element into the legislative arena,
and, there being strong opposition to the Bill
on principle, it would be only reasonable for
him to suppose that it would not be passed
in a hurry. Several honourable senators are
as much interested against the Bill as my
honourable friend is intcrested in its favour,

APRIL 4, 1983
but it was not convenient for them. to be
here to-day. Under the circumstances I amn
afraid we shall have to ask bim. to stay by
bis offspring until he secs what hecomes of it.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May I asic the
honourabie senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
McRae) what is reaiiy meant by the word
"hospital"? In my city and province "hospitai"
xnay mean any one of several things.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I think the term is
pretty plain to us ail. If there is any doubt
about it in the Province of Quebec, the Attorney-Generai there wiii certainly know what it
means.
The Bill was piaced on the Order Paper
Vo be read the third time to-morrow.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. F. L. BEIQUE moved the second readîng of Bill Q, an Act respecting the Quebec,
Montreai and Southern Raiiway Company.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Honourabie
senators, I bave no objection Vo the second
reading of the Bill, as I assume that it will be
referred immediately to the Committee on
Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours. Whiic
on my fee't, I would. suggest that an a.mendment be týhere considered which would compei
the company to sec that its debts are paid
hpfore it distributes its assets.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The committee will sec
to it that evidence is adduced to show that the
dehts have ail been paid.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THE CA'ITLE INDUSTRY
MOTION FOR REFERENCE TO COMMITTEE

The Senate resumed from March 29 the debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. Riley:
That the Standing Committee on Agriculture
and Forestry he authorized to conaider and
inquire into the conditions of export trade in
cattie and the cattie industry generaily.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourabie senators, last Wednesday I expressed my views
on the motion introduced by the honourabie
senator from High River (Hon. Mr. Riiey)
and gave a brief outiine of the method of
marketing cattie in Canada. As I stated at
the time, I feel that if this matter were referred to the Committee on Agriculture and
Forestry it wouid be deait witb in a tborough
manner. If it is the wish of the House, I
shouid be glad to have it so referred as soon
as possible.

383

Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Honourable senators,
I arn sorry that the honourabie senator from
High River (Hon. Mr. Riley) is not in bis
seat. This is an extremeiy important question, not only to the. ranchers of the West,
but to ail tbe stock-raisers of Canada.
Perhaps many in this Chamber are wondering why we have not, long ago caiied upon
the Standing Comniittee on Agriculture and
Forestry to investigate, and seek remedies
for, some of the serious problems which are
handicapping the cattie industry and other
branches of agriculture. For at least ten
ylea.rs this Commit-tee bas not functi-oned to
any extent. It is called together occasionally
to approve of certain Bis that corne from
the other House. I arn glad that the honourable senator from High River brought this
matýter Vo our attention. Wbiie bis resolution
deals with only the cattle industry, it can be
widened out in order to include ail branches
of agriculture.
Stock-raising in the West, and, in fact, in
ail parts of Canada, is extremely important,
not only for ranohers, but for our farmers
in generai. They are fuliy alive to ite importance as one of Canada's basic industries. In
thc older parts of the province in which I
live, where wbeat raising bas heen for many
years the major industry, the farmers are
beginning to realize that they cann.ot go on
with that mode of farming indefinite-ly. They
have discovered that Vhey cannot go on for
ever taking cverything out of the soil, witihout in some way replenishing it. TPhis can
be done only by foliowing a system. of what
is known as mixed farming. Consequentiy
we find that a large number of our farmers
are increasing their herds of cattie, also their
sheep and hogs. This system of farming,
even under existing low prices, is found Vo be
more profitable and safer than the exclusive
growing of grain. -In the older settled parts
of the Prairie Provinces noxious weeds are a
scourge. To a large extent these noxious
weeds can be smothered by the growing of
coarse kiuds of grain, which are necessary for
succe-ssful stock-raising.
I was extremely pieased to notice the
statement of the bonourable senator from
High River that the home markcet consumed
a large percentage of the cattie produced in
this country. He stated-and I presume bis
figures are correct-bhaV iast year we exported
Vo Great Britain only 17,000 head of cattle,
and that the home markcet consurned 1,500,000
head. In other words, tbe home mnarket consumed nearly 87 per cent of our cattie; which
proves that the home markcet is the most
important of alI. It bas been at times
ridiculed as of comparativeiy littIe value, but

SENATE

384

our statistics show that from year to year
our existence depends upon it to a large
extent.
As honourable senators are aware, we had
at one time practically an open market for our
cattle in the United States. The duty being
very low, we carried on an extensive business
with our neighbours to the south, who took
our young stock, animals two or three years
old, and fed them for the market. As far as
our stock producers were concerned, I think
that was a mistake. As I have stated, we are
going into the cultivation of the coarser grains,
and indeed in Manitoba and certain parts of
Saskatchewan corn is being grown successfully.
So we can prepare our young animals for the
market just as well as can our American
friends, who found it a very profitable business.
J desire to point out briefly what the Government has done during the past two years
to encourage not only stock-raising, but other
farming activities as well. In fact I think I
am safe in saying that since Confederation no
other Government has taken such a practical
interest in the various phases of agriculture.
Take the situation existing in Western Canada a couple of years ago, when the huge
organization known as the Wheat Pool was
on the verge of bankruptcy. In order to save
thousands of farmers interested in the Wheat
Pool, the Government advanced $15,000,000
to enable the organization to carry on. Had
not this been donc, probably tens of thousands
of people in the Western Provinces would
have lost their holdings.
Last autumn the price of wheat was so low
that something had to be done to stabilize
the market. Again the Government came to
the rescue of Western Canada and advanced
$15,000,000 to keep the market on a reasonably
sound basis. As a result the wheat farmers
of the Western Provinces, during the past six
months, have received a higher price for their
wheat than have wheat growers in any other
part of the world.
Again, at the Imperial Economie Conference
at Ottawa last August the Government looked
after the interests of our farmers. For the
past twenty-five or thirty years every effort
had been made by our live stock men and
others to get the Imperial authorities to withdraw the embargo against the importation of
Canadian cattle. Delegation after delegation
went to England for that purpose, but without result. At the Economic Conference the
Government succeeded in securing the removal
of the embargo, and as a result of that action
Hon. Mr. GILLIS.

our cattle now have free entrance to the
British market. In addition to that, it secured
a preference on many of our agricultural
products, which, this afternoon, I am not
going to enumerate.
But what I think is of greater importance
than anything else donc by the Government
is its recent action in establishing a stabilization fund. If we take into consideration the
advantage that will accrue to the stock-raisers
of Canada by reason of the establishment of
this fund, we shall find that for animals weighing twelve hundred pounds, and selling at six
cents a pound, the owner will receive at least
nine dollars, probably ten dollars, per head,
in addition to the price ordinarily paid.
Everyone must admit that this will be a great
boon to the stock growers of Canada. It is
my sincere hope that the Government will
regulate this matter s that the benefits of the
stabilization fund will go direct to the man
who produces the cattle.
Two years ago the Government decided to
offer a bonus of five cents a bushel to the
wheat growers of Western Canada. When
that proposal was brought down in the other
House, those who were opposed to the Government ridiculed the idea. They said, "The
elevator men and the railway companies vill
get the advantage of that five cents a bushei
Instead of that, the farmer who grew the grain
received a cheque for five cents a bushel on
everv bushiel he marketed, and he consequently
enjoyed the full benefit of the bonus. If
can be arranged under this
somte scheme
stabilization plan, it will be of great benefit
to the stock growers of Canada. It may not
be possible to bring titis about, but I think
the Government should give it very serious
consideration and make an effort in that
direction.
There are many matters that our committee,
if it is permitted to function, can deal with.
The honourable senator from Bruce (Hon. Mr.
Donnelly) stated the other day that the
stock-yards throughout Canada-he referred
more particularly to one in Toronto, with
which he was familiar-xwere charging as much
to-day for the handling of all products as
they charged during war-time, when prices
were high. He pointed out that they were
charging $27 a ton for bay-an outrageous
price. Last autumn an instance of this kind
was brought to my attention. A man in the
town where I live shipped several carloads of
first-class baled hay, for which he got $7
a ton. The cost of transporting it to the
stock-yards was probably $1.75 or $2. So,
if the hay is being sold to stock growers at

APIL 4, 1933

$27 a ton, somneone is making an excessive
profit out of the transaction. There are many
other complaints that the stock miarkets are
working serjous injury to the farmers. 1 have
heard complaints with regard to the grading
of hogs. Whether this work is done by Gov?rnment inspectors or not, I do flot know.
There is a certain class of hogs called "selects."
l'bey are supposed to be perfect animais, and
a bonus of $1 a head is paid for them. Unfortunateiy, credit is given for but very few of
these animais in the average carload of hogs.
One man told me that lie went to Winnipeg
witb a carload of bogs. He feit absolutely
confident that hie would get twelve "selects"
out of the carload. "But," hie said, "wliat was
my surprise when I was told that there were
only three 'selects' in the wbole carload." He
was a man of experience, and thought lie was
.iust as capable of judging animais as the ins9pector. Yet we got three "s-eleets9" when
in bis opinion hie should have had ten or
twelve.
As 1 say, this committee shouid inquire
into many things. Bonourable members have
observed that an inquiry is going on before
a committee in another place. In that coinmittee there was some taik about the nonpayment of dividends. The company that
was the subject of investigation claimed that
it was not able to pay dividends, and one or
two of the officiais of the company came forward and stated that it was struggling for
existence. Then, a day or two later, the president was examined, and hie was compelled
to admit that whereas the original capital of
the Company was $113,OOO, the business now,
by reason of the company's operations during
a certain number of years, was wortb more
than haîf a million dollars. How did the
company make sucli profits?
Bon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Is that the Mont'eal stock-yard?
Hon. Mr. GlLLIS: No; I bad finiahed with
tbat. Perhaps I bad betiter go back. This
business, which started out with a capital of
$113,000, is to-day admitted to be worth haîf
a million. Bow did the company make so
mueli money? Was it not by cbarging the
consumai-s one hundred per cent more for the
milk then was paid the farmens for it?
Most bonourable gentlemen must have read
in the press a day or two a-go that i certain
parts of Onta.rio-and probably ini other parts
as well-when spring lambs were brouglit to
the market last autumn the packers or some
other organization decided to fix seventy
pouinds, no more and nD lem, as thie proper
weight. If a lamb weighed seventy-five pounds
the fairmer would get oinfly haîf picn for it,

385

or if it weigbed le,-s( than seventy pounds lie
would get andy baif price. But, as was pointed
out in the paper, whien one went to a meat
shop to buy iamb hie was not asked wbether
lie wvanted lamb from an animal that weighed
scventy pounds. eighty pords or sixty pou>tnds;
the same piie was charged, no matter what
kind of lamb was supplied. That is a matter
tbat miglit be inquired into by the committee.
Now I corne f0 another induetry, wh*icb I
arn almoet afraid to mention. I refer ta the
rnilling industry of Canada. The day of the
oid custom miii that used to serve the comnînunity lias gone by; the day when the farmer
m-ould take bis load of wbeat (o the miii, pay
t on or fifteen cents a bushel for grinding, and
take home bis year's supply of flour, bran
and shorts. The rniiling business to-day is
entirely in the hands of tbe large companies,
and I think I arn safe in isaying that invariably
the price charged. for flour and its by-products,
sucb as bran and shorts, is entÀrelly out of proportion witb the prie-- of wlieât tlirougbout
the country. I understand that about two
and two-fiftbs busbels of wliea/t are required
to produce a ninety-eigbt pound sack of flour,
for wbicb the mulhing companis to-day charge
$2. 15. I arn quoting Western prices. Thig
flour is made of wbeat costâ.ng fifty cents a
bushel,' or less. During the last faw months
every milling cornpany in Canada lias býeen
able to secure a suprply of wheat in Western
Canada, wbere millions of busheis were soid,
and where the companies liad agents at almoet
every point, at ions than forty cents a bushel,
and even as low as tbirty cents. If this is
true, and I do not think anybody cari contradiet it, there sbou'ld be an investigation into
(bis industry to find out wbho is making the
rnoney. This is a matter of importance to
ail houseboiders in Canada, for tliey ail use
breaid and flour.
I arn giad to see at the bead of the comrnittee the honourabie senator from Bruce
(Hon. Mr. Donnelly). Be bas a general
knowiedge of these matters and will go into
thern thoroughly. Be bas outlined a few of
the many problems that tlie farmers and stock
growers of Canada bave to contend witb. If
tlie millers or the stock-yards or any otlier
organizations are cheating tlie public, we
sbould find out about it.
Hon. Mr. BUGHIES: Will the lionourable
member permit a question? I bave sean it
stated that the millers of Canada sali flour in
England cheaper than tbay do in Canada.
Bon. Mr. McMEANS: Tliey always do.
Bon. Mr. BUGHES: Wliat is the reason?

ourable gentleman from Higli River. I have
in my hand a publication of the Department
of Trade and Commerce, the Commercial Intelligence Journal, with which ail honourable
members are familiar. The issue of March
18 of Ibis year ýcontains a report by ouir agricultural oepresesntaitive in England, Mr. W. A.
W'ilsýon, .setting forth changes thait have been
mnade in thse regula-tions governing expoqt of
ca tt le.
Regulations that were eIassed as
nuisances and were a greait hindranoe to the
f xporting of catitie to thse United Kingdom
malcet have been done away witjh igince the
17tdi of Jan.uary last. I do not think it is
iiccessary to read them to thse Senate, because
this report is avaýilable to ail honourable
inembers.
Anocther encouraging feature is that adi the
(C:naqdian cattie that have bcen going to
Britain sincse that time have commanded
favourable prioer,. In tise Commercial Intelligence Journal of the 2&th of March last there
is a report by our Týrade Comimissioner of a
rat tic sale hýeld ait Glasgow on Ma-rdi 6, and.
ibiis shows that the prices received, by the
shippers wcýre very enoouraging.
Severai honourable members have referred
te the creation by the laSt budget of a stabilization fund. That, no doubt, is of direct
benefit at the present time-,, but the benefit
(an bc' only temporary, b,-ecause it is wholiy
baýed on the fact that our money is at a
preniimr over Britishi moeu. When there is
no longer such a preminln the good effeet of
the stabilization fund will cease to exist. The
advantages that wesîld accrue to the cattie
industry in Canada from an inquiry such as
is proposed in this motion wou!d, in my
opinion, be more permanent and far-reaching
than any we can expeet from a stabilization
find. Howelver. sinder this fund the pound is
te be fixed at $4.60, ani to tboSe wbo expert
cattle to the Old Country market this wvill
givû seme ativantage in the matter of cxchange.
1 -,rusld urge upon the right honourablc
leader of the Hotise that the inquiry be
allewed. It mray bc. as was said by the boneiirable senator fromn South Bruce (Hon. Mr.
Donneily), that the session is se far advanced
that Ibis matter cannot be gene into as fully
as it deserves. The external phases of the
business were deait with last year by the
committee te which. 1 have referred. The
Committee on Agriculture could confine its
inqshiry« more particuiarly te conditions in
Can-ada and te ocean rates. The chairman
of thiat cemmittce (Hon. Mr. Donncliy) is
wel! acquainted wif h the cattie industry and
highlv quaiified te prcside over a thorough in53721-25 à

vestigation. There is room for inquiry with
regard te the charges made at the stockyards, the services given te our cattie mca
by the railways in getting cattie te the ports,
and the rates for ecean transport.
We
naturaliy expeet that some reduction can be
made in those charges, but 1 do net knew
whether it is necessary for us te deal witb
that question in considering the motion. If
we eau b.elp te create more confidence between the producer and the markets we sball
be doing a great deal te help the agriculturai
industry. For these and many other reasons,
whichi 1 need net take time te state in detail,
I wish te support the motion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 tbjnk there is
censiderable advantage te be gained from
setting on foot an inquiry such as is proposed,
and as I arn jioder the impression tbat we
may stili be sitting here in dune, I suppose
there wiiI be plenty of time for the committee
te deal with the matter. I rise simply te suggest that the Chairman of the Committee on
Agriculture (Hon. Mr. Donnelly) might look
around and sec if there are net seme honourable senators. net on this committec, whese
experience and knowicdge would make them
valuaible memnbers of it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I may say
that the chairman of the committee spoke te
me just a few moments ago, suggesting that
the nee'bership should he enlarged, especially
as two or threc of the pre-sent members are
net regularly present. 1 have ne doubt that
be will be speaking te the honourabie leader
or the W'hip Opposite and asking for sugges.tions f rom that side of the House with
respect te additions te the cemmittec.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators, I w-as very much struck with a remark
made by the bonourable gentleman from
Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Gillis), te the cifet
that although we have bad a Committce on
Agriculture for a great many years, it has
scarcely ever undertaken any research work or
study of our agricuitural problems, having
cenfined itself merelv te routine matters concerning Buis that have ceme before it. I
may say that I have net inquired te ascertain
whether the bonourahie gentleman's statement
is weil founded. Ail that bas been said on the
importance of agriculture is undoubtedly truc.
Agriculture is, aftcr aIl, our great îndustry, and
un.less it succeeds this country cannot succced.
Therefore it seems te me that the Senate
sbould from time te time try te sec in what
wav it cao assist in the developmcnt of that
industry. As the Chairman of the Committcc

SENATE
on Agriculture (Hon. Mr. Donnelly) has
intimated, it is now late in the session and
there may not be time to do much with the
proposed inquiry. We have just heard that
we may be here until June, and if that proves
to bo a good guess there will be considerable
time for dealing with some phases of the
cattle industry. May I suggest to my honourable friend the chairman of the committee
that after prorogation ho consider ways in
which this House may be useful in carrying on
inquirics with a view to improving the state
of agriculture, and let us have some of these
ways brought to our attention in the early
part of next session.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Riley was agreed
to.
VISITING FORCES (BRITISH
COMMONWEALTH) BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
,second reading of Bill 40, an Act to make
provision with respect to forces of His Majesty
from other parts of the British Commonwealth
or from a colony when visiting the Dominion
of Canada; and with respect to the exorcise
of command and discipline when forces of His
Majesty from different parts of the Commonwealth are serving togethor; and with
respect to the attachment of members of one
such force to another such force, and with
respect to deserters from such forces.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would the right
honourable gentleman explain?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think I have
already given a brief explanation, but my
memory may be at fault. The Bill is one of
several measures which are consequential upon
the Statute of Westminster. That Statute
bas made it necessary for Canada to lay the
foundation of her law in respect of subjects
which formerly were taken care of by Jmperial enactment. The extension of this country's jurisdiction into the extra-territorial field
renders it essential that we pass a law governing the status of visiting forces of His
Majesty in Canada. As I understand it, the
effcet of this Bill will be to implement, and tie
into our own legislation, practices which have
grown up and are essential with respect to the
discipline and internal administration of visiting forces. I believe that the duties of such
forces will be exercised principally in the
matter of training, and that the Bill contemplates the interchange of officers and men
only during times of peace. To state the
limitations of the Act in another way, I would
say that there is nothing within its four
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

corners which in any way alters the fundamental necessity that this Parliament should
determine when conditions of peace exist and
when actual participation in war commences.
Authority to decide such a question rests of
course entirely in the Parliament of Canada,
and has been exercised on more than one
occasion in our history. Until this Parliament
decided upon participation in war by Canada
the provisions of the Bill would of course
apply in full; there would be no limitation to
the interchange of officers and men, nor to the
operation of any other part of the legislation.
The Act would apply to war-time conditions
if Canada again determined upon participation
in war; but only thon could the Act have
any such application. I will state the matter
in another way. The fact that the Bill provides for the interchange of officers and the
placing of Canadian rank and file under an
officer-from another part of the Empire in no
way implies that this may be donc for purposes of participation in a conflict, unless Parliament lias dealt with the subject previously
and determined that such participation should
take place. Such is the purview of the
measure, and such its very clear and definite
limitation.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Will the right
honourable gentleman enlighten the House
on an important matter? There was a
faious treaty of peace made at Lausanne
between His Majesty and Turkey, but the
Canadian Prime Minister of the time said that
this country was not invited to take part in
the making of that treaty, and did not do so.
Will the right honourable gentleman tell us
whether we are still at war with Turkey? It
is a serious question.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
rather alien to the present Bill.
Hon. Mr. CASCRAIN:

But it is

No.

Right lon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have a full
sense of my responsibili-ty and I want never
to dlimninish
Consequently I avilil rise to
its full hoig'ht and assure the honourable sonator thait we are net at w-ar wi-th Turkey.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: But we did not
take part in the Lausanne treaty of peace.
The Prime Minister of the day said that we
had nothing to do with it. When did we
get out of the war?

ut.

Right H'on. Mr. MEIGHEN:
We took
part in, and 'this Parliament raitified, the treaty
of Sèvres, which preceded the treaty of
La.usanne and terninated the war with
Turkey. I ai not aware tthat we have declared war on Turkey since.

APPdL 4, 1933
Hon. Mr. DANDURAdND:
When I read
the discussions on this Bill ini another place
I thought the measure was difficuit to understand, but since I have read it I find it fa4rly
c]ear. Trhe Bill refers only to His Mai esty's
forces when visi-bing this Dominion. TPhe word
"ivisiting" is capable of wide ap.plication, but
the riglit honourable gentleman his explained
thwt the forces fromn other parts of the Empire would not have certain .powers in tinte
of war unless our Parliament determined upon
participation. I ar n ot expeobrng that we
shahl require aid from outside forces for some
time. In spite of the view of the gallanct and
honourable senator to my right (Hon. Mr.
Casgrain) thait war will always be with us,
I believe that the Kellogg-Briand treaty,
iich we signed, will effectively di.spel any
war clouds that niay arise, and will save
future generations from -the horrors; of armed
conflicit on this continent, at ail events.
The motion wa.s agreed to, and the Bill was
read -the second time.
T.he Hon. the SPEAKER: Shahl this Bihl
be referred to Commiittee of the Whole?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If any honourable senators so desire, I shall be only too
plea.sed to have it referred to Committee of
the Whole. I was going to ask that the third
reading be set down for to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We have in this
Chamber several gallant generals who went
through the hate war. They are familiar with
the details of the Bill, and if they are satisficd with the measure, I have no amendments
to offer.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: The Bihl provides merely for the handling of troops duringý
peace tinte. The intention is that when any
Imperial troops happen to be in this country,
or any of our troops happen to be in Great
Britain or any other part of the Empire,
this Bilh shahl govern their movements.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Docs it apply
to any members of the lImperial Reserve
living in Canada?
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: I think so.
Rtiglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: There are a
number of there in this eountry.
The Bill was placed on the Order Paper

He said: Honourahie senators, the amendment is a small one. Section 10 of the Bill as
it came to us reads as follows:

APRIL 5,1933
Ottawa Citizen this morning. 1V is headed,
'Britain learns froma crash." I desire to draw
the attention of honourablo sonators to this
paragrapb:
While the United States salvages her banking and cmi-rcncy system, political and financial
Britain feels the repercussion in fresh deimands
f or nionetary reform and for stronger laws
against speculation. The lessons of the transïbtlantic l)omr of 1929 and -the crash of 1933
have been by no means le-st on British observers.
And this is tho time wben the Sonate of
Canada is thinking of passing legislation to
afford greater facilities for speculation and
ganibling!
I arn satisfied that many of the honourablo
sonators who voted for the second reading of
this measuro did not fully realize wbat they
were doing.
Some Hon. SE'NATORLS: Order.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: 1 will give my roasons.
After tho vote bad been takon, some of the
sonators told me they had voted for the Bill
bocause the Senato had rejected it Vwice and
they thouglit the Commons should got the
opportunity Vo rejeot it once. Others told me
that they did not approvo of the Bill at ah],
but they had been asked Vo vote for it and
did flot like Vo say no.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: 1 vise Vo a point of
order. Those bonourable senators must ho
named, for w-bat the honourablo gentleman has
just stated refleots on every bonourahle member of this House.
The lion. lhe SPEAKER:

Hon. Mn. PARENT:

Is V-bat n quotaition

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: If smy honourable
friend wo-uld readl the Bible a Ii'tle more
carefully, such a question would not be
necessany.
I-t is a iîme o.f unvest and strain, and theirefore not a time wlien thie Parlilament of Canadla shouid de-al lighVly witli legisiation which,

toi say 'the IcSt, is of a very dorubtful character. NoV even 'the advoocaltes of this le-gisIa&tion conitend -thiat it would promoVe honesty,
sýo.briety, -thrift. industry and fair dealing. It
would suroly have the opposite effeets. Yeît
thle Senate of Canada voted for this Bil.
I tcannot help thinking tirst àif, in the past,
as4 moceh care ha.d belon eýxercised in appointmenits -to :the Sonate as in appointments to
the Beneh, to royal commissions and to lother
semi-judicial bodies, thie Senate would by (ihis
time -occupy such a position in the country
that the people would insitinetively turn ito ifor guidance in times of stress und strain and
doubt. 1 do flot Vhink it is y-et f00 laVe. No
le,,isiative bo-dy in ttis or any other co-un'try
(an affor-d Vo itake chances with legisiativo
responsibililties.
I do nýot bear for what w'ill happen to
Canada if titis Bill pass the Senate and go
to the -Commons. 'Ph-ait body will ncot likely
make i-t law [his scssion, and may nover pass
it. This is a private Bill, and priva-te mcmibers' days in the other Houso are cxhaustýed,
there being left for the next few weeks only
two heurs a week for the consideration of such
Bis. If t'his measure is sent to the Couinons,
it wvill be placed at the foot of the Order Paper
and miay no-t e-yen be reached this session.
I oertainly ýthink, that in view o-f ail the circumstancos, this House would be wehl aidvised
to, refrain fro-m giving ithis Bill the third
readîng.

APRIL 5,1933
of them are spicy shows too-goes to the
hospitals, and that they are glad to get the
money.
Hon. J. MeCORMICK: Honourable members, I feel very strongly in this matter, and
think that I should give rny reasons for
opposing the Bill. It has been said by the
honourable gentleman from Hamxilton (Hon.
Mr. Lynch-Staunton) that unless this Bill or
something like it goes into operation the
hospitals of the country cannot be supported.
Down in my county of Cape Breton we have
sýix hospitals-one in the town I corne from,
one in North Sydney, two in Sydney, and
two in Glace Bay. Probably the employment
situation down there and the conditions surrounding the securing of funds for hospitals
or similar purposes have been as difficuit as
anywhere else. For the last three years the
maximum of employment ham been three or
four days a week in the summer, and one or
two days a week in the winter. Nevertheless
the hospitals there are stili carryjng on,
although there are not many wealthy people in
the community and the contributions corne
largely from the ordinary people.
The right honourable gentleman from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) bas referred
to the women in these commýunities. In
S *ydney Mines we have had a hospital since
1907. 1 have been a memiber of the board of
trustees since that time, and I may tell you
that the linens and bedding required for renewal purposes in that hospital are obtained
from the contributions of the people. If the
hospitals in my county, under the conditions
I have mentioned, are able to continue their
benefits to the public, I cannot in the least
understand why the hospitals in communities like Vancouver and the rich city of
Victoria should be experiencing difficulties.
The sentiment of the people there, if they do
flot assist in supporting such laudable institutions, must be very different fromn that of
the people in my part of the
country.*
Perhaps I should say that an honourable
gentleman on the other aide of the Huse
who had to leave asked me to, pair with him
on this vote; but even though. I cannot vote
I think it is my duty to give my rensons for
opposing the Bill.
Hon. G. PARENT: Honourable gentlemen, with reference to the remark of the
honourable memaber from King's (Hon. Mr.
Hughes) that if I read the Bible oftener it
would possibly bring me to his views, I desîre
to say a word or two of explanation. When
this Bill was referred to the Committee -on
Priva:te Bills everyone knew, I ithink, what the
situation was, and what was going to, be done

393

with the Bill. But I had views of my own. I
expected that we should 'have a chance of
examining it for the purpose of discovering
good reasons either to support or to defeat it.
From, the remarks of those supporting the Bill
Ifiad reoeived the impression that it was worth
while considering the advisability of drawing
from the people a little loose money for
hospitals or other charitable purposes. For
this reason I voted for the second reading,
although it was my humble opinion that -the
Bill was badly drafted, and opened the door
to such things as my honourable friend from
King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes) bas rnentioned.
For instance, trnder the Bill as presented,
every province would have the right to
estaiblish a lottery at any time, and if one
province did that and offered a certain prize,
and another province imrnediately offered a
more attractive prize. and so on, where would
it end? We should then have pure gambling,
a thing that surely appeals to nobody. Consequently the Bill was objectionable to me.
But I thought that as a resuit of our deliberations in the committee we xnight be able to
offer to the Senate and the Dominion something that would be acceptable. Apparently
we have not been able to do that. It would
be ail very well to devise, if we could, some
means of raising money for charity or
hospitals-I prefer the word "charity"ýthrough some such seheme as is proposed herg
provided there would flot be more than one
sweepstakes a year and that it would be
operated by the Dominion Government. But
I am absolutely opposed to legisîstion that
would lead to competition between the various
provinces in the sale of sweepstakes tickets
to the Canadian people.
Hon. LAWRENCE A. WILSON: Honourable senators, I rise simply to protest against
remarks that have been made bore to the
effect that lotteries mighit contaminate our
people. I have houghit thousands of tickets
for lotteries and tombolas, issued by convents
and hospitals in the Province of Quehec, and
in doing so I was undoubtedly gambling in
a small wvay. From my experionce I should
say that if we pass this Bill the bulk of the
tickets wilI be purchased by Americans, who,
as we ail know, love gambling and the turf.
They have no federal lawv such as the one
proposed here, and I arn of the op)inion that
nine-tenths of the money raised through the
sale of these tickets would corne from the
United States. We should get the benefit of
that money.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hoar, hecar.

PENITENTIARY BILL
FIRST READING

Bill 59, an Art to amvend tue Pe'niteti.ry
Mi.MeiLdiin.
Att iaIt Hon.

APRIL 6, 1933
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. S. MeLENNAN, for Hon. Mr.
Riley, moved the second reading of Bill 47,
an Act respecting the Canadian Anthracite
Coal Company, Limited.
He said: The Canadian Anthracite Coal
Company, Limited, was incorporated in 1886
with a paid up capital of $1,000,000. There
is a bond issue of $506,000. After operating
for a time the company got into financial
difficulties. A re-organization was effected and
2,944 shares were voluntarily transferred to
the company without payment.
This reorganization proved satisfactory, and the company is still operating. Within the last few
years the legality of this transfer bas been
questioned on the ground that it reduced the
capitalization of the company. The Bill contains a schedule explanatory of what was
done. I understand that the Department of
the Secretary of State bas no objection te
the passage of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO STANDING COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN moved that the
Bill be referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I had
expected this Bill te be referred te the Conmittee on Miscellaneous Private Bills. If the
motion were put in that form, I would merely
call attention te the main clause of the Bill,
which seems te be the ratification of a contract, and suggest that the committee te which
it is referred should consider the question of
its constitutionality. The Bill bas come from
the Commons, and nay have been thoroughly
reviewed before being passed upon there; but
if this feature bas net been very carefully
looked into, I think it ought te be.
The Bill was referred te the Standing Comnittee on Miscellaneous Private Bills.
CRIMINAL CODE (OFFENSIVE
WEAPONS) BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 53, an Act te amend the
Criminal Code (Offensive Weapons).
Hon. L. MeMEANS:
Honourable senators, I should like te point out that this Bill
contains a new section, No. 118, which it is
proposed te put into the Criminal Code, and
which te my nind is very objectionable. It
says:

Every one is guilty of an indictable offence
and liable to imprisonment for not less than
one year nor more than five years who, not
having a permit in Form 76, has upon his
person elsewhere than in his own dwelling
house, shop, warehouse, counting-house, or
preinses, or is carrying concealed upon his
person or in any vehicle under his control or
of whici be is an occupant, a pistol, revolver
or other firea.rm capable of being concealed
upon the person.
This means, as I read it, that any man who is
in possession of a revolver or a pistol, no
matter how innocently, must go to jail for one
year. I think, it bas always been the practice
to allow the magistrate or the judge who tries
a criminal case to exercise a certain discretion.
I can quite conceive of a man or a boy having
a pistol or a revolver in his possession quite
innocently, not knowing what the law is.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

That is no excuse.

I know it is not.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
But it is not just that a man should go to
jail for a year simply because he lias a revolver
in his possession. He may have picked it up
on the street. It does seem to me that the
penalty is exceedingly severe, and that the
trial judge should have the right to exercise
his discretion in the matter.
The purpose of this provision is te prevent
the carrying of firearms. I quite agree that a
man who is purposely carrying a concealed
weapon, and who is connected with robbery
or house breaking, or whose reputation is bad,
should go to the penitentiary for five years.
If that sort of thing is prevalent, an example
must be made of someone.
One of the difficulties that I foresee is that
this law is net generally known. The other
day, when it was discussed in the other House,
a great many of the members were astonisbed
to discover that they were liable under the
criminal law for certain things they had done.
Perhaps they had given an air pistol to a boy
who was under sixteen years of age. Even
they did net know what the law was.
I am net urging that the carrying of concealed weapons should go unpunished, but I
think some discretion should be allowed te
the judge or magistrate who tries the case of
a man or boy who innocently happens te have
a weapon in bis possession. How are the
people in the north country te know about
this law? I think that if the words relating te
one year's imprisonment were struck out the
section would accomplish the purpose. The
penalty of five years in the penitentiary would
remamn.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The honourable
gentleman seems te be well posted on this
subject. Is there anything in the law te
prevent people from selling firearms?

Hon. Mr. CASOHAI-N: Second-baud dealers?
Honi. Mr. MeoNIEANS:
Oh, yes. The Act
says that a dealer must bave a permit; also
tint the purchaser must bave a permit. WVo

arn a littie afraid of legislation like this,
whicb., as the honourable gentlýeman from
Winnipeg points out, deprives the magistrate
of discretion. Perhaps an improvemnent migbit
be made by stiking out the words "less than
one year nor," and leaving persons convicted
under this section "hable to imprisoient for
not more than five years" etc., in the diseretion of the magistrate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I understand the law to be that even where a

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: I have that
on the authority of the Minister of Justice.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I was looking for that law and could not find it.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD:
I should like 'ýo
ask the ilight bonourable leader if -lbe interprets the latter part of the pyroposed new
section 118 to mean that it will be an offence
to carry in a vehicie a flrearm whicbi is not
concealed. The section says:
IEveiyone is guilty .
.who
. . . is carrying
concealcd npon his person or~ in anv, vebiele
iinder bis control . . . a pistol. revolver or other
firearni capable ot being eoncealed upon the
person.
Now, does that mean a weapon which is concealed in any vehicle?
Rigbit Hon. Mr. MEIGREN:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: It looks to me as
if under a strict interpretation of that section
a man who was carrying a shotgun openly in
a vehicle would be guilty of an offence.
Rigit, Hon. Mr. MFIGHEN: I tbink the
weapon miust be cosscoahd, whether upon the
owne-'.s person. or in the vebiie l nder bis
control, to bring him within the laist part, of
section 118. In tlbe first part of the section.

is not an ingredient of the offence. If bie

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
I ar n ot
speaking as a lawyer, but 1 think it is a sounel
principle of legisiation that a too dýrastie law
defeats itselIf. If tbis Bill is enacted in its
present form, a magi-strate, being convineed
that tbe person before bim, accused of carrying concea.led weapons. bad no tbougbt of
wrongdoing, is more likely to discharge the
accused than to, find bimi guilty and impose
a sentence of "not less than one year or more
tban five years." I bave always contcnded
that -many a man charged with murder would
have been found guilty by the jury but for
the fact tbat they knew such a verdict would
inevitably involve a sentence of death. I
amn convinced that if you deprive the mag-istrate of 'all discretion in dealing with cases
tbat nmay arise under tbis measure, the law
will be too stringent and its purpo.se will be
defeaited.
Rigbt Hon. MWr. MEIGH.EN:
I do not
find that the point was discu.ssed bcfore the
Bill reacbed this Housie. I would suggest
that the Conimittee rise and report progres-,.
for I sbould like to give sorne further consideration to it. Were the minimum penalty
a montb, I sbould bave no doubt as to its
ieasgonableneas,, but it is a serious matter to
make it compuhsory on the part of the magistrate to impotse a minimum ýsentence of twelve
rnontb<' inmprisonmcent. As tbe right bonourable senator frorn Eganx ilie (Rigbýt Hon. Mr.
Grabam) bas said, s.ucb a drastic law ivould
probably result in acquittaIs in aIl cases wberc
the magi.strate did not find it in bis conscience
to sentence the accused to jail.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
It bias been suggeoted ta me tlint this case migbt arise under
section 122. Two men pairticipate in an
a.rmeil robherv.
One bas upon bis person a
concealeéd weapon; tbe other bas an ordinary
rifle, and actually bolds up the victim. Would
tbe section apply to the man witb the rifle?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
The section says,
",or any flrearm." Surely a rifle is a fircarmi.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Section 122 reads as
f ollows:
Every one wbo bias upon bis person a pistol,
revolver or any firearni capable of being
concealedThat is the -point. A rifle is not capable of
being concea.led.
-- on the person wbile c)mmitting, any criminal
offence of wbjubcl be is convicted. shaîl receive
a sentence of two years in addition to the
sentence iniposed in respect of tbe offence aforesaid of wbich lie is convjctedl.
In the case I bave mentioned, on conviction
would tbe man wbo bad tbe concealed wea-Pon

PRIVATE BILL

upon his person get two years more than the
man who had the rifle?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, for the
reason that the man who had the rifle had
given visible warning to the authorities during
the whole length of his journey to the scene
of the robbery. He had shown right in the
open what weapon he carried, and anyone
who cared could have taken into account the
fact that that man was carrying a rifle. This
section is intended to get at the fellow who
conceals his weapon, and who therefore may
be considered to be intent on committing a
much more serions offence than the fellow
who parades the streets with a rifle in his
hand.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: We will suppose these
two men are in an automobile, and the rifle
is concealed-it is not scen.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Then the
owner is guilty under section 118, because a
rifle is capable of being concealed in an automobile.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The section says,
"capable of being concealed upon the person."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
not guilty under section 118.

Then he is

lon. Mr. GORDON: In that case, on conviction. the man who had the revolver gets
two years more than the man who bad the
rifle?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The judge
can adjust the sentences. The purpose of this
section is to get at the man who is concealing
bis weapon.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Then, am I to understand that the man carrying the rifle may get
as long a sentence as the other fellow?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. The
judge would be able to adjust it, if he thought
fit.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I think the honourable senator from Nipissing (Hon. Mr.
Gordon) would have made out a better case
if he had referred to a man carrying a sawedoff shotgun, for such a man is the worst kind
of potential killer. I wonder if he would be
deailt with under section 118.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

SECOND READING

Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH moved the second
reading of Bill 49, an Act respecting a certain
patent application of Fred Charles Fantz.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Explain.
Hon. Mr. GRIFSBACH: It has been
recently discovered that some years ago someone omitted to pay a patent fee of $20. The
pa.ssing of this Bill is desired in order to restore the patent. The Bill carries the usual
safeguarding clause, and I am satisfied that
the Standing Committee on Private Bills could
deal with this measure most effectively.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: What does the patent
cover?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It has to do with
return bends.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

READING-DEBATE

ADJOURNED
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN moved
the second reading of Bill 58, an Act to amend
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: What is the
purpose of the Bill?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Its purpose is
te deal with the funds received from several
of the provinces by virtue of agreements made
between thcm and the Dominion for the services of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
in place of the provincial police. The
moneys are received twice a year and amount
annually to about 8800,000. The Bill provides that as these moneys come in they may
be utilized for the support of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police. Difficulty has
arisen as to the use of these moneys before
they have taken their place in the Consolidated Revenue Fund and become immediately subject to specific votes. This is the
main feature of the Bill. It enables funds
which aire obtained for the services of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police to be used
for the purposes of the force. Provision is
also made for the disposition of the proceeds
of all forfeitures in the hands of member s of
the force.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
portion do the provinces pay?

What

pro-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Apparently it
depends upon the extent of the services. The

APRIL 6, 19,33
several agreements require the following payments: frorn Alberta, M25,000; from Saskatchewan, $175,000; from Manitoba, $125,000;
from Nova Scotia, 8150,000; from New Brunswick, $100,000, and from Prince Edward, Island,
$15,000. Those are the receipts referred to in
the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: This Bill, as
described by the right honourable leader of
the House (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), is to
obviate the neenessity of asking Parliament. to
vote certain sums before they are expended?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I presume
that must be the purpose. I have read the
discussion in the other House, and it is none
too clarifying. The vote o.f Parliament is
necessary in order that the fees as they corne
in may be expended.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That would
be my understanding of the Bill. The situation lias changed very rapidly. At one time
the Mounted Police force was under the
Defence Departmcnt and I was wrongful'y
the head of it, for the force should not have
been under that department. Subsequently it
was placed un-der the authority of the Justice
Department. In deference to the dernands of
the provincial authorities, who objected
st.rongly to the number of Mouinted Police
in their territory, the force was considerably
reduced. I did nlot agree with the attitude
of the provinces at the timne, because I always
bad a very high opinion of the efficiency of
the Mounted Police. 0f late years there lias
been a change of sentiment, and at the request
of the provincial authorities the Mounted
Police have very largely taken over the work
of the provincial police. For instance, in the
(ity of Montreal the Mounted Police to-day
are to a rnarked degree discharging the duties
that it seems to me should be discharged by
the city police force.
Is this proposed legislation another indication of the tendency that under present conditions is grnwing up, to lay upon the shoulders
of the Dominion mýany burdens that we used
to think should be borne by the provinces
and municipalities?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: I do not
think so. I thînk the provincial authorities
pay in full for what they get.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.- 1 have referred
ta the change in sentirnt. To-day it is generally conceded that the Mounted Police are
doing very good work and are a great aid ta
the provincial authorities. I arn strongly of
the opinion that the provinces shoiild pay in
full for such aid, and thst the federal authority, no matter what legisiation rnay be en-

401

acted, should nlot be dTawn. into paying further
buis that under the constitution are a charge
upon the provinces.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I think the riglit
honourable gentleman is under somne misapprehension as to the exact situation. Primarily
the duty of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police is ta enforce federal legislation throughout the whole Dominion.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Is that not
the duty of the provinces?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No. The provinces enforce the criminal law, but apart from
that federal statutes are enforced by the
Mounted Police. I refer ta the enforcement
of legislation with respect te srnuggling,
traffic in narcotic drugs, immigration, and
naturalization. as fully set out in the Mounted
Police report.
In 1917 the Moun-tcd Police felI away in
strcngth, and the Federal Government ca.lled
upon the Governrnent of Alberta ta police the
province. Prior to that time, fromn the early
days, the Mountcd Police had been policing
the Province of Alberta. In 1917 that province established its own police force, and the
Mounted Police withdrew frein the enforcement of the criminal law and the statutes of
Alberta. To-day they enforce the crirninal
law and provincial statutes only in those provinces which have en-tered into agreements for
that purpose with the Feideral Governmesxt.
Such agreements now exist between the Federal
Governrnent and the provinces of Alberta,
Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and the three
Maritime Provinces. In Ontario, Quebec and
British Columbia the Mounted Police are engaged in enforcing only f ederal statutes, and
have nothing ta do with provincial or municipal policing. They do, however, maintain
roeserves. Ini the Province of British Columibia
they have, if my recollection serves me, sorne
350 meni. Vancouver being a seaport town,
and regard being had for public security, a
large body of men is kept there.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I rise with a good deal
of hesitation ta ask whether it is 9pecified in
this Bill where the money that is paid by the
provinces is ta go.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I thought it had been
the practice for it ta go into the Consolideted
Revenue Fund.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That has been
the practice.
Hon. Mr. FORKE: I understand. that during
the debate in the othea, House the Minister

of Ju4ice said there was authority in the
stattîte with regard te peace, order and good

that hie withdrew the clause from this Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I do flot quite
agree with the honourable senator. The lionourable gentleman be-hind me (Hoo,. Mr.
Griesbach) rather confuses mie. Hie seems to
insist that the Bill which I have is different
from his. In my eopy the explanlation, which
I gave in fuller terms, appears on the right
hand page. Apparently I hav~e a more moder'n
explanation sheet than is appended to the
Bill that other honourable gentlemen have.
1 will read the explanation:
Section 5 ef the Roy aI Canadian M-Nouiited
Police Act, as amended by section 1 of chapter
Il et the statutesl of 1931, at present reads as
follews:"5. (a) The Goveinor iii Council may, fromi

et the' Senate, and which. I need net read.

probe into the Abitibi purchase by the On-

APRIL 6, 1933
tario Governmcnt, and mentions the namne off
the riglit honourable the leader of this House.
1 feel that it is due not o-nly to the right
honourable gentleman himself, but also to this
Bouse, that he should be allowed to give an
explanation. In calling bis attention to tfhis
matter I think I may dlaim. that it is nlot
donc with any desire whatever to embarrass
the rîght honouraible gentleman. -I *hink he
knows the hýigh regard in which I hold him.
I rise merely to bring the matter to thc attention of the Senate in order that both the
right honourable gentleman and the Senate
itself may be put in a proper light.
Righit Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I do not resent in the least
the Temarks off the honourable senator from
Lonidon (Hon,. Mr. Little) on the question
of privilege which he has raised, nor the fact
that hle has taken occasion to make thero.
On the contrary, I arn so far from resenting
what hie has said that I thýink I should express
appreciation off the teris in which, he introduced the subjeet and, put bis question to
me.
Honourable members, no doubt, have rend
much in late wceks off subI ects that oircle
around the Governm.ent cf Ontario and the
Hydro-Electrie Power Commission of Ontario,
in regard to which there has been considerable discussion involving my naine, in a
measure, for seine weeks past. Ordinarily, on
a matter such as this, in whàch my own conduet as a public servant is called in question,
I should like my position to be put before
bhe public gencrally, and particularly before
thie Bouse, off which I arn a member, wit'h
that care and accuîracy which verbal preparatjen alone ean ensure. But, as bhc subject is
now launched, 1 do not tjhink I should delay
a moment in making such a statement as will
constitute a reasortably complete exposition
off the question put before me by bhe honourable senator ffrom London. Before going
furbhcr let me say it is aippropriate that this
body should be the firsb to be addressed on
any question affecting the integrity or reputation off one off its members. 1 know that if
a subject off this koind had te do with any
other honourable memnber be would feel, as
I do, that it was more manly te have it
brought up in his presence, where he. would
be on a level wibh his accuser, or at all events
his questioner, than to have this donc behind
the privileged doors off anothier assembly,
where he had not a very good opportunity to
test its merits on the spot.

distance baek, and I arn in some doubt as
to just how far it is necessary to go to

volved sufficiently elear, and their application
sufficiently definite.
The Ontario Power Service Corporation was
inicorpurated by the Abitibi Company soe
years ago, probably about 1929, and ail its
stock was owned., as I understand, by that
company. It was incorporated for the purpose of developinq power ýat the Abitbibi
Canyon .by an expenditure of a large amount
of money, and the Hydro-Electr-ic PQwer
Commission, long before I was a meinber
bhereof, made a contract for the taking off a
certain quant4ty of its product--88,000 horsepower the first ycar, that is, 1932, with an
increase of 3,000 eaeh year for three or four
years, until a total of 100,000 horse-power was
reached. This contract was made on the
responsibility, not off tbe Hyd.ro-Eleetrie
Power Commission, but of the Government of
the province, because of the view of that
Governient that the projct was a useful
and desirable one, was worthy of encouragement, and nccssary for the developinent of
Northern Ontario. I emphasizc that from thc
commencement, in so far as the public off
Ontario had any connection with the enterprise, it was not through. any commission off
any kind, but through those who alone, could
represent the people-the Government off that
province. The responsibility was entirely
theirs, and the method of co-operation wae
theirs.
1 became a menter of the Hydro-Electric
Power Commission in June of 1931. The
contraet lied been made, 1 ithink, approximsitely a year and a ia~ilf before. Promn the
time 1 bemen a monter off the Commission,
in the month of June, 1931, up tilI now, the.re
never has been a single moment when any
maitter affectinig the securities off that conipany werc in the slightest or remotest degree
wvithin the disSicn or bhe disposition of the
Hydro-Electrie Power Commission off onebario.
'I hope honourable members wi1l appreciaite
the wholee meaning and significance of lihet
sentence, for by the effeot enibraoed in, and
indeed constituting the who,e meaining of,
that sentence, the entire issue is to be Muged.
There never was a time when under any rule
cvetr aipplied, or, so far a.s I know, ever euggcsted, in British or Canadian public life-or
in -bhe public life of eny civilized land-there
was any restiction, iaposed on me, eiite
personally or in any capacity, beonuse of my
membership in the Hydro-Electrie Commission, in purchasing any of the secunities of
the Ontario Power Service Coimpany.
The matter was ffie brought to public
attention by a question -in the Ontaaio legijslature. Quite evident.y the purpose off the
question was to impute be me somne misconducb

404

SENATE

because of my inemlxbership in that Commissgion. I im.mediatel * intimated to the Premier
of the province that the companies withi
which I had some connection-being chairmnan of the boards and a-socint.ed withi the
managemeant of thirec of thero, ail menitioned
in thc queqtion to which 1 have referredwere as face as any companies in Canada, to
purchase those seuiisat
any time.
I
furtiber statied that if any misconduet was
,nttributed t.o me I desired that he immediýately
promise -to anyone alleging such miscoanduct
the fulle2t investigation without a moment's
delay, and undeortook thait I would be present
]mmediately on -the morn of the o>peniing of
t bat investigation.
Some speeches wü-re made afterwards, and
t bey resulted in a repetition of the request
on my part. Subsequently a statement was
made in the Legisiature by the Premier of
t he province, a full text of which statement
I hav e not been able to read or to obtain.
1 feel that sorne otber miatters beyond those
embraced within the statement ýo far as
reported are worthv' of being called to the
iuttention of fui.s House, and I shall speak
of them now. Io commnencing to do so I
want 10 repvat that 1 occupied no fiduciary
relationship wliatev er wvitIî respect te any of
the securities of the comnpanv or to the company itseif, nor w'as I ce er in a position to
obtain, nor did 1 ex er obtain. any information
ývliatte\-er relativ e to the conlpany or its bond
i-silo that was not av ailable at the same time
to ail the publie of tîjis or any other country.
In so far as the project was other tban a
purely priý-ate projeet. il Ivas an affair of the
Government of Ontario and not of the HydreElectrie Power Commission.
Parentbetically, perhaps I sbould say tbat
the Hydro-Electrie Power Commission of
Ontario is not onlv distinct from, but it does
flot act as trustec of, the Government, of
that province. It aets as trustee of the owners
of the properties wvhich it manages, those
owners being the municipalities embraced
within its; system. Appointments to tbe Commission are madie by the Government because
the Government bias acted as banker, and
only as banker, in providing the funds for thpe
purebase of properties and, in the initial stages,
for, necessary financing. These funds are being
repaid from lime to time and thc Commission
is amply able to make the repaymcnts as
tbey become due. The Commission is completely distinct from and independent of, and
is not in any sense wbatever, any deipartment
of government.
As thc projeet was nearing completion in
the spring of 1932, the Abitibi Company, the
Right Hon. Mr. NIEIGHEN.

parent company, which hiad by contract undertaken to supply the rest of the funds necessary to the comnpletion, found itseif unable t0
complY xvitli requirements embodied in tbat
obligation. The Government of Onitario, as
a matter of policy-tbe merits of whicb are
no eneerfi at all in the present issue, and the
good faith and wisdom of wbicb I not only
cast no aspersion on, but, were it proper at
this time to do so. I think I should be able
to commend-in the exercise of its discretion,
and its alonc, decided te intervene in the
enterprise, to make it a governmental enterprise rather than permit it 10 fall mbt the
band,, of others. The idea of the members of
the Cox ernment doubtless wvas that it was
their duty to sec to it that o power monopoly
xvas establi4îed in Northern Ontario. They
set themsclves thie task of negotiating for the
purchase of bonds as a preliminary and
essential stop 10o the acquirement of the
property. That was the responsibi1ity of tbc
Administration; it was in o rense, in no
degree and in no way whatever, however remnote, thc re-ponsibility of the Hydro-Electrie
Power Commission. Negotiations then proceeded between the Government of Ontario,
on the ono hand, and on the other certain
representatives of the bondholders, in the
eboice of whom neither I nor any one of
our, companies was even rcquested to express
an opinion. How anynne could imagine-Il
mean, in gond faitb-tbat 1 would bc a partY
to the negotiations, I am at a loss 10 understand. Not only wvas 1 ont a party, but I
had no knowledge whatever, beyond what was
given bo the public thrnugh, the press, of the
progress of those negotiations.
Those negotiations wcre concluded, I think,
towards the end of July or the beginning of
August, and tbe terms werc announced and
made known to the public. After this publie
announcement was made, and when any person
who ýdesired to do so could, by mercly making
an actuarial calculation, determine the value
of the securities which were to be exchangcd
for new securities, thc Governroent of the
Province of Ontario askcd the Hydro-Electric
Power Commission to 'be its agent in the
acquirement of tbc property, but wholly on
the responsiýbility, present and ultimate, of
the Goveroment of Ontario. In a word, the
Commission became a conduit pipe after the
determination of the value. But neither before nor after that determination did the Com-

mission ever have the slightcst discretion, or
ever approach tbe point where it would have
a discretion, tbe exercise of which would
affect the value of the securities in any way
at ail. We had a contract which was entcred

405

APRIL 6, 1933
into sorne years before and had to be obeyed
and lived up to, just as the Government of
Canada bas to live up to its obligations to
pay its Victory bonds, but we were neyer in
any area where there was any discretion that
could corne before us, nor have we ever since
been in any such area. I mean a discretion
affecting the value of the bonds.
I think I bave gone far enough to show
that there was no0 discretion within the ambit
of the Hydro-Electric Power Commission,
that there was no information whatever within
my reach which was not available to everybody, that I was in no fiduciary position at
ail with relation to the securities, and finally
that the whole enterprise, above and beyond
its purely private purposes on the part of
the Abitibi Company, was the affair of the
Governmcnt of the Province of Ontario and
of no0 other man or body whatever.
I do not think that honourable members
of this House would wish to be accused of
holding an opinion that it is per se reprehensible to purchase and pay good money for
securities of a Canadian company engaged in
a legitimate and important business. There
may be circumstances under which a person
holding public office should not make such a
purchase, or, if he does, should not continue
to bold such securities, but such circurnstances
could arise only when by virtue of bis office
be was in a position to exercise some discretion or to take some action affecting the
value of the property he beld.
It may be worth while-thougb by no0 means
relevant-to add that neither myscîf nor the
companies referred to in this statement made
on the whole more than the return of the
money invested and reasonable interest. My
share in the companies was a fraction of one
per cent.
1 have lived among my colleagues bere and
taken part in the public if e of this country
for very many years. I do not think that
an accusation involving wrongdoing bas been
hurled at me, even indirectly, and certainly it
bas not been 'by anyone associated with me on
the side of the House on wbîch I happened
to sit, or the other. And if there is at this
moment on1e tbing in wh'ich I can take sorne
pleasure it is the fact that be who bas specially taken it upon bimself to play the role
of accuser in the present case is not on1e wbomn
1 know personally at ail. From. the first initimation of this matter 1 have been ready,
and more than ready, to submit my conduct
to any tribunal that may be chosen, to be
judged by the best standards of British publie
service-by its severest standards, if you will
--and before that tribunal I shaîl rejoice to
meet my accuser.

CRIMINAL CODE (OFFENSIVE
WEAPONS) BILL
FURTHER CONSIDERED

IN COMMITTEE

The Senate again went into Comrnittee on
Bill 53, an Act to amend the Criminal
Code (Offensive Wcapon).-Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen.
Hon. Mr. McLennan in the Chair.
On section 1, new section 118--having or
carrying a pistol oT revolver witbout a
permit:
Right Hlon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Honouýra-ble
members, at the last sitting the Commibtee
deliberately rose and reported progress
because of the objection raised by the bonourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
McMeane), strongly su.pporrted by the right
honourable gentleman frorn Eganville (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham), to the minimum penalties whicb are fixed in this Bill for the
two major offences. I bave since been able
to give consideration to these objections. The
argument supporting thern strikes me as
vcry foi'cible indeed, and I amn prepared to
aecept an amendment striking out the minimum penalty and leaving the extent of the
penalty, subject to the maximum, wholly in
the discretion of the court.
After reading
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the discussion on this clause I thought that
sucb an amendment as is now suggested
would perhaps be advisable; so I fully agree
witb my rigbt honourable friend's proposaI. I
do not suppose be will move it. I would,
bowever, suggest this pbraseology:
Every one -is guilty of an indictable offence
and hiable to imprisonment for a ter-m not
exceeding five years...
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Leaving out
the words "niot less than, one year"?
I move
Hon. Mr. LYNOH-STAUNTON:
to strike out the words "less tban on1e year
nor."

SENATE
Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is not, the
of the honourable gentleman
sugg-estion
rather
Mr. Dandurand)
opposite
(Hon.
hetter? It is, as 1 understand it, to strike
out the words "nlot less than one year nor
more than," and to substitute the words
"% termi fot exceeding."
The CHAIRMAN:
It
is moved
and
scconded that the words "nlot less than one
vear nor more than" he struck out, and the
words "a terni not cxceeding- five years" be
substituted.
The proposed amcndmcnt was a.-reed to.
Hon. Mr. LYNýCH-STAUNTON:
Now, I
wish to eall attention to the word "concealed"
in lino 13. The Bill says the penalty may be
impo..ed against a person ivho is carrying
'ceoncealed upon his person or in any vehlicle
iinder ]lis onfi'ol or of which he is an onrîupant, a pi.,4ol, revolv~er or other firearm capable
of being conceaded upon the person." In the
first place, so far as~ that section is concerned,
a man could quite lawfully carry a revolver
at night. There is no need to conceal it then.
Furtiiormoro, there is many a revolver I have
on(, myself whica cala hc almost cox ered by
tlae hand.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
shooter.

Tlaat is a pea-

lion. Mr.
LYN"CH-STAUNTON:
The
cLusze should read, "carrying upon lais person
or in any vehicle limder bis control or of
which ho is an occupant, a pistol, revolver or
othier firearm capable of hcing concealed upon
1 qubmit 'tha-t that is the only
tlc ern"
Most
h)iop( r way to amend this section.
1people who carry revolvers carry tileul ot
nig-ht. A man could walk along the street in
I lie ilaytimo earrying a revolver in bis laand.
The weapon is so small that nohody would
îaotie if.. Ho coîîld carry it witb the barrel
in bis band and the rest of it up lais sleeve.
,ind it would nlot ho "ç,onceoled." The word
I«conccaled" will ho construed hy tlac courts as
appyin to a revolver that is out of sight,
and noÎtof a revolver that bv n careful look
eould ho seen. I think that the wlaole section
is rendered nugatory by the insertion of the
woýrd "coneealed." The Act is predicated upon
the assumption tlaat the carrying of lethal
weoapons without a permit is objectionable and
should ho discouraged and prevented. Now,
no person slaould bave tbe riglat to carry a
revolver or any we'apon wbicla is capable of
being concealed, unless lae bas a permit. I
i lerefore move that the word "concealed" in
]iîae 13 of pagç 1 of the Bill he strieken out.
Hon. Mr. LYXCH-STATJNTON.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But my bonourable friend will surely go furtbýer, because
tbe essence of tbe section as drafted bears on
concealment. The last words of the section
are "revolver or other firearm capable of
being concealed upon the person." My honourable friend asks, "Why should we allow
anyone to carry a firearm, concealed or not
concealed, witbout n permit?"
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
I did
not say "firearm," laccause I noticed from the
discussion in another place that the int-ention was f0 laave this section apýply only to
weapons capable of concealment upon the
person, and tlaat a sawed-off sbotg-un was included in tbat class. Burglars and hold-up
men do not go ýaround with rifles and long
guns. As the section is nimed at small
weapons, I tlaougbt we should naake it wvide
enougb to, prevent the carrying-, witbout a
permit, of any weapon wlaicb could ho conceahed on the person.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Doos the laonourable gentleman clam tbat the words "or other
firearna capable of heing concealeil upon tlae
person" refer distinctly to a small pistol or
revolver?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: That is
the way they were construed in anotlaer place,
and tha.t scems f0 nae to hoe the correct construction. I tbink that if my amendment
were adopted tlae section would cover ail the
snaall weapons tlaat can bo succesSfully concealed upon tIse poison.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I will second the
motion 10 strike out the word "concealed,"
hecause the section would ho mucha hetter
wjtbout it. But tlae discussion should not ho
confined f0 the revolver, for tlaere are many
otlaer small weopons that a man can ho laid
out with, such as daggers or hrass knuckles.
Right Hon. Mi. MEIGHEN: I shouhd like
to bear a little discussion hefore the amendnment is put. It seems to me that if the
anaendnaent wvere carried it would he easier
to obtain a conviction in cases wbere convictions; sbould be ohtained. And inasmuch
as the minimum penalty is abolished, a great
doal of the objection 10 the scope of tIse
section is overcome.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Does the
riglit laonourable gentleman approve of tbe
proposed amendment?
Riglat Hon. Mr. MEIGHE.N: I arn inclined to, but I should like to laear more
discussion.

APRIL 10, 1933
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I know that these
sections bave been pretty carefully prepared,
and that the Mounted Police have had to do
witb tbem. In the past the policy bas been
to legisîcte against concealed weapons.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Would not
any weapon be concealed on a dark nigbt?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It migbt be. But
the wbole policy of Parliament has been to
legizlate against concealed weapons. Tbe word
'.conccaled" 'bas always added a sinister significance to the charge of carrying. I ama neV
prepared to argue witb the bonourable gentleman frora Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) as to the legal effeet of tbe section in its
present form; I desire merely to suggest tbat
wc sbeuld proceed cautiously before we strike
ont a word wbicb I know is vital in this wbole
matter.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I can tell
the bonourable gentleman of a case that
bappened in the United States wbere there
was a law like this against the carrying of
concealcd weapons. A gang of mountaineers,
each armed witb pistais that bung fromn a rope
around bis body, came into a city. Tbey did
no harm, but in any event the law could no-t
get at them for the offence of carrying the
weapons, for there was no concealment; the
butta were sticking ont in plain view. It
seerns to me tbat the object bere is to prevent
the carrving of weapons by persons wbo are
not authorized to carry thera.
Mr.
Hon.. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH:
Chaanmrn, on readiing ýthe debate of aïast
Thu.ir,(Iy on 'this clause i-t ocured to me
to suggest tbait possibly a redrafting of t-he
section in twe parts mnight hielp to remeve
any doubt as to the meaning intended. Suppose ii. rend in this way:
Ev(-îy one is guiity of an indictabie offence

and liable to imprisonment for net more tban

five er wbo, net baving a permit in Forin 76,
(a) bas upon bis persen ýelsewbere than in
his own dwelling bouse, shop, warehouse,
connting-house, or premises-ilhen go to tbc end of the section-a pistol. revolver or other firearm capable
of beiuig corcealed upon the person; or
(b) who is earrying concealed upon his
person or in nny vebicle under bis control or
of wbic-b bie if an occupant, a pistoýl, revolver
or ot.ber firearm-and

etc. The word "ooncealed" might be repeated
,before the words "in any vebýicle," if concealnient in the vebicle is what is being struck
By a division of the clause into thoSe
àt.
twe parts tibere would be digtinet offesices
and each would be unmistakable.

407

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I wll ask thbe
honourable gentleman from North York
(non. sir Allen Ayleswortb) to draft the section jugt as he we.uld have At read. Then
je, would be very easy bo strike out the 'Word
"econcealed" if -we desired te do so. 1 hope
the Comrnittee will come ýto the oosslusicIL
thýat it should be struck ouft. In the meantime I suggest that we Paffs 'te the next
section.
New seotion 118, as amended, stands.
On n'cw section 119-dangerous weapons:
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Let me
direct the attention of honourable mecabers
b:
to paragraph
being an Ilien, bas in his possession any
shiot gini, rifle or other sncb firearm or any
ammunition for any sucb firearmn without
l)aving a permit in Formi 76B.
A large number of Americans come into
Ont'ario and Quebec du.ring the sb.ooting
scason and bring their guns witb them. The
railway people inform me ithet ithis provision
will embarrass the transportaiion companlies
and the incoming lalien, unless it is specifically
provided tehatt be may obfbain bds permiit from
the Customis Office-r at the point of emtry.
I desire to raise another point. I bave a
gond many American friends, sportsmen, who
have interests in sbooting clubs and go nortb
every year for the shooting season. One of
fbem bas lived in Canada for tbirty years. I
do not sec wby tbey sbould be discrimainated
againgt because tbey bave not taken out
I submit that an
naturalization papers.
American resident in this country should be
on the saine footing as a Canadian citizen in
regard to earrying firearms for sporting purposes. It seems to me tbat every man wbo
bas taken out a b'unting licence should be entitled to a free permiit to carry firearms. There
is ne reason wby -an alien sbould be discrîsainated against in this particular. We cali know
ýtbere are large numbers of respectable, trustwortby aliens resident in this country.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Tbe bonourable
member frora Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) objects to an alien sportsman being
compelled to secure a permit. Section 120
provides that permits may be granted by the
Commissioner of tbe Royal Canadian Mounted
Police, or any officer thereof duly autborized
by the Commissioner, or any person authorized by the Attorney-General of any province.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STATJNTON: Section
120 d-oe net cover this partioular permit.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It covers aIl permits. The granting of a permit for sporting
purposes is under provincial jurisdiction, and

4M5

SENATE

if a sportsman desires to enter a province to
shoot game, he is bound to ascertain the terms
under which he may do so. By section 120
any person so authorized by the AttorneyGeneral of any province may issue permits,
and these permits, I submit, cover the case
in question. I cannot follow my honourable
friend in his contention that it is sound law
to permit foreigners to carry firearms. Recently there was laid on the Table a return
showing that there are more than 529,000
aliens in this country. It is all-important in
the interest of peace, order and good government that those aliens shall not carry firearms. No police officer would approve of the
proposal that they should be exempted from
compliance with this law. As a matter of
fact, this is a police measure.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
If an
alien comes in to shoot game bas he to hunt
up an officer in order to secure a permit?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Why should he
not?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: If he is
a respectable man I dJo not sec why he should
have to do so.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: No person from the
United States can come into Nova Scotia or
New Brunswick to shoot game unless he first
gets a permit and pays his fees.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: That is
the law in all the provinces.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Then this does not
make the law any more onerous.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: A man
requiring a permit would bave to broadcast a
radio message to find where the police officer
lived.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: When he gets his
hunting licence he will find where he can secure a permit.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think if my
honourable friend will look at the opposite
page he will see that on the point in respect
of which he is objecting we are not really
changing the law.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
dicate the form.

Except to in-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I suppose a surveyor should not speak about these things.
Sone Hon. SENATORS: No.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Italians, for instance,
do not carry firearms; they carry daggers or
knives, which are much more dangerous. I
am told that coloured gentlemen carry razors.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

.Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Addressing
myself to my right honourable leader (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen), I understand that the
notes to which he bas directed my attention
do not refer to section 119; they refer to section 118.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: If the honourable
gentleman will refer to paragraph e on the
opposite page, he will find it is the old law.
It wvas passed in 1919.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If the honourable senator will read all the explanatory notes
opposite be will find that in the provision in
respect of which he is objecting to this section there is no change at all.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I have
not perused the Bill with sufficient care to
know whether that is correct. I thought it
would go bcfore a committee; so I diid not
examine it. But it does seem to me to be an
unreasonable provision.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is pretty
stingent, but the Minister of Justice advises
me that the cases are numerous calling for
some enactment such as 118, which is the new
section. He tells me that police officers
lepresent that it is important to prescribe a
very heavy penalty in respect of that offence.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
section 118.

That is

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. Number
119 is substantially the same as the old section. A change is necessitated in paragraphs
a and b because of section 118. Paragraph c
is new, and parts of paragraph d; but those
are not what my honourable friend objects to.
When we come to section 120 I shall have one
or two suggestions to make.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: My first
objection is as to the difficulty that an alien
will have in ascertaining where the necessary
permit can be obtained. He must obtain the
permit before ie comes into the country.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The parties
objecting to this legislation-I think they made
representations to my honourable friendspoke to me about it two or three times, and
wanted an opportunity to appear before a
committee. Subsequently they said they were
prepared to withdraw their objections because
they had satisfied themselves that the permit
system intended should be tried out. They
thought it would probably work successfully.
Just what the system is I do not know.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
not tell me that.

They did

APRIL 10, 1933
Right Hon. Mr. MEIýGHEN: Colonel
Thompson was speaking foi' them. I arn sure
lie would be only too glad to take the matter
up with my honourable friend. I know lie
withdrew ail objections.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Then I
do nlot press my objections.
New section 119 was agreed to.

by the Attorîîey-General of any province, may,
îîpon sufficient cause being sbown, issue a
permit in Formn 76-D to any applicant therefor,

On new section 120--persons who may issue
permits:
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIýGHEN: I do not think
it would be in order for me to move an amendment to this section; therefore I merely suggest the following:
Amend section 120 by adding to subsection 1
the words: "or for target practice in a
regalarly oraied sbooting club approved by
the Attorne-eeral of the province in which
such club is organized."
Hon. Mi'. GRIESBA'CI: ýI have an amendment whioh 1 thi.nk is somewhat better than
that, suggested. I arn approaciiing the matter
from the point of view that we have Ln Canada an organization known as the Dominion
of Canada Rifle Association. It is supported
by the Federai Govcrminent, end the various
provincial governmenits, ýthrough grancts it encourage sbooting. The Association conducts
a series of competitions for pistol or revolver
sboeLting aI over 'Canada. We have also
inilitary revolver clubs and police revolver
and pistol clubs, which of course do not require 4o be authorized, because of the nature
of their organiation. The Secre<tairy of the
Rifle Association and the President of the
Revolver Club of -Canada have spoken te me
with respect ito this Bi-1. I have prepas'ed an
ameadment which meets witih their approval,
and which I think is a sounder am-endment
than the ýone sugg-ested by the leader. I wili
read it. I have simply added t-o subsection 2
of section 120 of the Bill1.
The CHAIR MAN: Should wa nlot finish
subsection 1 first?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: You havç the
amendment before you.
The CHAIRMAN: Yours is noit an aiendment to 'the same subsection.
Hon. 'Mr. GRIIESBACH: The riglit honoumable leader btas suggest-ed an amendmen't
to thie first subsection; I propose in lieu of
that an amendment to the second. 1 would
cail it sabseotion 3, and would change the
numbers of the subsetions. Subseetion 3
would be the same as the pregent suibsection

tion.
I tihink my. aînendmenrt is superior te, fhe
other amendment suggegted, because, in the
lays upon the issuing officer the
iirst place, Lct
onus of exercising disorertion es te the individual applicant.
Hon. MT. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Is ecd
individual who goes to sboot to bave a permit?
Hon. Mr. GRIE-SBACH: Each individuai
who goas to shoot will bave to secure a permit for a pistol or revolver, and the issuing
officer will have to exercise discretion as te
wbetber or not tie applicant is deserving.
The applicant must satisfy the issuing officer

2, but witb an addition, and would. read:
The Commissioner of the Royal Canadian
Mýount-ed P>olice, or any officer thereof duly
authorized hy him, or any person authorized

as to whose discretion and good character hie is

satisfled, provided that sucli pereon is a member
in good standing of a revolver or pistol club
iccoguized by, affiliated with, or belonging to
the' Dominion of Canada Rifle Association, and
provided fýurther that sucb permit will only
entitie the applicant therefor te carry a pistol
or revolver between bis place of residence, or
business, and any place of practice or competi-

that bie is a member in good standing of a
revolver or pistol club wbich helongs to, is
recognized by, or afflliated wit~h the Dominion
of Canada Rifle Association. My proposed
amendment further provides that a person
will only be permitted to carry bis pistol or
revolver from bis place of residence or business to the place of pracýtiýce or competition.
It contains more safeguards than the other
amendment and puts the responsibility upon,

the Dominion cf Canada Rifle Association,
but it does not take away from the issuer the
responsibility of ascertaining whether the applicant is a deserving person.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
That
does not seem to be wvide enougi te cover
what is suggested hy the right honourable
leader. Ail the people who belong to sblooting
clubs could be barred out under that amendment.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: "Who bas a
permit to carry a revolver or pistol" cov'ers
the whole grouind that the bonourable gentleman proposes3 to coveýr by bis amendment.

The rigit honHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ourable gentleman (Rugit Hon. MT'. Meiglien)
bas suggested an amendment, and my hionourable friend from Edmonton (Hon. Me.
Griesbach) proposes what bie elaims is a more
comprehiensive amendment. It is for the
riglit honourable gentleman to sayHon. Mr. GRIESBAOH: As for as safeguarding tie public is coneerned, my amendment will go mueli beyond the amendment
suggested by the leader.

410
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
not cover all.

SENATE
It

will

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It covers all the
people who belong to revolver clubs or pistol
clubs.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
It does
nlot cover target praotice at any regularly
organized shooting club.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Under my amendment permits would be granted to the right
people, and to no others; and they would be
permitted to carry pistols only between their
places of residence or business and the place
of practice or competition.
Hon. Mr. BLACI: There are several rifle
associations in Canada which are not affiliated
with the Dominion Rifle Association. As I
understand this proposed amendment, members of those associations, as well as members
of clay pigeon clubs, would be barred fron
getting licences.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Thev are barred
anywav. They aire not contemplated.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They are
contemplated in the amendment I ha ve suggested.
In fact, it was maýinly on their
account that this anendment was presented.

The law, if passed in the form previously
submitted to this House, would simply allow
the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, or any officer thereof who is
duly authorized by the Commissioner, or uny
person authorized by the Attorney-General
of any province, to issue a permit in Form
76 to any person upon being satisfied that
suci person required a pistol or revolver for
the protection of life and property. The purpose of the amendment is to enable the
issue of a permit to any person upon satisfactory proof that he is getting the ýpistol or
revolver for target practice in a regularly
organized
shooting club, that is, a club
approved by the Attorney-General of the
province.
That gives the Attorney-General
the right to sav whether the shooting club
is a bona fide shootiag club of standing, and
net merely one that is being used as a mask.
The kind of shooting club I have in mind is
one such as the Toronto Revolver Club,
the principal purpose of which is to teach
its members--among whom are bank tellers
and the like-how to bandle a revolver skilfully if it should become necessary. They
say, "Don't prevent us from getting a licence
for a revolver for that purpose." Under the
amendment of the bonourable gentleman
from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) they
w'ould be debarred. Under the amendment
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

I have suggested the class that he bas in
mind would not be debarred, but would be
approved read.ily by the Attorney-General of
the province.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The class I have
in mind would be admitted under the suggested amendment of the rigbt honourable
gentleman, but his amendment, I submit,
would open wide the door; it would include,
as the bonourable gentleman from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Black) says, the members
of a shot-gun club who shoot at clay pigeons.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Why would
a mai want a permit for a pistol or a revolver
at a shot-gun club?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
His purpose
would bc to defeat the law and get a licence
for a revolver. My amendment proposes to
put pistol shooting in Canada under the
authority of the Dominion of Canada Rifle
Association, which is a large and responsible
organization. I submit that the amendment
proposed by the right honourable gentleman
is too wide in its scope. After all, this is
a police measure. The police are desirous of
limiting the number of persons who may
have pistols and revolvers, and of ensuring
that they are respectable, reliable and trustworthy people.
I submit that under the
amendment proposed by the right bonourable
gentleman a mian could allege that he was a
member of a gun club, and, if the AttorneyGencral approved of that gun club, that man
would be entitled to a permit for a pistol.
Under the amendment that I propose, the
individual has to satisfy the issuing officer
that he is a proper person to bave a revolver;
then lie bas to show that lie belongs to a
pistol club which is recognized by or affilýiated
with the Dominion of Canada Rifle Associatien; then, having done these things, and
having secured a permit, he is allowed to
carry the pistol or revolver covered by his
permit only from his place of residence or his
place of business to the place of practice or
competition. I submit that my amendment
narrows the class of persons who may secure
permits, but makes it possible for men who
ought to be encouraged to shoot to secure
them. It excludes not only the individual
who tries to come in by some side wind, but
also the individual who wants to carry a
pistol on all occasions.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
about the bank clerk?

What

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: He must join a
pistol club or apply for a permit under subsection 1. on the ground that he requires a
pistol for the protection of life or property

APRIL 10, 1933
Surely a banker can apply for and secure a
permit for a pistol to proteet life and
property. He does not have to belong to any
club at aIl.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: He could
not use it to practise.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: H1e would go to a
shooting gallery and practise.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTOiN: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: If he does flot belong to
a club hie cannot get a permit.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: There is nothing
in that argument at alI. The man has a
permit te carry a pistol for the protection cf
life and property, and he can go to any
shooting gallery and practise.
lon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Where is
there provision for that?
Hon. Mr. GRIEýSBACH: Mention the law
that prevents it, once hie bas a permit. Show
it teo me.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: The honourable
gentleman has just said that the man must
belong to a club before hie can do any
practising.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I have said nothing of the sort. I ask anyone te show me
anywhere in this Bill a provision wbich prevents bim from practising if hie bas a permit.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: It says hie
may bave a pistol or revolver for the purpose of protecting life and property. That
must mean that hie can use it only for that
purpese. His permit will state that it ýisonly
for that puropse that hie is allowed to carry
it. I think the suggestion cf the rîght hioncurable leader is the preper one.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I amn satisfied that
bis amendment is net seund. I wculd ask that
this sýection be reserved and that the leader
take occasion to submit the matter to the
Mcunted Police officers who are in charge cf
the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have already
submitted the suggestion te the Minister cf
Justice, who is in charge cf the Police, and
hie bas agreed te it.
It dees net seema te me that men, in order
te get permiuts, should have te allege that they
want revolvers fer the immediate protection
cf life and property. There axre -thoee who say
frankly, "We are members cf a revolver club,
and ve~want them for praýctice." Why sbould
we say tc therr, "We wiIl not lot you do that
unless your club joins the Dominion Rifle
Association"?
Surely when the Moun-ted

411

Police are convinced of the bona fides of a man
who says hie wants a revolver for practioe in
a revolver club which is recognized by the
Attorney-General of the province, that should
be sufficient. It should not be necessary for
bim to join the Dominion Rifle Association.
1 was going to suggest that we word the
amendment thýis way: "or for target practice
in a reguifarly organi7ed shooting club approved by the Attorney-GeneraAl cf the province"-I hardly know how to, word the rest of
it.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON :-"'in which
the applicaýnt resides." The Attorney-General
will not give bis approval te any club outside
of bis own province.
Hon. Mr.
DANDURAND :-"organized
within his own province."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: That is the
first suggestion. We might say, "approved by
the AtLorney-Generad of the province in which
such club i.s organized."
Hon. Mr. GRIESBAGH: Will you say
(.pistol or revolver shooting club"?
Right Hon. Mr. MEI-GHEN: Perhaps that
wvould do.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Any gun club is a
shooting club,
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It would be
difficult to convince anyonie that you wanted
a pistol oïr revolver at a gun club. It would be
absurd.
The propoeed amendment was ngreed to.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACHI: Form 76 is for
the protection of life and property. You will
have te have a newv form for pistol praotice.
Riglh-t Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN - Well, we
could get over rfihe diffioulty by adding to
Ferm 76, where it appears in this Bill, the
words "or for target pracetice." We shail orne
to, that shortly.
Subseotion 1, as artnended, was agree4l te.
Subsection 2 was agreed. to.
On subsýection 3-duration:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I mýove t'hMî
the word "in" in line 28 be charnged to "f-or,"
to makze the phrase read "d'uring the calendar

The aimendmjent was agreed rtc, and suhsection 3, as amended, was ag'reed to.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would this section permit the disarming of one who bas a

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Yes. He

New section 127 was agreed to.
New sections 128 and 129 were ngreed to.
On section 2-permits cancelled:
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON'': What is
the abject of this?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: To make permits that have been issued heretofore of no
value.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Burt the
permits have been issued by duly constituted
authority. Many persons who have sucli permits will flot know that the law is changed
and their permits are cance'lled. Surely a
permit should be allowed to run its term.
Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not know
that permits had terms.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I do flot
know that either. But some persons may be
placed in an awkward position through this
section.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn under the
impression that the object of this section is
to enable the new authorities to keep a record
of the permits issued.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Well,! the
holders of existing permits should be notified.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: In the past a
large number of officiais coiuld issue permits.
For instance, the Chief of Police in any emaTi
commumity h-ad such power. I can quite Se
that in making a .fresh staSt of this kind it
would be desirable to cancel adl permuta
previously issued.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: WeR, the

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: That is

The amendment was agreed to, and section
3, as amended, was agreed to.
On section 4--coming into force:
Hon. M.r. DANDURAND:
IV may be
neceesarv Vo examine this section in relation
to the new section 120.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do noV think
this section 4 covers the difficulty that was
raised by the honourable senator from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton), and I suggest that the section stand. It is possible that
when we are dealing with this matter again an
amendment rnay be moved to new section
119,' anent the comment thereon by the
honourable senator from Hamilton. We may
adopt an amendment, even though the present
section is, I understand, acceptable to the
railways.
Section 4 stands.
On section 1, new section 118--having or
carrying a pistol or revolver without a permit:
Right Hou. Mr. MEIGHEN: 1 move that
we now return to new section 118 for further
consideration, as the honourable senator from
North York (lion. Sir Allen Ayleswortb) bas
prepared the form whieh lie suggests the section should take.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH:- After
looking over the Bill as it came from the
other House, and reading the discussion in the
Senat-e last week, I was under the impression
that what the propoeed new section 118 was
striking ait was the carrying of a concealed
weapon, and therefore when I was speaki2g a
few minutes ago I suggested a redraftiag of
the section, retaining the word "concedied."
But I undeq-stan now that the sense of the
Committee is that it should be made an
offence Vo carry a revolver, whether con*cealed or noV, and 1 have written another
section as a substitute for the section printed
in the Bill. I move -that this new section 118
read:
Every one ie guslty of an indiotable offence
and hiable to iniprisonment for a term not exceeding five years who, not having a permit in
Form 76,
(a) has upon hie person eleewhere than in
his own dwelling house, ehop, warehouise,

SENATE

couînting-house, or premises, a pistol, revolver
or other firearm capable of being concealed
upon the person;
or who, not having such permit,
(b) is carrying in any vehicle under his
control or of which he is an occupant a pistol,
revolver or other firearm capable of being
concealed upon the person.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If this amendment is carried-and I certainly think it should
be, for the intention of the section could not
be more clearly brought out-there will be
left for consideration only clauses 2 and 4, and
possibly for reconsidoraition that part of clause
1 which deals with new section 119.
The latter part
Hon. Mi. DANDURAND:
of the amendment proposed by the honourable
gentleman from North York (Hon. Sir Allen
Aylesworth) is intended to cover only small
weapons?

Yes.

each province of the Dominion as it came into
Confederation, giving, of course, the original
four provinces in the list?
2. What was the date of each extension of
area and the quantity of such extension in the
case of each province whose boundaries, or area,
was so extended?
3. What was the estimated population in the
extended areas a.t the time suoh area was taken
into any province, and what is the population*
in such area at the present time?
*Note.-If actual population cannot be
obtained, give estimated population.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH.

Hon. Mr. Beaubien in

IN COMMITTEE

into Committee on
the Criminai Code
Right -Hon. Mr.
the Chair.

On section 2-permits cancelled:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, when the Committee rose yesterday we hiad disposed of ail parts of this Bil11
except sections 2 and 4. Section 2 provides:
Every permit heretofore issued pursuant to
any section repealed by this Act is hereby
cancelled.

Some honourabie members, including myseif,
were appréhensive that if this section became
law ail holders of permits would immediateiy
become violators of the law. Section 4 bas
aorne bearing on the saine matter, and after

415

a close study of the two sections I arn convinced that fhey together meef the situation
adequateiy. Section 4 says:
This Acf shall corne into force on a date to
be fixed by proclamation of the Governor in
Council, provided that section one hundred and
tweflty of the Criminal CodeHonourable members wili remembeý what
that section covers.
-as enacted by section one of this Act, shall
corne into force upon the date of the Assent to
this Act, but the permite menfioned in said
section one hundred and fwenty shall be valid
only upoo the date this Act cornes info force
by proclamation.
Now, this new section 120 is the section
which provides authority for the issue of the
permits. By section 4 the provision for this
authority is effective the moment the Act is
assented fo. Consequentiy, from that moment
on, ail present holders of permits and other
persons desirous of becoming hoiders may
obtain permits, and they can do so in the
period befween the date of the assent to this
Act and the date when the Acf cornes info
effeet by proclamation. If they do so in thaf
period, they wili be in possession of permits
when the Act cornes into effeef by proclamation and will not suifer fhrough the fact that
the old permits lapse immediately the proclamation is issued. The intention of the two
sections together seems to be clear. It also
appears f0 be a useful intention, for, whiie
doing no injustice by the prompt cancellafion
of permits, if Iay-s the ground for a complete,
clear, new sheef of perrnits in Canada, so
thaf henceforward we shahl know jusf who
have thein and who have not.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: How are
the ordinary people going fo iearn when the
Acf does corne inf o force?
Righf Hon. Mr. MEIGIEN: I presume
thaf in the administration special efforts wili
be made fo sec that the public do learn. 0f
course, fhey are entifled fo learn only by the
law, which fhey are expected fo know, but
I have no doubt thaf those in charge of the
administration, namely the Mounted Police,
will take steps to sec that the public are
informed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If publication

fali short of reaching the generality of holders.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If wouid be

SENATE

416
On new section
(reconsjdered):

119

dangerous

weapons

Righit Hon. Mi. MEIGIIEN: With flec bave
of the ;Committoe, 1 move for reconsiderafion
of newv section 119. which is part of section
1 nf this Bill. If xvill be remembered that at
the lasf siffing the bonourable senator from
Hamilfon (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) called
attention f0 difficulfies thaf hunters and other
sportsmen would encouinter on coming into
Canada, and intimafed that certain Canadian
interesfs, chiefly the railways, who desired to
encourage the coming ni such people int o this
country, had been de-sirous of an amendment f0 provide that these sportsmen would
flot be unduly hampered. I stated thaf I
had been informed by the railways that they
were content f0 lot the Bill stand as it is;
thaf they would depend upon the permifs;
being reasonable and would wait to sec how
flie Acf worked out. Just before the Comnmittee rose, however, I had intimation that
an ameodment was desired; f herefore I said
that we should have a chance f0 reconsider
the maffer to-day.
I refer honourable members f0 this new
section 119, which makes if an offence, punishable hy summary conviction, f0 have upon
the p4ýrs-on elsewhere than in a dwelling bouse,
and so forth, or f0 carry, a weapon; and paragraph b mnakes if an offence for a person who
is an alien f0 bave in his possession any shot
gun, rifle or other such firearm or any ammunition for any such firearm wifhout having a
permit in Form 76B. Obviously if the case
nf a well-intenfioned sportsman coming int o
Canada f0 bunt is f0 ho taken care of, it
can be donc appropriately under paragrapli
b. Otherwise, it is quife clear, a man coming
fhrough from, say, Detroit to hunt in Norfhern Onfario would ho a violat or of the law
during the inferval between bis enfering
Canadian territory and his reacbing flie permit
office, which office might ho some distance
from the hmîndary. Besides, it may be inferred thaf be is not so familiar wif h the law
as is a Canadian citizen. I arn fold tbat
American sportsmen also enter at Sarnia or
Windsor, pass fbrougb Canada, and go to the
Stafe of Maine f0 hunt.
In order to try to providc for these caises,
I propose the f ollowing amendment by way of
proviso f0 paragrapb b of new section 119:
Provided however that any bons, fide sportsman or hunter shahl ho permitted to enter or
pass through Canada having in his possession
acy shot gun, rifle or otber sucli firearm, or
any aminînition therefor, on condition tha~t he
pass contintioîsly tbrough and out of Canada,
or, if not, that he apply for a permit in Form
76B %vithoutundue deiay after ontering Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. NIEIOHEN.

Hon. Mr. CALDER:
I arn reminded oi
an incidlenf that occurred in the West. I
happened to ho travelling to Calgary. There
had been considerable snow, and the train was
fied up at a liffle fou n, wbich I will flot mentin. During the fie-up one ni our frienda
from the South who was on fthc train began
f0 brandisil a revolver, but apparent ly wifb
no ill infent. Ho was faken uptown and
ariaig-nd before a police magistrafe. 1 was
present af the trial. Tbe accused admifted
tbe charge, with the resuif thaf bis revolver
was confiseafed and hie uas finýed $5. The
incident was ail over in less than twentyfy4ve
minutes. If tbat man hiad kept bis revolver
in bis pockef no one would have been any
thec wiser. I suppose down wbere ho came
from if uvas not contrary to fthc lnw fo flourish
a revolver in public.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
sorveci to ho fined.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: I do not say ho ought

FEDERAL ELECTION COSTS
INQUIRY AND

DISCUSSION

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, March
14, the debate on the question proposed by
Hon. Mr. Foster:
To call the attention of the Senate to the ah-

normal cost, both to candidates and the country,
of federal elections, and inquire if the leader

of the Government would consider the question

of the appointment of a select committee of

this House to consider and report upon such
action as would materially reduce the cost
thereof.
Hon. CHARLES E. TANNER: I think I
ought to explain that I have adjourned the
debate on this matter on several occasions
in order to accommodate some honourable
members who intimated to me that they would
like to speak, and who, in view of the importance of the subject, desired to have time
to prepare their addresses carefully. I hope
they are here to-day and are quite prepared.
They have had ample time to make ready.
As for myself, I have only a few remarks to
make, and will proceed lest I forget what I
want to say.
Like some of the honourable members who
have already spoken, I feel that we may not
be spending our time any too profitably in discussing this subject, as it particularly appertains to another branch of Parliament. However, although honourable members in the
other part of the building may think that we
are intruding upon their preserve, some of
the valuable suggestions made may appeal to
them.
I may say, in passing, that on one of the
occasions when I moved the adjournment of
this debate I made a remark to the effect
that a saving might Tesult from the abolition
of the other Chamber. I learned afterwards
that that remark, although not very seriously
intended, had caused a little flutter of excitement. Honourable members of the other
House are so accustomed to suggesting the
abolition of this Chamber that apparently
they are hit with surprise when any honourable member of this House suggests that the
country might find it profitable to abolish the
House of Commons. However, so far as I
am concerned, I have a great deal of respect
for the other House and for the honourable
gentlemen who sit there. I can assure them
that I will not be in any great haste to move

for the abolition of that House.
There is, however, a certain background for

a suggestion that might call the attention of
the other House to the work of the Senate.
To-day we have been engaged in completing
work which originated in this Chamber three

417

or four years ago, but which, when sent to
the other House, upon more than one occasion,
received practically no consideration at all. 1
observed in the press the other day that a
committee of officials has been engaged in
studying the cost of the stationery of Parliament, and has come to the conclusion that a
substantial sum of money can be saved to the
eountry in that matter alone. I am reminded
that nine years ago a committee of this House,
presided over by the honourable member from
De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique), carefully
investigated the co-ordination of all departments, the reduction of staff, and the exorbitant cost of rentals of buildings in this
city for the Civil Service. That committee
gathered a great deal of valuable information
on all those subjects. Yet, only now, nine
years later, is the other branch of Parliament
awakening to the fact that money can be
saved in some of those respects. It is common
knowledge also that eight years ago a special
committee of this House, under the late
Senator Ross, very carefully considered the
pending railway problems of this country and
pointed out the signs of danger that then
were in the sky, in relation to the expenditures and costs of railways in this country.
To-day we are confronted with the very
consequences pointed out by that Senate committee in 1925. So I say, honourable members, we have reason for thinking, even with
respect to the cost of elections, that there'is
some wisdom in this House and that honourable members of it are competent to make
suggestions which are well worthy of the consideration of the House of Commons.
We all acknowledge that costs of elections
have become exorbitant. I suppose I am correct in saying that probably a majority of
the honourable members of this House have
had experience not only of campaigning, but
of being candidates in elections. I have myself had the privilege of contesting nine elections, and I was not very far away during a
dozen more general elections in which I was
not a candidate. I feel, therefore, that I
know a little about elections and the cost of

elections, and my observation leads me very
quickly to the conclusion that election
expenses have grown enormously. Many years
ago I ran elections in which there was no
such thing as a campaign fund. I have known
of federal elections in Nova Scotia where
there was virtually no fund at all. I have

seen the expenses in that respect grow very
considerably.
It was pointed out by the honourable member from Saint John (Hon. Mr. Foster), and
I think it is true, that the public generally

wouid have to be authorized to look aftor
that kind of thing, and they wouid have
to be paid. There are 245 constituencies in
this country. Instead of reducing the cost
of eleotions, compuisory voting would increaso
the cost very materiai]y.
As for doing away with voters' iists aitogether, I must say that I should have to
dissent from such a proposai. If that were
adopted there wouid he, I think. a veritabie
carnival of personation. You couid not keep
track of the people et ail in a large city.
According to honourable members who represent Montreai, conditions there are very bad
nuw. But how much worse would they be if
there were nu iists! A man would be able
to start at une end of the city and keep on
voting ini every ward and evory poliag subdivision until the poils were ciosed. Without
lists there would be no check whatever on
personation. If that cannot be prevented now,
how couid it be prevented whea we shouid
have no lists? ýSo far as I can seeý, there is
no need for such a change as that. In a large
city like Montreal there should be some way
of seeing to it that the lists are correct and
that on.ly qualified persons vote. My honourable friend fromn Moncton (Hon. Mr. Robinson) suggested that there ho one returning
officer for every SiXty voterS, and that ho go
around from house to houso and take their
names. WelI, that looks like a, very simple
tigta do; but it would flot ho very difficuit to fi up ail the vacant houses in a ward
with peuple who bad nu right to ho there,
thon shif t them around to vacant houses in thec
next ward, and su on.
It seoins tu mo-aithougli I have not givon
the matter much consideration-that a more
practical muvo wouid be a, reduction in the
size of poiiing subdivisions. Thero are now
250 voters, 1 think, in oach. If that number
were reduced to 100, the officiais and representatives of the parties couid identify eveTy
man and woman personally.
It must bo romembered that the difficuities
that exist, in Montreai do flot exist ail over
the country. Therer are nu such troubles in
Nova Scotia. An occasionai personator may
ho found down there, but it is a rare thing
to flnd une even in the city of Halifax, which
has fifty or sixty thousand people. I do not
think it wouid ha prudent to. do away with
lists aitogether and to throw the field wide
open just be-cause the administration of the
law has been found difficuit in une or two
large cities.
We have democracy in Canada. It ie expensive, but what are we going to do about
that? We cannot ahoiish democracy, as we
understand it. We have municipal, provincial
53721-27h

419

and federai olections; and we are ail agreed,
I think, -that wve
have too many elections, but we
cannut get rid of them, for the peuple iasist
upon -having eloctions of thoso three types.
One good thing to do, it seems to me, would
be ta lengthen the life of Parliament. I think
that Parliament shouid ha eiected flot for five
but for seven years, which is the terra of the
British Parliament. And the provincial legislatures, which nominaily are eiected for five
yeans, might aiso bave seven-year terms. These
changes would certainiy resuit in fewer elections. Some peuple have suggested that we
might bave fixed dates for eloctions. WeiI, 1
think it is very debatable whetber that wouid
do any good, under our systom.
The cuet of a federai election ta the
country bas been estimated at about S1,200,000, I think; but in caiculating the annual
cuat we have ta remember that this exponse
is incurred onIy once every four years or
su. There is the further fact ta ho remembered that we give employment and pay the
money to aur own people. The muney is not
iost, for it gues into the puekets af some of
the peuple wbo have provideci it. The great
difficuity that oach candidate and bis friends
have to face is the provision of money for
what are calied campaiga purposes-for tbe

frilîs and flourishes of a campaiga. I believe
many hanourable members wili agree with me
when I say tbat at ieast fil ty per cent of
those campaiga funds are absaiutely wasted.
Tbey do nat affect the resuit of the election
one way or the other. But haw can we overcume the necessity for such funds? In a
riding there are two candidates, lot us say,
John Smith and John MacDonald. The olction is warmiag up and thero is considerabie
doubt as ta who fbas the botter chance ta wrn.
How can you stop themn from using ovory
legitimate means ta incroase their chances of
success? As long as they can find the money
they will broadcast over the radio, issue cernpaign literature and advertise in the nowspapers. Ia my judgment, unless we want to
abalish democracy and set up a Mussolini
or sume other autbarity, we cannot avoid
these expensos while monoy oaa ho found to
meet them.
In making those fow remarks, hunourable
members, I do not want to ho considered as
opposed te, the motion to refer the question
of federal election costs to a committee of
this House. I tbink it would probahly ho a
good idea for us to appoint a committee ta
tako the whole subi oct into consideratian,
for it might ho that out af an inquiry hy
such a committee somne practical suggestions
would ho offered that would commend themselves ta mombors of another place.

SEN_1ATE
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Honourable members,
when the honoorable gentleman who has
just taken bis seat (Hon. Mr. Tanner) opened
bis remarks be looked in this direction as
tbougb he blamed me for being one nf the

When the bonourabie gentleman from
Moncton (Hon. Mr. Robinson) speaks in this
House we can always rely on getting somne
sond ideas and practical pointers, but I amn
afraid that on this occasion ho allowed bis
imagination te rue away with lus better
judgment. For instance, be suggested that
the deputy returning officer and poli clerk
travel around, accompanied by two scrutineers
and, I suppose, a constable, taking the votes.
I tbink ie can conclude that that seheme is
net at ail practicabie.
Ie se far as the present iaw applies; te rural
consîtituc ncos it is working vcry well. 1 know
that many' honourable gentlemen are familiar
with tho law. Wbcn the writs are issued the
returning officor appeints registrars in every
poiling subdivision. Tboy propare the lists,
and a fcw days bofore the election those lists
must ho postcd up in some public place

On election day it was disoexered that the
names of a large number of voters were net
listcd. Fortunately this irregular practico is
net common. Ex en w'herc x eters are left off

Hon.

NIr. TANNER.

1 will gix e a couple of illustrations bearing
on the cost of the sý,stem nf registration. At
the last federal election there were in the
constituency of Qu'Appelle, in which I reside,
17,800 voters. The average cost per voter
for making up the ljst was 1712 cents, and the
total cost for the whoie constituency was
$3.016. 1 find that 83 per cent of those
electors voted. So I thjnk it can bo said that
ie the rural districts the prosent law is working, as xvell as any law could. But the cost
of making up lists ie urban constitucecies is
For instance, a, conconsiderably higher.
stitucncy in the city of Toronto had 18,000
voters on the list and the cost of registration
averaged 29 cents per name and totalled $5,222,
ncarly double the cost of similar work in the
rural constituency te which I referred. 0f
course, a coasiderable part of this difference is
accountcd for by the fact that ie the cities the
lists have to be printed.
In the course of the debate several remedies
have bee proposcd for impreving our mcthod
of coeducting, elections. One of these proposed remodies is compulsory registration.
Now, I arn at a loss to uederstand how a
scheme can ho found that will enable the
making up of lists, complote in evcry respect,
without a considerablc outlay of money. It
might ho a gond idoa te hav e the lists furnishcd by the provinces, if they would agree
te that. Throughi thcir municipal organizations tlîey could probablv hav e the iists kept
up-to-date ex ery y car, for every municipality
niu.4 now make eut an annual statemeet containieg the namos nf ail its rcsidents who are
entitled te vote ie the local elections. Witheut complote voers' lists cempulsory voting
could net, of course, bcecnforced.
Theio oetrable gentleman who proposed thi,inquiry (Hon. Mr. Foster) suggestod, ameag
othor things, the censcriptiag of meter cars
and hialls for election purposes. Well, if we
Iegislated te carry eut any oi these suggestions
we shoulcl have te previ(le penalties for failure
te obey the law. 1 think it xviii bo gcnerally
agreod that thore are many difficulties in the
way of legislating te force people ta eotc. As
the honourabie senator front Piclei (Hon. Mi.
Tanner) lias said, the buik oi the people arc
disposcd to use their v otes. The experienco
in the censfituoney ni Qu'Appoile, whcre, as
I hàax o said, 83 per cent ni the ciectors wvont
to the poils, shows what the people wiii do
wxhen thcey are interestcd. I thinlc that in rural
dlistricts ill oxor the country the clectors are
cvmuch aiv o t te political situation. At
titeir inoetings, in smali schooihousc-. and such
places, matters of public policy will eftee receix e far dloser scrutiny and be dohatod in far
more detail titan at city meetings.

APRIL 11, 1933
One of the main reasons why I rose was to
object to the proposai macle by the honourable senator from Saint John (Hon. Mr.
Foster) and supported by the honourable
leader on the other aide (Hon. MT. Dandurand)
that the federal vote be taken on Su.nday. I
do flot think there ie any necessity whatever
for violating the Lord's Day by the holding
of an election.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should prefer
n legal holiday.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I was going to suggest
that there be a public holiday for voting. We
should leave the holy day alone. I imagine
that if we went from one end of Canada to
the other we should find that the buik of the
people are opposed to the idea of Sunday
voting. In Germany they vote on Sunday,
but we are not bound to follow Germany in
this or any other respect.
Reference was macle to election crimes committcd in Montreal and other cities. I think
the situation refcrred to is deplorable. But it
seems to me the whole trouble is due to the
fact that the present iaw is not enforced. As
the right honourable leader of the House
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighcn) pointcd out the
other day, the Act provides punishmcnt for
every real or imaginable crime. It is not the
law but ita enforccment, that is lax. Election
crooks feel pretty confident that after the
election is over nothing more will he heard of
their wrongdoing, for the succcssful candidate
will say, "Oh, well, I need flot bother," and
the defeated candidate is not inclined to incur
any further expefise. Consequently these impe-rsonators go scot-free. Fortunateiy, in the
rural constituencies there is very little illicit
voting. We hope that the Election Act wil
be amendcd and more severe penalties prescribed for persons found guilty of impersonation. It bas been suggested that su-ch wrongdoers should be sentenced to a stiff term of
imprisonment.
1 am not opposing the appointment of a
select committee as suggested by the huuuurable senator who lias madle this inquiry; I amn
merely pointing out what would appear to me
to b-e difficulties in putting into practice many
of the suggestions advanced. during this debate.
I arn sure that if a committ-ee of this House is
appointed to consider and report upon sucli
action as would materially reduce the abnormal
costs of federal elections, members of the other
House will be very gra.tefui to this Chamber.
PENITENTIARY BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 59, an Act to amend
the Penitentiary Act.

421

He said: Honourable senators, briefiy, one
of the purposes of this Bill is to remove from
the Civil Service Act the appointm.ent of certain principal officers holding executive police
autliority and to inake the Minister, or in
certain cases the warden, directly responsible.
It is also souglit to make more equitable provisions respecting gratuities, ahl sucli provisions, 1 think, looking toward reduction. It
appears that in the combination of Acts covering superannuation and other allowanccs, including gratuities, there are duplications.
These arc taken care of by the Bill.
What is the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
reason for the proposed change with respect to
the appointrnent of penitentiary officiais? Has
the present system failed to bring about satisfactory appointments?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: That is the
judgmcnt of the Minister in charge.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is it the intention to select penitcntiary superintendents
frorn among men who have experience and
standing in the militia or have graduated from
the Royal Military 'College at Kingston? I
have heard of such a suggestion having been
macle elsewhere, though. 1 do not know whether
any opinion was expressed as to the advisability of setting up military discipline in the
penitentiaries, or the advantage of having men
of high military rank superintending those
institutions.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As the
honourable senator knows, I amn always very
chary of declaring any intention, especially
ii it cannot conceivably mature for a considerable time to come. In this hectic periocl
of the world's history it is wise flot to make
any attempt to predict what may he clone in
the far or even in the near future. The question, though, rather lacks point, for the reason
that the present Superintendent of Penitentiaries was appointed hy the Civil Service
Commission.11e is a man of wid-e military experiýence..I do not think lie is a graduate of the
Military iCollege, but if he were he would be
ail the better for it. .In my humble judgm.ent
bis military experience by no means disqualifies him for the post he holds. The appointment was made, as are ail appointments by the
Civil Service Commission, without reference
to any member of the Government. I amn
not certain whether 1 was in the Administration at the time, but I certainly would flot
criticize the appointment merely because the
appointce had bad a very distinguished
military service. 1 clo not think any intention bas yet been planted in the mind o*f
the Administration-, mucb less bas it flowered

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Bill aiso

wardeos.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGUEN: I recali that
the late Administration appointed a military
mani as warden at New Westminster Peoitentiary. I hesitate at any time to criticize the
lato Administration, but if I wero criticizing
I certaioiy wouid nt choose that instance as
the point of my attack. Tiret is the oiy other
appoiotment cf a miilitary chacacter that I cao

lino xxit riodero thcurnht. I arr n aiae tiret
tire Dourinico Coverumeont is under a certain

APRIL 11, 1933
disadvantage as compared with the provincial
governments in dealing with this matter. In
Ontario a youth found guilty of some trifling
offence is placed under observation in a reformatory or some similar institution, where
he is given every encouragement to become a
good citizen. In that way the provincial
authorities become acquainted with the life
history of the abnormal person, much in the
same way as a family doctor becomes
acquainted with the life history of his patients.
But when a convicted criminal is sentenced
to a penitentiary term lie is already embarked
on a life of crime, though, if he be a
young man, his reformation is not hopeless.
Therefore it seems to me all the more expedient that the Dominion Government should be
ready to accept outside advice in regard to
prison discipline. I have no doubt that the
right honourable gentleman (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) will say no, just from force of habit;
but I have an idea that eventually this course
will be taken.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If I caught
the last remark of my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Lewis) it was that I presume to know
these things from force of habit.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: I beg my right honourable friend's pardon. I said lie would say no
from force of habit.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Unfortunately it has become almost a habit for me to
say no to his suggestions as to discipline in
our penal institutions. Whether the fault lies
with me or with him, the House will have to
decide. But the habit will have to continue
while the character of his suggestions remains
the same. I cannot pretend to any sympathy
with the theory that in the maintenance of
discipline in a penal institution the persons
subject to that discipline must be given a
right of appeal from the decision of officials
immediately over them, on questions within
the discretion of those officials. If it can be
said that the inmates of a penal institution
have such a right of appeal, then there is no
longer any authority in that institution; it is
transferred somewhere else, and all tbat was at
the base of discipline is gone. In a school, for
example, if a pupil bas a right of appeal
against any discipline which the teacher
exercises within his discretion, and which is
not forbidden by law, then the school becomes merely a wrangling aggregation. What
applies there applies with double force to any
institution such as a penitentiary. From a
case between a convict and a guard, or the
warden, I draw the same deduction as from a
case between either of those officers and the

423

officer above to whom he is immediately responsible. The discretion of the officer above
must be accepted, subject to such review as
those superior to him care to exercise. On
such principles, and such alone, can these penal
institutions be maintained and perform the
function they are supposed to perform in the
economy of our life.
Hon. Mr. LEWIS: Honourable members,
may I explain that I was fnot dealing
particularly with the necessity of allowing to
a prisoner a right of appeal from the warden
or other penitentiary official; rather I had in
mind the whole question of prison discipline
and the importance of receiving suggestions
and advice as to better methods of discipline.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I thoroughly
agree that every responsible person in the
whole structure of government should be
ready to receive and seriously to consider advice, suggestions, and new ideas.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen,
the Senate went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien in the Chair.
On section 1-Governor in Council to appoint Superintendent and inspectors:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is irrespective of any idea of promotion.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No doubt the
rule of promotion will receive just as much
consideration as before. I do not think promotion has played much part under the Civil
Service Commission.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: The inspectors are
new officials, are they not?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I really could
not say. The Superintendent is a new official.
If I had to give a statement at all with regard
to the inspectors, I would say that usually
they are from the institutions. They have,
in the main, got their posts by way of promotion.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Section 14 of the
old Act does not say anything about the
inspectors.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I think the complaint in the past has been that the inspectors
have been appointed from clerical positions in
the Penitentiaries Branch of the Department
of Justice in Ottawa, and that they were wholly
unsuited for the work. In the case of the
Portsmouth Penitentiary, when a warden was

SENATE
retired an inspector was put in charge. He
was an accountant out of the Penitentiaries
Branch of the Department of Justice, and
had no qualifications for or experience in the
work. A bank inspector is usually a promoted
bank manager, and when ho makes an inspection he has all the authority and all the qualifications of a man who knows how a bank
manager should behave. I should hope that
in future inspectors, if they are to be of
higlier rank than wardens, will be men who
have been promoted from the position of
warden. That is the only way I know of in
which we may ensure that inspectors know
how to inspect and how to make a real contribution to the penitentiary service.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman opposite (Hon. Mr. Robinson)
draws attention to the fact that inspectors are
not provided for in the section repealed.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: But they are in
section 20.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: Yes, they are
in a subsequent section.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-Governor in Council to appoint wardens, etc.:
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Does that mean
guards?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They are provided for in the next section.
Section 2 was agreed to.
On section 3-appointment of guards, trade
instructors, etc.:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The recommendation of the warden is made necessary.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Practically the
whole personnel of the penitentiary is moved
out of the control of the Civil Service Commission.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The personnel
down to clerical assistants-no, net even to
those. In the main, the clerical help will be
what is left.
Section 3 was agreed to.
On section 4-departmental

staff:

What is
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
effect of section 23 of the Act?

the

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: It is shown on the
right-hand page of the Bill.
Section 4 was agreed te.
Honi.

Mr. GRIESBACH.

On section 5--gratuities to retiring officers:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In this section the words "the rules" are stricken out,
and are replaced by the words "any Act," because, as a matter of fact, provision is made
by an Act and net by a rule.
In this connection I want to carry the Committec to section 6. I hope that after looking
at that clause the Committee will agree to
an amendment to clause 5. Subsection 1 of
section 32 of the Act provides for a retiring
allowance to certain officers, and subsection 2,
which appears on the right-hand page of the
Bill we are now studying, provides:
Sceli retiring allowanre may be increased
by one-half the amîoiunt thereof if the infirmity
or injury whieh cocmpels sucl officer to retire
froi the service is occasioned by any hurt
received by him in the performance of his
duty, without fault or negligence on his part,
at the hands of any convict, or in preventing
an escape or rescue, or in suppressing a revolt.
If ho is hurt at the hands of a convict the
gratuity may be increased by fifty per cent.
The anendment proposed by clause 6 of the
Bill says:
In no case shall the retiring allowance of
auy offieer be so increased if he is eligible to
receive coipensnation in respect of the infirnity
or injury which lias coimpelled his retirement
froi the service under and in virtue of the
provisions of the Government Emiployces'
Compensation Act.
That is to say, if he is entitled te compensaticn under the Government Employees' Compensation Act he is not te get an increase
in the gratuity because of having been injured
in the way I have described. The effect of all
this is to icave the man who is net entitled
to any increase even thoughi he is net under
the Covernment Employees' Compensation
Act, in the same position as the man who received his injury in the creditable performance
of a dangerous duty. I think there should be
an amendment to provide that the man wlio
receives his injury in the creditable performance of his duty should have an advantage.
I therefore propose that there be added after
section 5 of this Act-the section which we
are now studying-the following:
Subsection 1 of section 32 of the said Act
is amiended by adding thereto the following
proviso:
Provided thalt the retiring allowance authorized by this subsection chall not be paid te
any otheer if he is eligible to receive comipensatien in respect of the intirimity or injury which
lias coipelled his retirement frem the service
under and in virtue of the provisions of the
Governuenit Employees' Comipensation Act.
If we pass this amendment, which I will ask
the honourable senator behind me (Hon. Mr.
Griesbach) tu propose, and thon pass section
will be that the man who bas
6, the effectx

425

APRIL 11, 1933
rendered no special service will not get the
gratuity if hae comes under the Superannuation
Act, but the man who is entitled to, the flfty
par cent increase in his gratuity because of
extraordinary services will bace, not bis gratuity, but the fifty per cent increase, if lie
comes under the Government Employees'
Compensation Act. That will still give himi
an advantagc to which bis conduat entitles
him.
I move that
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
amendment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have not the
text of the amendment hefore me, and
althougbh the explanation may ha perfectly
clear, I confess that I do not understand it.
I will accept the amendment, ho-wever, if the
third reading is postponed until to-morrow so
that 1 may bave an npportunity to read over
the amendment.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Very weIl.
The amendment was agreed to, and section
5 as amended was agreed to.
Section 6 was agreed to.
On section '7-saving of eligibility for
gratuity:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This is
simply a better and more detailed statement
of the law that is set out on the right-hand
page of the Bill. It is rendered necessary
by the fact, among other things, that there
are two Acts, the Civil Service Superannuation Act and the Civil Service Superannuation
and Retirement Act. Onhy one of tbem is
referred to in the Penitentiaries Act as it now
stands.
Section 7 was agreed to.
On section 8--no gratuity payable under
Civil Service Act:
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: This also is
to avoid duplication of gratuity.
Section 8 was agreed to.
On section 9-confinement of convicts;
period of confinement not to ha computed
as time served:
Right Hon. Mr. MEI'GHEN: The period
of confinement is not computed under the
present law, but if this amendment is passed
there will be a computation of any time that
a convict is detained pending an appeal by
the Attorney-General or counsel for tbe
Crown.
Section 9 was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.
The Bill was reported, as amended.

CONSIDEREY IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Riglît Hon. Mi-. Meighc-n,
the Sonaite w-cnt into Ceminittec on tha Bill.
Hon. M\r. Bc-atbien in tha Chair.
On sectien 1-Goeenor in Cotincil to deturmnine rates of payv
Hon. Mr-. DAN-,DIjRAN-'D: Who determinad
the rates of pay bafoca?

APRIL 12, 1933
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Governor
in Council determined the rate of pay, but
the clause read somewhat differently. It said
the Governor in Council could make regulations which would be effective, and which
would be decmed to have been effective since
the 31st day of May, 1924. The only change
in this is the deletion of all the words following the word "Force." The wording of the
section as it stands might be interpreted to
mean that any future change in rates of pay
or all'owances would have to be antedated to
the 31st of May, 1924. The on'ly purpose of
the amendment is to preclude any such interpretation.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2, new section 21, subsection 1
-fines and forfeitures earned by members of
the Force to be paid to the Minister:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This is
important. In the past these fines and
forfeitures and the proceeds of seizures were
transmitted to the headquarters of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police at Ottawa for
deposit in the Benefit Trust Fund. It is now
considered desirable, in addition to this, that
no member of the Force should be permitted
to retain any moneys, fees or other remuneration or commission, over and above his
salary, for any extra work performed by him,
but that these moneys should be deposited to
the credit of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police Benefit Trust Fund, which is under the
control of the Minister and is used for the
benefit of members of the Force as a whole
and the families of deceased members.
Subsection 1 was agreed to.
Subsections 2 and 3 were agreed to.
On subseotion 4-regul-ations:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
What is this?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This has to
do with the making of regulations relating
to this trust fund.
Subsection 4 was agreed to.
On section 3-punishment of offences by
non-commissioned officers and constables:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As this section stands at present, any reduction in rank
is confined to non-commissioned officers. The
purpose of the amendment is to make the
reduction in rank applicable to constables,
who are divided into three classes-first,
second and third. Without this amendment
they cannot be demoted.
Section 3 was agreed to.

427

On section 4-Governor in Council may
determine amount of allowance for purposes
of pension:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would the right
honourable gentleman explain?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The purpose
of this amendment, to put it in my own
words instead of the words of the memorandum which I hold, is to enable the Governor
in Council to fix uniformly, by regulation,
the basis on which remuneration may be
estimated for pension purposes. In deciding
whether special remuneration is to be included with the salary when the amount of a
man's pension is determined, much depends
on location, rank and other circumstances.
Some men get free residence, depending upon
where they are stationed. Under this amendment the Governor in Council may by regulation adjust the basis so that the man who
has an advantage in respect of residence will
not be able to have that advantage computed
as an allowance which would increase his
pension and make it higher than that which
another man, of equal merit, would receive.
As a Minister I have often had the case come
before me of a man getting, say, $2,000 and
a free house, who, had it not been for the free
house, would have been getting, say, $3,000.
He would compute his right to pension on the
basis of a remuneration of $3,000. When the
time for pension came he would always want
to say, "The value of this house per year
was part of my remuneration." The purpose
of this subsection is to enable the Governor
in Council by regulation to put all officers of
the force on the same basis, so that there may
never be any dispute on this point in respect
of the Mounted Police.
Section 4 was agreed to.
On section 5, new subsection 7 of section 48
-time served in South Africa may be included:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This gives
the Mounted Police officers the same privilege
that members of the permanent corps of the
active militia have.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I believe that
under the present law only officers of certain
grades have the privilege of including the
time they served in South Africa in their
term of service for the purposes of their pension. This section would extend the same
privilege to Mounted Police officers. It is
now some thirty-three years since the South
African War ended, and as this amendment
would lead to an additional burden upon the
treasury, I wonder why it is proposed at this

SENATE

428

time, when there is an effort to restrict expense, even in the matter of pensions.
The CHAIRMAN:
carry?

Shall this subsection

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should not
like to have it carry at present, over the protest of the honourable gentleman.
Of course, I
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
do not know how large a sum would be involved in the passing of the section. I have
no knowledge as to the number of men
affected.
The South
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
African War ended about thirty-three years
ago, as my honourable friend says, and that
period is sufficient to enable members of the
Mounted Police who served in that war and
have been on the Police force ever since to
qualify for pension. That is the reason the
amendment is proposed now. It will be remembered that in the closing days of 1899
there were organized in Canada for service in
South Africa two cavalry regiments, one based
on the Royal Canadian Dragoons, and the
other, the Second Canadian Mounted Rifles,
on the Royal North West Mounted Police.
Some 160 or 170 members of the Police force
joined the Mounted Rifles and a number of
them, after serving in South Africa, returned
to the force, while others remained with the
regiment. Some Canadians who served in
other units in South Africa also joined the
force. The subsection provides that Mounted
Police officers shall have any time they spent
in the South African campaign included in
their term of service for the purposes of pension under this Act. I should say that not
more than a few dozen officers and men would
be affected by the amendment.
Could we not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
have a statement as to the extra expense the
amendment would involve?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We could,
but it is a question of whether the amendment
is right, and not of how many persons would
benefit from it. Since the honourable gentleman has raised the question, there is one
point on which I am not satisfied. It is quite
right that a man who went from the Mounted
Police to a South African regiment should
have the time he spent as a soldier counted
for the purpose of pension, but as the section
reads now I am not quite certain that it is
restricted to such men.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The section would
apply also to officers who joined the Mounted
Police force for the first time after they
returned from South Africa.
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
why it should.

I do net see

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Well, in our
superannuation law there is a provision that
service in various departments may be computed for purposes of pension. And in the
permanent corps of the active militia service
in South Africa counts towards pension.
Therefore it could be argued that such service
should be computed for pension purposes in

force.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That could
be argued, but it would not convince me. I
do net feel satisfied with the wording, and I
suggest that we defer consideration of this
subsection.
New subsection 7 stands.
On section 5, new subsection 8 of section
48-time with the military forces.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: This is all
right. It means that if in respect of the time
served in the military forces a pension has
already been granted, that time shall not
count in the term of service for the purposes
of pension in the Mounted Police.
Subsection 8 was agreed to.
Section 6 was agreed to.

Well, this
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
should stand along with the first part of section 5. I presume that if we had before us
a copy of the Act that is being amended we
should see that the time served in South
Africa is computed for pension purposes only
when it is part of a continuous service. But
as the amendments read by themselves, there
is nothing to show that a man who joined the
force ten years after the South African War
could net have any time that he served in
South Africa included for purposes of pension
under this Act. I want to be sure that such
a thing is net possible.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: In the permanent
force that is done.

APRIL 12, 1933
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That may be
all right, because the man on the permanent
force is in military service, but it seems to
me to be absurd that a man who joined the
Mounted Police a number of years after the
South African War ended could have any
time that he served in South Africa added to
the time he has since served with the Mounted
Police, when his pension is being considered.
New subsection 4 stands.

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Honourable members, I am making this motion on behalf of
the honourable senator from Essex (Hon. Mr.
Lacasse). The Devonshire race-track was for
a number of years operated by the Western
Racing Association, which got into financial
difficulty and had a deficit to the extent of
some $235,000. In an attempt to salvage as
much as possible out of the investments the
creditors have organized the Devonshire
Jockey Club and taken over the assets of the

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable

a likelihood that the Bill as presented to
this House will not be proceeded wijth, but
thalt another Bill will be introduced te make

ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE
BILL
FURTHER CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

The Senate again went into Committee on

Bill 58, an Act to amend the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act.-Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen.
Hon. Mr. MeLennan in the Chair.
On section 5, new subsection 7 of section
48-time served in South Africa may be included:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The right
honourable gentleman was to give some
explanation as to the purport and extent of
this clause.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This clause
was allowed to stand in order that further
consideration might be given by honourable
members to a point which was raised. Under
the law as enacted by clause 5 anyone joining
the Mounted Police at any time after the
South African War would be entitled, in estimating the amount of his pension upon retirement, to include the period of his service in
that war. The question was raised whether
it was right to enact that a member of the
Mounted Pol.ice who joined that force after
bis return from the South African War-it
might be ten years after-should be entitled
to have his South African service added to
his service in the Mounted Police in the

calculation

of his

pension.

The

reason

advanced for this proposed enactment-it was

expressed in this House by the honourable
senator from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach)
and has been urged upon me since-was that
for the purpose of estimating pensions members of the militia are entitled to have their
South African service included, even though
they came into the militia after the South

SENATE

432

African War was over. In other words, the
right which this provision seeks to give to the
Mounted Police in regard to pension matters
has already been given to the militia.
The questions before the Committee are,
first, whether it was right to enact such a
provision with respect to the militia, and,
second, if se, wheter it necessarily follows
that it 'is right with respect to the Mounted
Police. If it was not right then, it is not
right now. The argument advanced to me
is merely an argument by way of analogy
botween the Mounted Police and the militia.
I think I owe it to the CQmmi.ttee to say
that I have not changed my opinion as expressed when we considered this question
before, and I should find great difficulty in
defending the subsection as it is.
Does the right
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
honourable gentleman think that a member
of the force should be able to count the time
he was on active service in South Africa, so
long as the period intervening between the
close of the Boer War and the date of his
join.ing the force-ten years, or whatever it
might be-is not counted?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That intervening period of ten years, or whatever it
might be, could not be counted in any event.
Only the time spent on active service is referred to here. The question is whether Parliament wants te legislate that a man who
joined the Mounted Police force only after
the end of the Boer War-one month, one
year, ton years, or any length of time afterwards-should be able to have the time he
served in South Africa included in his terim
of service for the purpose of computing his
pension under this Act.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
men would be affected?

How many

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
twenty-five.

The same
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
opinion that my right honourable friend
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) has expressed
occurred to me when the Bill first came
before us. I can sec no possible justification
for such a retroactive provision, or for the
giving of such a bounty to men who have
been favoured with an appointment on the
Mounted Police force. They have had the
advantage of holding a Government position
and of being employed steadily, and have not
been affected by the lean years. This question
arises in my mind: How could we justify such
a preference te a fe men over the treatnent
given to the several thousand other men who
Right Hon.

Mr. MEIGHEN.

served in South Africa and on their return
wient into private life? Nobody would suggest that those others should be given a
bounty now. If the principle of this section
is endorsed here, shall we not in the near
future be asked te give a bounty to all the
men wvho served in the Boer War and are
now in private life? My right honourable
friend says that the same principle is already
embodied in the Militia Act. Well, it may
have been agreed to in a year of plen'ty, or
that part of the Militia AGt containing this
principle may have passed this Chamber without receiving much attention. I confess there
are times wen we pass such legislation without critical analysis. But in view of the
present condition of our finances, I w-onder
whether the country would acquiesce in what
is proposed in this section.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable members,
I did net hear the discussion on this section
the other day, and I must say that I was
unaware there was any such provision in connection with militia pensions as that referred
to by the right honourable leader. It sems
to me from what has been said to-day that
the principle involved in this section is unsound, and I doubt very much the advisability
of passing legislation of this kind at present.
As the honourable gentleman opposite (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) has stated, we do net know
where it would lcad. I am, and always have
been, in favour of giving proper pensions, but
every false move that Parliament makes in
such matters only leads to further demands.
The continual piling up of burdens one after
another, in the past, has had much to do with
bringing the country where it is to-day. We
in Canada do not want to get into a position
like that prevailing south of the border;
everybody who understands the situation hopes
that we shall be able to keep from going so
far. But unleSs Parliament is sane and sound
enoughi to resist what may be classed as-I
will not say altogether improper applications,
but applications that are not quite right, in the
courSe of time we nust inevitably drift into
such conditions as exist elscwhere. With our
financial position as it is to-day, we could net
stand those conditions. I cannot sec that there
would be any injustice in not giving the right
that is asked for here to men who joined the
Mounted Police force only after the South
African War had ended.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Will it be
objected by someone that this is a monecy
Bill and the Senate tas nothing to do with it?

APRIL 25, 1933
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I hardly think so. We
have flot had much difficulty in that direction.
Personally I shal nlot support this section.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may tell my
riglit honourable friend to my lef t (Right Hon.
Mr. Graham) that it i.s a privilege of this
Chamber to reduce votes, though we have no
power to increase them.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I arn in the
hands of the Commjttee. I suggest that if it
is decided to act in uine with the arguments
of the honourable senator opposite (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) and the honourable senator to
My left (Hon. Mr. Calder), the proper procedure would be to amend subsection 7 by
adding after the word "may" in line 10 the
words:
in the case of persons who were members of
the Roy ai North West Mluunted Police at the
timne of enlistment for such service in South
1
Africa.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I sliould flot
object to that.
Right Hon. Mr. MFJGHEN: I th-ink it
would flot do to strike out the clause, because
subsection 8, which is a restriction and flot
an enlargement, is necessary, and if we struck
ouit subsection 7 the men who went from the
force to Sou-th Africa could flot include in
their termn of service the time they spent
there. In this view 1 may possibly be wrong,
but, on the aesumption that they could flot,
I think the proper amendment would be as
1 have suggested.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would it not
be advisable to add, "and who returned to
the service," at the end of the amendment
proposed by the riglit honourable gentleman?
Suppose a member of the force enlisted for
Sou'th Africa and resigned fromn the force,
but returned some years later.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should lie
agrecable to including sucli a man, because
othcrwise the time lie spent in South Africa
would be time lost from bis period of service
in the force.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Suppose a man
resigned from the force and rcmained in South
Africa or Iived elsewhere for a number of
years, but later returned and rejoined the
force.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Yes, I think
the time such a man spent in South Africa
should bic countcd, because if he had flot been
in South Africa lie probahly would have been
on thc force. 1 have no reason to believe
there is any such case. Any man who went
53721-28

from the force to South Africa should, I think,
have -the ýtime lie spent, in South Africa
counted for the purpose of pension if he later
returned to, the force. That is in line with
the principle we have usually adopted in the
,case of our youflg men who went to war. But
1 feel it would be going too far to, say thait
a man vrho had served in South Africa and
joined the force for the firat time after the
Boer War ended--qierhaps a nu-mber of years
after-should have the time lie spent in South
Africa included when his pension is being
computed under this Act.
Hon. M.r. BLACK: Honouralile senators,
is it or is it not the intention to place the
Mounted Police on the same basis as the
permanent corps of the militia? It will be
seen on reference to the explanatory note that
a simi lar provision. does appertain to members of the permanent corps of the active
militia. If I remýember righitly, thýat lias been
s0 for a long time. I Vihink this is the condition. A man may have served five years
in the South African War and later joîned
the permanent militia; whereupon, for pension purposes, lie would 'le credited with bis
South African service. By an amendment
to the Milýitia Act a similar concession
was made to those who served in the laite
War. For exaimple, if a man served overseas for three years, aind on bis return to
Canada joined the permanent militia and
served seventeen years, lie would be entitled
to retire at the end of that period on the
basis of twenty years' service. If the Mounted
Police are to lie plaiced on the same busis
as the permanent militia, tliey are entitled to
the saime treatment; if not, there is no reason
at aIl wliy we sliould enaiet this proposed
legisiation.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Let us look ait this
other case. A young man, we will say, ait the
aige of twenty-two volunteered for the South
African War aind served tliree years; then
lie came baick to Canada and went into the
Civil Service. Suppose lie is entitled to retire
at the end of cigliteen years. Should lie,
for pension purposes, be aillowed to add those
tliree years to bis eighteen years' service?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: No.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I sliould say not.
Take a case sucli as was previously cited. A
man served two years ini Southi Africa, and
five years laiter joined the Royal Cainaidian
Mounted Police. As I understand it, this
Bull proposes tliat, for pension purposes, those
two years sliould be aidded to bis term of
service in the Mounted Police. I must say
frainkly that I cannot aigree witli sucli a principle. I would go a little furtlier: if that

REVISED
EDITION

434

SENATE

principle is embodied in legislation affecting
the militia force of Canada, I think the legislation should be repealed. There may be contracts and understandings with certain persons,
but in my opinion that principle should
never have been recognized.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: So that no
complaint can be made of failure to present
the case, I shall read to the Committee the
memorandum from the Commissioner. I may
premise by saying that it appears from this
memorandum that should the Committee decide against granting this time, then the right
thing to do would be strike out clauses 5 and
7, because those men who were members of
the Mounted Police Force at the time they
went to South Africa are already covered.
This sectionThat is, section 5.
well as section No. 7 deals with time
-as
served with the Canadian military forces in
South Africa, and these sections, as they stand,
would permit all officers and constables who so
served, during the years mentioned, to count
such service for pension purposes under the
R.C.M. Police Act.
As the principle of allowing South African
service to count has already been granted to
members of the permanent corps of the Canadian militia, it is considered only fair that the
saine privilege should be extended to the
R.C.M Police, which, while it is a police force
first, is trained in military duties and can be
used as an auxiliary force.
With regard to cost, as close an estimate as
can be made sets the number of officers and
constables concerned as between 20 to 25 as a
ihe average service in South Africa
naximnum.
would be about one year, and in these circumstances,That is, assuming it is one year.
-the ultimate cost to the Canadian Government would not be more than an average
increase in pension of one-fiftieth for each of
the officers and constables concerned, which is
relatively small.
It should be added that all members of the
North West Mounted Police Force on active
service with the Canadian Volunteers in South
Africa are allowed to count such active service
as served in the Force under the authority of
Chapter 19 of the 1900 statutes, and the purpose of sections 5 and 7 above referred to is
to permit all officers and men at present serving
in the Force and who served in the South
African campaign to count such service for
pension purposes whether they were in the
Force heiore or after the South African War.
The South Afriran War is too far distant
to permit any others over and above the 20 to
25 present members receiving this privilege.
That is the entire memorandum, and I think
we may assume that it embraces the whole

After read-ing the memorandum more carefully, especially the second last paragraph, I
think no provision is needed in order to
preserve the rights of those who were members of the Mounted Police when they went

CANADA SHIPPING BILL
On the motion ta adjourn:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Honourable
members, I think I owe it to the House ta
intimate that the Committee on Banking and
Commerce-which has charge of the very
important measure now before the Senate,
namely, Bill J, respecting shipping in Canada
-is to meet to-morrow morning at ten4hirty.
The Committee will then consider reporting
against the further prosecution of this most
extensive Bill this session. It is hoped that
if the Committee so reports, as I anticipate
it will, there will shortly be introduced another
measure, which is at present under consideration, and is of a very restricted character,
having relation ta Canadian shipping only,
and taking the forin of amendments ta the
present Act.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Will that
measure be in'troduced in the Senate?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, the
purpose is to introduce in this House whatever measure is gone on with this session.

PURCHASE OF RADIO STATIONS
RESOLUTION OF APPROVAL

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, a message has been received from
the House of Commons reading as follows:
Resolved that a message be sent to the
Senate informing Their Honours that this House
has adopted a resolution (hereto annexed) ap-

provng the purchase of the radio broadcasting

stations and equipment of the Canadian National
Railways by the Canadian Radio Broadcasting
Commission for the sum of $50,000, and request-

ing that Their Honours will unite with this
House in the approval of said purchase.

The annexed resolution reads:
Resolved that pursuant ta the provisions of
the Canadian Radio Act, 1932, the House of
Commons hereby approves the purchase of the
radio broadcasting stations and equiprment Of
the Canadian National Railways by the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission for the
sum of $50,000.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved:
Resolved that pursuant ta the provisions of
the Canadian Radio Broadeasting Act, 1932,
the Senate of Canada hereby approves the

purchase of the radio broadcasting stations and
equipment of the Canadian National Railways
by the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission for the sum of $50,000.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will the right
honourable gentleman explain?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: As honourable

members know, the Parliament of Canada
passed in 1932 an Act establishing the Radio
Broadcasting Commission and giving certain
powers and duties ta that body. Thereby
this country adopted the principle of government supervision of radio broadcasting in the
Dominion. The adoption of this principle
followed upon the report of a commission
appointed in, I think, 1928, and headed by
Sir John Aird, and was pursuant to the recommendation of a committee of the other House
which investigated the entire subject of radio
broadcasting in this country.
Honourable members will also be aware that
some years ago-the initiating year I cannot
recall, but it was long prior ta the inquiry by
the Aird Commission-the management of the
Canadian National Railways launched upon
a somewhat pretentious plan of radio broad-

casting, and establislied stations across the
Dominion-one eachi at Halifax, Moncton.
Montreal, Ottawa and Vancouvxer. Two of
those stations are of considerable power and
magnitude. The capital cost nf ail the installations to the Canadian National Railways

resuirs were concerned, the cornpany's exl)erience in this enterprise wvas uinfortunate, the
losses on operation je the last four vears
having been as follows: 1929, $441,000; 1930,
$420,000; 1931, $326,000, and 1932, $80,000.
The management of the company, in the
exercise of its business judgment, decided te
make the best sale that it ceuld of these
properties, and negotiations were conducted
between the management and representatives
of the Radio Broadcasting Commission. It
was felt by the Commission that the acquirement of the stations, if it could be arranged
on satisfactory ternis, would be in full consonance with the principle upon whichi the
Commission was constituted, as well as with
the polýicy unanimously recommended by the
committee ni the other Blouse. The negotiatiens resulted in a price ni $50,000 hein- agreed
uipon.
This is considerably less than the
original cost. I do not knexv just wby the
fig-ure of $50,000 was arrived at instead of,
say, $3à5,000 or $80,000, or any other amount.
but it may have been by this route. The
company, in its presentation te the coininittee of the other House on this subjeet,
placed a value of $70,000 upon these properties,
.aiter taking into accouait obsolescence and
depreciation. There lias, of course, been further dE-preciation since, and, allowaoce being
made fer that, it would seem that $50,000
wotild not be an uinfair valuation at the date
of acquirement. The earning power of thcse
stations being considered in relation te capital
cost, it certainly cannot be said that a figure
hi-lier than $50,000 wou]d be warranted.
The Act constituting the Canadian Radio
Broadcasting Commission ýprovides that the
Commission may make only siieh expenditures as are authorized by Parliament. Authorization may be granted by an estimate being
passed by both flouses. In the present instance this course was not followed, and consequently it is suggested that the authorization
take another f orm, namnely, a joint resolution
of approval.
The subject has already been under discussion in the other Bouse, the necessary resolutien ni approval has becn passed, and, as
read ýby you from the Chair, Mr. Speaker, the
question now cones befere us fer consideration.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. R. DANDURAND: Honourable senators, I do net suppos~e -that we should be
criitical ni this proposal. It ýis practically a
book-keeping entry, inasmuch as the Radio
Broadcasting Commission and the Canadian
National Railivays are the offspring of Parliament and, se far as finances are coneerned, are
under the control of the Federal Government. I realize, of course, that our lateat
cbild,, the Radio Commission, desires to keep
down its capital expenditure and an make a
better shewing in the future; but whetber the
purcha..e price oi these radio, staionýs be
$50,000 or $400,000, it will not affect the load
carried by the federal treasury.
This venture may expand and eventually be
operated at a profit; I de not know. 1 desire
simply te give expression to a sentiment which
1 have just heard, thait iýt is perhaps injudicious for this House to adopt a resolution
on the day it is introduced; it might indicate
undue haste; but if honourable members are
satisfied that we have given sufficient attention to the subjeet-matter and approve of the
resolution with our eyes open, 1 have ne
objection to our adopting it now.
Hon. J. STANFIELD: Bonotîrable sena.
tors, the purpose oi this resolution is recomnmended by the Radio Commission. I may
point eut that net a single member oi that
Commission is a man with business experience.
True, one of the commissioners is reputed te
ba radie expert. I would net utter a mord
in disparagement of bis technical qualifications, but as to bis business ability I hav e
grave doubts. I trust that before any more
radijo stations are acquired or any iurther
capital expenditures are incurred the proposed
action of the Commission will bo thoroughlly
looked inte by competent authorities, men
of proved buisinvss capacitv.
As te the Halifax station, wvhich is te be
acquired, I know very little technically about
it or its staff. For about hallf an heur on
Sundav evenings it used te hroadeast concerts
given 1w the orchestra ni the Nova Scntian
Hetel. The Moncton station, which used te
broadcasst for an bour in the afternoon and
an heur in the evenin. had a staff ni two>
or three operators and one engineor.
Of
course, I am net blaming the Radio Commission for the equipment and operation of
the Canadian National Railwa 'vs radio stations. As a matter of fart the operating
deficits of the Canadian National Railways
were substa.ntially increased by the expenses
of their radio stations and the installation ni
radio eqiiipnacnt on their principal trains.

APRIL 26, 1933
Each train operalor was paid a salary of 890
a month, with expenses. This equipment bas
been withdrawn and the operalors have been
discharged. I do not know how many operators are in charge of the Ottawa radio station,
but I must say I have always found them
very courleous and helpful in giving any information Ihat I bave sought.
Some weeks ago I crilicized the milliondollar vote to the Radio Commission. On
that occasion I was told tbat the money did
not come out of the federal treasury, but was
derived from radio licence fees. In any event
tbe money does come out of the pockets of
the people ultimately, and I would remind
bonourable members that many of our citizens
to-day can ill afford to pay two dollars for
a radio licence. If we have so mucb money
available for the Radio Commission. wby not
eut down the licence fee and make it less
difficult for radio owners to secure a licence?
I am not opposing the motion.
Righit Hon. GEO. P. GRAHAM: Honourable senalors, originally I objected to the
formation of the Radio Commission under
present financial conditions. If the Commission is to establish a broadcasting cbain,
prohably the purchase of these stations from
the Ca-nadýian National Railways is the hast
bargain it could make; but I still maintain
that we are merely on the verge of what
Ibis radio venture will cost the country, and
certainly thais is no time to spend the people's
money on radio broadcasting or on any other
experiments. That is the ground I take.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, bear.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
I am not
criticizing the personnel of the Radio Commission.
Thougb the Canadlian National
Railways management m.ay bave made a
mistake in esîablishing a radio sysîem, it
followed several precedenîs, and its example
has been imitated by several other railway
companies. To a railway, radio is a means
of advertising, not of making money. Tbe
only way it can secure a profit on the operation of its radio stations is by broadcasting
programmes for commercial and other corporations.
I desire to place myself on record as again
objecting to this new venture on bebaîf of
tbe Government into a business which this
country can well do without at the present
moment, when men and wome.n and business
concerns are migbtily troubled in meeting the
increasing burdens of taxation.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, bear.

Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: Honouýrable senators, I have been wondering
wbetber there is any significance in the way
this resolution, is worded, and sbould the right
bonourable gentleman leading the House
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) think it worth
noticing, I should be glad if he would explain
it. The resolution asks this House to
approve, flot the sale of certain radio stations
and equipment, but their purcbase. Would
it not have been more appropriate to word
the resolution the other way about? The
purchase would seem to be a very excellent
bargain so far as the amount of the purchase
money is concerned, and I should not have
thougbt it would need any debate to obtain
approval of it from the standpoint of the
Radio Commission. This is a property for
which one must suppose the Radio Commission has a use. Certainly the Commission is
getting the property at a very low figure as
compared witb its original cost, or even its
comparatively recent valuation. The property
cost about 8130,000 a few years ago. It was
valued, I think, not more than a year ago,
at $70,000 odd.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
ago.

Two years

Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: Now
the Commission is getting the property at
$50,000. The purchase seems to be a very
good one if the Commission bas a use for the
property.
But what about the sellers of the property?
Do they not need any approval of a sale like
this? Here is something for which tbey paid
$130,000 odd, and now they are parting with
it for a comparatively small sum. I should
think that we ought to be asked rather to
approve the sale of the property by the
Ganadian National Railways.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Honourable
senators, the comment of the honourable
gentleman from Colchester (Hon. Mr. Stanfield) appertains not so much to the resolulion as to, the general policy. I cannot pretend to be speciafly equipped, if indeed 1 am
ordinarily equipped, to discuss the general
policy, not having been in public life at the
time of ils adoption; but as an observer from
without-very far without-I did notice that
it was favoured by aIl sections of the other
House, and from tbis one might in-fer tbat
it was approved by aIl substantial sections of
public ospinion, though it would be goîng too
far -to assume that all the people favoured it.
0f course it migbt still be argued that while
the policy might be regarded as sound, having

438

SENATE

been recommended after a most exhaustive
and painstaking inquiry by a committee of
Parliament, as well as by a royal commission,
yet this was not an opportune time to launch
upon it. Upon this point I feel safe in going
so far as to say that if the policy is to be
pursued at ail, the longer it is deferred the
greater will be the cost; the farther the ramifications of private ownership extend, the
greater becomes the difficulty of exercising the
control and supervision which the policy
contemplates.
Certainly it should be the policy of the
Commission to move very warily, and at this
time within a narrow financial compass. I
have every reason to think it is doing so, and
if I recall my reading exactly, its receipts are
beyond its expenditures. I am the more confirmed in my view of the Commission's policy
after the speech of the honourable gentleman from North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth), who feels there is no difficulty in
recommending this transaction from the standpoint of the purchaser, but has grave doubts
from the standpoint of the seliler. The reflect-ion is favourable to the Commission, and,
I know, will be very acceptable to the honourable senator from Colchester.
As to the comment of the honourable
senator from Colchester that there is no
business man on the Commission, I would
point out that there are business men and
business men. The superman is entirely out
of existence to-day, as the honourable senator
knows. I should not regard the Chairman of
the Commission as a man of no business experience. Certainly I should regard the gentleman selected from the Province of Quebec
as a man possessed of business experience and
business capacity of no mean order. I happen
to have known him for many years, and I
may say that if success in business is a
criterion of capacity he is not to be despised,
at ail events by those of us who have not
achieved an equal success. I do not include
the honourable senator from Colchester.
It is true the price does seem low, but if
in the estimation of the company there was
a depreciation from S132000 to S70,000 in the
course of three, four or five short years, it is
not unreasonable to think that in the course
of two years more the value might be reduced
to $50,000. At ail events, the difference between this price and the figure that would
remain after the deduction of a reasonable
amount for depreciation would be small
indeed.
The reason the resolution is before us is
that the Act provides that the purchase must
be approved by Parliament. But there is no
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

statute providing that Parliament must
approve the sale by the Canadian National
Railways. From the standpoint of the Canadian National the matter is entirely within
the purview of the management of that
system. Possibly I should add that the sale,
inasmuch as it involves capital assets, probably
requires the imprimatur of the Governor in
Council even though it does not require any
resolution of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: By leave of the
House, may I say that it would be of interest
to know a little more of the figures the right
honourable gentleman gave in referring to the
reduction of loss in the management of this
business frorn $400,000 to $80,000. Could the
right honourable gentleman tell us how much
of that loss was attributable to radio stations,
and how much to the other part of the
system, on the cars?
Right Hon. Mr. MiEIGHEN: I do not think
there could be any division, but the loss
would include the loss on installation and
operation on the cars. No doubt the latter
ingredient would be by far the greater. It is
all a loss in the enterprise. In this connection
I may say that the Canadian Pacific Railway
never launched upon such a policy. If it was
an error, it is not one that Parliarment has
to apportion between the two companies, but
belongs to only one of them.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: With the leave of the
House, I should like to ask the right honourable gentleman whether he has any idea of
the approximate number of radio receiving
sets in operation throughout Canada at present, according to the records of the department, and, secondly, the number of persons
who have paid licence fees. I happen to come
from a district where thousands of radio
owners are deliberately refusing to pay their
licence fees on the strength of a case which
was taken to court, and in which the court's
decision was in favour of the objector. I presume my right honourable friend is fully
aware of that. I am referring to a case in the
city of Windsor which was conducted by a
lawyer named Gignac. On the authority of
the judgment in that case hundreds of people
in the district are deliberately challenging the
rulings of the Department of Marine and of
the Radio Commission, and are indefinitely
postponing the payment of their licence fees.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIG.HEN: I think the
case to which the honourable gentleman refers
must have been decided before the settlement
of the main dispute, which went to the Privy
Council, for that body held, without any
reservation, that the control of radio was en-

APRIL 26, 1933
tirely a matter of federal jurisdiction, and
therefore it goes without saying that the
licence system is legal. 1 cannot give the
honourable gentleman information as to the
number of licence.%that have been. issued in
Canada. I really have not taken a very great
interest in the subj eut. The only thing I like
about a radio is that you can turn it off.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Hear, hear.
The resolution was agreed to.
]Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved that a
message be sent to the House of Commons to
infoinm that House that the Senate had
adopted the resolution.

PRINTING 0F PARLIAMENT
REPORT 0F COMMITTEE

Honourable
Hon. SMEATON WHITE:
senators, a long list of documents is included
in our Minutes of Proceedings of yesterday.
For the information of the House, as many of
those documents are of considerable public
in.terest, I should like to explain that the
reason why the Joint Comrnittee on Printing
has not recommended them to be printed
is that some of them have already appeared
in print, and others will be published in
annual reports.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, I am very glad the honourable senator
from Inkerman (Hon. Smeaton White) has
raised this question, because I note that
thirty-nine pages of our Minutes of Proceedings of yesterday consist of a report from a
committee of Parliament which no one, except
those on the committee, had an opportunity
to look at before it was adopted by the House.
I cannot imagine any one thing that would
do more to convince the citizens of Canada
that some of us here are nonentities and have
nothing to do, than the haste shown yesterday
in adopting that report. I have carefully
looked over this long list of documents. Personally 1 think that in recommiending that
they be not printed the committee exercised
good judgment, but that is not the point. We
had a righit to knK>w ivhat it was that the
committee proposed should not be printed,

'l

and I appeal to the right honourable leader of
the House to see that in future no report of
a committee is adopted in such unseemly and
unnecessary haste.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: May I say that the
Committee on Prinsting wae to meet yeeterday
morning at 1i1 o'clock, but the Senate was
not to meet till 3 o'clock in the afternoon;
consequently many members were not present
when -the committee decided upo>n this question.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: 1 think there
is a considerable distribution of responsibility.
If but a single senator h~ad itaken exception
to what was done yesterd-ay, not only would
hie have been Iistened to, but hie would have
been effective in preventing the adoption of
the report.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: Senators could not
object when they were not present.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Objection
could have been raised in order to permit of
an examination of the report. Not having had
a very long experience hiere, I a.ssumned the
report was more or less formal-it was merely
a question of what expense should be undertaken and what should not, and, as there was
no objection to it, 1Ipermitted the resolution
to pass. I do not altogether like to have
honourable senators who were here, or should
have been here, complaining afterwards about
the action taken, because any one of them.
would have been just as effective as anyone
else in blocking the adoption of the report.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I thought of rising
yesterday and sisking that we be given an
opportunity to analyse the report, but 1
assumed from what was said that it contained only two or three small items. I did
not know that a thirty-nine-page list of documents was involved, and I did not want to be
too technieal in stopping the play. Lt see-ms
to me that someone should have considered
the rest of us sufficîently to allow us at least
to read what was contained in the report before
asking us to concur in it.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, this Bill came to my hands only
shortly before the opening of the House, and
while I have had an opportunity of making
some study of the measure and the explanatory notes, I do not feel that I can give such
adequate reasons for the vari-ous clauses as
1 should like Vo be able to give. I suggest
therefore that the second reading stand until

to-morrow.

NOTICE OF INQUIRY

On the notice of inquiry:
]3y H-on. Mr. Casgrain:
That hie will inquire of the Governinent:
1. llow niucha publie money was spent during
the year 1932 in connection with Port Churchill,
the navigation of Hudson Bay and the straits
-whatever purpose-altogether?
2. How m,îch money was spent on the operation of that harbour?

HAY AND STRAW INSPECTION BILL
FIRST READING

A message was reeived from the House of
Comýmons with Bill 22, an Act respecting the
Ins~pection and Grading of Hay and Straw.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND

READING

POSTPONED

Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN .moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill has

for its purpose the repeal of the law governing the grading of hay and straw, and the
substitution therefor of a system of grading
to be devised by the Department of Agriculture. The present law, enaeted some
twtnty-five years ago, speeifically defines the
various grades. These grades differ in different sections of the Dominion, and were estahlishod to suit the requirements of -the market

of :that time, when the principal demand for
hay was for the feeding of horses in cities.
Conditions have changed in the intervening
years and to-day the main demand for our
hay comes froin the United States. It is

soughit to empower the Department of Agriculture to establish such regulations as will
enable our hay producers from time Vo time
to meýet the exigenýcies of that market.

Hon. Mr. BLACK:

Does this Bull change

the old system of grading?
Right Hon. Mr. ME'IGHEN
It repeals
thje specifie grading provisions applicable Vo
differeýnit partis of the country and places in

the hands of the Minister of Agriculture full
authority for the grading of hay and straw.
H-on. Mr. BLACK: I have noV seen the
Bill, and therefore cannort discuss it intell-igently. I want simply to caîl attention te
the fact that flot, more than five years ago
-I think only three-our hay growers held
conventions in different parts of the country
and agreed on a system of grading forr the

various hay-producing looshities. If the grading of hay were lefV entirely in the hands of
t.he Department of Agriculture, it would be, I
am sure, very unpopular

among

the large

producers of hay in the Maritime Provinces,
who at the present time do flot look to the
American market for the sale of their hay.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: 1 understand the
Bill is not distributed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEI(GHEN:

It should be.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I have no objection to the Bill being proceeded with.
My inýforRi.ghtt Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:
mation is that the ýalteration from the specifie
grades to the more elastie system of grading
by the deparbmrent lias been asked for by
the trade.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: By the sellers of hay?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Yes. But I
think sthere should be opportunity for the
honourable snator fromn Westmorland <Hon.
Mr. Black) to study the Bill. Consequently,
with the permission *of the House, 1 suggest
that the second reading stand until to-morrew.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: May 1 ask the right
honourable gentleman whether under the provisions of this Bill more inspectors are to be
appointed?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: 1 do not think
so. There probably will be fewcr, although
the Bill provides for inspection. As honourable senators who are fortunate enough to
have the Bill beforc them will see, the explanatory pages recite the sections of the Act
te be rcpealed. These sections enumerate the
varjous classes and grades of hay, and provide for classification accordingly. Section 156
contains a list of grades from a te m, inclusive; section 157, grades from a to c, and
i-ection 158, tame grasses, fromn a to j, inclusive. I quite admit the importance that
may attach te the repeal of these sections, and
i; any honourable senators wish to make a
special study of the Bill they should have
nmple opportunity te do so.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Lt strikes me that the
change is a very desirable one.
Hon. Mr. CAS'GRAIN: Has the honourable
gentleman the Bill?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: -No,but I have listened
t o the explanation.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Does flie honourable
senator grow any hay?
Hon. Mr. CAL DER: Yes, I have grown
hay. The hionourable senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Black) int-imated that the
growers in bis locality fixed the grades of
the hay.
Hon. Mr. BLACKx: 1 did not sav that. That
is quite xvrong.
Hon.

Mr.

BLACK.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Thiat is what I understood-that the grewers of hay got together
and decided what the grades shou'ld be. As
I understand it, the grades new fixed by the
law must be used whien hay is sold. Let us
take the case of grain, which, though not
altogether analogous, is similar. The grades
for grain are fixed, flot for tan or fifteen years
in advance, but from year te year. Se far
as hay is conce'rned, it is very desirable, I
assumoe, that either the departmnent or some
board should grade the hay from year te year
according to prevailing conditions. I arn net
a hay man in the sense that my honourable
friend behind mne (Hon. Mr. McMeans) lias

Nor a straw

Nor a straw man
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
either-but I can understand the desirability
of baving the department. or some other
body fix the grades every year, instead. of
having tihem fixed permanently by statute.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: Does the Bill provide for grading for export purpeses enly?

No. The
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Bill prevides for the appointmaent of inspectors, and authorizes the Minister te establish
regulations prescribing standards of class and
quality. It aise provides fer inspection certificatas, and prescrihes the conditions unider
which the inspection shaîl take place, and the
charges te be made theref or. In the Maritime Provinces, which, for the purpeses of the
old Act, are bracketed with Ontaýrie and
Quebec, thýere have been, as I intimated
before, grades extending nîl the way from
Prime Timothy, called a, te Shipping Grade,
called m. In Quebec-why, I do net knowcertain weights were provided. In Manitoba,
British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Alberta and
the Northwest Territories, another classificatien ecisted. Then thiere was the classificaThe contention of the
tien of wild grms.
Minister is that aIl these grades were intended
te meet the demands of the local markets in
our cities, and do net meet the demand of
the American market, which is new the
market for our hiay; consequently new classifications have te be established.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: 1 think we might
very well pestpene this discussion until temorrow, when we shail have the Bill before
us. For many years I have kcept herses and
have bought hay. Frequently 1 have donie
thue grading myself, and sometimes I have
fixed the price ari'ording te my grading.
The motion for the second reading stands.

in charge of Stock Yards Service Branch,
Department of Agriculture; H. P. Kennedy,
Toronto, President of Edmonton Stock Yards
Limited, and A. W. Burrell, of Edmonton,
Manager of Edmonton Stock Yards Limited.
The honourable Minister of Agriculture and
the departmental officials whom I have named
gave us very valuable information, which will
be a foundation for our further inquiry. Mr.
H. P. Kennedy has had forty years' experience
in the live stock industry and has been a
large exporter of cattle. His evidence, as well
as that of 1\r. Burrell, was very interesting.
The Commit tee was particularly impressed
with a suggestion made by Mr. Kennedy, and
supported by Mr. Burrell, that the method of
selling at our different stock yards might be
changed to conform with the English system
of selling by auction. The proposed change
would necessitate the co-operation of all
parties interested, and Mr. Kennedy said he
would take up the matter with representatives
of these parties and give us later the benefit of
his investigations.
In order to consider properly the many
phases of the subject of reference it will be
necessary for the Committee to hear a number of other witnesses. Some of the honourable menibers of the Committee whose homes
are in the West were desirous of having a
few Western gentlemen appear to give
evidence, but in view of the advanced stage
of the session the Committee was of opinion
that it would not be wise to proceed further
with the investigation at present, since it was
unlikely that there would be time to reach
The
proper conclusions before prorogation.
Committee is strongly of the view that the
inquiry should be renewed early next session,
when the evidence that has been heard will
still be pertinent and can be taken advantage
of. The inquiry was virtually limited to the
export trade in cattle, but the Committee
desires that the scope of the investigation
be broadened so as to take in live stock in
general.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is this a report
of the Committee?
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:
It is merely a
statement, not a report.

CANADA

GRAIN BILL

SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEI'GHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 79, an Act to amend
the Canada Grain Act.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

Explain.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, I think I can explain the Bill, but
I am very certain I cannot explain the explanation which is on the adjoining page. To
nie it is utterly without meaning.
The purpose of the Bill is to improve the
law regarding the documentation of grain
shipped from the West and transferred into
an Eastern elevator. The identity of the
grain is lost, and questions as to title have
arisen because of the transfer.
The Bill provides in sections 1, 3, 4, 5 and
6 for the issue of transfer receipts and Eastern warehouse receipts: the transfer receipts
to apply where the grain is received into the
elevator merely for transfer purposes; the
Eastern warehouse receipts to alpply when it
is delivered to the elevator for storage. The
transfer receipts are made non-negotiable; the
Eastern warehouse receipts are made negotiable. There is also provision for the exchange of the transfer receipt for the Eastern
warehouse receipt if it has subsequently been
decided to leave the grain in storage. All
this is under the supervision of the Grain
Commissioners. The Bill extends their jurisdiction in this respect. The object is to
secure greater certainty of the ownership of
the grain and te prevent difficulties in establishing ownership due to loss of identity of
the grain in these intermediary elevators.
Section 2, however, supplemented by section
7, is for a distinct purpose-to enable the
owner of an elevator at a point of ocean shipment to loan grain to shippers, under such

MAY 3, 1933
conditions as will protect the public, tîereby
faoilitating export at that point. It does not
permit the owner of tIe ebevator Vo slip
someoile else's grain, but ratIer it empowers
the Board of Grain Commissioners Vo, permit
the loading of grain under their supervision,

shipment, espeoially at the port of Montreal.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

The grain is not

Rigît Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They can
boad grain of similar quality and ameunt.
I do neot like týo reflect on explanations. Having souglit to explain sections 2 and '7,1 will
now read the explanaVory note on those sections, and -honourable senators rnay take what
meaning out of it they can:
It is desired to relieve the Montreal Harbour
Cominissioners in connection with the operation
of their transfer elevator from the prohibition
againsrt discharging grain f rom an elevator
except on delivery cf a warehouse receipt.
That is ail right.
It is desired to do this in order Vo enable
a person who bas grain on ship board in tIe
harbour to "borrow grain of like quality and
quantity from the stock in the larbour elevator
and ship VIe saýme when the best opportunity
offers.
Wby a man with bis ship loaded would want
Vo borrow more grain for the shipment I do
not know.
H-on. Mr. CASGRAiIN: To complete his
load.
IV says,
Rîglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
"grain cf like quelity and quantity" wiit.
VIe grain he lias on bis shi.p. Wly would le
want the "like quantity" if he lad two-Vhirds
cf his slip full? He would not want twothirds mocre.
Hon. Mr. CASGRALN: 0f Vhe sa-me quality.
Rigît Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: The explanat.ory note says, "of like quality and quantity." That naakes tIe whole explanation
meanàngless. I arn confident that VIe expianation I have given is right-and I hope it
15 olear. There are two objecte to be served:
first, Vo preserve more oiearly VIe documentation cf titie xiow interfered with because of
tIe storage shiýpment and ithe transfer slipment ut these inteirmediary elevators, andi Vo
do so by means of Vhe Eastern warehouse receipt and VIe transfer receipt respectively, with
the significance wvhich. I attaoh to each;
secondly, Vo permit tIe borrowing cf grain at
export points for the purpose cf facilitating
shipment.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I could under9tand that if it we-re to complete the shipment.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: So could I.
Hon. SMEATON WITE: An ocean ship
miglt be ioading, and the shipper rnight not
have sufficient grain in the elevator to complete bis cargo; but 'he might have, either
in a lake vessel in the harbour, or on the
way to the elevator, enough grain of the
same quality to replace the grain to be
borrowed from tihe elevator.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: We are fortunate
in having in Vhis House an ex-chairman. of the
Montreal Harbour Board. He could explain
the matter fully.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Two ex-dhaàrmen.
Hon. Mr. 'CASGRAIN: The other honourable gentleman was not chairman of the Harbour Board.
Hon. J. H. RAINVILLE: Honourable
senators, in the port of Montreal it lias been
the practice for a good many years Vo loan
grain. When the grain is stored un the elevators it loses its identity. Suppose a shipper
has a boat load of grain coming througlh the
Lachine canal, but not a sufficient quantity
in storage at the port to comiplote an ocean
ship'ment: he misses thc chance of selling bis
grain. To overcome this difficu'lty we loan
grain td the shipper on the aasulnption that
it will be replaced by lis grain of sisnilar
grade en route to Montreal. In order to gus.rd
our.selves against bass we require the shipper
to insure bis grain -and s0 guarantee delivery
to us of the same quantity and quality of
grain as we have loaned to him. Furthermore,
hjs bank becomes responsible to us for the
value of the grain so loaned, though, as we
have always been told, the banks have no
rigît to do hIls.
There is no doubt that we are short of
storage space in tihe port of Montreal. We
have a storage oapacity of 15,000,000 bushels;
we sîould be able to, take Gare of 30,000,000
bushels. Buiffaie lias a storage capacity of
45,000,000 bushels. This is why, for a good
many years past, our grain lias been diiverted
to the Buffalo-New York route. The American
grain storage is centrally located. On the contrary, we have builht our elevatore uit Owen
Sound, Midland, Port McNicoll, Port Colborne, Goder'icl, Sarnia. Eaoh of these ebevators has a capacity of from 1,000,000 up to
12,000,000 bushels. If they were located in the
port of Montreal we should not lose aur grain
Vo Buffalo. Our storage capacity ie only suffi-

cient to take care of grain for inmmediate slipment. On two occasions our friends across the
line tried to block our elevators with unsold gradn, and at the time our good grain was
being diverted tto the Buffalo-New York route.
I believe the Bill will serve a very useful purpose in facilitating the shipment of grain for
export.
.Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Is; it not a fact
that for weeks at a time shippers have flot
been able to unload their grain because there
ivas no storage room in the elevators at Montreal ?
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Yes, many times.
Hon. Mr. MeMEAN"ýS: Do they flot send
the grain on to Quebec?
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE:
In any
there would flot be sufficient storage.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
I think the
honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
White) gave us the explanation: a ship is
partially loaded, and thc shipper, to save time,
wants to borrow wheat from the elevator to
take the place of wheat that he las on the
way to the elevator, perhaps flot very far
from it.

Is "identical

the grain inspector, but the ten thousand
bushels taken into thc elevator are not the
ten thousand bushels taken out.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHIIEN: Yes. This
clause covers the provision respectîng identical
grain. It is the old clause 135, except that
after the word ".shahl" in the sixth Une an
exception is made in these words:
except ns in this Act otherwîse provided.
In this Bill we have covered a case where

MAY 3, 1933
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Wîll the Governmerît follow the advice of the commission?
Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Probably we
shall do very much as we did in the case of
the 1{ailway Act fallowing the advice of
the commission as far as Parliament wjll
permit.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Why extend the
time for only a year? We have an excellent
system of banking, owing very largely, 1
think, to the fact that aIl our ban'king legislation lias been most carefully considered by
the Senate Committee on Banking and Commerce, many of the members of which .have
been bankers. I remember very well that
when Sir George Drummond, president of the
Bank of Montreal for many years, was chairman of the Banking and Commerce Coinmittee of the Senate, hie retained at bis own
expense a legal officer to look carefully into
ail applications for bank charters.
Only
recently applications for bank charters have
heen refused by the Senate, and very properly
so, I think, because they were flot made by
people who were regarded as suffirciently reliable to receive them. In one instance the
majority of the directors did flot even live
at the place where the head office of the bank
was to be.
I think the Senate may flatter itself that
banking legislation is admittedly lef t to its
Committee on Banking and Commerce. We
know the resuit of this practice. We have
seen what happened to the banks eLsewhere on
this cont'inent, and we know that flot a single
casualty qqcurred. amïong the .bank1s in Canada.
Our bankg- have, aid managed to pull through
the terrible -crisis that lias confronted the
world. They have served the people well. I
should like to suggest that, if it is at al
possible, an extension of more than one year
should now be granted to our banks in order
to give them greater stability. Neither the
banks nor the business people of the country
want any change. I am quite aware that the
Bank Act is supposed to be revised every ten
years, but I say, wby flot let well enough
alone? Why hurry to appoint a commission
liefore we know what is going to take place
at the conference. to be opened on the l2th
of June in the great city of London?
Anot-her matter that is worrying me is that
the meeting is to take place in London. Why,
in 1919 we created a body that was expected
te deal with these very questions.
-Rig t, Hon. Mr. MEJIGHREN: What hody?
Hou. Mr., CA$GR.AIN: The League of
Nations. _It. has-, not, çlos'ed its doors. The

League of Nations bas cost this country, I
suppose, mucb more than $2,0O0,000. It has
a staff of experts and has had the benefit of
twelve years' experience. Why not take advantage of such an organization? Furthermore, will the League of Nations take any
part in the eoming conference? The subi ectmatter of the conference is of world-wide
importance; this is the very sort of thing for
which the League of Nations was created. It
would be a great slight on the League to
neglect it at this time, particularly as it is
officered with innumerable experts, both male
and female. As we have spent a great deal of
money on it, I really cannot understand why
we should fail to make use of it. The newspapers tell us that sixty nations will be represented in London. That is even more than
the League of Nations dlaims as its membership.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD:
to do with the Bill?

What lias that

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If it were possible
to, make this extension a little longer than
is proposed, it would be, I think, a matter of
satisfaction to the business people, the commercial community, and the banks of Canada.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: Why does not
the League of Nations stop the war between
Japan and China?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I regret that my
leader is not here. If lie were liere hie would
tell the honourable gentleman wliy. Perhaps
the honourable senator from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) will tell us.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: I do not think
even your leader could tell us that.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The usual
extension, as provided by the Bank Act, is
ten years, but there have been cases, notably
in 1911 and 1912, where the ten-year extensien was def.erred and a one-year extension
made.
No doubt there are many who feel that
hasically, at least, our banking law is riglit
and our currency system as sound as that of
the better countries of 'the world; but we
have reason to suspect that there are some,
,occupying places of. importance in this country, who feel that very great changes ought
to lie made, and "Who -are very impatient
about delay. Consequently we are not asking
Parliament for an extension beyond one year.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN introduced
Bill C1, an Act to amend the Canada
Shipping Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this is the
Bill that was forecast at the time of the withdrawal of the more extensive measure with
which the Committee on Banking and Commerce dealt for some considerable period.
The object of the present Bill is merely the

MAY 4,1933
making of certain amendments, one of which
is quite important, ta the Canada Shipping
Act.
While an my feet 1 may say that 1 had a
canference with the Chairman af the Cammittee an Banking and Cammerce (Han. Mr.
Black) and he decided ta ask the cammittee ta meet this afternaan at 5 o'c!ack.
Power to call the cammittee tagether was
reposed in him at the last meeting. The
Cammittee an Agriculture and Farestry meets
inmediately after the Hause rises, and it was
thaught that the Banking Cammittee might
at least assemble this afternaon far the

HUDSON BAY TERMINALS
INQUIftY AND DISCUSSION
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN rase in accordance with the fallowing notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
ta the cost of develapment work and other
germalle expenditure at Fart Churchill and Part
Nelson, and inquire wh.at economies the Government proposes ta make in connection with thoe
parts.
He said: Honaurable members, the House
heard yesterday the answers ta my inquiry
concerning expenditures in cannectian with
the Hudson Bay route. The first question
I asked was:
How much public money was spent during the
vear 1932 in connection with Part Churchill,
the navigation of Hudson Bay and atraite-whatever purpose-altogether?
The answer was that the 'Department of
Railways end Canais spent $1,23W,743.06. That
53721-29à

451

as goodiy amount, cOnsidering -the rather
iimited quantity of grain tJeat was shipped by
that route. I waa unable t~o learn the actuai
number of bushels that were shipped, but I
understand that three vessels lef t the port
and one was wrecked. The answer aiso stâted
that the Marine Department spent $127,815.89.
Well, I take it that would be for the iighthouses up there and on keeping a ship in the
straits &1-1 time.
the
As I have said, one of the shipe t.hat left the
part was wrecked. It was an unfortunûte
incident, and it seemed t'a me that it was
absurd ta hint, as was dane in an-other place,
that the wreck accurred purposeiy.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: It iis not s0 absurd.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Na man an a Bhip
wauld try ta wreck it, especiaily when there
was no means in sight af saving his life. 0f
course, the ship that was wrecked carried
wireiess equipment and there happened te be
in the vicinity a Governunent vessel, whieh
arrived before the sinking occurred, and just
in time ta prevent the ioss of life. The lass
of the ship was disoauraging, but I do not
believe that any persan would risk his life
for the sake of discouraging shipments by any
particular route.
To the second question, "How much money
was spent on the operation af that harbour?"
the answer is, "Nil."
Next I asked: "How snuch maney was spent
for the maintenance and operation of the cee.
vator at that part?"
The answer is,
"$87,590.54."1
I should lîke ta be carrected if I a~m mistaken, but I doubt very much whether more
than 1,000,000 bushels of grain went through
the elevator. Supposing this quantity was
handled, the expenditure for maintenance and
operatian represents 8-7 cents a bushel, which
is a very high cost. I know transportation
companies that wauld be very glad te transport 1,000,000 bushels af grain from Fart
William ta Montreal at eight cents a bushel;
but hanourable senators will notice that that
expenditure was oniy for the maintenance and
aperation of the elevatar.
I corne ta my fourth question: «How much
maney was received far the storage of grain
or other purposes in the elevator?" The
answer is: "Storage, nil; cleaning chargea,
$11,239.85!" The Latin word nil is used; not
a cent was received for storage. As wili be
scen, there were cieaning chargea cf812985
I do flot know whether this is revenue, but I
suppose it in. I underatand that wheat is
cleaned in elevators. Apparenitly the abippers
of the grain paîd those cleaning charges, How-

SENATE

452

ever, honourable senators will have to guess
for themselves; I cannot explain the answer.
In the sixth question I ask, in part, "What
is the total expenditure to date at Port Nelson?" The anstver is, "$6,274,217.88." If that
is the total expenditure on Port Nelson dur' ing the past twenty years, it is the most
economical work that I have ever heard of. I
should think three or four times six million
dollars has been spent there during that period.
I do not know whether the expenditure of six
million dollars odd includes the cost of dredging. In the answer to this question we are
informed:
This sum does not include the cost of that
portion of the railway grade which was
ahandoned in consequence of the diversion of
the railway to Churchill. The amount paid the
contractors for the grading works on that
section, pro rated to the mileage abandoned.
would indicate an approximate cost of $1,466,270
for the abandoned grade.
Well, this expenditure is not excessive in that
God-forsaken country, where the cost of
supplies and provisions is very high.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS:
forsaken country?

Why is it

a God-

Because it is.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Nothing will grow there. The country has
never thawed out since the Creator made it.
If that is the honourable senator's idea of an
El Dorado, I would advise him not to end his
days there. We should prefer to have him
remain with us in this Chamber.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: That does not explain
the honourable gentleman's phrase, "Godforsaken."
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: This is my seventh
question: "Was there any salvage from the
iron bridge or other work erected at Port
Nelson?" The wide stretch of shallow water
betaween the main channel and the low-lying
shore increased the expense of providing
wharfage. The engineers made an artificial
island and built a bridge to connect it with
the mainland. The answer indicates there
was no salvage from the bridge.
Then I asked: "Is it the intention of the
Government to continue to subsidize this
route this year?" The answer leaves room
for speculation. We are told that harbour
tolLs and dues comparable with those of other
Canadian ports are being established at the
port of Churchill this coming season, also a
reguslar tariff of levator charges. How much
revenue will be collected is in the lap of the
gods. For my part, I do not think very much
revenue will result from tolls and dues.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
much less for Montreal.

It

will mean so

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
During the past
quarter of a century the Senate has debated
the practicability of the Hudson Bay route,
and in the debates on this question I have
to the best of my abili-ty tried to convince
our people that we should never have undertaken the construction of the Hudson Bay
Railway. Only the other day I was told,
"Never try to convince anybody unless you
are paid to do so." Well, in good years I
am paid $4,000 a session, and I take it that I
should earn my indemnity by trying to convince the country of the folly of spending
money on unprofitable public works. I may
not have convinced them, but at least I have
done my duty. If since 1908 successive Governments had studied Hansard of the Senate,
a considerable portion of the expenditure on
the Hudson Bay route would probably never
have been incurred.
It is to be hoped that in future the Government of the day will take more notice of
the debates in this Chamber. We are in a
peculiarly favourable position to discuss publie
question on their merits. We are not aecountable te clamorous constituents, and we
If periodically
are absolutely independent.
we had to seek election to this House, human
nature being what it is, our judgment might
be swayed by self-interest. Our tenure of
office encourages independence of thought
and action. A second Chamber tiat is not
permanent is not worth having. I am very
glad to be able to say that since the right
(Right Hon. Mr.
gentleman
honourable
Meighen) bas donc us the honour of leading
the Houso, he has increased its prestige very
much, and to-day the press gives some space
to our debates. For years we have bad to
engage a newspaper reporter to give publicity
to our proceedings, because apparently the
newspapers did not t.hink it worth while to
send their correspondents here. I do not
wish to be a lauder of the time gone bylaudator temporis acti-but it seems to me
that thirty years ago, when I had the honour
to become a member, there were many prominent men in the Senate and the debates
were on a high plane. Of course, we are all
prominent men to-day, but at that time we
had some very able leaders, and always two
ministers with portfolio sat in the Sonate. I
think we have perhaps larger powers than the
Sonate of the United States, for its members
have not the permanency of office that we enjoy. If honourable senators read the American
newspapers they will see that the House of

MAY 4,1933
Representatives does flot get nearly the
amount of space that is devoted to the proceedings of the Senate. We have wide powers,
and I believe that if we would exercise those
powers, especially at this time of crisis, the
country miglit be governed much better than
it ever has been governed in the past.
Coming back 10 Port Nelson, I may say
there is no barbour there at ail; there neyer
has been, and neyer can be. The distinction
between a harbour and a port is this: a
harbour is made by Nature, a port by the
band of man. 'fhe authorities tried to make
a port at this point, but anybody who cares
to look at the map will see how impossible
that is, for te the north there is an uninterrupted sweep of a thousand miles, with
flot even an island intervening. Consequently
a north wind or an east wind causes a rise
of water at Port Nelson which, though flot
as great as in the Bay of Fundy, is nevertheless very considerable. To illustrate Ibis, 1
may say that a confrere of mine whio was sent
by the Government of Ontario to lay out a
townsite on the east side of Hudson Bay
found upon his arrival that the locality of
the proposed townsite was many feet under
water. H1e camped and waited for the water
to recede, but il did flot recede, and hie bad
to come bark and report what hie had found.
The great trouble with governments is that
they insist upon consulting engineers a-bout
harbours and navigation. When il comes 10
building wharves, superintending dredging, or
something of that sort, engineers are very
useful; but when we want 10 know about
the navigability of waters adjacent to a
certain port we ought 10 consult sea captains
and sailormen, who know something about
navigation. I was very close to one Governmient which was in power for about fifteen
years, but 1 could never make it understand
this principle. It would always reply that
the engineers had said this or that. Ifil
hiad consulted any schooner captain it wouId
have been bold very quickly that a port could
neyer be made at Nelson.
Sixteen miles out from the shore at that
point the water is only seventeen feet deep;
so, in a storm, with the thousand-mile sweep
of which 1 have spoken, even if a ship drew
only ten or twelve feet, she would strike the
bottom every lime she went down in the
trough of the waves. Furîhermore, the sult
from the river forbids any idea of dredging
outside this port. But we could not find
that out for ourselves; we had to gel a gentleman by the name of Pa'lmer-and 1 do not
know how mucb we paid him-to tell us that
Churchill was a harbour and Nelson was not.

After a railroad had been bu-ilt il was discovered that the shore was 100 low for the
construction of wharves in accordance- with
the design of the then Chief Engineer of the
Department of Railways and Canals, Mr.
Bowden; s0 it became necessary 10 place in
the middle of the sbream a sort of artificial
island on which 10 erect elevators. A cribwork sixty feet high-as high as tbis room,
or perhaps higher-and having a circumference
of a mile, was construcbed and filled in. As
that island was some 1,800 feet from the mainland, a twelve-span bridge had 10 be built.
The piers were put in and, I understand, the
spans were erected. That is why I asked
whether there wvas any salvage from the
bridge. Apparently il is 10 remain there as
a monument 10 the lack of understanding on
the part of governmenbs for the past thirty
years.

sixteen yeia-r had been in charge of niaviga-to-n

once that I knew Captain Max very well, because it so hcappened that for ten yeurs lie
wvas one of my teaotîs in Montreal. Every
time he lef t for Huidso-cn Bay I would soc him
off, and when he wouId corne back lie wou]d
show me a lot of photographs. The Hudson's
Bay Companny neyer allows ifs employeces to
giv-e out ainy information about anything, but
as Captain Max is no longer connected wif h
that compainy, there io ne harmi in telling you
that on rny necommendattion Hein. C. A.
Dunning engaged Captain Max, at a good
sala.ry, to take the second dredge to Port
Neltson. He did this without rnisadventure.
During his sixte-en years with the Hudson's
Bay Comapany lie neyver hýad an accident.
In reference to navigation I may say that
icebergs corne down into the Hudson Strait
froin Fox Channel. This ice is generally two
years old, and ice of tha~t age is as bard as a
rock. These growlers, ns they are called, are
very formidable, because only one-.eleventh
of them is visible. For every foot you sec
of an iceberg there is ten feet you do flot sec,
and sometimes they draw as much as four
or fl e Lundred feet of water. The pressure
of the wafer at five hundred feet is about
two hundred pounds te the square inch.
'rhese growlers are carried along by the undertow-the current below the surface. When
the tide cornes in the wateýr at the top moves
frsf; so the surface ice may flot be moving
in flic samne direction as the growlers; and if
the wind is favourable yon can hear for
miles the ýnoiýse they make ln crashing throughi
the surface ice. Whien a ship is caught in
tlie floafing ice slie tries to get, into wbat is
called soft ice and f0 keep ont of the way
of icebergs. 0f course, in ice a ship's rudder

of them she is doomed.

I will refer to Commander Wakeham.

on the ice, where she lay with her stays
hanging from the masfs like ribbons from a
May-pole. Captain Wakeham hýad ail the
boats Iowered and Ioaded with provisions, but
gradîîally the ice gave wvay, and when the
ship settled into the water again it was diseovered that site Lad flot even sprung aleak.
The first ship to go into the waters of
Hudson Bay for the Governent was the
Neptune, under Commander Low, of the
Geological Branch. To show you the type
of sLip required for navigation in the Hudson
Bay and Strait, I wiHl give you a description
of the Neptune. She was sheatbed with fourinch Britisht oak, then four inehes of greenLeart, and the space between the outside
planking and the lining was sol'idly filled witb
rock-ýsaIt, Ia this way the ship was made perfectly safe against any shock froma the exterior. SueL sLips aire made sau-cer-shaped,
so fhat when the ice presses against thern tbey
are lifted bodi.ly out of fthe water. The bow
of tLe Neptune was of solid t imber, eight
feet thick and sheathed with one inch of iron.
The f imbers inside were aIll laid crosswise, and

ivas left for cargo. AIl who have seen the

If any honourable gentleman wants ta confirmn what I say about conditions in Hudson
Bay and Strait, he can go ta the Department
of Public Works, as I ddid, and read the 1eg
of a ship in those waters. On the Rth of
August there were ice and fog in the strait,
and -one blade of the propeller was broken;
the next day more blades were broken; and it
was not until the 19th of August t1iat the
ship reached Port Nelson with only haîf af
oe propeller blade lef t. One must ha extremely optimistic ta think that such a route
as that is a commercial possibîlity.
I do nat know whether it is common knowledge that during the Great War the Hudson's
Bay Company was in charge cf freight for
England. That is how it happened that
Captain Max had ta go ta Archangel with the
ice breaker which wvas sent there, and wliich
released many British shîps that had been
caught in the ica. Another trip he made was
ta Bergen, which is the mast northerly port
of importance in Norway. 0f course, there
are other ports on the north ooast open all
the year round, because cf the influence cf the
Gulf Stiream. The Russian Prime Minister,
Kokovtsoff, was conspiring at that time with
Rasputin against the Alies, and when I asked
Captain Max, "What do you think ofth
Russian?" he said, "Well, you know, I don'
like the cut of his jib."
If it is thought dasirable to keep the Hudson
Bay route opan, vary well; but I do not think
any additional expenditures should be made
upon it. As a matter of fa-ct, I remembar that
when a ceitain witness before the Banking and
Commerce Gommitte was asked why more
shipments had net been made by the Hudson
Bay route, ha did net show any great enthusiasm. about it, and did not risc ta the
occasion.
Now just one word under the heading of
economy. The Welland Canal cost $125,000,000 ta build, and the interest during construction was $50,000,000. Weli, $175,000,000 at 4
per cent is exaotly $7,000,000 a year, and
the maintenance and operation charges are
$622,000, making the annual coist nearly
$8.000,000. Just the othecr day I heard the
Minîster of Finance say that the sugar tax
would bring in about 38,000,000. Sa approximately ail the money that will be collected
from the sugar tax will ba required ta pay
thesa charges on the Welland Canal. That
canal is built and we oannot get the money
back now, but I am bringing up the matter
because Lt contains a lesson for us. If that
canal cost s0 much money, how much would
a canal fromn Niagara ta Mon.treal ccrnt? I
would ask the Goverament ta listen ta the
Senate and te stop-I want ta emphasize that

word--sto)p making expenditures that aire nlot
absolutely necessary.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Honourable &enators, I should like to say a few words an
this subjeet that has been referred ta by my
honourabie friend fromn De Lanaudière (Hon.
Mr. ýCasgrain). The developmnent of the Port
Churchill route was brought about for twa
reasons: the West needed a cheap outiet for
its produce, and the East failed ta intereet
itself in Western trade ta the extent of providing such an outiet, althotigh we had one
of the largest natural transportation routes in
the world, namely the St. Lawrence. Sa I
have ne grudge against the West because of
the construction of the Hudson Bay route,
and anything I may say here will nlot be said
with a view ta diverting more business ta
Montreal. We often hear it stated in this
part of the country, and we see the statement
made in some ncevspapers, that the East paid
for the construction of railroads and virtually
bujît up the West. But this is a narrow argument. If $54,000,000 lias been spent on the
Hudson Bay route and terminal, and if the
cost of maintenance of that terminal strikes
some people as being extravagant, the East
must share the respansibility for what has
happened because of its failure to develop
the wonderful route provided by Nature between the West and the East. We see that
there is the less excuse for this failure when
we remaember that the development of transportation facilities across our coun.try was
one of the features upon which much stress
was laid at the time of <Jonfederation. Most
of the important speeches made then contained advice ta the growing generation ta
make adequate provision for carrying -the
produce. of the West te the East, and for
routing ail oue export shipmnents Vhrough our
own parts.
We have an enormous country, approxîmately four thousand miles wide from ocean
ta ocean. Unfortunately it is divided into,
two sections, not only by the Great Lakes, but
also by a rocky territory extending about one
thousand miles, which contains no agricultural
nor minerai lands. Haif of our country is
served by rail transportation alerne, and the
other haîf by rail and water. Transportation
by rail is fast and expensive; by water it -is
slow and oheap. There is great need, in the
West and the East alike, for the further
devedopment of aur natural water route. And
the West should be compensated in some way
for the long rail haul required by its grain.
Saskatoon, I think, might be called a division
point, ail the grain preduced west of there
going via the Vancouver route, and ail pro-

duced ýeast of there being shipped to the head
of the Lakes.*TI otber words, wheat grown in
the W'est is carried an average distance of 900
miles from the farm to the lake boat.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I think the honourable
gentleman is not quitc correct.
A comnparatively smnall portion of the grain grown in
the western part of Saskatchewvan gees to the
Pacifie coast, but ail the rest of the grain
grown in that province and to the east gocs
to Eastern ports.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The honourable gentleman's dividing line is about on1e hundred miles
out.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: I am glad of the
correction. But for the sake of argument let
us say that the lengthi of the average haul
by rail is about 900 miles. The maximum
cost of carrying grain that distance to a lake
port is 18 cents per bushel.
Hon. G. V. WHITE: Does any part of that
grain go by Hudson Bay?
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: I am not criticizing
the Hudson Bay route. I hold the view that
that route xvas made necessary because the
East failed to develop the natural water route
which would have given the West cheap
transportation. The people of the West would
flot have mn4'îed upon the cpening of a port
in Hudson Bay if they had been able te,
ship their grain by a chcap water rute direct
to Montreal or Quebec.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: If the bionourable
gentleman does flot intend to cr-iticize the
Hudson Bay route, he is flot speaking to the
motion.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: I am speaking to
the motion, for I amn giving the reason why
the Hudson Bay route was built. As I have
said, the leng-th of the average baul of grain
from the West to a port on the lakes is about
900 miles, and the cost of that long haul resuits in a very heavy burden on the West.
OJur Western farmers need some kind of comxpensation to enable theým to compete with
grain producers in other counitries. Ia the
Argentine, for example, the length of the
average baul of grain by rail is only 210 miles;
in Auistralia 215 miles; in Russia 3.50 miles,
and in Inýdia 550 miles.
The cost of bringing wheat from Fort William to either Montreal or New York during
the past ten years bas been about 8ý or 9
cents a bushel. I amn not, of course, referring
to the special rates that have been in effeet
for the last two years. So it wvill be seen
that the rail and water rates total 26 cents a
bushel. Now, I wonder how h should feel if
Hon. 'Mi. EAINS 1L5E.

I were a Western farmner and had to pay 26
cents a bushel to send my wheat to the seaboard, when the sale price was 48 cents.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: It was 48 cents at
Fort William.
Hon. Mr. RAINVIL-LE: The charge fromn
the farmi to Fort William is on the farmer.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Will the bonourable

gentleman permit -me to interrupt bim? The
rate of 18 cents is per bundredweight, not per
Dushel.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It makes a big
difference whether it is per 60 porunds or 100
pound.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Witbout the waterway that we have to-day, not a single bushel
of grain would corne east for export.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The Transcontinental
was built to carry wheat froým Armstrong to
Quebec at 61 cents a bushel.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Yes, but it was

unprofltable business for the railway. At the
present time the Canadian Pacifie and the
Canadian National can charge for bauling grain
from bay ports to Halifax and Saint John
only the saine rate that is ebarged froza
Buffalo to New York. But the distance
between Buffalo and New York is only 400
moileis, whereas fromn bay ports to Saint John
it is 900 miles, and to Halifax nearly 1,200
miles. The two railways admit that they are
losing money at these rates, and they are not
cager to get the business. That is why there
are almost no exports of grain via Halifax
and Saint John, and why New York gets
nearly aIl the business that should be going to
these ports.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The Transcontinental
was built for hauling grain.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: But to-day we are
trying to make the Transcontinental pay.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Haîf of it bas been
abandoned. How can it be made to pay?
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: 1 arn seeking to
show that if we bad only an aIl-rail route in
this country not a single bushel of grain
xxould pass tbrough our Eastern ports for
shipment abroad. A f ew years ago we tried
the experiment of bringing coal from Alberta
to Ontario. The haulage was not very great,
but tlic e\perimilt proved a complete failure
and I believe the railroads are not continuing
it. Our railroads were built to supplement the
water route, and without a water route we
could not give the people of the West a rate
low ùnough to induce themi to export their
produets via our Eastern seaboard.

MAY 4, 1933
Billions of dollars have been spent on our
railroads. For example, the outlay on the
Hudson Bay line bas been $54,000,000, and in
Montreal we have started on a terminal
that was estimated to cost 850,000,000. On
the Welland Canal we have spent $128,000,000.
But what bas been the expenditure for the
improvement of our water route? I want to
cati the attention of honourable members
to the fact that during the last 110 years
the dredging of the St. Lawrence from
Montreal down to Quebec has cost us only
$35,000,000, and of this sumn $13,000,000 was
paid to the shipyard at Sorel for the building
and repairing of dredges. I mention this
because it may be that many honourable
members are of opinion that the dredging of
the St. Lawrence channel from Montreal eastward lias cost an immense sumn of money.
whereas the fact is that the actual expenditure over the last 110 years lias been only
$22,000,000.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Is that not enough?
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: It is very little
in comparison with the sum spent on the
Welland Canal and on our railroads. We
are Iosing a large amount of money every
year because of our negleet to improve the
St. Lawrence route as it sbould have been
improved. The marine insurance rates on
shipments via the St. Lawrence are and
always have hpen double the rates via New
York. We have to pay 5 per cent on bull
and cargo, as compared with the New York
rate of 2-4 per cent. Taking into account
only the sbipments that are made from
Montreal, excluding those that go from Sorel,
Tbree Rivers and Quebec, we find we are
paying for bull insurance alone two and a
half million dollars more than we should have
to pay if the shipments went via New York.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
Each year?
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Eaeh year. On
cargoes the excess cost of insurance amounts
to another 31,000,000. This makes a total of
$3,500,000. We appreciate the six-cent British
preference on our wheat shipped direct te
Great Br-itain from Canadian ports. The
sbipments of Canadian grain via New York
for the past ten years have averaged between
seventy and eighty million bushels a year.
If this business were diverted to the St.
Lawrence route we should have to pay, on
account of the double rate, a furtber exeess

of

$1,500,Meo

for

insuranoe.

Altogether

.$5,000,009 a year oould lie saved by improving
the St. Lawrence ebannel. Would this possible saving of $5,000,000 a year not make it
wortb our wbile to try to take good care of
our ehannel between Montreal and the sea,
and finish the good work begun in 1825?

457

As I said at the outset, I have no grudge
against the West. I do not blame our wheat
growers for seeking a cbeap outlet to the sea.
I repeat, if there is any blame at ail, it is
for our negleet to -make sale the route tbat
Nature bas provided for us. It sbouki lie
made so safe that exported grain and imported goods would, fot be overtaxed for insurance, and the returns te the farmers of the
West would be inmproved by a reduetion in
the cost of transporting their wonderful wheat
to the markets of the world.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Gillis, the debate
was adlourned.

STATEMENT

Hon. R. DANDURAND: Honourable senators, on Wednesday last the bonourable
member from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Wilson) put
a question to the right honourable leader of
the House (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), asking
why bis name did not appear on any of our
committees. I was absent on that day, but
I bave read bis remarks in Hansard. The
rigbt bonourable gentleman, being somewbat
unfamiliar witb the practice of the Committee of Selection, was unable to answer the
question. I do not complain of bis inability
to deal with the matter, for he is a new-comer
and is better acquainted witb tbe custoins of
the House of Commons, which do not coincide with ours.
TIhe answer is fairly simple:- it is because
of the absence of the honourable senator
f or Riga,,ud during the sesýsions of 1930, 1931
and 1932. Owing to illness he was unable to
attend, except to be introduced, during the
session of 1931. Altbough tbe bionourable
gentleman was present at tbe opening of this
session, we were informed that he wvas still
ailing and would not be able to attend our

proper to impose upon him the responsibility
of committee membersbip. Fortunately, witbin six weeks the honourable gentleman
recovered bis health and was able to assume
bis senatorial duties. We are most happy
tu bave bim amongst us again, and we hope
be will long continue to serve the public
weal.
I may say that in consonance witb our
tenure of office, appointments to the various
committees are deemed to be for life; cons-equently it bas been somewbat difficult to
place new-comers on some of the committees, for, except in case of prolong-ed illness,
tbe appointments are very seldom disturbed.
I recaîl a few comparatively recent cases
in wbicb, after members of certain committees liad been unable to attend for two consecutive sessins, we felt free to drop them
and appoint newv-comers in their stead. It
is much easier to place than to disphace.

MAY 9, 1933
Now, wi'th his health fully restored, my
-honourable friend will be able to render very
useful service on our committeesl. He bas
been a successful business man, and, having
been a large importer, he is conversant with
many of the laws and policies which corne
before us for review. He has also taken a
deep interest in agriculture. I remnember
when, a few years ago, I was asked to deliver
,over the air a lecture advising young men to
remain on the farm, I received from the honýourable gentleman a memorandum indicating
'what should be done to improve conditions in
our rural districts in order to make life more
interesting and attractive ta 'the farming
cammuniity. lIt was a well thought out document whi-ch showed a grasp of the problem.
TlTndoubtedly, both in business and in agricultural matters he will be able to give us
valuable advice.
Whîle on this subject of standing coinmittees I should like to tell my calleagues
something of the task of the strikîng committee. We mu.st give to the four great
sections of this country, the Western Provinces, Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritimes,
fair representation on aIl committees, and at
the same time strive to maintain an even
balance between the two parties. It is, I
believe, in this instance anly that party
affiliations appear on the surface and impose
themselves -on our attention. Most of our
committees are sinaîl. A year or two ago we
enlarged a few of thein. We might well
consider the advisability of enlarging most
of the cammittees. As I said a moment ago,
by tradition the appointments to the variaus
committees are continued from session to
session except in case of transfer front one
committee to another. If at the opening of
the session there is a vacancy in the representation of one of our geographical groups,
it is generally filled hy the a.ppointment of
a member frorm the sa-me section and the
same political party as the departed senator.
Another feature that must flot be lost sight
of is the seniority ru-le. Members on both
sides of the House go to their leaders, or to
members of the striking coinmittee, and express a desire to be put on certain committees,
but I know of a nuiuber of sny colleagues who,
in consequence of the sQeniority rule, have had
to wait two or three years before securing a
place on the conimittee on which they desired
to serve. I may say that for same years past
we have practically comimandeered a certain
number of senators to sit on the Divorce Committee and perform a very disagreeable task.In some caises they aocepted with great reluctance. When there were some three hundred applications to be dealt with, these gen-

459

tlemen sacrificed their time in the mornings
and afternoons, and sometimes in the evenings, and by reason of their service on thîs
committee were deprived of the advantage of
meinhership in committees on which t-hey
would have preferred to serve.
I -mention these things so, that my honourable colleagues may -have some idea of the
difficulty of for'ming the various cominittees.
Even though we do our utmost, we are unable
to satisfy everybody. We cannot appoint the
whole rnembership of the Senate to committees, for the limitation im.posed by thib
Huse permits of the appointment of only
fifty per cent of our memhership. I hope my
honourable colleagues who surround me, and
for whom, in part, I have been acting, along
witb other members of the Commiittee of
Selection, will understand that whatever may
have been our faults of omission or commission-and in regard to those I beg their kind
indulgence-our efforts have always been
directed towards doing our very best on their
behalf.

HUDSON

BAY TERMINAIS

INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

The Senate resumed from May 4 the debate
on the question proposed by Hon. Mr. Casgrain:
To cail the attention of the Senate to the
cost of developrnent, work and other germane
expenditure at Fort Churchill and Port Nelson,
and inquire what economies the Government
proposes to make in connection with those
ports.
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Honourable senators, I
very much regret that the honourable gentleman who brought this question before the
House is not in his seat to-day. This subject
lias been so often debated in this bouse and

460

SENATE

elsewhere that I think it is hardly necessary
for me to say very much, particularly in view
of the fact that the railroad is now completed
and the feasibility of the scheme is bevond
question. The honourable senator who bas
called attention to the matter seems to be
unable to refrain from indulging in criticism of
the Hudson Bay project whenever the opportunity offers. The mere mention of the
Hudson Bay Raiiway is to him like the
proverbial red rag to a bull. He is ready to
argue against it t any time.
The Hudson Bay Railway bas been a live
issue in Western Canada for many years. In
my first political campaign for election to the
Territorial Legislature, forty years ago, it was
one of the questions with which we had to
deal, and from that time on every local and
federal election was fought to a greater or less
degree on the question of the Hudson Bay
Railway. I think I can safely say that all
the people of Manitoba and ninety per cent
of the people of Saskatchewan are a unit in
favour of this route. They have been advocating it during all these years in the hope
that when completed and in operation it would
be of great advantage to the Western Provinces. Manitoba and Saskatchewan, with a
population of 1,621,924, are surely entitled to
have their desire in this respect gratified.
I quite agree with the honourable senator
from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain)
that it was most unfortunate that Nelson was
selected in the first instance rather than
Churchill-an error which resulted in the
waste of several million dollars. Wbere the
fault lay I cannot say defnitely, but I presume it was to a large extent due to the
reports made by the engineers from time to
time. It is net my intention to go into the
details of this phase of the question, as the
facts are well known to everyone.
The honourable gentleman also referred to
the country tributary to the Hudson Bay Railway as a "God-forsaken country." One would
infer from his statement that it was of no
value whatsoever, and that there was notbing
to induce people to sele there. Yet we find
that there are thousands of acres of good,
arable land adjacent to the railroad for two
or three hundred miles north of the Pas;
furthermore, that area is known to be rich
in minerals-there is one mine to-day producing at the rate of 840,000 a diay-and there
is a large quantity of timber fit for pulpwood
and other purposes. Besides. there are huge
lakes teeming with the finest fish in the world.
With the permission of the House I will
read a statement by Mr. W. A. Thornton, who
Hon. Mr. GILLIS.

was for a number of years the Auditor of the
Hudson Bay line:
A large portion of the country through which
the line runs is fit for agriculture, and will
soie day provide desirable traffic for the line.
The railway authorities should interest themselves in colonization movements and induce
settlers of the pioneer type to corne into this
belt.
That indicates the honourable gentleman's
description of the territory adjacent to the
railway is absolutely inaccurate.
The honourable gentleman dealt at considerable length with the alleged difficulties
in navigating the straits. He contended that
these difficulties were almost insurmountable
and that only ships with what he called
"saucer bottoms" can be safely operated there.
Now, we find that last season, when the first
real experiment in shipping out of Churchill
was made, ten vessels arrived safely at that
port and none of them was of the "saucer
bottom" type. They were loaded with wheat
to a total of almost 3,000,000 bushels, and
with one exception they all returned with
their cargoes to Liverpool or other European
ports. Unfortunately, the Bright Fan struck
an iceberg.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
Or an iceberg
struck ber.
Hon. Mr. CILLIS: The accident occurred
a few hours after the ship had left Churchill
Harbour. It has been alleged in another place
t.hat the ship was deliberately wrecked; that
no proper look out was kept on board, although a warning had been given to the
officers of the presence of icebergs in the
bay; that the crew were celebrating shortly
before they left the harbour, and that at the
time of the accident the captain was in bed
and the second officer in the chart-room, the
only person on any part of bthedeck being a
boy at the wheel. I cannot vouch for the
accuracy of those statements, but they have
been made on more than one occasion. I
think the most charitable conclusion we can
corne to is that but for the utter earelessness
of those in charge the ship would have
arrived safely on the other side of the Atlantic, as the nine other ships did. The honourable gentleman sought to condemn this route
because of that single accident. Accidents
of a far more serious nature have occurred in
almost every navigable water in the world,
yet none of those waters has been abandoned
by navigators on that account. On the Atlantic Ocecan itself about twenty years ago there
was one of the greatest disasters that have
ever oecurred at sea, when the Titantic struck
an iceberg and sank, and thirteen hundred or
more lives were lost.

MAY 9, 1933
Front the Hudson's Bay Company's log book,
over the period fromi 1825 to 1894, a table was
icoinpiled by the late Senator Ferguson, of
Prince Edward Island, .showing the length of
the open scason on the bay.
The longest
open season was 5 months and 18 days, and
the shortest was 4 months and 8 days. The
following interesting testànony was given by
Dr. Robert Bell, who I think was connected
wi-th the University of Manitoba, with regard
týo other points in the bay somewhat south
,of Churchill:
1 have a record of the principal phenomnena
of the seasons at Martin's Falls, on the Albany,
extending through a period of fifty years, and
fron it I find that the river is open there on
an average of six months in the year. 1 have
aiso a record of the dates of opening and
eulosing of Hayes river at York Factory, extending over more than fifty years, from which it
appears te enjoy an average of f ully six months
of open water. The Nelson river is open for
a longer period.
I should aIse like -to quote from. the testimony given ýbefore a committee of this House
a few years ago by Captainý Bernier, an
explorer and celcbrated navigator, with whomn
a number of honourable
members are
acquainted. On a couple of occasions in the
last year or two I have had the pleasure of
conversing with him. I arn sure that no one
\vould for a moment question the accuracy of
bis statement.
Ha says:
The Hudson B3ay and Strait are open te
navigation the year around, but as far as the
strait je concerned icebergs block the way in
places according to where the current into or
ont of the bay drives them. With wireless
stations established se that ships could be

wotuld rank arnengst the most important on the
continent. owing to the very appreciaible difference in distance to Europe com'pared with that
of other ports.
I think the twe statements I have read
should carry much more weight than thýose
of the honoiirahle gentleman who began the
deba-te (Hon. Mr. CasgraÀn), who, se, far as I
know, bas neyer had any personal experience
in the Hudson Bay country.
The test shipments macle from Churchill
last year proved that, despite adverse conditions existing on the newly-established. route,
wheat produced in northern Saskatchewan was
landed in Europe at a cost approximately 4ý
centsq a bushel less than it would have been if
the shipments had been made through Mentrmal. Let us look at the facts. The insurance
rate via Churchill je five times as high as that
via Montreal. The total insurance on a cargo
of 280,000 bushels out of Churchill would be
$2,100, as cempared with M50out of Montmral. In the last day or two I have learned
that the Government -of Saskatchewan has
succeeded in arranging with Lloyd's of London
for a reduotion of 33J per cent in insurance
charges on shipments out of. Churchill, which
reductien should be a great benefit to that
port.
Test âipments of flour were also macle fromn
Churchill, and it was found that a 100-pound
sack could be landed at Liverpool for 19 cents
less -than if shipped hy Montreal.
It is interesting to compare the rail rates
on live stock from Western points to Churchill, with the rate to Montreal. Here are soe

I tbink honourable sanaters will agree that
w%%hen Hludson Bay route is well established
the
and up-to-date steamers are plying into and
eut of Churchll the advantage to the people
of the West in shipping. via that route will be
very great. It is difficult to. understand why

New York. As pointed eut the other day
by the ionourable gentleman from Repentigny
.(Hon. Mr. Rainville), we have not complete
facilities- fo r shipping to Montreal or othar
ports in Eastern Canada. Why sh-ould we
net try to build up the Hud~son Bay route
with a view to diverting to it much of the
grain that we now ship through the United
States?

SENATE
We must remember that only a comparatively .small portion of the Prairie Provinces
is under cultivation at present; there are
millions of acres of virgin soil in the West.
In the course of a relatively short time, when
this land is being worked, we shahl be producing enough grain te supply tonnage for
Montreal and Vancouver, as well as Churchill.
Therefore I think every encouragement should
be given te the effort te mnake the Hudson
Bay route usable.
'I believe it cao be safely said that in a few
years the republie te the south of us will be
importing rather than experting wheat and
other grains. In 1931 the United States produced 800,880,000 bushels of wheat, and in
1932 the production was 700.200,000, a decrease of 100,680,000 bushels. But Canada in
1931 produced 300,040,000, and last year
400,320,000 bîîsbels, an inereasp of 100,280,000.
These figures show that our production is increasing rapidly, whereas that of the United
States is decreasing.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Wi'll the 'honourable gentleman allow me te ask him a question? \Vas that inerease of production in the
Canadian West due te a better crop or te a
larger acroage?
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: The year 1931 was an
off year, and iii 1932 aIse the production was
comparatively low. 1 tbink three or four
years ago weo produced nearly 500,000,000
bushels of m-bea-t in tbe Western Provinces.
Hon. Mr. FOliKE: In 1928.
Hon. Mivr.GILLIS: 0ur population is only
one-twclfth of that of thbe United States, yet
in 1932 we produced more tban haîf as moch
wbeat as that country did. Canada is able
te grow more grain of the highest quality than
any other country in the world except the
UJnited States. Should we net take advantage
of this fact and endeavour te increase our
production te the greatest possible extent?
My chief purpose in rising was te point
eut a few facts witb regard te the Hudson
Bay route. The people of the West are deeply
interested in tbis route, and there is every
reason why the East sbould be equally interested, for if the routing of grain via
Churchill results in higher profits te the producers, the country as a wbole will benefit.
We should look upon thýis new northern route
from a national rather than a provincial standpoint.
Hon. F. L. SCHAFFNER: Honourable
senators, as 1 have lived for more than fifty
years in the wondorful Province of Manitoba,
I teed it bebooves me te try te refute some
Hon.

Mr. GILLIS.

of the remarks of my honourable friend from
De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain).
H1e
hias always taken a deep and intelligent interest in transportation prohlems, in which heis justly considered an expert, and on many
occasions in the paSt sixteen years it hias been
my privilege te listcn to bis expositions on
tbis subject, but I must confess that I think
he has net addcd te his reputatien by his
crjticism of the Hudson Bay route. I have
(arefully ctudied his addreýss of last Thur..day,
and cannot help feeling that in the back of
bis mind be is unfairly pre.judiced against this
new sea route, which I believe is bound te>
become of tremendous importance te the
Prairie Provinces.
During the half century that I have liad
the lbeneur of being a resident of Manitoba
that route lias been a political football. Even
when I went eut there first une party or the
otber w'as advocating tbe building of a road
te Hudson Bay.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Both parties were.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Everytbing possible has bren done to make tbe sea route te,
Chîurcihill available and safe for the carrying
of grain and cattle. Ail modern aids te navigation bai e been establislied. including radio
sta tiens for tbe direction of sbips tbrough
areas in which, on account of proximity te tbe
magnetic pole, cempass readings are unrolijable.
Io September, 1931, two tramp steamers
were cb:îrtered for test sbil)ments frorn
Churchill.
Tbe Farnwortb came into tbat
port on September 10, was loadcd witb 277,000
b)lsbels of w'beat, ýzailed on tbe 17tb, and
arrived at Albert Decks on October 4; and
the WVarkworth, whicb arrived at Churchill on
September 17, took on 267,769 bushels, sailed
on September 21, and reached Antwerp on
October 13. Arrangements for tbeïse sbips were
made by tbe Dominion Government, wbile tbe
shipments of wbeat were provided by John
McFarlane, of tbe Canadian Wbeat Pool. No
untoward incidents marked tbe voyage of
tbese '%
essels te Hudson Bay or tbeir rcturn
voyage te Europe. The success4ul completion
of the trial trips marks the endl of the first
stage of tbe prolect te give Western Canada
more convenient acess te tbe markets of
Europe.
The proposal te build a railway lino te,
Hudson Bay and establish an ocean port at
Nelson or Churchill was before the publie
for fifty years. The Prairie Provinces favoured
the undertakîng, but Eastern Canada demurred, on the ground that the cost wvould

MAY 9, 1933
exceed any potential benefits. The completion
of the project was due ultimately to the increasing importance of Western Canada, political and economic, and 'the deep-seated sentiment of ithe people that sucb a route would
bring the advantage of ocean transport a
thousand miles nearer to Western producers.
Churchill stands in the same relation to
the Western Provinces as do Fort William
and Port Arthur. The distance from Churchill to Liverpool is 40 miles shorter than from
Montreal, that is, 2,967 as agaiinst 3,007 miles.
Hence the great advantage of shipping by
the northern port is that this route eliminates
distance equal to that between the head of
the Lakes and Montreal.
Let me give honourable members comparative distances from points in Western
Canada to Churchill and to Montreal:

At the present time freight and handling
charges on the Eastern route, that is, fro-m
Port Arthur and Fort William to Montreal,
represent about 8J cents a bushel. As my
honourable friend fromn Repentigny (Hon.
Mr. Rainville) stated last week, the opening
oif the St. Lawrence Waterway will lead to a
reduction in these charges. I was pleased
with his remarks. While he mildly criticized
the building of the Hudson Bay Railway, he
mentioned a very important factor that led
tte people of the Prairie Provinces to
endeavour to establish a new route, namely,
the neglect of Eastern Canada to provide
proper transportation by improving the St.
Lawrence Waterway.
While a member of the other House I
Iistened to several debates on the practieability of the Hudson Bay route, and since
I took my seat. in this Chamber the subject
bas been frequently discussed. It takes time
to demonstrate the possibilities of a shipping
route. Even the port of Vancouver, whicb is
fast becoming our maj or grain-shipping port,
met with opposition at first. It was claimed
that wheat could neyer be transported
through the Panama Canal, as in its passage
through the Canal Zone the heat and moisture
would swell the cargo and buret the ships.
Fortunately these fears proved to be groundless. The first shipment of grain from Vancouver was in 1909-a shipment of 50,000
busheles aked. The firat bulk grain cargo,
consisting of 500,000 bushels, wais ehipped

463

from Vancouver in 1921. Figures prepared by
the Statistical Department of the Board of
Grain Commissioners show that from August
1, 1931, to July 31, 1932, out of a total of
173,000,000 bushels of Canadian wheat exported, 76,000,000 bushels were shipped through
Vancouver, 64,000,000 bushels through Eastern
Canadian ports, and 33,000,000 bushels through
United States ports. I should like to suggest
to my honourable friends from Eastern
Canada that there is a possibility of a very
large proportion of the grain now shipped
through Montreal being routed through
Churchill.
In addition to the transportation of wheat,
we believe the Hudson Bay route is going to
be of the utmost importance in the shippîng
of cattle. My honourable friends from Calgary
(Hon. Mr. Burns) and High River (Hon. M.r.
Riley). who are large exportera of cattle, may
not agree with me, but I have always understood tha-t cattle lose weight during a long
rail journey, but that, on the contrary, they
gain weight during an ocean voyage. If my
understanding is correct, then the advantage
of the Hudson Bay route for the shipping of
cattle is obvious.
In Western Canada there is no antipathy
against Mon-treal or the East. The people
of the Western Provinces believe that Hudson B-ay is the cheapest possible route for
exporting to the Old Country their grain and
cattle and any other commodities they may
produce. Montreal is a great manufaoturing
and commercial city, and every citizen of
Canada is proud of it. There can be no doubt
that both Montreal and Toronto have been
built up to a considerable extent by their
trade with Western Canada, where we have
a consuming population of over 3,000,000.
While there are a few manufaeturing industries in the West, and I hope te see more
established, they are utterly inadequate to
supply the West with farm machinery and
other manufactured goods. Therefore the
more money the people of 'the Prairie Provinoes can make, the more they will have to
buy goods fromn Montreal and Toronto, but
principally, I think, from Montreal.
W-hen last week my honourable friend from
De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) introduced this subject he referred to the attempt
to establish a port at Nelson. My right honourable friend from Eganville (Right Hon.
Mr. Graham) is not in his seat at the moment,
but I think he wil -agree with me that both
political parties mu-et share the responsibility
for any work donc at Nelson. My honourable friend from Saska-tchewan (Hon. Mr.
Gillis) has said that no doubt the Govern-

SENATE
ment of the day acted on the advice of its
engineers in selecting Nelson as the terminal
for the Hudson Bay Railway. I remember
very distinetly, and I dare say those of my
colleagues who were formerly in the other
House will also recall, the numerous meetings
of the committee which investigated the Hudson Bay route and the suitability of Nelson
as the terminal. To-day, I am confident, most
people wonder why any attempt was ever
made to establish a port at Nelson. I understand that 'all parties in the other House
approved the action of the then Government
in selecting Mr. Palmer, an eminent British
authority on ports and harbours, to visit
Nelson and Churchill and advise whether or
not Nelson should be abandoned in favour of
Churchill. After a very thorough investigation he recommended that Churchill should
be selected as the port and that the necessary
terminal facilities should be constructed. I
understand there is deep wa-ter from the Bay
to the port, and that the wharf is sufficient
to accommodate three large ships, while there
is anchorage for three more. As honourable
members are aware, there is an elevator at
Churchill with a capacity of 2,500,000 bushels,
and the unloading facilities will take care of
400 cars a day. It is said that during the
ordinary season of navigation, extending over
about two and a half months, there would
be no difficulty in loading 28,000,000 bushels
of grain. Once more I would impress on my
honourable friends from Montreal that there
is every probability of at least three-quarters
of the grain of the Prairie Provinces finding,
in the near future, an outiet at Churchill. I
think that in the long run this will not
prejudicially affect the port of Montreal, for
it must always continue tu be one of our
greatest national ports.
Last week rny honourable friend from De
Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) said that
someone had warned him, "Never try to convince anybody unless you are paid to do so."
I do not know that I ever heard a similar
warning, but perhaps it is familiar to lawyers.
He also said:
Tn goOd ye.ars I an paid $4,000 a session,
aml T take it that I should earn my indemnity
hb tryiîng to convince the country of the folly
1
of spend ing money on unprofitable public
works.
I think all honourable members will agree
with tiat excellent doctrine. I had not the
honour to be a member of this House when
the Transcontinental and Grand Trunk railways were projected. The building of these
two railways involved a tremendous capital
outlay. and some of our railway worries today may be traced to that expenditure. If
Hion. Mr. SCHAFFNER.

T con-ulted Hansard I might be able to ascertain whether my honourable friend from De
Lanaudière opposed those two projects. I
think I am correct in saying that one very
honourable gentleman was se strongly opposed
to the railway policy of the Government of
bhat day that he resigned his portfolio. But
I do not think we should be unduly pessimistic in regard to the railway situation. Our
two great railway systems did pretty well
when times were good, and I am confident
that with a revival of trade they will corne
into their own.
The Hudson Bay route is of the utmost importance to the people of the West, and I
would ask our friends in Eastern Canada to
give it a fair chance. As I bave said, the
people of the Prairie Provinces believe that in
the Hudson Bay route they have the cheapest
means of transporting their products to the
Old Country. And I repeat, the more prosperous are we in the West the better it will
be for Eastern Canada, and especially for
Montreal and Toronto. There is no question
about that. I think I am right in saying that
the great majority of the farm implements
used in the three Prairie Provinces are manufactured in Ontario and Quebec. Can you
blame the farmers of the West for endeavouring to secure, aven though it involve considerable expense, a route by which they can more
cheaply and more quickly ship their products
to Europe?
I have beard the objection that grain
Shipped by way of Churchill bad to remain in
that port for a considerable period, as it could
not be shipped out before the month of
August. In respect to the season of navigation I would refer bonourable gentlemen to
the late Senator Ferguson, of Prince Edward
Island, who made a very strong speech in
favour of the route. I have no doubt the
honourable leader on the other side of the
Hou-e (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) remembers
him. He was a very fine man. He took as
the basis of his remarks the period of navigation, not for a year here and there, nor for a
few years onlv, but for fifty alternate years.
This, I think it will be admitted, is the fair
way-.
My honourable friend from Saskatchewan
(Hon. Mr. Gillis) referred to the ship that
was lost last summer. We all regret the
occurrence. Many people felt that it gave a
black eye to the route. I have in my hand
the report of the commission which investigated the wvreck. I cannot bring myself to
believe that the captain and the officers of a
ship would make a deliberate attempt to
destroy her. While that.theory may seem to

have some foundation in fact, I have nlot
much sympathy with it, and arn not inclined
to place much confidence in the statement
that such an attiempt was actually made. We
do know that the ship was a long way off her
course, and that during the most hazardous
part of the voyage a fifteen-year-old apprentice was assigned to the duty of keeping:
watch. I .may say in .passing t-hat icebergs
neyer appear in Hudson Bay; they are ail to
be found in the strait. The strait, if my
figures are correct, varies in width from. fifty
to one hundred miles. Even though a vessel
is completely equipped with applianees for
safety, while she is passing through the
strait a sharp look out is necessary. The
report to which I have referred, and which
honourable gentlenmen have seen, is viery
fair. 'It said that there was too much liquor
on board this ship. The investigating commission found that this was not correot. Liquor
may be blamed for many things, but it was
flot to blame for the loss of this ship.
The honourable gentleman from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) referred to the loss
of a 8400,000 dredge. Why he did that in
discussing the Hudson Bay route I do not
know. This dredge was lest, nlot in Hudson
Bay nor in the strait, but off the coast of
Labrador, half-way between the Strait of Bel-le
Isle and Cape Ch-idley.
,If honourable 'members will look et Hudson
Bay on the map of Canada, as I have often
done, they will ob§erve how far that great
inland ocean, with over two thousand miles of
coast-line, extends into the interior of the
country, and how near it is to the wheatproducing provinces of the Prairies. In so
placing it, Providence has done mueh to
aflord the people of the Prairies a gateway
through which they may export their cattie
and their grain, an.d it is *my belief that in
opposing this route the people of the East are
trying to obstruct the design of Providence.
Hon. C. IC. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
gentlemen, I had not intended to say anything on t-his subjeet, but in referenoe to the
remarks of the honourahie senator from
Winnipeg~
Hon. Mr. MeMVEANS: ¶ beg the honourable gentleman's pardon. I have made no
remarks.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: -the honourable senator who bas just resumed his seat, the
honourable member from. Boissevaîn (Hon.
Mr. Schaffner), who has laid great stress upon
what he apparently regards as Eastern antagonism, I may say to him that the people
of the city of Montreal and of the province

from which I have the honour to corne have
no hostile feeling whatsoever towards the
Hudson Bay route. We believe in the unity
of Canada. The more each and every province grows and prospers the better it will
be for the country as a whole. Certainly if
the people of Quebec entertained the ideas
that the honourable gentleman seems to think
they entertain, we should nlot be exhibiting
that national feeling which we think is so
desirable.
Hlaving had some years of experience as
Harbour Commissioner of Montreal, and having been also, for some four or five years,
Minister of Marine and Fisheries, I know
that grain always follows the cheapest route.
There is no sentiment in connection with the
shipment of grain. If in the future the
Hudson Bay route should prove to be ail that
my honoiirahle friend bas so eloquently
picturedý, so much the better. The orily
criticism of that route that I have ever heard
in Eastern Canada was that before the establighment at Nelson of a port, whiceh h-ad to be
transferred to Churchill at a cost of $6,000,000,
a careful survey should have been made by
competent and experienced navigators in order
that the facts in regard to safety and climatie
conditions might be ascertained.
One thing that I have learned from. talking
to shipping men is that you cannot expect to
develop a very great grain trade through
Hudson Bay unless you induce return cargoes.
The carniage of grain alone does not pay. 1
srncerely trust that in the very near future
large cargoes and many ships will corne from
the ports of the Old World to Fort Churchill,
and that the development of that port will
justify the $55,000,000 which bas been spent
upon it. We in the East may be rather impatient, but what disappoints us is that more
bas not been donc by the people of the West.
A 2,000,000-bushel elevator bas been erected,
the service of which bas been given free to
the Western shipper.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Just for last year.
Hon. Mr. 13ALLANTYNE: Yes, and the
present tirne. The Government bas donc
everything it could to make the route a
successful one for the shipping of grain.
Possibly I should not offer any advice to my
Western friends, but I arn going to dare to
do so. I think they ought to do more than
they have done to encourage shipment via
Hudson Bay. Why do they not induce the
wholesalers of Winnipeg and other Western
cities to have their goods routed to them
tliat way?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER:

They are doing

s0.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Only to a very
limited extent. I think a great deal more
could be done in that regard.
Before I resume my seat I should like to
say to ail Western senators that they must
disabuse their minds at once of the idea that
there is animosity or antagonism on the part
of Easterners in reference to the Hudson Bay
or any other route. It was a great pleasure
for me, when I was Minister of Marine, to
see how the port of Vancouver was developing the grain business. When I was in Vancouver in 1920 only a negligible quantity of
grain was shipped from that port; last year
there were shipped 114,000,000 bushels, 75,000,000 of which were wheat. That was very
pleasing to me as an Easterner, and was pleasing also, I am sure, to ail the people of Canada, from one coast to the other. Anything
that the East can do by joining hands with
our friends in the West to develop the Prairies
will certainly be regarded as both a pleasure
and a privilege. We never can build up Canada in the way that we hope for if one province entertains the idea that another province
is hostile, and my only object in rising at this
time is to sav that there is no feeling of
hostility in the city of Montreal or in the
province from whieh I come.
Hon. J. [S. MeLENNAN:
Honourable
gentleman, I should like to correct the
honourable gentleman from Boissevain (Hon.
Mr. Schaffner). If I remember correctly what
bas been said with respect to the Hudson Bay

route by the honourable senator for De
Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) during the
sixteen years or so that I have been a member
of this Hou-e, his opposition was directed
mainly against the selection of Port Nelson as
the terminal of the Hudson Bay Railway; and
results have proved the soundness of his judgment in that respect.
I should like to associate myself with the
honourable gentleman who has just taken his
seat (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) in protesting
against the feeling of our friends from the
West that there is in the East hostility to
this project. Quite apart from the principles
of patriotism, of which he has spoken, or
the mutual dependence of the provinces, there
is a third material reason-and it is worldwide-why those peculiarly interested in
established ports, such as Montreal, should
feel that there is no danger arising from the
establishment of rival routes. If you survey
the history of the development of the various
ports of Europe you will find that every
Hon. Mr., BALLANTYNE.

established port which has increased its
facilities has secured a proportionate increase
of business. Take for instance Glasgow, on
an almost fordable stream; or Liverpool,
where, if the tide is out, we can see as we
leave by train the early development of the
port. Take Antwerp, Rotterdam, Hamburg,
Cherbourg-a port into which the largest
ships can now go. Ail have increased their
business. Then we have our own port of
Montreal. The outstanding case is that of
Liverpool. Manchester found its trade slipping away, and the people of that city
determined to make it a seaport. They did
so by raising a sum of money and building
the Manchester ship canal. It looked then
as if Liverpool were going to lose at one
blow a great part of its trade, namely, the
incoming supply of raw cotton, and the cotton
goods going out to ahl parts of the world.
Hitherto this trade had been carried on
exclusively through the port of Liverpool.
Liverpool met the situation by improving its
docks and deeponing the channel; and
although Manchester has made a brilliant
success of its ship canal, the port of Liverpool has made an equally great success in
holding its place among the ports of the
world.
It is a curious fact that notwithstanding ahl the shipping done on the
Manchester ship canal, Liverpool is still the
world's greatest cotton port. I think the
history of other great ports shows that Montreal lias nothing to fear from the development
of harbours elsewhere in the Province of
Quebec, in the Maritimes, in Ontario, or the
far West. It is my opinion that the more
familiar we become with the growth of our
shipping, and of our country as a whole, the
more ready we shall be to say to our Western
friends, "Go ahead and get all the business
you can for the Hudson Bay route." We
should wish the port of Churchill every
success, realizing that whatever works to the
advantage of the West will be for the good
of the East as well.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Burns, the debate
was adjourned.

THE TARIFF SITUATION
INQUIET
Hon. M.r. DANDURAND:
I do not know
whether I am quite in order in putting a question ta the right hanourable gentleman at this
stage. I have read in the press recently that
the President of the United States had suggested a "'tariet truce" witb the warld. I have
sought in vain the text of that proposai, and
althougb I read that it is being discussed in
some of the parliaments of Eurape, I must
confess that I do not know exactly what the
expression means. Probably the right honourable the Prime Minister, who was in Washington, has brought back a clear definition of the
phrase. Does it mean that the tariffs of al
countries should be neither raised nar lowered,
but siould remain as Vhey are, and tiat no
treaty arrangements or reciprocity agreements
should be entered into? Suci a proposai is
ail the more surprîsing in that it cames froma
the head of a country that raised its tariffs
ta such an extenýt as ta, bring about, Iargely,
tic situation from which we are suffering. I
may be duli, but I have yet ta Ilearn exactly
wbat the terma "tariff truce"> means as used
by President Roosevelt. Perhaps the rigit
honourable gentleman can give us somne light
on tie subject.
Right Han. Mr. MEIGHEN: In respect of
matters international I occupy the position of
a very mýinor planet, and cannot throw muci
ljght. Indeed, I resemble tie moon, in that
Vhe ligit I cast is oniy a reflected ligit.

Rigit Han. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Prime
Minister has not mnade any report, so far as I
have observed, of Vie resuît of bis conference
in Washington, and certainly it would be iniappropriate for mie ta venture even to suggest
what the report might be. I know nothing of
the intent of the President of the Uni ted
States, nor of the inference or meaning Vo be
taken from, the words, «tariff truce." I hope,

Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The House

was infended f0 be a statutory incorporation
of the report of the Duif Commission. As

f0 be flhc re,-ulf cf long and laiorious efforts
hav e exactly flic same effect as would have
been achiex cd liy prinfing flic Bill in white
instead of in black.
I shail î'exiew thc House of Commons
amendments x-cry hriefly, one by crnc. The
firsf amendnîent simply substifufcs "1933," for
"1932,' so fhat section 1 reads:
This Acf nary be citcd as The Canadian
Naticial-Camadian Pacific Act, 1933.

MAY 10, 1933
The Bill was int-roduced in 1932, and cosequently bore that date. As it is now 1933,

this change is neccssary.
The second amendment adds to -the list of
Acts specifically mentioned as not being repealcd in any sense by this measure the

Industrial Disputes Inveatigation Act.

That

Act would not have been repealed, nor would
its integrity have been threatened in the
slightest degrce, if this amendaient had not
been introduced.
lIn subsection 2 of section 2 of the Bill a
new clause is inserted which reads:
Notwitbstanding anything in this Act or in
any other Act any railway company may
abandon the operation of any line of raîlway
with the approval of the Board of Railway
Commissioners for Canada, and no railway
company shall abandon the operation of any
line of railway without sncb approval.
I would not go so far as to say that this doca
not alter the law, but for practical purposes
it does not, because the Bill as it came from
the Senate Committee made abandonment
impossible except with the approval of the
Chairman of the Board, who was Chairman
of the Tribunal. The Board is now substituted for the Chairman of the Board; but
i-nasmuch as the Chairman of the Board,
under the present Act, can give the decision
of the Board, the difference is microscopie.
The next change consists of the reduction,
in two plaes, of the capital A in "Arbitral,"
to a smaîl a.
A change is made in subsection 2 of section
4, in Part I of the Bill. Thc old subsection
respecting the Chairman of -the Trustees said:
H1e shail devote his whole time te performance of the duties of bis office and shail not
hae an officer of any company other than a
comnpeny wlich la comprised in National Railways, and sha1l not during his tenure of office
as Trustee becorne a director of any company
other than a cornpany which la comprised in
National Ilailvays of wbicb hae was not a
director at the time of bis appointment.
This clause now reads as follows:
One of sucb Trustees shall be their Chairman.
He shall devote bis wbolc time to performance
of the duties of bis office and shail not hae an
officer nor after bis appointment as trustee
becorne, otberwisc than by re-election, a director
of any cornpany otber than a company wbicb
is eomprised in National Railways.
The effect of this clause is just the samne as
that of the old clause. I freely concede that
this is an improvement in the phraseology: it
is a neater and betteir wording; furthermore,
it is clearer.
A third subsection is added to, section 4:
The Trustees, ot>ber than the chairman, firat
appointed under the provisions of this Act, shall
from tinie te time during tbe terma of their
first appointments devote to performance of tbe

4M

duties of their office their whole or part time
as may bie determined from time to time by
the Governor in Council, and the salaries to be
paid to sucli trustees for whole and/or part
1ime service shail bie fixed at the time of their
appointments.
This is new. Under the Bill as it left this
House the Chairm-an of the Trustees was the
only one who was required to devote full
time to the performance of bis duties. By
this clause the Governor in Council will have
power to require tbe ot-her two trustees to
devote full time to the work, if it is thought
advisable. I make no comment on this clause;
I leave it to the judgment of the House.
In section 8 a change is made with respect
to a feature which gave us somne difllculty in
the Com-mittee, as honourable members who
were on the Cornmittee will recall. This section makes the Act applicable to those elements of the National Railways which bave
been incorporated not by the Dominion, but
by a provincial or other authori.ty, and which
would not, witbout soe such provision a-3 is
made here, bie within the purview of the Act.
The Co'mmittec worked out a miechanism for
enabling the controlling organization under
the Act to apply this new legisiation to sueh
companies, and this mechanismn is adopted
entirely in the amendmnent, wbich is better
phrased -than was the original section. The
mechanism our Co'mfanittee adopted was to
provide that the works of any such comnpanies "are hereby declared to be works for
the general advantage of Canada, and every
such company is, by force of this Act, re-in-

corpora-ted" as a Dominion company. The
section bas been divided into two parts, and

tbc phrase ology i.mproved, in tbiis way:
8. (1) 'The works of every incorporated coinpany in Canada wbicb is comprised in National
Railways but la not incorporate-d by or under
the Ian' of the Dominion of Canada and which
hiave not beretofore been dedlared to bie works
for the general advantage of Canada, are
bereby declarcd to bie works for the general
advantage of Canada.
(2) TByforce of this Act, and without more,
the now shareholders of cvery company in
Canada eomprised in National Railways, the
works ýnf whicb have been or are bereby declared
te be w'orks for the general ýadvantege of Canada.
are bereby incorporated, and such incorporated
couipany shall have the samne naine, directors
and undertaking as the first mentioned coinpany, and may and shall act in succession
thereto and continuity thereof as resppects al
its affairs by. under and subject to the provi-

sions 4)f thi.9 Act.

Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: 1 hesitate to interrupt, but perbaps the right bonourable gentleman will be patient with one who is nlot

familiar with the legal effects of this section.
May 1 ask wbetber the result of the section
woul not be to take such cueupanies as arm

470

SENATE

referred to away from provincial jurisdiction?
If this is the effect, there are no doubt good
reasons for desiring it.
Right Hon. *Mr. MEIGHEN: The section
takes the works of the companies away from
provincial jurisdiction. When this Parliament declares the works of a company to be
for the genera.l advantage of Canada it thereby obtains jurisdiction over the works, but
not ovetr the company. But in our Coinmittee we went farther, and in order to reach
our goal we provided that such companies
should be by force of this Act re-incorporated
as Dominion companies.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That takes them
away from provincial jurisdiction.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHIEN: It at least
brings them within Dominion jurisdiction for
the purposes of this Act. And this is the procedure approved by the other House and
stated in the amendments in language which
is, I think, more comprehensive, if not more
felicitous, than that used in the original
section.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of couse, all the
stock of these various companies, whether or
net tbey are incorporated under provincial
laws, is held by the Canadian National Railways?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, or by a
company which is held by the National Railways.
The next amendment is to subsection 6 of
section 9. The original subsection read:
(6) No order, regulation, by-law, act, decision or proceeding of the Trustees shall require
the approval of His Majesty or that of any
other shareholder of any company to which this
section applies.
The amended section reads simply:
(6) No order, regulation, by-law, act, decision or proceeding of the Trustees shall require
the approval of the shareholders of any cornpany to w-hich this section applies.
I do not know why it was thought worth
while to leave out "His Majesty," which words
of course mean His Majesty as represented
by the Government of Canada. However, I
think the Act will not suffer appreciably as
a result of this deletion.
In section 12 there are some changes. The
original section provided that "amounts required for income deficits, for interest on
obligations, for capital expenditures and for
refunding or retirement of maturing securities
shall be submitted by the Trustees to the
Minister of Finance for the consideration of
the Governor in Council prior te presentation
to Parliament." The amendment says that
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

estimates of such amounts shall be submitted.
Of course, that is what would be done, in
accordance with the usual procedure. I think
the amendment is more accurate in its expression, but there is no change in the intent.
The amended section reads:
Estimates of the amounts required . . . shall

be submitted by the Trustees to the Minister
of Finance for the consideration and approval
or disapproval in whole or in part of the
Governor in Council and thereafter presented
to Parliament.
We can all feel quite satisfied that the effect
of the amended section is in reality the same
as that of the original.
There has been a slight amendment to
section 13. This section provides that a continuous audit of the accounts of the National
Railways shall be made by independent
auditors appointed annually by Parliament,
and 'the amended section reads that the
auditors shall be appointed by a resolution
of Parliament. Of course, everyone understood that the auditors would be appointed
by resolution and not by a Bill. I have no
objection to the amendment, for I cannot sec
that it makes any difference whatsoever to
the measure.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If it were intended
to pay the auditors, there would have to be
a resolution.
Righît Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Section 16,
in Part Il of the Bill, is one to which I know
the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock) attaches some importance. It
directs the National Company and the Pacific
Company to agree upon such co-operative
measures, plans and arrangements as are fair
and reasonable. The second sentence of subsection I further directed that whenever the
companies "se agree they shall endeavour to
provide as part of such measure, plan or
arrangement or otherwise, for a fair and
reasonable apportionment as between the employees of National Railways and Pacifie Railways, respectively, of such employment as
may be incident to the operation of such
measure, plan or arrangement."
This is
amended by the insertion, after the word
"provide," of the following words: "through
negotiations with the representatives of the
employees affected."
I will make no comment upon this at
present. The change bas no very definite
legal effect and is merely an indication of
the desire of Parliament. The matter will
probably be referred to by the honourable
senator from Parkdale, who will be here tomorrow.

MAY 10, 1933
The section has also been amended by the
addition of the following as subsection 3:
(3) The National Company -and the Pacifie
Company for and on 'behaif as aforesaid are
directed to endeavour to provide that any new
campany, created as in subsection two of this
section referred to, shall gîve preference for
work to employees in any services or on any
works taken over by suclh new company.
This merely carrnes -out the spirit of subsection 1 as approved -of by our own
Committee.
The f ollowing new subsection is also addd
as subsection 5:
(5) 'Where the execution or carrying out of
sucli a measure, plan or arrangement involves
the doing of any act whioh by any statute
requires the leave, sanction, assent or approval
of the Board of Railway Conunissianers for
Canada, no such measure, plan or arrangement
,hall be effective without the approval of the
said iBoard.
As honaurable members will see at a glance,
there is noa substantial alteration here, inasmuch as under the Bill as it stood anything
that heretofore nrequired the approval of the
Board could not be donc save with the
distinct approval of the Chairman of the
Tribunal, who was also the Chuirman of the
Board. 1 should prefer the clause without
this amendment, as probably being smoother
in aperation and less cumbersomne, but I
do nlot see anything especîally objectianable
in the change, if indeed it can be called a
change.
An addition is made to section 18. This
clause enables two addîtional memýbers to be
appointed to the Tribunal when the coinpanies consider that the matter in dispute is
of such importance as to warrant a larger
Tribunal. As the Bill passed this House the
clause read, in part:
At the request of either the National Company or the Pacifie Company, or both, the
President of the Exehequer Court of Canada
Mnay, upon it being made ta appear ta him that
the dispute is one of sufficient; importance,
appoint two additional members for its
disposition.
The amendaient provides that in the event
cf the P-resident of the Exchequer Court
acting as Chief Coxnmissioner, a Supreme
Court judige may make the order f or the
appointment of the Vwo additional members
of the Tribunal. It is a useful amendment.
W'hile not likely to be ever necessary, sti1
it is far better to have it in the Bill.
Section 23 is amended. I shail indicate the
amendments as I read the clause:
Where the executian of any order, or the
carrying out of a decisian of a Tribunal,
involves the doing of any act which by any
statute requires the leave, sanction, assent or
appraval of the Board of Railway Commissioners, or where in the opinion of the presiding officer-

471

This is new:
-of a Tribunal composed of not more than
three membersThen follows the wording of the old clause:
-the publie interests involved are of sufficient
importance to. warrant it, no order made by a
Tribunal shaîl be operative without the concurrence of the presiding officer and his formal
written assenit,And then these words have been added:
-and on sueh concurrence and assent having
been given, no such leave, sanction, assent or
approval of the said Board will be required.
It will be seen that under the clause as
it passed this Chamber power was vested in
the Chairnian of the Tribunal, that is, the
Chairman of the Board of Railway Commissianers, to refuse to implement the judgment of a rnajority against him if in his
opinion the pyublic interests involved were of
such importance or of such a character as
those which ordinarily came within the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners. Under the clause as amended hie can
exercise this power only when the Tribunal is
composed of not more than three members.
The oniy other amendment appears as Part
IV, containing these two clauses:
27. Nothing in this Act shaîl be deemed to
authorize the amalgamaýtion of any railway
company which is comprised. in National Railways with any railway company whieh is
comprised in Pacifie Railways nar ta authorize
the unified management and control of the
railway systemn which forms part of National
Railways with the railway system which farms
part of Pacifie Railways.
28. This Act shall came into force on the
first day of July, 1933.
0f course, section 28 was ini Part III se passed
by this House. As ta section 27, nothing in
the Bill authorized the amalgamnation of any
two companies, but I see nu objection to
yielding ta the much-expressed fear of many
persans that there was some hidden danger,
sorne lion lurking behind the wood-pile. Consequently I offer no objection ta what is clearly
intended, and what I thought was very plain
in the original measure.
I have now reviewed. ail the amendments
mnade ta the Bill by the other House.
Hlon. M.r. CASORAIN: The right hionourable gentleman said he wae gaing to explain
only thase amendmente that ailtered the Bill.
From hîs statement it would appear that there
18 no alteration.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: There is na
substantial alteration. W'here there is an alteration in detail, it is not important.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Section 6.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I regret that
I overlooked this fsection. Section 6 is altered

472

SENATE

in a manner which has some importance,
although not very great. The term of the
Chairman of the Trustees was fixed at seven
years, and that of each of the other original
trustees a.t a lesser period, the dates of the
expiration of their respective terms of office
being staggered.
The amendment provides
that the Chairman shall be appointed for five
years, and each of the other original trustees
for a term of less than five years and of
different duration from the term of his cotrustee. In other words, the amendment substitutes five years for seven.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Suppose they all die
at the same time?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That was taken
care of in the measure as it went from this
House. The system of staggering the expiration of the trustees' respective terms will be
continued.
If I were asked to express an
opinion, I would rather have the term seven
years than five. It is the recommendation of
the Royal Commission, and it does not appear
to me to be too long a term in the contemplation of the man who is asked to address himself to the very formidable task which confronts anyone accepting the responsibility of
a Trustee. But in the other House there was
a great deal of discussion, which resulted in
the reduction of this term, and I would not
recommend tfhat we resist the amendment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
As I recall, a
clause in the original draft prohibited the two
railwavs from amalgamating. I do not know
how it came about that we dropped it in committee. Of course, like my right honourable
friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), I feel tbat
whore an Act contains no authorization to do
a thing, such authorization is not implied. So
the amendment reinstating the original clause
may well be accepted, althougb it does not
add very much to the effectiveness of the
Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I quite agree
with my honourable friend. Possiblv I have
omitted something in the amended Bill. If
>o, I shall deal with it when the ancdments
come up for consideration to-nimorrow.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Do I understand that the
panel yZten of filling v-acancies remains?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I understand
the pane] system is changed, but I did net
observe the change as I went through the
measure. I will go into it carefully tomorrow.

-CANADIAN NATIONAL RAIL WAYS
FIýNANCING BIL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN rnovad the
second reading of Bi-l 73, an Act respectilg
the Canadian National Railways and to
authorize the provision of rnoneys to ineet
expenditures made and indebtedness incurred
during the calendar year 1933 and to authorize lis Maj esty to make loans and advances
to the Canadian National Raihway Com.pany.
He said: This is what I rnay terrn an al
too usual Bill. It corresponds with meaisures
passed in other sessions -to permit of the
finaneing of the Canadian National Railways
along the usual lines.
I see that the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
arnount asked for is some.what smaiher than
that required last session to cover the deficit
on -operationý, if I arn not mistaken, as well
as for loans, refunding and capital expenditures. I hope -that the finantial requirements
of the National Railways will continue to
dirniniali frorni year to year, especially when
the svstern be:gins to ýoperate under te
arnnded Bill which has now corne before us
for -consideration.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The arnount
is less. I think the Minister of Railways is
to ba heartiiy congratuiated on the insistance
with which he has directed the reduction of
these expenditures, having regard to the necessary demands upon the treasury.
It seerns to me that at this point -the flouse,
having put itself ýon -record last fall by paissing
a resolution requesting the early working out
of joint arrangements between the two railway systerns, is entitled to be told what has
been done, and ought to express to the respective managements its appreciation of the

473

manner in which they have addressad themsalves to the task. ilonourabie members
know of the pooling arrangements in passengar traffie which are in affect in this district, and
which. in their sirnplicity and sanity mnust
appeal to everyone. We may well wonder why
such steps were not taken much eariier by
those in charge of the two railway systerns.
At ail avents they have set to work to carry
out the clearly expressed desire of the Senate,
and have achievad somne real rasuits.
Hon. WALTER E. FOSTER: Honourable
mambers, this Bill providas an excellent opportunity for anyona who is desirous of discussing the genaral railway situation in Canada.
Howevar, as I have already exprassed in this
House and before various public bodies rny
opinion with regard to a situation that looms
very large in the publie eye of this country,
and as I have stated what I thought would
ultirnately bave to be done in order to rernedy
that situation, it is not my intention to enter
upon a general discussion this afternoon. I
shouid like, however, to point out that this
Bill providas for financing to the extent of
360,000,000 odd, soine $13,000,000 of which. is
to ha ohtainad in one way, and $47,000,000 or
348,000,000 in anothar. The $48,000,000 is to
ha applied on account of the net incorna
delicits, including profit and bass, but not including interest on Dominion Government
advancas. Honourable mamibers wiii raadily
sea that the $60,000,000 involved in this Bihl
doas not take into, account intareat on loans
frorn the Governmnent.
I speak of this matter in the hope that there
may ha spraad not only in the press, but
alan upon our national records, and, indeed,
upon the dead wals of the country, if that ha
possible, a statement of the arnount involved
in this Bill. 1 muet say that since I have bean
a member of this flouse I have bean irnpressed
,with the fact that Bills of this nature, which.
coma Maore this House from year to yaar,
are passad in a formai way without vary rnuch
dliscussion or comment. I think it is weli that
wc shouhd mention such matters as frequanthy
as possible, in order to impress upon the minds
of the people of this country the fact that
such legisiation in aid of our railways involvas
a matter of 320,000 a day, or a suna equal
to about $25 par annura for avery famiiy ini
Canada.
We have had returned to us to-day from,
the other Chamber the Raihway Bill, so-calhed,
which was passed by this flouse. I aan oxily
express the hope that the affect of that Bihl
wilh be to decreaee rnaterially the arnount
that we rnay ha asked to vote anothar yaar.
We should endeavour to wipe out the deficits
of the railway, to restore dividands and to

474

SENATE

reduce freight rates to a level more in keeping
with the present value of our commodities. I
realize that such things cannot be aocomplished
within a year, and I seriously daubt whether
the Bill that bas just been returned to, us is
going to produce the resuits expected fromn it.
Nevertheless, I think that the things I have
mentioned should be the ultimate aim of our
railway legisiation, and I only hope that a
year from now, when we are considering a Bill
simýilar ta the one now before us, the amount
required will be very substantially reduced.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Right Han. Mr. METOHEN moved the third
reading af the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDIIRAND: As we cannat
amend this Bill, and as we must meet aur
obligations, 1 have no abjection ta the Bit]
being re4id the third time now.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
It should
be pointed out in this can.nection, honourable
gentlemen, that the Bill authorizes loans ta
the compa-ny and that the moneys ta be provided-represen'ted by deficits and maturities,
-and, in ve.ry small part, by capital expenditue-ilconsequently form part of and
will at once appear in the national debt af
this country. It is lamentable that the
practice of including such boans in the national
debt was ever departed from. The omission has resulted in the people of this
country being lulled into a false sense of
security, imagining that their deibt was not
growi.ng, when, in reality, under the guise of
endorsements of bonds of the National Railways, which were just as much a part of the
debt of ýthis country as any other obligation,
the deht was being added ta at the rate of

$100,000,000 a year. I feel free ta say that
one of the essential recammendations o'f the
Dif Re'port is that whien obligations of this
kind are incurred there shaiild be hlazoned
acr-ss tlic sky a reflection of their effeet upan
the national debt of aur Dominion.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.

COMPAINIES' CREDITORS ARRANýGEMENT BILL
SECOND READING

Righit Hon. Mr. MEICHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 77, an Act ta facilitatie Campramnises and Arrangements hetween
Camipanies and their Creditors.
He said: Hanourable senitors, the purpose
of this Bill is ta enable companies which
lion. Mr. FOSTER.

otherwise would be confronted with bankruptey ta arrange compromises by means of
conferenees among their variaus classes of
security hokiers. It provides ýthat any cIass
of security holders may, by a vote which
indicates an ovierwhielming view, surrender
their rights in the commmon interest. There
hae been no provision for this process in
Canadian laiw. The depression has brought
almost imnumerablie companies ta the paqs
where some such arrangement is necessary in
the interest of the company iýtsedf, in the
interest cf its employees--because the bankruptcy ýof the company would throw the empicyees on -the street-and in the inte-rest of
the security holders, who may decide that
it is much better ta make some sacrifice
than run the risk of losing all in the general
debacle of bankruptcy.
In England there
have been for Inuuny years most effective
measures ta accomplish the same end. In
Canada we have depended on the bankruptcy law. Under the federal system we
encaunter difficulties that are not met with in
England. The law now submitted ta us could
be made vastly mare effective if it were nat
for the federal system. As it is, the best result
can be attained only by the passage by aur
leg-islatures of such co-operative measures as
will enable civil rights, and campanies within
their purview, ta be interfered with for the
general advantage.
I move the second reading cf the Bill on
the understanding that it will be referred ta
the *Cammittee on Banking and Commerce.
Han. RAOUL DANDURAND: I am glad
ta hear my right honaurable f riend say that
the Bill is ta be sent ta the Cammittee an
Banking and Commerce, because we may have
the hbenefit of the presence of the representative of the department wha prepared this Bill
for the House cf Commaons.
As a result, cf the default of many campanies
and a laxity in loaking after the interests cf
security halders and shareholders in general,
there
lias bren
considerable
uneasiness
throughaut the country. I hav e bcen wandering whethcr under siich a Bill as this the
Departrment cf the Secretary cf State cauld
net demand representatian at these meetings
in or(ler that sameone miglit be presenit ta
look after the interests cf those who cannat
be there ta prateet themselves. Lt is evident
t hat, such security halders are absolutely
helpless, because of the limited interest of
each. A persan *may have an interest of a
thausand dollars, five thousand dollars, or
morle, in jeopardy. He bas thon to consider
the advisability cf taking- caunsel or cf

475

MAY 10, 1933
appointing an attorney to protect his interest.
Arrangements are very often made by -a f ew
parties who secure proxies, the resuit being
that the creditors generally feel that their
interests have been neglected. In some countries of Europe, even though the interpretation
of the civil law may be ail that is involved,
the public prosecutor is always on hand on
such occasions. Frequently vast intereats are
.concerned, but the people who have bought
the securities are widely scatter-ed throughout the land. 0f course, a trustee has certain obligations resting upon him, but ha must
yield to the desires expressed by the security
holders who dominate the situation. It might
be well to submit this phase of the question
to the representative of the Department of
the Secretary of State when he appears before
the Banking and Commerce Committee, in
order to learn whether some instrument cannot be forged to remove the feeling on the
part of certain interests that they have been
sacrificed in the liquidation.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
RAILWAY BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHDN moved the
second reading of Bill 80, an Act to amend
the Railway Act.
H1e said: Honourable gentlemen, I see no
reason why this Bill should not receive the
second and third readings to-day. It is a
very simple measure. It merely provides that
no part of a railway may be abandoned without the approval of the Railway Board.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is practically
a consequential measure.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: 1 have no objection
to the Bill, but the right honourable gentleman bas just said that this was provided for
in the other Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN - No. In the
other Bill it is provided that under that Bill
there cannot be abandonment without the
approval of the Railway Bloard. I must say
that I amrn ot very clear as to the necessity
of this Bill, 'but I know it is absolutely
harmless.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: It is like a plaster
on a wooden leg.
I realize, of
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
course, that we are limiting the powers of a
private company, which otherwise could pro-

ceed to abandon lines or parts of lines without
appearing before the Railway Board.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It could not do
that. A railway company cannot abandon a
Uine without the consent of the Railway Board.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN moved the
third reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 94, an Act to aimend

H1e said: Honourable members, I aRn prepared to give any necessary explanations of
this Bill, but I think they should be given in
Comimittee of the Whole.
The motion wa.s agireed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

COMMITTEE

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen,
the Senate went into Com*mittee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien in the Chair.
On section 1.-trial of offender:
Right Hou. Mr. MEIGIiEN: The effect of
this is merely to bring the law into accord
with the statute of 1928 which abolished the
special jurisdiction of coun'ty court judges in
excise cases. Inasmuch as these judges no
longer have the ju-risdiction, the Excise Act
should be amended to exclude them from the
tribunals before which offenders under the
Excise Act may come.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On ýsection 2-penalties belong to Consolidated Revenue Fund:
Right lion. Mr. MEIGHIEN: The only
change here is to provide that penalties may
be paid to the Commissioner of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police or to any officer
cornmanding a division of that force, instead
of, as foismerly, to the Customs-Excise Preventive Service, which has been abolished.
Ail sich penalties will of course be transmitted to the Consolidated Revenue Fund.

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: This section
fixes the arnounit of the guarantee bond required from a Iicensed distillery. A sehedule

productive capacities of the modern cernpanies. The number of companies is now
comparatively small, but they produce on a
large seale.
Section 3 xvas agreed to.
On section 4-excise duties on .spirits:
Righit Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: The expianations of this a:meodment as given on the
opposite, page of the Bill are clear. The purpose of the amendiment is the adoption of a
new system for the assessing of duties on spirits
used in bond for manufacturing purposes, to
conforn to the amendmcints made at the last
session of Parliament with regard 10 duties
on potable spirits. The sliding scale method
has been discontinncd in favour of a flat rate
of $7. The differential rates are abolisbed
and a flat rate o.f $2.50 per gallon strength of
proof is imposed. The ameodment bas to do
more or less xith matters of detail, and is
d-"signed for the more simple operation of the
law, as well as the collection of greater
revenue.

amd there is an ex~tra dutv on any percentage

Provision is made, in conformity with the
British practice, for abatement on spirits lest
through evaporation in ware.house. In respect
of any deficiency occurring through the process
of vatting, blending, racking or reducing, the
abatement in duty is net te exceed one per

purpeses.
Hon. Mr. CASGHAIN: Does net the extenýt
of evaperation depenci upon the class of containers used? If the spirits are kept in copper

Righit Hon. Mr. MEICHEN-ý: The purpose
of this amndment is te moderato seme af
the very severe penalties that hav e been imposaible. In some cases these penalties were
se, great, as te bave the resuit that the rigbht
hononi-able senator frein Eganville (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham)
bas nften warned us
agaiîîst, namely, of defeating the purposes of
the Ian'. At present the minimum punish-

MAY 10, 1933
ment for the contravention of this section is
a fine of $200 and one mon'th's im.prisonment
in addition.
The amendment brings the
punishments into line with those imposed. by
the Customs and Excise Acts respectively.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Why should flot
the penalties be as severe as possible? Alcohol
made by unlicensed persons is very dangerous
stuif, some of it as bad as ýbootleg whiskey.
The provincial governments suifer a considerable loss of revenue because of the opera-tione
of unlicensed distillers. I think very strong
reasons should be given before we are asked
to reduce penalties. The law should be ma.de
more severe, if possible.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman does neot suggest, that the
contravening of this section be made a capital
offence?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
n lot of people.

Poison liquor kilis

There are
Ilight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
in the north a considerable number of
foreigners who make spirits for -their own
consumption, although they have no licence
to do so. This breaking of the law should be
prevented if possible, but it seems hard that
such offenders should be treated as if they
were semi-murderers.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Well, many of them
are.
Right Hon. Mr-. MEI-GHEN: I arn told
that usually they make the stuif for their
own use only. Many cases have been cited
where the penalty was out of proportion to
the -crime, and the effeot was to defeat the
purpose of the law.
Will the right
Hon. Mr-. CASGRAI'N:
honourable gentleman sta'te a concrete instance
where the penalty was out of proportion to
the crime?
Right Hon. Mr. MEICGHEN: In a case
where a poor fellow has a littie still, a hundred
miles or so away from any community, and
makes some spirits for 'himself, ilt w»ould
appear that the minimum penalty is too
severe.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: But the stuif some
of these people make is very damigerous. A
variation of one degree from the proper temperature of the still makes the liquor
poison'ous.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The amemidment does nât, obolish the punishments, but
simply brings themi into conformity with those

împosed by the Customs and Excise Acts.
If honourable members will look at paragraph
g, at the bottom of page 5, they will sec that
the punishments imposable will still be very
severe if the amendmnent is carried. The
minimum penalty proposed i8 $200 or imprisonmient, wher-eas under the present law the
minimum is $200 plus îmnprisonment. In some
tases the fam.ily of the offendier might starve
if hie were imnprisoned. I1think the alternative
penalty is sufficient.

FIRST READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN introduced Bill
El, an Act to amend the Act respecting the
Senate and Huse of Commons.
H1e said: Honourable members, may I be
pardoned for introducing this Bill at the
present juncture? I did nlot have it before
me at the proper time for its introduction.
The measure is very highiy regarded by the
honourabie senator from North York (Hon.
Sir Allen Ayiesworth), who bas taken considerable interest in it, and its objeet is to protect senators who may have contraots with the
Government in respect of Government bonds.
Some years ago the Senate and bouse of Cornmons Act was amended for the purpose of
giving immunity to members of both flouses.
The keen mind of the honourable senator from
North York is responsibie for the discovery
that as a matter of legal effect the immunity
dýid nlot extend to senators.

HIUDSON BAY TERMINALS
INQUIRY AND DIS~CUSSION

The Senate resumed fromn yesterday the
debate on the question proposed by Hon.
Mr. Casgrain:
'[o cail tlie attention of the Senate to the
cost of developinent. workz and other germane
ex'penditure at Fort Churchill andI Port Nelson,
ain
jiewa
econornies the Goverumient
proposes to niake in connection w itli those
Ports.
Honourable
Hon. PATRICK BURNS:
sena tors, in discussing the Hudson Bay route
1 shahl confine myself for tbe most part te
its suitability as an outiet for tbe shiprnent
of Western cattie to the British rnarket.
Froin Winnipeg westward our farmers are
turning their attention to the feeding of
cattle during- the winter rnontlis for expert.
The sbipping season for grain-fed "expert"
eattle starts in February and extends tu Juiy.
This year our cattle sbiprnents started v ia
Sqint John in Febrnary, and by the first of
May WC had shipped 10,500 head, 6.700 frorn
Ontario anti 3,800 frorn
the West.
We
expect to ship up to Juiy, throughi Montreai,
about 15,000 additional head of grain-fed
cattle. anti during the remainder of the seasen
about 15,000 beach of grass cattie, neariv ail
of wbich corne frein the West. In 1931 WC
sbipped a total of 28.000O head. During the
shipping season of 1932 our total shipirrents
were 17,000 head. 11,000 frorn Ontario and
6,000 frorn Western Canada. I arn afraid the
Hudson Bay route would not bc suitabie for
our winter-fed cattie; but we can take advantage of it for our grass-fed cattle, whieli we
ship from August until the close of navigation.
In ordei to take advantage of the port of
Churchill it wouid be necessary to induce our
shipping companies to send their cattle boats
frorn Montreal and other ports to Churchill.
It is pretty expensive to fit boats witb cattle
stalis, and it would be unreasonable to expeet
thern to make this outlay for a comparatîvely
iimited number of shipments. In short, I
would say the Hudson Bay route would be

MAY 10, 1933
very unsatisfactory until the latter part of the
regular cattie-shipping season.
In 'September, 1931, 1 traveiied over the
Hudson Bay 'Rallway to Churchill with the
Canadian Board of Trade party. It bas a
very good road-bed. The captain of a ship
then in port took us out into the bay. Whiie
we were on this sail he told us the season was
short, varying from three to three and onehaif months.
I do flot agree with my honourable friend
from Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Gillis) that the
railway runs through number one farming
country. M~ an'old farmer, 1 shouid not care
to farm there. We have so much good farmn
land stîli availabie in the older parts of
Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British
Columbhia that I think it would be unwise for
anyone to, take up a home.stead along the
Hudson Bay Raiiway at the present time.
However, if later people do settie along the
line, the Hudson Bay route will probably corne
out ail right. The elevator at Churchili has
a capacity of 2,500,000 bushels, and wheat cou]d
be stored there until navigation opens. The
raiiway and the port and terminal facilities
are in good condition, but, as I have said,
the adjacent country is very poor for farming purposes. As an oid timer who has had
some opportunity to size up the Western
Provinces, I shouid say that if there is minera]
weaith aiong this line of rai.iway it Wiii
help materially in developing Churchill. The
trouble to-day is that if vessels come to,
Churchill for cattie or wheat they have to
come empty. What cargo can they bring?
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Welsh coal.
Hon. Mr. BURNS: We have more extensive
deposits of coal in Alberta than in any other
section of North America. Twenty-five per
cent of the coal deposits of Canada are to he
found in Alberta, and the coal is of the finest
qualitv. We in the West have no need for
Welsh coal.
0Of course, 1 realize it takes time for any
country to develop. I settled in Manitoba
fifty-flve years ago, when there was very littie
settiement west of Portage La Prairie. Vancouver as a great national port was unknown.
Last year 15,981 ships entered that port. 0f
this number 1,123 were deep sea ships. When
I was at Vancouver in 1885 there were oniy
a few smail craft in port. If Churchill shouid
show an equai deveiopment, it would be most
gratifying to ail Canadians.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: That deveiopment is
coming.

479

Hon. Mr. BURNS: I may say to, my honourable friend what I shouid also like, in
ciosing, to say to another honourabie member
of this Chamber. The senator from Boissevain
(Hon. Mr. Schaffner) said yesterday the peopie of Manitobaa had been taiking of the
Hudson Bay route for fifty years. It is true
we ail have taiked of it for fifty yesxs, but it
is a pity that before the Hudson Bay Raiiway
was buii-t we had, not taiked of it another
fifty years,
Hon. L. MoMEANS: I hope the honourable gentleman from Calgary (Hon. Mr.
Burns) has not lef t the impression on honourable senators that there is no minerai
wealth aiong the Hudson Bay Railway. After
aill, the railway is merely an extension northward of thýe line to The Pas. Beyond The
Pas we have to-day one of the largest minîng
undertakings on the North American continent
It represents an investment of $22,000,000.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Flin Flon.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
Yes, otherwise
known as the Hudson Bay Mining Company, and the Sherritt-Gordon mines. The
volume of freight over the line that connects
with the Hudson Bay Railway is tremendous.
The mining industry in that country is
in jts infancy. Honourable members will
recaîl that the Temiskaming and Northern
Ontario Railway ivas built by the Ontario
Covernment for ýcolonization purposes, and
no one ever imagined so much minerai wealth
would he taken out of the Cobalt district. The mining development throughout
Northern Ontario and Northern Quebec wiil,
I believe, be duplicated in the country served
hy the Hudson Bay Raiiway.
I do not know why the honourable gentleman from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) should have introduced this motion.
Ail his confrères from Montreal have in effect
apologized for him. They have said: "We
are in sympathy with the West. We are very
glad the road was built. and we are o-nly too
anxious to see it made a success." But
my honourahie friend differs with them: he
wants to criticize the Hudson Bay Railway
from time to time. I have a very warm regard
for him, and I admire his wide range of
knowledge, but apparently he cannot let slip
any opportunity to condemn the Hudson Bay
route. I wouid remind him that commerce
wili build a eity even though it be iocated.

I represent Winnipeg. The Hudson Bay

projected ro#d tha't was to iink up Winffipeg

SENATE
with the Hudson Bay Railway has been
virtuaHy abandoned. In the old days it was
predicted .that all the grain from the Western
Provinces and the Northwestern States would
be carried over tha.t road. It may be yet.
My honourable friend knows what happened
in the carly days of Manitoba and the Northwest. The provincial railway charters were
disallo.wed hy the Federal Government. The
people saw no other means of reducing the
excessive freiglit ntes charged by the railway
monopoly because of the clause in the Canadian Pacific charter by which the company
was practically freed from competition in the
territory between its line and the American
border. The agitation against this state of affairs
reached almost a state of rebellion. Then
came the proposal to obtain relief by building
an independent outlet to Hudson Bay. That
was long before the Panama Canal was opened
and wheat for export to Europe began to
move through the port of Vancouver. Ultimately the monopoly clause in the Canadian
Pacific charter was abrogated and the Northern Pacifie was extended into Manitoba. This
line was leased by the Canadian Northern
Railvay Company. It now forms part of
By an
the Canadian National System.
arrangement between the Canadian Northern
Railway Company and the Manitoba Government the freight rate was reduced from 25
cents to 101 cents per hundred pounds. Today, I believe, it is 11 cents.
The Hudson Bay road has been in operation
for only a short time, and as yet there has
been no opportuni'ty to demonstrate its
potentialities. I happened to be present at
the time my honourable friend from Calgary
(Hon. Mr. Burns) was in Churchill, and it
was a revelation to us to find that the port
was one of the finest in the world. There is
tremendous mineral wealth all through the
country served by the Hudson Bay Railway,
and although I -as not wedded to the proposal, I believe that eventually the development of the Hudson Bay route will justify
the expenditure involved.
I cannot congratulate my honourable friend
from De Lanaudière on again bringing this
question to the attention of the House. I
think it would be the part of wisdom for
him to refrain from further criticism of the
Hudson Bay route, and so avoid any danger
of arousing antagonism between the East and
the West.
Hon. J. P. B. CASCRAIN: As the mover of
the motion I bave the privilege of closing the
debate.
Hon.

Mr. M\cMEANS.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
gentleman may do so with the leave of the
Senate. It is an inquiry, not a motion.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There were questions first; then I gave notice that I would
call the attention of the Senate to the cost
of development work at Fort Churchill, and
so on. This converted the inquiry into a
motion. I leave it to the Clerk of the House
to say whether I am in order or not. I am
glad to put His Honour the Speaker right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I differ with my
honourable friend from De Lanaudière (Hon.
Mr. Ca grain).
A motion calls for a conclusion.
There is none involved in this
nquiry.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: My notice reads,
"That he will call the attention," and so on.
That is a motion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

No.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I hope my honourable friend from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans) will allow me to remind him that if
the Hudson Bay route develops as he anticipates, it will take bsine-s away from
Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: That is w-hat I say.
lion. Mr. CASGRAIN: "On to the Bay"
will mean taking business away from Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:

That is right.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: All the northern
part of Saskatclhewan and the territory beyond
The Pas will be served by the Hudson Bay
route. Tien the territory tributary to Vancouver is extending eastward all the time. It
is a mystery to me how the low rates that
have been mentioned are possible. The honourable member from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
McRae) was good enough to ascertain for me
the toll on wheat taken througlh the Panama
Canal. It is 81.25 a ton, or approximately
4 cents a bushel. I have not the reports under
my hand, but nsy recollection is that the rate
for shipping wseat from Vancouver to Liverpool is 9 cents. Deducting the canal toll
leaves a balance of only 4 or 5 cents for the
shipowner. To me tlis is ai extraordinarily
low rate.
My good friend askas why I bring up the
subject of the Hud-on Bay route from time to
time. Well, for the last quarter of a century
I have disciussed it periodically because my
hobby is navigation and transportation, and I
sincerely believe tiat the Hudson Bay route

MAY 10, 1933e
can neyer be a commercial suceess. I have
been in contact withi persons who have visited
Cl 1urchil-land surveyors and others-and I
have dizcussed with thein the nature of the
country served by the Hudson Bay Railway.
Everybody knows that when that railroad
was being hujît there wvas a good, solid foundation. because the ground was frozen. It has
heen frozen ever since the Creator made it.
If you make a contour-line with a radius
of two hundred miles froin Churchill or
Nelson-not from James Bay, for that is
hundreds of miles south-you will find that
there is nu vegýetation within the area. When
dIbervilic and his brother, de Maricourt, went
to Hudson Bay they had to carry birch practically two hundred miles to make canoes.
The v biiilt two canoes. D'Iberville was in one
with six men, and his brother was in the other
with an equal number. and they took two
English frigates, the crews of which were al
down with the scurvy. I think the world is
getting better ahl the turne, in spite of the
League of Nations; for at that time, when
they found those people sick with scurvy and
unable to defend theinselves, they murdered
every one of thein and threw their bodies
overboard. Then they decided that fourteen
men, their total number, were not enough to
man two ships; se they sanlc one and put alI
the furs on board the other and brought to
Quebec a cargo worth a king's ransoin.
My good friend from Saskatchewan (Hon.
Mr. Gillis) said many things. In some matters
hie agreed with me, for whioh I thank him.
H1e said I was perfectly right in asserting
that Nelson could neyer be made a port. Al
would have been well if, long ago, the Government of the day had listened to what was
said in this Huse, instead of spending the
$6,000,000 mentioned in the answer to my inquiry, and referred to by the honourable
gentleman (Hon. Mr. Gillis). lu my opinion
the expenditure was much greater than that.
The two dredges which cost $400,000 each,
and one of whîch was lost, were not included.
The honourable gentleman from Saskatchewan went on te dilate about the almost
innumerable acres of good land lying along the
line of the Hudson Bay Railway. But you do
net have te go there fer land. The C.P-R.
authorities will tell you that to-day there are
over six million acres of land lying adjacent
to their railroad and the Canadien National
Railways; se, why should anyone go alinost to,
the North Pole for land when so0 vast an area
is available nearer home?
Then, even if we did grow all the wheat
that has been mentiened, where could we S-Il
it? We are unable te seli what we have now.

Nobody denies that. The grain growers had
to corne to the Goverument for assistance.
The creation. of the Wheat Pool was a great
crime. In a paper with which. I was connected there was an article published under
the heading, "The Wheat Pool Defies Creation." That is just what it did. Our wheat
crop is only five per oent of the world's production. How is that five per cent going te
control the crop of the whole world? If we
could only teach. the people of China to eat
bread it inight help, but only one in ten eata
the white man's bread.
The 'honourable gentleman froin Saskatchewan referred to my old friend Senator Ferguson, who sat in this House when I first came
here. He was one of the most industrious and
painstaking senators we ever had. My leader
will remember him quite well. He had been
very well educated and studied constantly. In
speaking against the Transcontinental Railway
he said it was of no use anyhow-that the
proper route was through the Hudson Bay,
and hie gave many facts and much data in order
to show that the latitudes of Churchill and
Nelson were similar to those of certain places
in 'Europe. Climatic conditions are governed,
however, not by latitude, but by the isothermal
lines. Away up in the Arctic, north of Norway,
it neyer freezes, because there you have the
Gulf Stream. The port of Kola, or Kathsrina,
in northern Russia, is open ai-l the year round,
because the Gulf Stream dies there. In an
argument I proved that it waa the isothermal
lines and not the latitude that governed the
temperature. For its latitude Ottawa is about
the coldest place on earth. On the west coast
of Ireland, where our good friend from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) epends bis
summers-I believe he is on hie way there
now--the isothermal lines in January and July
are the saine as they are in Portugal. So you
cannot tell anything about the temperature of
a country by its latitude.
I remember that on one occasion when I was
talking about the Hudson Bay the late Sir
James Lougheed rose in his place and said
that honourable memibers were hearing the
annual wail of the Prophet Jeremiah, and hie
made a speeoh similar to that of the honouraable gentleman frein Saskatchewan.. He referred te the mines, and se on. Well, it is
truc that there is the Flin Flon Mine, but
to ge.t to it they had te build a railway one
hundred and thirty nsiles long.
The port od Churchill is ahl right once you
get into it, but if a north wind were blowing
no prudent captain would ever attecipt to
approach it, m-uch less -bc enter it, because
there is a clear sweep of eight hundred and
fifty or nine hundred miles. As honourable

gentlemen ivili remember, the coast of Hudson Bay runs a1most north and south and the
estuary of the Churchill river from, west to
ea.st. A ship itrying f0 enter the harbour
would have to moderate her speed. Her leeway
would then be increased, and ishe inight very
easily drift on to the bank, which would mean
the loss of the ship. I have met navigators
who have been iup there, and 1 have listened
intently to what 'they had to say. I have
also lectured on the subjeet. When I have
done this, for fear there might not be anybody elise pre.sent, I have brought members
of rny own family along, felling them they
could icave when they -chose. They have told
me afterwa.rds that they actually became so
interested tJhat they remained to the end.
I arn sincere when I say I arn convinced
that the Governiment should net spend any
more mroney on this prujuet, and in saying
it I think I arn only doing my duty. It is an
runpleasant thing f0 have to say. It is
strange that people whom you will hear say,
outside of this House, that the Hudson Day
route js a cr-azy idea, are ifraid to saiy it

tlic League of Nations, why do they flot get

different thing. I believe that everybody
should. speak his inmd: wliat lie bas to say
rnay lie worth while.
I wjshi to thank also the honourable senator
fruml Boc%,cain (Hon, Mr. Schaffner). Hie is

That is very ýpleasing, you know, for somefinies we are flot treated in fliat manner.
He thinks, howvever, that I have not enhanced
my reputafion ýby taking the ground that I
have taken. Well, he is on the other side of
the question. If I were on his side hie would
say I had rnade a fine speech.
I do not know thiat I can adM very rnuch to

in Canada by exposing ships to such dangers
as I have enumerafed.*
I want fo congratulate our ncw senator froni
Calgary (Hon. Mr. Burns). I was ven, glad
f0 hear hirn speak as lie did, because I thought
that if there was one industry fIat would flnd
the Hudson Day route of benefif if w as the
cattle industry. Cattle arc always shipped
in the summer-time, and the railway haul
from Calgary to Churchill is much shorfer
than the haul to Port Arfhur, and if would lie
cooler. I thought fliat the Hudson Day route
would be ideal for the shipping of cattie, but
the honourable gentleman doca not seem Ici
have rnuch confidence in if. As to, its possibilities s0 far as agriculture is concerned, he
does not think much of them. And he is a
fanmer in a large way and keeps many cattle.
Hon. Mr. BURNS: I spoke of the latter
part of the scason. I said the season wvas al
f00 short.

MAY 10, 1933
Hon. Mr. CAISGRA.IN: 1 hope wa shall
have the advantage of hearing again from a
man who bas been so successful in business as
bas been the honourable gentleman from Calgary, and who, lika the honourable senator
from Righ River (Hon. Mr. Riley), knows ail
about cattie. Such gentlemen can tell us
much that is useful. I take it that this House
is somewhat like a sehool; we learn something
every day. What is the use of getting older
if we do not at the same time become wiser?
My honourable friend from Saskatcbewan
(Hon. Mr. Gillis) spoka of Captain Bernier,
1 have known Captain Bernier for many years.
and 1 knew his father before him. 0f course
Captain Bernier bas no complaint to make
about Hudson Bay navigation. Any man who
goes to the 'North Pole thinks that navigation
in Hudson Strait is rather easy. Captain Bernier bas spent eight winters in the Arctic
regions. He bas commanded no less than one
hundred and nine ships, of whichbc lost only
one, and that was during the XVar.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: A good authority.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: He has been here
on more than one occasion, and bas explained
to some of the members of this bouse how
bie discovered a territory reacbing almost to
the North Pole and annexed it for Canada.
Yet -lhe bas neyer received any recognition
from this country. He has described to me
on more than one occasion bis departure on
one of thosa trips to the North. It was in
1908 that our present King, then the Duke of
York, happened to be on board the Ophir
in the harbour of Quebec. Ha sent f or
Captain Bernier and asked him when he was
leaving for the North. Captain Bernier
replied, "Any time you say, sir." After consultation with the officers of the Ophir, twelve
o'clook was set as the time for Captain
Bernier's departure. Everybody on the Duke
of York's ship was off duty at that hour, and
the yards were manned, three cheers were
given. the band played Âuld Lang Syne, and
Captain Barnier and his mnen wera given a
great send-off. Our present King, who is a
great sailor, actually gave Captain Bernier
directions and courses that hie used during hîs
voyage. While away hie found many coal
mines in the lands that he annexed for Canada in those -northern latitudes. I really
think the Governxnent of this country ought
to do something for him, and I appeal to
the right honourable leader of this bouse
ta see if something cannot be done for this
man, who is now over eighty years of age,
by way of recognition for what he hias done
for Canada. 11e placed aur western boundary

Unitad States later agreed to that boundary

Captain Brnmier in recognition of bis great
services to the country.

intend to discuss the inquiry which the honourable memiber bas made, and bas converted
into a rasolution; I would merely refer
to bis closing remarks. They really are not
pertinent to the inquiry, but I sbould not
feel satisfied if I omitted to andorse wbat hae
bas said with respect to the services rendered
ta this country by Captain Bernier, who
occupies a unique position in the history of
our great. nort.bland. bis years are now many,
but his spirit is strong. H1e still talks like a
youth. It seems to me that Canada owes far
more than she bas paid him for the wondeiful
work hae bas aecomplished and the dangers ha
has faced on bebaif of the namne and place of
this country in t>he great Aretie sphere. No,
man bas bad any experience comparable wit.h
his in our northern waters, nor followed a.
more consistently patriotic course than hae.
I am flot in a position to make any commitment, but no person in this country would ha
more pleased than I to sec Captain Bmnier'a
services fittingly recognized.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I cannot suggegt what ýform of recognition would please
Qa.ptain Bernier, but perhaps -a suggestion
could ha made by the honourable gentleman
from Aima (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne), who is
an ex-Minister of Marine. I have heard it
said by people in the service of the Marchant
Marine of Canada that Captain Bernier
should ha given a higher title in the service,
and that this would greatly please him.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Does the honourable gentleman not intend to express himsalf
on the Hudson Bay Raiiway?
bon. Mr. DANDURAND:
All I eau say
is that a lot of money bas been spent on that
-railway, and I hope the port of Churchill will
continue ta deveilop. I do not know to what
extent that davelopment may go, but I -have
sean so many axtraordinary things ha.ppen in
Mny lifetime that I arn not a pesimist. Who
would have expected suoh a development as
there bas been at Van-couver in recent years?
The Governrnent of whidh I was a member
aesumed heavy obligations in conneotion with
the improvement of the facilities at tihat port,
but who imaginad that the building of tihe
Panama Canal would have such good reaults
for aur Pacifie coast? Plans tha-t may at

Canada has made towards the building up of
the Hudson Bay lino will prove to have been
not in vain.
Hon. Mr. CASCRAIN: ilonourable members, may 1 be allowed to, withdraw the
motion? I do not want to press it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: The honourable gentleman should be allowed to, withdraw his motion, I think. Ho inight also
withdraw bis statement that some of the land
up in the Hudson Bay district has been frozen
since creation. He informed us that týhere were
large -coal areas on an island farther north. If
ho is correct in that, the climate up there
mnust have been warmer at some time in the
past than it is now. There may ho anoyther
climatic change in the future, for wbat bas

H-on. Mr. CASORAIN: Will honourable
members permit me to give a brief dissertation
on geology? Everyone knows that at first
the tal th was verv hot. We have no proof
that the polos wore thon in their present
position, for thero was a glacial period and
tbe earth took a tilt. At Rome one can see
bulîs for the creation of a diocese in Greenland. And I have read in magazines that by
looking tbrough ice on Greenland one may
observe the romains of buge cathedrals. That
indicates wbat climatie changes can occur.

CUSTOMS BIL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen, the
Senate went into Commnittee on Bill 30, an
Act te amend the Customs Act.
Hon. Mr. Copp in the Chair.
On section 1-dellnition; "value for duty":
Right Hon. Mr. M.EIGHEN: Perhaps I
had better deal with ail the sections while I
am on niy feet.
As te section 1, in certain cases the penalty
apparently depended upon tbe ad valorem
duty of the imperted goods, or, as it is stated
in the Act, their "value fer duty," and magistrates have held that there is ne statutory
offence where a specific duty is prescribed.
It is intended by this section te remedy this
defect by defining what "value for duty"
means in snob cases.
The purpose of section 2 is te permit of
heavily laden vessels-for instance, those
carrying cil and cil products-ightening their
load in order te get through sha'llow water
sufficienhtly close te the wharf at which the
cargo is to be landed, and te previde that
this lightening shaîl net render the owners
guilty of an effence under the Customs Act.
Section 3 permits customs officers te board
and search vessels while in Canadian territorial
waters. Hitherto these officials had power te
de se on-]y when, in the words oif the statute.
"hevering"ý-whatever
vessels were
the
"hovering" means.
The object of section 4 is te provide for
seizure and forfeiture o-f unmanifested goods.
It appears that vessels engaged in smuggling
have escaped because cf the absence of some
such. definition. The section aIse makes the
master or person in charge of sùch vessel
guilty cf an offence and provîdee suitable
penalties.
That is the substance of the Bill.
lion. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 do net pretend te be an expert in customs matters, but
I have gone through the Bill and have no
criticism te offer.
Section 1 was agreed te.
Sections 2, 3 and 4 were agreed te.
Týhe preamble and the titie were agreed te.
The Bill was reported without aimendment.

SOLDIER SEYI1LEMENT BILL
SECOND READYING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 45, an Act to umend
the Soldier Settlement Aot.
H-e said: Hon-ourable senators, this is a
successor of several Buis of a similar kind
pyassed in varjous yeurs and designed to lighten
the Ioad of sold-ier settlers.
Section 72, which it is proposed to add to
the Aot, provides that the interest whàch
accrued during the twelve months prior to
i'he standard da-te, October 1 or November 1,
in 1932, s-hal be remitted, and that any
moneys paid in respect of that year shal
be applicable -to principal.
Section 73 provides, in respect of contracts
cntered into prior to, the lst of January,
1933, that any soldier who, between the 31st
of March, 1933, and the 31st of March, 1936,
pays arrears of principal, or any instalment
not in arrears, shall be credited flot only with
the amount se paid, but also wilih an equal
additional amoeunt: he will receive credit for
double what he pays during thait period. He
muet, however, have taken care of taxes and
insurance. Presumably anything he pays is
first applied on interest. Suhoection 3 of
section 73 sets out the conditions precedent
to the extra credit being allo,%ed.
Section 74 .provides t-hat neither the remissien nor the bonus credit. shail apply in thle
case of debts for which the British Government is responsible, or which are paya«ble to
that Government in respect of settlers in
,Canada, unless the British Government takes
appropriate steps to cencur in what la being
done.
Section 75 releases the -lien on the implements upon which a debit is due by the soldier
te ühe Directior. Previously the deht was due
to the Soldier Settlement Board. Und-er the
conditions set out, alithough there remain-s the
obligation te psy, the security constituted by
the lien neo longer exists.
That explanation covers the exutire Bill. No
doubt, these remissions are granted Io the
soldier settlers because of the very discouraging times threugh which they are passing, and
the itendency of se many of them Vo abandon
t-heir land.
Is there
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
ýany estimate of the cost cf these remissions?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: 1 have not
found it. A most exhaustive analysis cf the
Bill reached me about five minutes before I

and <'bat the collections for thbe fiscal year

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Though I
cannot find it, I wou'ld nat say it is not
bore. 1 ama able ta find al.mast anything in
this memorandum. Of those irbo are out af
the hands af the departiment 4,958 bave repaid their boans in fu'll-2,390 by cash repayment and 2,56 by repayaient tbrough the
sale of thoir properties. In 1932 the department loased ta local faraners 2,065 fanms, tbe
resulting revenue being 854,485; frona wbicb
it would appear that those irbo leased farms
paid an average rentai of 827 spiece. The
bonourable senator from Calgary (Hon. Mr.
Burns) wili perbaps think that is toa high a
figure in these bad yeers.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: When I was in
cbarge of governaient legislation, some years
ago, I bad ta doal with this leir, and lice
my right honourable friend, I came ta asic for
remissions. I have reachod the conclusion
that very often we are wiser affer the event
*than we were before. I believe this was a
disastraus venture. If we consider the formidable amount which bas beon expended, more
than $100,000,000, and the amali number
of soldiers who have really benefited by it,
and f rom wbose labours in deveoping the land
the country aiea has benefited, ire find ithat
it probably would have beon botter business
ta givo theai an annuity whicb wou'ld bave
kept theai in claver for lifo.
A general crîticismn that might ho made is
that this favaurod treetment waz extendod
ta but very few aI the 400,000 mnen irba returned from overseas ta ho reabsarbed in
civil liS e. Nevertheless, thbe ides of trying ta
settle returned soldiers on the -land was an
attractive one. AU tbat I bave ta say noir
is thet aur exporience should perbaps make
us a littie more modest in judging thbe actions
of public mon. There is no alternative, however, ta aocepting legisIation af this kind,
whîch is presented ta us from time ta time,
and ire cen only hope tibat this is the lsst
remission that will bave ta ho made in tbis
connoction.

Han. MT. GRIESBACH: It May be of
interest ta honourable inembers ta know how
this policy caime ta be adopted. In 1917 the
Gavernment circularîzed the men under arma,
asking them. what they would like te do
when they left the ar.my. The postearde
reached the men when they were etanding
in the trenches, being shot at from ail
directions, and were filthy, cold and wet. I
forget exactlýy how the questionnaire ran, but
I think it was somewhat like t1his: "«How
would you like ta go farming?" At that time
no man in the Canadian army could think of
anything finer than retiring ta a nice, quiet
fanai. Consequontly every one af them said
ho would like ta go farming. That is what
started this policy. The only lesson ta be
learned froRn what bias happened is that you
cannot very well rely on evidence socured
under such eircuinstances.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I do no.t
though probably
rememnber the circulea,
some sucb efforts were Ma.de in preparation
for the return of the large army of men who
were in Franice. 1 have a very clear recollectien, however, of deputations, large and
numnerous, very often headod by soidiers,
Wihich came to Ottiawa at that time. The
principal problem of the Goveimient af tibat
day was ta find some means of absaiting tiia
vast Multitude, composed xnostly of young
mon, many of whom at the time of leaving
for avertseas were net aid enough ta have
reoeived training for any special occupation.
The mnaiority of the -mon who, had Gield
positions in civil life found on retuning that
-tihose positions were occupied by other people.
Ail the returned men were restive and impatient ta have something done for tihem
quickly. 'I think there wes nlot a single
organization of any importance in Canada
that d-id flot press the Government ta take
means ta place tihese men on the land.
The plan adopted. mas sound, was9 aarefuily
and effectively safeguarded, and was placed
in charge of mon adinirably qxalified for
their work. The great difficulty was that thie
plan had ta be put into operation at a time
when the prevaiiing prices for land were very
býigh. The War had raised tihe priices of
farm ýproducts and other commodities, and
land values foltlowed the genieral trend. Farms
that noir would go begging on the market
et $10 an acre could be re«d-ily sold in Vhoe
days at ton times -that figure. Though every
care iras taken to purdiase land at thie lowest
possible cost, and no commissions irere
allowed under any conditions, there 'bas since
been such a depreciation that no settler, however exceptional fie might be, cauld ever pay

488

SENATE

for the land so boughit. Ordinary ciiîans
who puîohiascd in those days have been
affected in the same way as the ex-soldiers.
In short, the prohiem had to be faced a.t a
time w'hen values were so higlh that they could
not bc sustained.
I quite agi-ce vifth the remarks of my honouî'able friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
to the efftet tiiat, Goverroments somefimes do
flot resist popular appeals; long enough. Some
of these aippeals acquire tremendous force by
virf ue of ncew%,,paper propaganda, and the
powers that be are ton often prone to yie]d.
I hope I may slîy in this Houme, wiî;hout
being mistinderstood, that about tlhe wo.ist
possible guide any Governiment can follow is
the mass opinion of necpapers of tihL country.

trains fromn Toronto to Owen Sonnd now go
hy Streetsville and Brampton. In a word,
the line is still there, but nineteen miles of
it have been abandoned.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:- The point
raised by the bonourable gentleman struck
me yesterday, but I sbould be afraid tbat if
we inserted the words he suggests a railway
could not abandon any portion of a hune, even
ten feet. withot. the approval of the Board.
Dealing witb the illustration cited by tbe honourable gentleman, I do not tbink the courts
would hold that betweeu Fort William and
Sudbury nothing short of the whole line could
be considered a lino within the meaning of
this su.bsection. It seems to me the interpretation would be that a line of railway is a sb
stantial part involving a distinct service; that
so long as there was no loss of a distinct service there would ho no abandonmient of a line,
and that the approval of tbe Commission
would be necessary for any abandoumient
wbîch would result in the discontinuation of a
service. I should profer te, lave the subsection
as it is. If il did not work out in accordance
with the principlo wbich I thiuk will govern
the courts, we conld make an amondment
later.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: AlI right.
The amondment was agroed to.
On section 3-definitions:
The CHAIRMAN: The amendmeut te tbis
section is tbat the word "Arbitral,' occurring
in hune 25 and lino 30 in paragraph b, is not
spelled withi a capital A.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not know
why the word should not be capitalized, as
" Tribunal " is. But by adopting the amnendment we shaîl not ripset the British Constitution.
The amendment was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I eall the attention of the right honourable leader to what
I think is a typographical error in paragraph
b of section 3? It soems te, me that the words
Part Il ' in lino 26 sboiîld read " Part III."
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MiEIGHEN: That is very
important.
The CH.AIRM AN'\: And is thero a similar
error in line 29?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: -No; "Part Il"
lino 29 is aIl right.

in

Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: I think tlic
honourable gentleman is right on both points.
However, the Clerk bas just called my atten-

489

tion te the fact that the error was in the Bill
when we sent it over fromn the Senate. M'e
are now in Committee 10 consider amendments made by the House of Commons to the
Bill. Perhaps we had better leave the matter
for the moment.
On section 4-nominations and appointment.'

The CHAIRMAN: The amendment is thzat
subsection 2 be deleted and the following two
subsections substituted:
(2) One of suchi Trustees shall be their

performance of the duties of bis office and shall
nlot be an officer nor after bis appointment as

of the duties of their office their whole or part
time as niay be determined frein time to tirne
by the Governor in Council, and the salarie,
to be paid to sucb trustees for whole and/or
part time service shall be fixed at the time of
their appointments.
The amendment was agreed to.
On section 6, subsection 1-vacancies:
The CHAIRMAN: The amendment is to
strike ont aIl the words after the word "occurring" at the end of tbe fixst sentence. This
would make the section read:
(1) The Governor in Council may froin tiine
te time appoint or reappoint a Trustee to fili
any va.cancy amnong tbe Trustees frein aiiy cause
occurring.
R'ight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This amendment does away with the panel fromn wbich
a trustee was to be elected in the event of a
vacancy. I may say tihat the amendment is
in distinct an'tagonism to the report of tbe
Duif Commission. Tbe Commission recoinmended that tbere be some safeguard against
political appointments, and suggested that
when a vacaney occnrred a panel should
be furnished to the Governor in Counieil
by a board composed of certain men who were
The
divorced entirely frein polical life.
Senate Committee strengthened that safeguard
by increasing the size of the panel, and now
the House of Commons bas struck out the
whole panel system and left the appointments
entirely with the Governor in Council. I have
confidence enough in the Governor in Council,
but I do point out that this is in distinct
antagonismn te one of the basic recommendations of the Duif Commission.
The amendment was agreed to.

of the employees affected." In this provision
1 sec nothing but delay and disagreement,
because presumably thue direct representatives
of the employees of the Canadian Pacifie
Railway-and 1 know whereof I speak-would
be diametrically opposed to the contentions
of the employees of the Canadian National
Railways, and the operating officiais of the
two roads would say, " Well, we will divide
up the employment and allocate it after you
àgree among yourselves." That miglit take
ai long time. Therefore, speaking as a represent.ative of labour for many years, I may
say that I regard those words as unneccssary.
The relations between the railway men and
the officiais of the two roads have becn of
too cordial a nature to necessitate anything
which wvill onlv delay the allocation of the
emplovees of the two lines under a co-operative plan.
As I have said, it had not been my intention
to say anything in regard to this subjeet, but
when rny honourable leader participated in
the discussion 1 thought it only proper that
I should state my position. 1 thaink the words
I have referred to 'are tota:lly unnecessary and
will be disadvantageous ratbher than advantageous in the settlement of differences between
the employees.
Right Hon. Mr. MiEIGHEN: Honourable
mem'bens, 1 amn in complete agreement with
the honnurable gentleman from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock). The words iaserted
hy the House of Commons are not only unnecessary, but nonsensical. The clause into
which they are injected was given to me in
our Committee by the honourable senator
from Parkdale, thie intention being to make
sucli provision as Parliament reasonably could
make to see to it that under working agreements or operating arrangements, or the like,
between the two systems, there should be a
fair division of the work among those who
had had it before, and that it should not go
elsewhere. The main ,object was to sce that
men were flot displaced any further than was
absolu;tely nacessary. Why in the world
should such a matter be arranged by nego'tiation with the representatives of the men?
Te show how utterly nonsensical the amendment is, I asIc, why du the railway companies
need t0 go to the -men to negotiate in order
that those men may get the work? If it
were a matter in which the men were pulling
one way and the companies the other,
negotiation wouid be proper, but the railways
are directed to do just what the men would
want thrn to do. That being so, why
negotiate? If there were to be negotiations
between the einployees of the Canadian Na-

tional and the employees of the C. P. R. as to
the division of the work, then the negotiations
should be between the representatives of those
two groups of employees, and not between
the e.mployees on the one hand and the
railways on the other.

I do not know how muoh danger there is in
I know it is of no earthly
value. The honourable gentleman from Parkdale will know whether or not it is worth
while moving t0 strike it out. If he thinks
it is, I will supp)ort him. 1 tbink the words
%vhichhave been added are superfluous, if not
non.sextsical, and would be better out of the
this provision.

Bill.

Hon. Mr. MUR.DOCK: My own .iudgment
is that this arnendiment should go out, but I
amn not going to make a motion of tihat, kind,
hrecause this looks good to gentlemen who
were in the bfisiness of negotiating for the
employees ten or fifteen or twenty years ago,
when we used to have to sit on the 'bottoni
step of the railway offices for ten or fifteen
days awaiting an interview. But those days
have gone by. To-day we can go to the
officials in a proper way and discuss anything
on an even footing.
This language is superfluous, and I think it
will resuit in unnecessary discussion between
the employeee of the two lines; but proba>bly
we should leave it there to see how it will
work out. My personal judgment is that later
we shaîl want to place the responsýibility where
it properly belongs--and where it waa placed
before the Bill left this House-namely, witli
the operators of the .two railroads. But let
us try t-his out and see what cornes of it.
The amendments were concurred in.
INDIAN BILL
SECOND READING

Riglit Hon. Mr. MFiIGHEN snoved the
second reading of Bill 21, an Act to amend
the Indian Act.
He said: Honourable members, the main
purpose of this Bill is to provide, once again,
for the enfranchisement of Indians, aven
though thay do flot apply for it. In 1920,
while Superintend-ent Geeral of Indian Affairs,
I introduced into the House of Commone and
laad accapted by it a measure designed for
this very purpose.

Strange as it may saem,

the Indian population, especially the active
and orsitorical members of the bands, are
almost always opposed

to anything of this

kind. They want to keep their populations
intact; they do not want those who maure
intellectually and otherwiise to enter into full
citizenship, and they do not look with favour

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say, honourabie members, thnt the Six Nations Indians
g-ave me considerabie trouble at Geneva. Having done A they couid in týhis country to free
thenives fromn the control of the Dominion
Government, they wvent to the foot of the
Throne, whence they were directed to rotunn
with their compiaints to Ottawa. Theni they
appeaied to the Council of the League of
Nations for protection, ciaiming that Canada
wvas violating a troaty made some 150 years
ago ýbetween a representative of the King and
themseives. I obtained fromn the department
con.siderabie information on the status of thes
Indians and furnished it to the Society of
Friends at Geneva, which w-as endeavouring
to protect -the rights of Indians in Africa, Asia
and America. I rememaber that one of the
grievances was that a police officer of Canada
had dared to invade the Six Nations reserve.
1 cited our iaw whioh permits these Indians to
vote, and showed that ail the members of this
particular band had recognized themselves as
Canadian citizens by going to the poils at the

for enfranchisement:
llight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This is the
section which was referred to on the motion
for second rea.ding.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND : This is the kernel
of the Bill. I quite understandthat the Superintendent General shouid take notice of the
request of an Indian who desires to be enfranchised, but I wonder what wiil govern the
sehection of persons for enfranchisement in the
absence of such requests. As I said before,
the matter wouid he quite simple if the section
appiied only to those individuais who hiad

to live as ordinary Canadian citizens, for thev
wouiid have show-n that thev no longer desired

Bon. Mr. GILLIS: WVilI he nlot be guidesi
by the agent or other official at the reserve
as to wohat men are fit for enfranchisement?
Right Bon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Always.
Indians theniselves can select their own representative on the Enfranchisement Board.
They are allowed thirty days in which to do
this. If they are stubborn and refuse ta do
so, a representative is selected for them.
Section 7 was agreed to.
On section 8--residing or hunting upon any

Section 8 was agreed ta.
Section 9 was agreed ta.
On section 10-restriction on rIndien dances,

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIEN: This amendment strikes out the words "in aboriginal
costume." The original Act provided that
Indians who engaged in stampedes or page
ants in aborîginal costume without the consent
of the Superintendent General or bis authorized agent rcndered themselves liable ta
serious penalties. The a.mendment is intended ta rcnder it a littie -more difficuit for
Indians ta evadýe the ban by making a slight
change in tbeir costume.
Bon. Mr. DANDURAND: W'hat is the
objetion to their taking part in dances and
stampedes?
Right Bon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Mr. Graham,
the late Commissioner at Regina, who was in
the Indiian service for over forty years, told
me that dances among the Indians were pretty
wild affairs, and most degrading and dangerous,
having a tendeacy ta take themn back ta jungle
conditions. The best Indian authon'ties say
"N;o," and I am ready to follow their advice.

The preamble and the title were agreed ta.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: W'hen shaîl this
B3ill be read the third tîme?
Bon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 think the
Senate would be interested in knowing whether
enfranchisement might resuit in a whole band
being dispersed. 1 would suggest ta xny right
honourable friend that the third reading of

the Bill sheuld be d'eferred and in the meantime hie should ascertain from the Department
of Indian Affairs what procedure the board
is to follow in selecting Indians to be enfranchised.
R'ight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In vie'w of
the honourable senator's request 1 wil1 flot

Hon. Mr. MceMEANS:
Wouid it not ho

adultery a crime, as it is: in several States
cf bbe Union?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

reads, "Every person wbo, in the home cf a
ebilî, participates in adultery," and so on.
Would tbat cover the case cf a woman wbo
bas ieft bier iuusband and is liv ing witbi

MAY il, 1933
Right Hon. Mr. MEJOHEN:
It would.
I tbink this is a very dangerous clause.
Hou. Mr. DANDUIRAND:
I think it goes
far beyond what seems on the surface to be
its effect. As the honourable gentleman from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeans) bas said, it
would perbaps be better to wrestle witb the
broad problem rather than try to punish
adultery in this way. I would direct attention to the difficulty that if there are no
cbjîdren in the home adultery does not constitute an offence.
Hon. M-r. MeMEANS: 1 may say, Mr.
Chairman, that there have been within my
own experience several cases of people living
together as man and wife, baving children
of their ewn, and being looked upon in the
neighhbourhood in m-icbl they lived as miarried
people. I can caîl to mind several cases of
Englishmen wbo, flnding it impossible to live
with their wives, lef t England and came to
this country with other women, with whomn
tbey lived as respectable married people. 1
remember on one occasion drawing a will for
a man from England. One day hoe brought
me a summons wbich biad been served upon
him, demanding support for bis wife in England. 1 theu learned for t.he first time that
tbe woman with wbomn hoe
had been living,
and wbo bad borne bim cbildren, was not bis
wife. I 'bad to tell hima that 'bis will was
no good. He had no idea in the world of
committing any offence.
Very often amendments are made to the
Criminal Code witbout any conqideration
being given to the effect tbey will bave. I
quite admit that it would bie very improper
for a man te live in a bouse with an immoral
woman if there was a child tbere; bui tbîis
section doos much more tban to deal witb
sueb a case. We sbould ho very careful in
amending the criminal law. Some countries
have gone to gro-at lengtbs. In several States
of the Union adultery is punishable by imprisonmient for two years. Fortunately, that
bas nover been tbe law in Canada nor in
England. I tbiok this clause sbould ho struck
out.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The clause gees
mucb further. It says:
Every persan who indulges in habituai
drunkenncss or any other form of vice, thereby
endangering the morals of such child or rendering the home of sucli child an un-fit place for

0f courso drunkenness is a dreadful vice, or

that it sbould ho punislied under the wording
of this clause?

organization had succeeded in getting a provision inserted raising the age of consent, and
imposing one of the heaviest penalties known
to the law upon any man having sexual
intercourse with a girl under that age, even
though she were a common prostitute. All
she had to do was to prove that there had
been sexual intercourse between herself and
the man, and he immediately became liable
to this extreme penalty. Senator Ross suggested an amendment whereby the judge
was enabled to instruct the jury that if they
found the complainant either wholly or partially to blame they might acquit the accused.
This did much to prevent successful blackmail.

SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN

moved the

second reading of Bill El, an Act to amend
the Act respecting the Senate and House of
Commons.

Canada is not adhering to the convention.
That is just what we are doing.

He said: Honourable members, I wish to
move a slight amendment to the title of the
Act, and would suggest that after the second
reading we go into Committee of the Whole.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Then why disavow
that by striking out reference to the convention?

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

able gentleman is wrong in implying that

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Let me explain. The draft convention has been signed,
but has not been approved. The resolution
of approval has not yet been subnitted to
Parliament. Therefore the Committee thought
it better not to imply approval, and struck
out certain words. But the Bill is left in
such a form that it contains all the clauses
essential to be put into effect when the draft
convention is approved. I hope the honourable gentleman will accept my word that in
the committee I contended strenuously for
the preservation of these clauses, and that I
should have been glad to bave his assistance
there.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Will the right honourable gentleman state that the draft convention does not say that the expression "tackle"
shall inelude "all such articles whether on ship
or ashore"?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It may.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Then why did the
Committee change the section to make it
not applicable to such articles on the shore?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: For the reason
that the inspection ashore is now being done
by the provinces. So long as there is governmental inspection in Canada the convention
is complied with; it is not necessary that the

Dominion Government should reinspect something already inspected by a provincial government.

The motion for concurrence in the Committee's report was agreed to.

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Right lon. Mr. Meighen, the
Senate went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Webster in the Chair.
On section 1-lenders of money to Government:

Rtight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This Bill was
explained yesterday, and I am sure alil hon-

ourable members are in favour of it. When

When I purHon. Mr. DAiNDURAND:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is the
reason for its appearance -in the Bill. I may
say that the clause was drawn by the honourable member from North York (Hon. Sir

Allen Aylesworth), and the House may rest
assured that it meets the occasion.
Section 1 was agreed to.
The preamble was agreed to.
On the title:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I move that
in the bible the words "the Act respecting"
be struck out and the word "Act" be added
at the end. The title will then read: An Act

INDIAN BILL
MOTION FOR THIRD READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
third reading of Bill 21, an Act to amend the
Indian Act.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
members, I am informed that when this Bill
was before the House ast week mv deskmate, the honourable leader on this side (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand), asked for certain information. I presume my right honourable friend
can furnish the information now.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
The
honourable leader on the other side questioned whether compulsory enfranchisement of
the chiefs or eading men would not disintegrate or demoralize the band.
He also
desired to know whether on enfranchisement
an Indian would share in the property-the
land and funds-of the band.
As to the first question, it would never be
in contemplation that a whole band should
be enfranchised en bloc. In the selection of
those who are to be enfranchised care is taken
that nothing shall be done to injure the
status of the band. The very fact that certain members have reached positions of independence indicates that it is a progressive
band and that there are others not very far
behind the leaders. Consequently the band
will never lack internai leadership. If it were
ever contemplated to enfranchise a whole
band, it would have to be effected, I think, by
a special Act.
On the second point, the general explanation
I gave last Thursday was correct, but I can
amplify it now. When an Indian is enfranchised ho is entitled at once to bis full share
in cash of the funds of the band; also to the
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

farm implements allotted to him. In addition
he is entitled to the land he bas been accustomed to farm. Therefore he romains within
the area of the reserve. But he owns bis land
outright; he is a full fledged citizen. The
reserves are laid out in sections and townships;
consequently an Indian who becomes enfranchised and receives a patent of lis land is able
to get access to the outside world through the
roads and lanes on the reserve without trespassing on the property of any member of the
band.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY: Could an Indian dispose of his land to a white man?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There are, I
think, no restraints on bis powers of disposition; otherwise he would not be the owner.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is bis land.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: A reserve is square
or rectangular in shape as a general rule. An
Indian who wants to farm for himself is
allotted the equivalent of a quarter-section.
Suppose that quarter-section is in the centre
of the reserve: from my general knowledge of
Indian administration, I cannot agree that the
enfranchised Indian, even if the land is deeded
to him, can sell it; and I am pretty certain
that an execution judgment against him could
not bo enforced.
It would be contrary to
public policy that an Indian should be allowed
to sell a piece of land in the centre of a
reserve. I suggest that my right honourable
leader go into the matter a little more fully. I
know Indians who are farming lands in the
centre of their reserves, and, as I say, I think
it would be contrary to public policy, and
perhaps in breach of our treaty obligations,
for us to make it possible for segments of a
reserve to be alienated either by sale or execution.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have no information that the full rights of citizenship
are abbreviated when an Indian is enfranchised; but I do not like to be too positive on
the point. The further memorandum I have
received makes no reference to it.
In bis
memorandum Mr. McGill, Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, states:
Each Indian is paid bis per capita share of
the band funds and is given a patent for the
lands he occupies. where he remains undisturbed with all his former surroundings and
friends.
le is not driven away. The lands
for which an Indian receives a patent cease,
on such issue. to be a part of the reserve and
becoi
reseive

part of the municipality in which the
is situated.
Some apprehension was

It was decibed as m)aking a checker-board of

application of Indians fromn time to time durin~

where sudh enfranichisements are likedy te take
place are surveyed into lots and highways just
as in a township. The occupants of these lots
have access to the bighways and can get about
without disturbing their neighbours in any
way.
Certainly the clear inference is that once the
land is tranferred to an enfranchised Indian it
ceases to be a part of the reserve.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The land might be
added to the municipality and be subject to,
taxation, but the municipal officiaIs could not
enter on the reserve and build roads, bridges,
schoolhouses or anything else. 1 wonder how
the rnunicijjality can tax the Indian when it
is precluded from giving himn any municipal
services. The statement by the Deputy Superintendent General is certainly very clear and
appears to deal with events that have
happened. Perhaps 1 amn merely behind the
times.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The honourable gentleman fromn De Lorimier (Hon. Mr'.
Dandurand) will be here to-morrow. Would
my right honourable friend mind allowing the
third reading f0 stand until then?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHE'N: Not at ail.
The motion for the third reading stands.
JUDOES BLL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN moved tho
second reading of Bill 84, an Act ta amend
the Judges Act.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Explain.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not car'
to qay anything now except of a very general
chara-eter. I do not know of any problem
more difficuit to deal with in the hope of
producing an absolutely equitable result than
the one attacked in the Bill now before us.
As is well known, under the state of our law
-and in this terni I include our constitutional
rights-iudges of the higher courts of our
country are appointed for life or good conduct,
by virtue of the enactmnent of an Imperial
statute. The abbreviation of their tenure cf
office is therefore flot something that cornes
within the unrestrained purview of the Parliament cf Canada. Our ceunty courts arc
established by virtue of general puwers vested
by Imperial statute in this Parliament and in
the provincial legislatures, and under those
powers provision wvas made many years ago

505

that county court judges should retire from
office and accept pension at the age of 75.
Because cf the different position cccupied by
the higher court judges, their retirement at a
certain age cannot be effected by the sanie
method that applies to county court judges.
Consequently a condition of affairs bas grown
up-it is not a new condition, or one that
hais not existed before-under wbich, in some
instances, the judges cf our higher courts have
continued to hold office after reaching an age
at which normally the capacities cf the individual are net at their best. While certain
persons "by reason cf strength," to use the
words cf the psalmist, have retained their
powers undiminished, others have nef, and
1 am informed that there bas been a persistent
and general complaint that the presenit system
has rcsulted in injury te the public service.
The method adopted by this Bill for the purpose cf remedying the situation cannot, cf
course, do entire justice to ail. I have already
conceded that there are instances cf very exi raordinarv men whc continue to perforni their
funictions creditably and acceptably even after
they have reachied feurscore years; but a.s
there are not a few instances te the contrary.
the law must be general in character and must
contain such provisions as appear in the Bill
before us.
The Bill provides that .iudges shiaîl be entitled te retire on full pension at the age cf
seventy-flve, and that those who do net elect
te retire at that time shahl receive by way cf
salary ne more than the amount cf such pension. 1 arn quite aware that honourable mcmbers cf the Hcuse will have in mmnd certain
valued members cf the judiciary te whcmn it
would seemn unfortunate that this Bill should
apply. I can only add that honourable senators should take a broad, general view cf the
entire problcm and measure the tetumn cf
advantage or cf gcod against the tetum cf
disadvantage or Mi. If they find the latter te

because incapacity must be inferred from
their age. Parliament recognized in 1928 that
it had perpetrated an injustice the previous
year .towards the federal judges, yet we are
asked to pass this Bill, which would work the
same injustice towards the superior court
judges.
If it is true that at the age of seventy-five
a judge becomes incompetent, why not remove him by the application of the present
law?
As I have already said, in 1922 an
amendment to the Judges Act was passed
providing that if any judge is found, after
investigation, to be incompetent, either from
old age or any other cause, he can be constrained to leave the Bench and take his
pension.
Therefore I submit, honourable
members, that the present Bill is not required.
But there is more to be said. Why should
litigants be deprived of the benefit of having
their cases tried by judges of long experience
who, no matter what their ages may be, are
fully competent?
If this Bill carries, a number of judges in
the Province of Quebec will suffer grievous
injustice. I hesitate to name any of them.
I believe, however, that the Bar of my province would, with few if any dissidents, hold
that several of the judges falling under the
provisions of this measure still possess some
of the brightest legal minds in the country.
If this Bill becomes law, judges not only in
the superior court but in the court of appeals,
men who have no peers in the profession, at
least in Quebec, will have to step down from
their high position, for presumed incapacity,
although they are as bright and alert, physically and mentally, as they have ever been.
I repeat, the most striking feature of this
measure is its crying injustice. The State
should respect its contracts with individuals.
If agreements with judges are violated, will
not other lifetime agreements be treated in
the same way? If we in the Senate do not
protect other people against injustices, why
should we be protected?
Will it be considered that age brings about incapacity only
on the Bench? We in the Senate should be
particularly careful to see that contracts made
by the State are faithfully observed.
The right honourable the Prime Minister of
to-day denounced in eloquent and forcible
terms the amendment of 1927, to which I have
referred, as a violation of contract. That
amendment applied only to the federal judges,
over whom Parliament has direct authority.
The present measure is equally vicious, and
besides it deals with the superior court judges,
over whom Parliament has no such control,
except indirectly, through the payment of
emoluments. Not only is the measure unjust,

507

but it is unnecessary, for, as I have already
pointed out, there is now in the statutes a
provision for the removal of an incompetent
judge. May I read the law, so that honourable members may satisfy themselves that it
is so applicable and effective? Of course, I
understand that laws must be made for the
good of the public as a whole, and that we
must close our eyes to isolated cases of hardships resulting from an attempt to legislate
for the general weal. But I want to emphasize that such an argument does not apply
here, for there is not the slightest necessity for
the Bill. The law which provides for the
removal of an incompetent judge is keen and
snappy. Section 28 of the Judges Act, chapter
105 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927,
says:
Any judge of the Supreme Court of Canada
or of the Exchequer Court of Canada, or of
any superior court in Canada, or any local
judge in Admiralty of the Exchequer Court of
Canada or any judge of a county court, who is
found by the Governor in Couneil, upon report
of the Minister of Justice, to have become, by
reason of age or infirmity, incapacita.ted or
disabled froin the due execution of his office,
shall, notwithstanding anything in this Act
contained. cease to be paid or to receive or to
be entitled to receive any further salary, if the
facts respecting the incapacity or disability are
first made the subject of enquiry and report in
the manner hereinafter provided, and the judge
is given reasonable notice of the time and place
appointed for the enquiry and is afforded an
opportunity by himself or his counsel of being
beard thereat and of cross-examination of
witnesses and of adducing evidence on his own
behalf.
It is clear that the law as it exists at present
is amply sufficient to force the withdrawal of
a judge incompetent for any reason. Therefore I say this measure is not necessary.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: Move the six montha'
hoist.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I do not intend to
stress the further objection that if the purpose of the Bill is carried out the yearly
cost of the administration of justice will be
increased by some $100,000 immediately, and
by much more bereafter. But in my opinion
the dominating question raised by the proposed
legislation is this: Shahi we remain free to
choose the best material in the country for
our judiciary? Will this be possible if year
by year we amend the law and render the
judges' tenure of office shorter and more insecure?
I think one serious objection to the Bill
would be removed if it were made to apply
to future appointments only. Then those who
accept judgeships would do so with ful
knowledge of what is in store for them on
their attaining the age of seventy-five years

SENATE

508

But to make these provisions operative against
present members of the judiciary is, I submit,
a gross injustice whieh this 1ouse, at all
events, should not perpetrate.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: Honourable senators, I regret that so important
a measure should come before this House at
such a late stage in the session, when many
honourable members are net able to be present, and I hope that before the discussion on
the second reading bas ended. sufficient objection to the passage of the Bill may develop
to induce the right honourable leader of the
House (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) to withdraw it.
So far as I can see, there is no urgent need
for the Bill. In this connection I should like
to call attention to the theory implied in
the Bill, namely, that the judges who will
be affeeted by it are, notwithstanding their
age, perfectly competent to disoharge the
duties of their office. That is the necessary
implication in the option which is given to
each of them to remain on the Bench at a
reduced salary. This state of things could not
possibly be allowed to continue if there were
real necessity for immediate retirement of the
prset

occupants

by

reo.-n

of intefficiency.

The Bill proceeds. not upon any principle,
but upon the mere circumstance that a judge,
no matter how efficient he may be, bas reached
the age of seventy-five years. I submit that
this is utterlv vicious, and that the passing
of the Bill would be entirely detrimental to
the public interest.
More than twenty-five years ago, when I
was in charge of the Department of Justice,
a very distinguished and very active member
of this House came to me to discuss the idea
of forcing judges to retire when they reached
sorne given age-I think it wxas seventy.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is worse.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORITH: The
honourable gentleman, a lawyer, gave me
instances in his own province-not the province from which I come-where in his opinion

as a professional man the efficiency of an
aged judge was so greatly impaired that his
retention in office was a menace to the due
administration of justice. I declined to entertain the idea. I argued it would be utterly
wrong to attempt te establish an age limit
which should apply to every judge; that it
would be contrary to the true interest of the
country and the proper administration of
justice. It would be an attempt to standardize where standardizing is a natural impossibilitv. If a man were a mere machine. it
wou l be all very well perhaps to standardize,
but just so long as there is individuality in
Hon' Mr BEAUBIEN.

human beings it will be impossible to lay
down any hard and fast rule to apply to all
without doing grave injury to the true interest of the country.
We all know that many a man at the age
of seventy-five is better fitted for doing intellectual work than bis neighbour who may
be only fifty years old. Then how is it possible to say to a body of men, who, after all,
are only so many individuals, "You must
retire from the Bench when you reach a
particular age because, forsooth, the majority
of men at that age have their intellectual
faculties impaired"?
Another consideration which was suggested
to me at the time I speak of, by one of my
colleagues in the Government, the watch-dog
of the treasury, the Minister of Finance, appealed to him perhaps more than it did to
me. He said it would be a scandal to let any
judge who was fit to do his work leave the
Bench and walk around the streets, drawing
his full pay for doing nothing, while the
country paid his successor full salary for doing
the work, simply because he was somewhat
younger. Is that not true?
In the other Chamber the Solicitor General
stated that fifteen judges would be affected by
this measure if it became law. If they accept
the alternative this Bill offers tlem, and relire upon pension, and fifteen othor judgs are
appointed at full salary to do their work. the
federal treasury will have to pay the fifteen
retired judges at least two-thirds of their
present salaries for doing nothing. At a time
when we are being urged to sacrifice, when
flie Minister of Finance is looking everywhere to find sometliing new to tax, w-ben
(verybodv is being taxed to death, we are
calmily told that the country ought to bave
its permanent debt increased by some hundreds of thousands of dollars, as it would be
if -ou capitalized the annual increase in cost
which the passing of this measure would involve. I submit that the whole thing is uttcrly wrong in principle, in that it is impossible to fix for a set of men any given aige at
wbich their efficiency will be so impaired that
they wxill no longer he competent to do their
work.
On more than one occasion, twenty-five
years ago, the bonourable senator to whom I
have referred repeated his arguments to me.
1 finallv took the liberty of saying to the
good oid gentleman, "How do you think it
would do to apply your plan to the Senate?"
He was forced to argue, in order to be iogical,
that the position of a judge was far more
important and carried with it necessity for a
biglier degree of intellectuality than the position of a member of Parliament. I differed
with him then, and I differ with him now. I

MAY 15, 1933
think it is just the other way about. In -ny
view the honourahie members of this Chamber, whose function and duty it is to help
make the Iaws of this country, have a responsibility at least equal to that of the judges
on the Bench, whose duty it is to interpret
the laws. Furtherrnore, under the constitution, in case of impeachmnent we are the
judges of the judge. Lt is to this Chamber
that the question would corne for decision:
Has the judge so rnisconducted himself that
he ought to be no longer in office? 1 think I
arn justified in the position 1 have indicated,
that there is certainly upon the individual
members of this Chamber as rnuch responsibility as upon the judges of our superior
courts, if not greater responsibility.
1 would direct the attention of honourable
senators to this fact. We have, by actual
count, nineteen members of this Chamber
who have passed their seventy-fifth birthday.
Eleven of those honcurable gentblemen sit on
one side cf the House, eight on the other. I
arn one of the eight. 0f course, 1 cannot ask
any'body to express hirnacif as to the fitness of
the eight honourable gentlemen, but 1 will
juat remind you of what you all know-that
arnong thern are leading members of this
Chamber. Then take the eleven old gentlemen who sit on the other side of the Huse,
andi again, if you look over their names, you
will find among themn some of our most
distinguished and moat active members. I
arn wiîhing to put my case to my colleagues
who sit beside me on this side of the bouse.
Is there one of you who can say that of the
eleven honourable gentlemen 1 have indicatcd
a single one has so deteriorated inteliectually
by reason of advancing years that he is not
perfectly competent to f111 the position he
now occupies?
The sarne thing is true of the members of
the Bench, so far as'I amn acquainted with
them. There are fifteen, it is said, in the
Dominion. The numbers for each province
were given by the Solicitor General. Six of
them are in the Province of Ontario and une
is in the Province of Saskatchewan. With
each one of those seven I arn intimately
acquainted, and 1 mey say that with each one
of them I have had the privilege of lifedong
warrn personal friendshîp. I arn content to
say-not bold to say, because everybody
knows it-that those seven men, the one frorn
Saskatchewan and the six frorn Ontario, are
to-day among the rnost 1earned, most efficient,
most experienced and ablest judges in Canada.
If we pass this measure it will mean that
sirnply because ýeach one of those men has
passed his seventy-fifth birthday the country is to lose his services or he is to be

509

forced to take a salary substantially lower
than that received by bis most junior
colleague. It is flot fair, i-t is nlot reasonable,
it is flot in the interest of the country that it
should be done. Speaking for myself, with no
other ýpersonal interest in the matter than
that of friendship, 1 protest against it and
say that this measure ought neyer to have been
introduced.
The onily real argument or excuse offered in
favour of it in the other Chamber just shows
the danger of taking the first step. It was
said: "WTe are going to do this because you
did it. You have done it before, in the case
of the federal ýcourts-the Supreme Court and
the Court of Exchequer; now we are going to
do it in the case of the superior courts- of the
provinces." In exactly the saine way, when
the corrcsponding measure with regard to the
federal courts in Ottawa was introduced and
passed in the other House, it was said to be
justified because the pre.vious Goveronent
had done the same thing in the case of the
county judges. That was what the honourable gentleman whom I aiiuded. to wanted
me to do twenty-five years ago-to start with
the cotinty Judges, and, I suppose, to worl:
upwards, just as has been done u-p to the
present time, when we have the culmination of
it ail in the present Bill.
It is a vcry unpleasant thought that this is
a step which no one would be willing, 1 suippose, to undertake to put into force by direct
enactmient. At any rate, this Bill does flot
pretend to say that every .iudge who completes his seventy-fifth year must irnmediately
retire. It goes about the matter by a circuitous route, in a fashion which. I cannot hoIp
saying is unworthy of Parliament. Lt is just
the same kind of whipping the devîl round
the sturnp that we had a year ago in the
matter of reducing the judges' salaries, or of
putting upon them instead an extra ten per
cent tax. I protested against that a year ago,
and 1 cannot help protest.ing again, because 1
think that if the present measure simp'ly enforccd immediate resignation very few indeed
would be found willing to support it.
A great many people think, and after reading
the rernarks of the Prime Minister in the
buse of Commons I cannot help forrning the
opinion that he thinks, that the salary we
pay to our judges is a matter of contract and
that the lowering of that salary would be a
breach of contract as bctween the indivi-dual
Judge and the Parliament of Canada. I arn
not willing to say that 1 think otherwise. But
I do not like putting it upon that ground. It
may be that in many respects the appointrnent
cf a jiudge or his acceptance of office is in
the nature of a contract on his part to serve

"lu

SENATE

and on the part of the Government to pay.
But even if there was an absolute contract,
we have never. I think, known an instance
where the individual judge would object to
having Ite contract varied by an increase in
the amotnt of the salary. At any rate, there
tas been repcuted agitation to secure an increase of salary for the judges, and if there is
a sacred contract that cannot be broken on
either side, I do not veryv well see how anyone
could support a change in the way of increasing the salary, any more than in the way of
diiinishing it.
But whetter or not there is any actual contract as to salary. I do say tliat it would be
nothing else tian a breact of good faith on
the part of Parliaiment to make this Bill apply
te judges ahemdy appointed. Every man who
is offered a position on the Bench lias nccessarily to consider seriously the consequences
of accepting scieh an offer. W e are often told
tiat the salaries now paid our judges are
much too low; that it is impossible to get the
best of the practising hiwey es of the country
te take judicial position-, simply because all,
or liany of thiiem arc makàIing annual incomes
imch larger tlImn their salaries would be. I
think tiat is probablv true as to the a mount
of incoime in coinparisoit with the amount of a
judicial salary But I would point out as a
v.
couitervailing circumstancc a factor which
to my pensonal knowlelge tas been the
determuining influence in the case of many a
mtan who has ac cpted a iutdg-hip it a considerable pecuniary sacrifice. I refer to the
retiring alloswance. There is provision for old
age wiich lias alwaysv been regarded as a
coetractual obligation on the part of the
Governnent or of the Parliamtent of Canada.
That provision was in existence, I fancy,
before any of us were born. At any rate,
it was on the Statute Book before I had
any personal knowledge of the statutes of
the country, and tas remained ever since.
Over and over again, that retiring allowance
tas been looked upon as a material part of
the judicial remuneration, as compensation to
a judge for accepting a salary lower than ho
otherwise clearly would have been entitled to.
How, then, can you say to a man who has
been serving on the Bench for ten, fifteen or
twenty years, "Yeu retire now or your salary
for the future will be reduced to the amount
which you would have been entitled to receive
as a pension if you had retired some years ago,
when you reached the age of seventy-five"?
Yeu are simply making an inroad upon the
pension which the statute provided at the
time the judge in question accepted his judicial
position. At the close of his judicial career
you are taking frem him the very inducement
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH.

which you held out to him fifteen or twenty
years ago as a reason why ho might serve for
years at a greatly reduced salary. That, it
seems to me, is an utter breach of good faith.
So strongly do I feel upon this point that I
intend to move in committee, if this measure
receives its second reading, an amendment to
make this legislation applicable only to future
appontments. There will be no bad faith
about it if there is a provision like this on
the Statute Book when any proposed appointment is under consideration by a man to be
appointed; ho will know exactly what are his
prospects in a financial way, and he will be
able to make his decision accordingly. But
if the Bill is to be made to apply to judges
who have already earned their full statutory
pension-to those who are entitled to it as a
matter of deferred salary-I say it constitutes,
if not an absolute breach of contract, at any
rate a breach of good faith.
I want te mention one other evil effect that
this legislation would have. If it passes in any
form it will croate two distinct classes of
judges on the Bench-those who have reached
seventy-flive and those who have not-and
will discriminate between those two classes in
the matter of remuneration. I think that any
discrimination of that character is a bad thing
and ought never to be permitted if it is possible of avoidance.
And let me point out just one thing more,
as te how this measure will work in actual
practice. It will give to each judge who tas
attained or may attain the age of seventy-five
years the option of continuing in office or
retiring upon a certain pension. Well, who
is going to accept the option of continuing to
serve at the reduced amount except a judge
who can afford to do so? It will depend on
the circumstances of the individual judge. A
judge who is a wealthy man of himself, apart
from his salary, or who happons to have
married a wealthy woman, or whose children
are all well-to-do, or away from home and
doing for themselves, can afford to accept the
reduced pay. And that is exactly what such a
man will do. le will snap his fingers at this
legislation and will decline to give to those who
are proposing it the satisfaction of seeing him
forced off the Bench. But the poor man who
tas given his life to the service of his country,
and who at the age of seventy-five is unable
to support himself otherwise than upon what
he receives from the Covernment, will be
forced off the Bench by reason of this reduction in salarv. That mceans discrimination
of the very worst sort, and wil be the
nces-ary effeet of this legislation if it passes.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, someone-do not ask me who it was

MAY 15, 1933
-has said, "Consistency, thou art a jewel."
For years we have had on the Statute Book
a law which prohibits a member of the Board
of Railway Commissioners from continuing in
office after he is seventy-five years of age.
Not long ago a very distinguished member of
the Railway Commission was removed because
he had reached that age.
Let us come nearer home and consider what
happens to employees of the various departments of the ýGovernment service. For some
years past the rule has been, and so far as I
know it still is, that if a Minister desires to
retain the services of a particularly valuable
employee who has reached the age of seventy
years, he must go through a certain procedure,
including the making of a requisition, and
even when this is effective the employment is
extended only one year; so the same procedure has to be gone through year by year
so long as the Minister wishes to retain that
employee. And employees of both the great
railway systems of Canada are usually retired
automatically at the age of sixty-five years.
There are some exceptions to this rule, extensions being sometimes granted for one year
or, if an employee is particularly efficient
mentally and physically, for two or three
years.
From both sides of the House this afternoon
we have heard eloquent pleas on behalf of a
few brilliant and capable gentlemen who were
chosen to adorn the Bench of Canada and
who, after serving for fifteen, twenty or more
years with credit to themselves and the country, have now reached the age of seventy-five.
This is five years more than the allotted span
of life as set out in Holy Writ. We are told
that it is a deplorable thiing to take these men
out of service merely because of their age and
say to them-to use a railroad term: "Go on
spot for the rest of your life. You will have
five, six or seven thousand dollars a year coming to you because of the regard of the people
for the worth and ability that you have displayed in the service of Canada." How terrible, how cruel, is such a proposal as we
have heard it described on both sides of this
Chamber!
My good friend who sits directly opposite

me (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) states that this Bill
is unnecessary, because, if a judge is alleged
to be physically or mentally incapacitated, a
Royal Commission or some other investigating body can be set up and can decide whether

the allegation is wel founded. But what a
cruel procedure that would be, to take a
distinguished judge who has served his country well for many years, and who believes

himself to be as competent as ever, and
subject him to an inquiry into his fitness.

Some

people

believe

that

certain

other

persons, who have not reached anything like

the age of seventy-five, are incapable of
éarrying on the work they are doing. It is
often a question of the point of view. Any
judge who was subjected to such an inquiry

as provided for by the present law would be
regarded from one end of Canada to the
other as incompetent.
The honourable senator from North York
(Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) contended that
this measure would result in the violation of
contracts. But does not the passing of time
bring about different conditions and necessitate the changing of arrangements?

In this

age of technocracy there are, it is said,
approximately one million persons unemployed in Canada. A number of them who,
as I happen to know, have spent a good
many years and a great deal of money in

the acquirement of legal knowledge and
experience, are not doing very well to-day,
some being almost as badly off as many of
our railroad men and other citizens are.
The provisions of the Bill are logical and
consistent, and, I think, in line with all comparable regulations of which we have knowledge. in Canada or elsewhere. The proposal
is simply that judges who have served
their country well and have attained to the
age of seventy-five years will be "placed on
spot" with a substantial salary for the remainder of their lives. It seems to me, though
I may be entirely wrong, that some of the
objections that have been raised to the
measure here have their root in the thought
that if we agree to this proposal concerning
the judges we shall be compelled later on,
for the sake of consistency, to take a similar
stand with respect to members of the Senate.
I am willing to vote right now for a similar
provision applicable to all who have become
members of this Chamber since the lst of
March, 1930. I believe the people of Canada would approve of such a measure. In
saying this I am not opposing in any way the
remarks of the distinguished senator from
North York as to honourable members on
both sides of the House who have reached
or passed the age of seventy-five years. I
believe that as surely as I am standing on
my feet just now the time is coming when
we shall have a regulation, similar to the
one proposed in this Bill, applicable to members of the Senate. I repeat that I am ready
to vote right now for such a regulation,
applicable to all who have become senators
since the lst of March, 1930-the others, we
should hope, being spared to reach a good old
age in the service of the public.

SENATE

The people of Canada, from one end to the
other, are interested in this Bill, and I believe
that if they were consulted they would be in.
favour of it. I certainly am.
Hon. G. PARENT: Honourable senators, I
am very much surprised at the remarks of
the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock), for as a rule he is opposed to
the incurring of large expenditures. He favours
the retirement of a number of judges, which
would necessitate the appointment of others
to take their place and, in each such instance,
the payment of $16,000 a year instead of
$9,000. As the honourable senator from North
York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) has stated,
the increased expenditure resulting from this
Bill would represent, if capitalized, a sum of
hundreds of thousands of dollars. I would
suggest to the honourable senator from Parkdale that we cannot make a fair comparison
between judges of the superior courts and
railway commissioners or deputy ministers.
Wlhen a railway commissioner or a deputy
minister joins the service of the Government
lie knows exactly what the conditions of his
einployment are and when his tenure of office
will expire. But it is difforent with the judges.
In my opinion this Bill is inherently wrong.
As I listened to the right honourable leader
of the House (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) when
he introduced the Bill I felt that he could,
if requested, have made a much stronger case
againot it. It struck me that the presentation
of such a measure was a rather painful duty
for hin. On the other hand, I was much
impressed by the remarks of the honourable
senator froin Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien).
I think he covered the ground thoroughly;
all the reasons that would appeal to the legal
mind on this question were given by him.
If he overlooked anything, the honourable
senator from North York (Hon. Sir Allen
Aylesworth) has made good the omission.
Therefore it is unnecessary for me to say
much on the Bill. Neverthelos, I must state
that what it proposes would work a great
injustice. Many able judges are on the Bench
becaueo thev were requested, ýsome of them
very strengly, o sacrifice tleir professional
practice in order that the best possible judgments might be rondered the -litigants of this
countrv. These judges have been appointecd
for life. and mnost of them remain capable
ong
es as thoy live of fulfilling their duties.
On wî'hat principle would tho Coernmcn t
of Canada be acting if it were to sav to
some of these men, " You niust retire froi
your position, or, if you refuse, you will be
paid only the same remuneration as if you
had retired and been pensioned"? Under this
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

Bill, although most of the judges who have
passed the age of seventy-five years are still
highly capable, they would have their
salaries eut by about one-third, even if they
continued te perform their duties.
In our own province of Quebec we have a
number of eminent judges who are more than
seventy-five years old. One of these, if I may
mention a name, is the Chief Justice, Sir
François Lemieux, who is now eighty-two. He
bas had a long and fruitful career. The lawyers
who know him realize that no judge has
devoted more time and energy to the dispensing of justice than he. On many occasions
when younger judges found it necessary,
owing to illness, to take a vacation, Sir François wvas ready to substitute for them, and he
always did so with a great deal of satisfaction
to all concerned. Net long ago, after a vacation, he returned to bis heavy duties. How
many other able judges over seventy-five there
are throughout Canada I do not know, but
we are all familiar with the name of one other
whose reputation is nation-wide. I refer to
the Chief Justice of Ontario, Sir William
Mulock. I am told there are many others
wiho are quite capable of continuing to carry
on their work, but who will be affected by this
Bill. If this b so-and I have no reason to
believe that it is not-this measure is
nefarious, for it commits an injustice towards
these mon. I do not believe it would be right
to confirii what the House of Commons bas
donc and pass this Bill, and therefore I intend
to vote against it.
As the honourable gentleman from Montaro(n. Mr. Beaubien) has stated, the
ville
present law provides a means for the retirement of judges who are found te be incompetent. So long as a judge retains his capacity,
his contract with the Government should be
respected. In any event, as the honourable
senator from North York (Hon. Sir Allon
Aylesworth) has suggested, we should net make
the Bill retroactive, but, if we pass it, should
limit its application to judges appointed in
the future. If this were donc there could be
no charge of violation of contract, for a judge.
on accepting his position would know that he
was to be retired on reaching the age of
seventy-five.

BEVISED EDITION

SENATE

Penhaps the only clause the House will care to
discuss is the first. No explanation appears
upon the Bill, and therefore I will read the
clause. This is the addition to the present
ct:
(9) (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of
any other law, the Governor in Council may,
from time to time and as occasion requires,
order and direct, subject to such exceptions as
may be made, what shall be the rate of
exchange fixed for any currency in computing
the value for duty of goods imported into
Canada from any place or country the currency
of whieh is depreciated, and in case a sum in
Canadian currency less than the invoice value
of the goods in the currency of the place or
country of export, computed at the rate of
exchange so ordered, be paid for the goods, the
actual selling price of the goods to the importer
shall be regarded as less than the fair market
value of the goods when sold for home consumption, and the provisions of this section
shall apply and special or dumping duty shall
apply equal to the difference between the value
of the invoice computed at the current rate of
exchange or at the average current rate from
time to time fixed by order of the Governor in
Council, and the value of such invoice, coinputed at the rate of exchange for duty so
ordered as aforesaid, or may be less than such
difference as the Governor in Council may from
time to time order and directso forth.
-and
In substance it is in effect now and has
for
%been many years. It is an addition to, and
in some degree a restatement of, the power of
fixing value for duty purposes of goods imported from countries whose currencies are
depreciated in relation to our own. As honourable members are aware, unless this is
done the major effect of the application of the
tariff to such imports is entirely nullified; in
fa)ct in many cases it is more than nullified and
the result is really tihat there is a bonus on
importations as against the Canadian producer. These probleme have arisen owing to
,the disturbed state of world exchanges. They
have to be met, and, in part, they have been
met from time to time. So far as this section
is concerned, it is merely an adjustment to
meet the conditions that have more lately
'arisen.
The main part of the Bill consists of the customs tariff amendments as passed in the other
House. Relatively to the whole tariff the
amendments are not numerous, but were this
the House of Commons, consideration of these
amendments item by item would constitute
a formidable task.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: That part of the
section in relation to sales or consignments of
goods imported when importer and exporter
have joint ownership or operate under a
holding company is new, I believe.

are perfectly at liberty to discuss the details
of any measure for the benefit of the country
at large. I think quite often we should do
well to discuss certain measures, even if we
did not feel at liberty to alter details to any
great extent. I find as I travel around that
the public are paying a good deal of attention
to the debates in the Senate. Sometimes we
miss an opportunity of placing our views before the country, simply because of our reluctance to discuss matters which some person
thinks are not within our purview. It has
been the practice, of course, not to review
tariff bills unless they contained something
of particular interest that we felt ought to
be discussed.
It strikes me that the chief objection to
the Bill is that it is nearly all in one sentence
of fifty-five lines. With my limited education,
it is beyond me to follow intelligently the
predicates, adverbs and adjectives to find
out just what this long sentence implies. I
wish the gentlemen who draft our laws would
keep their sentences within such bounds that
the intellect of the ordinary person could
grasp the meaning of their language.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

MAY 15, 1933
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I may say
that in this long list of six pages everything
under the British Preferential Tariff is made
free, except a certain kind of woven fabric
not made in this country, but imported in
the web, belt pulleys, peroxides of hydrogen,
and electrie light and arc carbons.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Would that
be in accordance with the agreement made at
the Ottawa Conference?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think those
agreements were implemented earlier.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Some of them
were, I think.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: A certain class
of spectacles is also subject to duty under the
British Preferential Tariff. With those trifling
exceptions everything under that tariff is free.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: We have read
a good deal in the press and listened to several speeches on what may happen between
the United States and Canada in the way of
a trade agreement. Of course, we can take
with a grain of salt what we read and hear,
but the trend seems to be toward the reduction of trade restrictions. Is my right honourable friend at liberty to give us any
definite information, for example, as to the
probability of a trade treaty being made
between Canada and the United States before
the coming Economic Conference meets in
London? If so, what is likely to be in the
treaty?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Iwillgive the
answer which I know the right honourable
senator would give were our positions reversed-he a member of the Government and
I opposite-although I know I shall not be
able to give it with the same urbanity, nor
is it likely to meet with the same acceptance.
Whether or not anything of the character he
foreshadows can be effected before the Economic Conference meets will depend a great
deal on when it meets. I do not know that
any definite date has yet been fixed. I anticipate that it would be next to impossible to
have any such arrangement made in the meantime. As to what its character will be, if it
is made, I must be equally indefinite. I can
very confidently express the hope, however,
that if such a treaty matures it will surpass
in value and efficacy all similar efforts of
days gone by.

SPECIAL WAR REVENUE BILL
SECOND

READING

POSTPONED

On the Order for the second reading of Bill
95, an Act to amend the Special War Revenue
Act:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I wish this
Bill to stand. I have read very carefuldy the
explanation as given to me and as appearing
in the pages of the Bill, opposite the proposed
amendments. Some of it is incomprehensible,
and as it covers only half the Bill, I do not
intend to proceed further with the measure
until the information I have is supplemented
and made adequate for our purposes.
The Order stands.
INCOME WAR TAX BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 96, an Act to amend
the Income War Tax Act.
He said: This Bil in its relationship to this
House is in the same category as the measure
respecting customs; nevertheless I think I
should give at this stage the eipilanation to
whieh the House is entitled.
The first clause of the Bili amends the
schedule which establishes the incorne tax of
each person in Canada. I am sorry to say
the amendment is upward. Honourable members will have no trouble in ascertaining what
their income tax will be if they wil just refer
to their proper allocation in this schedule. As
will be seen from paragraph B, the five per
cent supertax on al incomes in excess of
$5,000 is retained. The tax on corporate
incemes is increased, being now twelve and
one-half per cent. The rate of tax applicable
to corporations and joint stock companies
which file returns consolidating their profits
and losses with those of thei-r subsidiaries
is thirteen and one-half per cent. I think
honourable members will readily see the reason
for this. Take the case of a group of companies, one of which controls or owns the
others. If all the companies in the group
were to furnish individual returns, those that
made profits would pay a tax, and those
that did not make profits would pay no tax,
but the lesses of the companies that did not
have to pay would not be deductible from the
profits of those that did have to pay; there-

516

SENATE

fore such a group of companies made composite returns, and the losses of the one
company were deducted from the profits of the
other. It is now provided that if such a course
as that is adopted the tax will be thirteen and
one-half per cent instead of twelve and onehalf per cent.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
have smaller profits then.

They may

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Those groups
within which there are companies making
losses will be able to deduct those losses from
their profits, by means of the composite
return; but they will have to pay a tax of
thirteen and one-half per cent.
Clause 2 of the Bill removes entirely the
old provision that a man was a householder
and became entitled to the exemption of $2,000
if he came within either of the two definitiens appearing opposite page 3 of the Bill.
A man might be a bachelor, but if be chose
to enjoy the luxury of a separate bouse be
came within the definition and got the benefit
of the $2,000 exemption. It was not felt that
such a man was entitled to this exemption
merely because he chose such a way of living;
so he is deprived of this privilege. A subsequent clause, which honourable members will
find on page 4 of the Bill, makes certain, however, that any person who, to repeat the
language of the second part of the definitionmaintains a self-contained domestic establishment and who actually supports therein one or
more individuals connected with him by blood
relationship, marriage or adoptionshall be entitled to the $2,000 exemption.
Section 3 of the Bill repeals the exemption
from income tax of military, naval or air force
pensions. Income received from such sources
is to be upon the same plane as any other income, and is taxable. Honourable member
will recall that this plan has been adopted as
a substitute for the original plan of making
one who received a 'Government salary and
a pension choose the one or the other.
Section 4 of the Bill reduces from $2,400 to
$2,000 the exemption for married men and
others who maintain establishments where
they support blood relations. In the case of
a single man or woman the exemption is reduced from $1,200 to $1,000. The allowance
for each child or dependent relative is reduced
from $500 to $400.
Section 5 reduces from $1,200 to $1,000 the
exemption of the husband and wife who have
each a separate income.
Hon. Mr. HORISEY: That $400 exemption
for dependents applies only, I suppose, where
they are mentally or physically dependent?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: It applies to
relatives who have to be supported, and, I
understand, although I do not see the explanation here, only to the extent of the support given, with a maximum of $400.
Section 6 is worthy of attention. It provides that the carrying charges on productive
property the income of which is exempt from
taxation shall be deducted from that exempted income. That is to say, where a company held by an individual has a block of
tax-exempt bonds and the management of the
company entails a certain amount of expenso,
a proportion of that expense shall be chargeable against the income from the tax-exempt
bonds; the whole amount shall not be charged
against taxable income.
,Section 7 enables the Minister to annul a
charge made by a company for salary, or the
like, where in his judgment it has been given
not for services rendered, but in order to
reduce the amount of taxable income.
Foreigners may own a Canadian company,
and in order to conceal taxable profits they
may pay themselves fantastic salaries and
thus dodge the taxation. This provision will
circumvent that subterfuge, to adopt the
phrase of the right honourable senator opposite.
Section 8 eliminates the $2,000 exemption
to which a company previously was entitled
before its income was taxable. This is a section te which perhaps some objection could
be taken.
The main objection to the
abolition has been that it gives an undue advantage to a partnership or an individual
competing with an incorporated company.
Then come the provisions as to the application of the five per cent tax on dividends
paid in Canada in a currency which is at a
premium in relation to Canadian currency.
This tax does net apply in respect of tax-free
Dominion bonds, nor to interest or dividends
received by the provinces or municipalities.
This section also imposes a five per cent tax
on dividends received by foreigners in Canadian currency fron Canadian properties or
investments, but is not applicable to income
received from the Dominion of Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Is that the
section to which Great Britain objected?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, and as
a consequence, I presume, of the roar that
was made, the bonds of the Dominion of
Canada are exempt. I hope I have made
myself clear.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY: Suppose the exchange
on American funds should be one or two per
cent, should we still have to pay five per cent?

MAY 15, 1933
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, according to the explanation given here.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY: Should we ba/ve the
option of taking payment at par?

517

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: There might
be room for debate upon that; there certainly
would be room for differenoe of opinion. At
ail events, the explanation I have given is correct, for it is the same as the one appearing
in the Bull:
Subsection 9 of section 9B ie to ensure that
the tax je borne by the person entitled to
receive the interest or dividende and not by the
person who bas to pay the interest or dividende.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Apparently
not. However, when we reach that happy
stage we sh-al feel so elated that we shall
flot care what tax is to be paid.
Thlere are further details. For instance,
the Minister is given power to determine
whether or flot a man who lives part of the

to Canadians. It would have been a very
simple matter to do this, it would have been
just to do so, and the Government would have
received a very much larger revenue than it
will under the present Bill. And we all know
that the Government needs all the revenue
it can get. I have never heard any sound
argument against my proposal, which I have
been pressing for a great many years.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This Bill pute
it into effect.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Not to the full
extent that I was hoping for. This goes only
'part of the way, in putting a tax of five per
cent on non-residents. I wanted an income
.tax to be applied, especially against our
neighbours to the south, to the same extent
as they tax us. If that were done, the Government would get twenty-five or thirty per
cent in some cases, instead of five per cent.
And that small taxation may have the
tendency to prevent the flow of capital into
this country. However, it is too late now to
press my contention. I am not going to ask
our leader to state any reason why the Government did not do as I suggested, although,
h repeat, I know that to do so would have
been only fair and would have brought to the
texchequer a much larger revenue than the
Ifive per cent will.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
like the five per cent, and I should like twentyfive per cent still less. But, in common with
my honourable friend, I should have preferred
to sec such a tax applicd only against the
countries that tax Canadians, and to the same
extent. I presume the reason for the lighter
tax is that we are still a debtor country which
bas to borrow money, while the United States
is net. The country needs no longer to
borrow abroad, and feels it can safely tax
income payable to people outside its borders.

remittance of the deductions to the ReceiverGeneral.
Section 13 provides for consolidated returns
of income of corporations.
Section 14 provides for returns to be made
by all debtors who are paying interest on any
fully registered bonds or debentures. The
information is required by the department so
that persons who receive such interest may
be more easily identified.
Section 15 provides for the identification of
holders of bearer bonds, by compelling depositors of coupons or warrants to sign ownership certificates. The object is to make it
possible to trace the real ownership. Even
cases of deposit of bonds and warrants in a
foreign country are provided for, and safeguards are erected to make sure that the
ultimate recipients of the interest are identified and taxed in respect of that income. I
am sure the honourable senator from Rigaud
(Hon. Lawrence Wilson) will be delighted
when he reads this section. I think it has
been thoroughly worked out and is likely to
prove highly troublesome to persons who have
been concealing the ownership of bearer bonds
in the past.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH Is it the intention to trace back the ownership during the
past fifteen years or so and prosecute the
persons who are found to have been evading
the payment of taxes on bonds?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The practice
bas always been to pursue the evader of income tax, and there is no reason why an
exception should be made with respect to the
holders of bearer bonds.
Then there are provisions for delivery of
these ownership certificates to the Minister,
for penalties in cases of failure to collect or
withhold, for failure to remit and for failure
to complete ownership certificates.
Section 17 provides for interest on increase
of the tax:
Interest on the increase of tax imposed by
sections one, eight and thirteen of this Act on
corporations for the fiscal period ending in
1932, shall commence to run from the thirtieth
day of April, 1933.
That interest is at the rate of six per cent.
The remaining four sections, numbers 18, 19,
20 and 21, have to do with the date at which
the various sections of the Act come into
effect. They become effective at varying dates
for appropriate reasons.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
senators, one of the difficulties about a new
Bill of this kind is that few of the people who
are called upon to pay income tax really un-

MAY 15, 1933
derstand what is required of them. The banks
find themselves in a particularly difficult
position, because as a matter of practice they
have to make out various certificates. And
sometimes they are not supplied with sufficient
forms. One banker told me that he had received only a dozen, and that that number
might be used up in one day if a few of his
customers happened to be cashing coupons.
I have often wondered whether it was necessary to have so many forms and technicalities
for the making of income tax returns. No doubt
it is essential, in order that all kinds of persons may be reached, that the Income Tax
Act should have many sections, but I have
sometimes thought that it should be reduced
to its essence for the benefit of the ordinary
taxpayer. Think of the position in which a
business man in Ontario finds himself. Even
if his business is small, he has to make out
federal income tax forms, with all their intricacies. I undertook the work in connection
with my own little business and finally had to
get a man to do it for me. Now the province
bas a business tax directed at accumulated
profits, I think, and the business man finds it
necessary to educate someone to understand
that. Furthermore, the municipalities impose
a tax. In other words, we have to pay three
taxes on the one income. That is bad enough,
but my criticism is not altogether against the
amount of the taxation. The feature I am
criticizing is the multiplicity of details and
procedure with which we have to become acquainted in order to arrive at the proper
amount of these taxes.
It has been suggested in the press that an
arrangement might be made by the federal,
provincial and municipal authorities for the
collection of income taxes by one set of
machinery and on the basis of one set of facts.
That would be a godsend to taxpayers if it
could be done, because the present method is
very annoying. Even the smallest concern
finds it is necessary nowadays to detail one
person to keep track of the different items of
taxation. I have only a few employees, and
I must depute perhaps the best man in my
office, an accountant, to spend weeks in discovering what taxes are payable. Such a
system is an imposition on taxpayers, and I
think it could be done away with if the different authorities made up their minds to have
a combined collection of taxes.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: A short time
ago I went into one of the leading banks in
Montreal and inquired, merely for the information, what I should have to do if I
deposited a cheque received from New York
for interest payable there on a Canadian bond.

The banker said, "You would have to sign
this yellow form certifying that you are the
owner of the bond." That was perfectly clear
and in keeping with our Income Tax Act.
Then I asked what the procedure would be
if I brought in a cheque from an American
firm for a dividend, and the reply was, "You
would have to sign this pink slip." I asked
if the five per cent was collectible on a dividend from the States, and was told that it
was not. I said, "I am sorry to differ with
you, for I am quite sure that it is." But as
the banker held a very strong view to the
contrary, I left him with it. It is my opinion
that the banks have not a clear conception
of the Act at all.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is a
conference going on now, I believe, between
officials of certain provincial governments and
this Government with a view to trying to
make some arrangement about the division of
taxation. I will not express an opinion as to
whether it is likely to succeed or not.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: For the purpose of
having a clear and concise statement on the
record, may I ask the right honourable gentleman to state the position with regard to
taxation of a non-resident holder of Canadian
bonds that are payable either in New York
or London?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He is not
liable to a tax unless his interest is payable
in Canadian currency.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think that
after our conversational discussion the House
would be perfectly warranted in not asking
that this Bill be considered in Committee of
the Whole, but I suggest that my right
honourable friend defer the third reading until
to-morrow.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Very good.

Hon. Mr. BELAND:

In what way?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Loss in

of $100,000 a year. The annual loss, as I
have said, is about $6,000,000. Se we are a
long way yet from the taxation stage. The
Bill establishes a rate of four cents a pound in
respect of newspapers in which the advertising is over fifty per cent of the entire contents
of the paper. The Post Office authorities
state that last year the loss on handling
newspapers through the post was somewhere
between five and six million dollars. I thought
it was between six and seven million dollars.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It would be
nearer threc or four million dollars--if it is
as much.

money. At ail events we had better do se
while the situation stands as it is. I want
te disabuse anybody's mind of the idea that
we are taxing newspapers. They are sacresanct.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I must ask
honourable members te suppose that I am net
a newspaper man, but am merely speaking
for some newspaper men. The reduction in
train service has compelled many of the larger
newspaper companies to send their newspapers
by motor truck, except the few that are sent
out of the country. I know of one case where,
on account of the change in train service, the
papers sent te a place which is only six miles
distant from the office are carried several miles
beyond their destination and have te be
brought back te it on a late train. Naturally
this reduces the number of subscribers in that
particular section. In other places buses are
being used instead of the mails. For instance,
the Toronto papers, the Mail and Empire, the
Globe, and the Star, are sent te eastern points
by bus. I am speaking of places on the highway with which I am familiar. Formerly, when
sent by mail. they were not delivered until two

livered before ten o'clock in the morning. This
is better for the subscribers, but it means a
graduai withdrawal of revenue from the Post
Office. Possibly the imposition of a higher
rate of postage may further decrease that
dwindling revenue.
I am glad my right honourable friend thinks
the newspapers of Canada are in a state of
wonderful prosperity.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do net
think se.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I venture te
tell him that to-day there are not five daily
newspapers in the Dominion that are not in
the red, some of them te a very large extent.
If there were some way by which we could
have communism, se that those newspapers
making a lot of money could help those that
are in the red, it would be a good thing for
the newspaper world.
I am not objecting te the imposition of
the higher postage; I am simply trying te
point out the reason why the postal revenue
bas dropped. As I say, perhaps this proposed
increace in postage rates may cause a further
drop in revenue. I believe we could save
$100,000 in one or two other directions that
wou1ld involve less hardship on those affected.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Honourable members,
I think the point taken by the right honourable gentleman from Eganville (Right Hon.
Mr. Graham) has a great deal of merit. The
majority of railway men in Canada and in
the United States agree that railway rates cannet be further increased without a decrease
in traflic. Such would appear te be the case
in regard te the postage rates for the carriage
of our daily papers. Every month we sec
an increasing use of trucks for the distribution of newspapers. From personal knowledge
I catn confirm what the right honourable gentieman bas said about the financial condition
of the daily newspapers of this country. Like
every other business, they are having trouble.
and perhaps they are net well prepared to
carry this additional charge. If I understand
correctly, the Post Office Department bas a
surplus, and under the circumstances it is not
quite clear te me why the postage rates on
newspapers should be increased. It does seei
te me that, if I am correct, we might well go
slow in putting any heavier burden on the
newspapers, particularly in view of the fact
that they are availing themselves more and
more of the competitive service offered by
motor vehiches.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I presume it
is done in a rough and ready way-but aiways
on the right side. I do not want to be understood as intîmating that my defence of the
increased rates is on the ground that great
wealth is being accumuiated by our newspapers. I know positiveiy that such is not
the case. But I think this reflection is
apropos. I have often feit that in the newspaper field, as distînguished from others, the
profit-making power is top often in inverse
proportion to the public service rendered. It
is a field where apparentiy the wicked can
flourish like the green bay tree, and where
those that stand Ioyaiiy by the vital and
fundamental interests of the State do not gct
anything like an adequate reward. I amn not
speaking from any partisan standpoint. If
the newspapers of this country were aIl of
the character of that with which my right

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: What is the
puirpose of the Bill?
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: It is a Bill to
incorporate a group of people as a loan and

Senate permit the Bill to be rcad a second

if Parliament is not prorogued this week. I
do not think any public interest will be injuriously aifected, because the Bill, if it is

Commons before it is finaiiy passed. The
applicants are just taking the chance that
there may be sufficient time to deai with the
Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I arn informed that the applicants have not paid the

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Parent) has the

House an undertaking that the fees will be

Hon. Mr. PARENT: I take the responsibility of stating that the attorney for the
promoters of the Bill has said that the money
is to be paid to-day.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
think the honourable gentleman could go
further than that, but it would hardly justify
us in giving the Bill second reading.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If assurance
is given to the House in the proper form
that the money has been paid, we can return
to this matter later.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes. I
have no objection to that at all; but it would
have to be the assurance of the honourable

INDIAN BILL
THIRD READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
third reading of Bill 21, an Act to amend the
Indian Act.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: May I ask my
right honourable friend whether he is sure
that the Indians whom the Government proposes to enfranchise are really Canadian
citizens? The reason for my question is that
a few years ago a gentleman appeared at a
meeting of the League of Nations at Geneva
and, through one of the members of the
League-it was Holland if I am not mistaken
-lodged a protest on behalf of certain Indians
whom he represented, stating that they were
not citizens of Canada, but allies of Canada
who had taken up residence in this country
under certain conditions. The matter was of
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

such importance that the late Sir Lomer
Gouin and I had a conference with the representative of the Indians, and I cabled to Canada for some assurance in regard to it. The
reply I received was very short, namely, that
there was no real foundation for the contention. As to the endeavour to enfranchise
these Indians, wiql the objection be raised in
some quarters that they are allies of Canada
and not Canadian citizens?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The remarks
of the right honourable senator refer to the
Six Nations Indians. They have advanced
the contention that they are a separate nation living within the borders of Canada under
the terme of a treaty made between their
sovereign authority and the sovereign authority of Canada. This contention was taken
to the courts, but did not meet with much
success. I fancy it is pretty apparent that
you cannot have one nation within another,
living on property which is subject to the
suzerainty of the other. The judgment of the
courts undoubtedly was sound, and I do not
think the League of Nations regarded the
contention very seriously. In the absence of
the honourable senator from De Lanaudière
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain) I do not like to speak
too authoritatively of the action of the
League of Nations, but I think I may say it
would take many Leagues of Nations to
make a separate nation of the Six Nations
Indians.
While on my feet I may add to what I
said yesterday regarding the position of the
Indian who owns land within the borders of
a reserve and who becomes enfranohised under
the statute. The question was raised whether
such a man could sell that land without
restraint--whether he could sell it to a white
man, and, if se, whether such white man
could then live on the land within the confines of the reserve. I expressed yesterday
the tentative view that this could be done;
that the enfranchised Indian would be one
hundred per cent a citizen of Canada, without
any abbreviation, and that he could buy and
sell the same as any other citizen of Canada.
That view is correct: he can sell to a white
man or te whomever he chooses. The property is absolutely his own.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Though I shall
not contest the statement of my right honourable friend, I confess that it surprises me
a little. I thought the reserves were maintained for the exclusive use and advantage
of the Indians, and that no Indian could seH
out to a white man. My right honourable
friend makes the distinction that when the
Indian who owns the property is enfranchised

MAY 16, 1933
hie is freed from the regulations that up to
that moment have prevented hirn fro-m disposing of the land.
Bearing on the very principle of this Bill,
there is a provision which I find it extremely
difficuit to reconef1e, and as ta the proper
application of whioh 1 arn very doubtful. It
is the taking by -the Governîment of aut'hority
to declare which Indians shahl be enfranchised,
even though Vhey have nlot sought enfranchisemnent. 1 asked the right honourable
gentleman whether he could indicate any
general po'licy which would govern the department or the Superintendent General, but lie
has not answered tihat question. So 1 arn
stili at a loss to knorw by wjiat rule an Ind.ian
in a reserve will be selected by the departmental agent for enfranchisement. Will the
individual Indian's qualification be decided
upon the ground of bis education, of his havinig progressed beyond the necessity for
tutelage, or of his having sbown in a general
way, in his life and behaviour, that lie is
qualified to become a full-fledged citizen of
Canada? It seenis ta me that considerable
difficulty will be experienced by the board
of three -arbitrators who-se duty it will be ta
draw a line between -those who are considered
eligible for enfranehisement and those who
are not. On that board the Indi-an band will
wilh have one representative. I have tried
to imagine what kinjd of plan could be evolved
for the exei'cise of the authority that this
Bill would give for the enifranchisement of
Indians, and I confess that I arn unable to
see bow the Government or the department
could lay down a rule that would be satisfactory to the Indians themselves.
These people are our wards, the descendants
of the original owners of the soil, and we have
taken very good care of them. Comparisons
are always odious, but there bas beýen a kind
of tradition tbroughout our country that we
have been perhaps more liberal than the
Republic to the south in the treatment of
Indians. However, perbaps I arn venturing
on dangerous ground here.
I shahl not oppose the third reading of the
Bill. I shall patiently wait to observe its
future effect, in the hope that we miay noV
have ta regret the step we are now taking.
My rigbt bonourable friend to my ef t
(Right Hon. Mr. Graham) rnentioned the
Six Nations Indians, who dlaim Vo be independent. When I was at Geneva I wrote
considerable correspondence with respect to
them. I remember that the principal reason
among the many reasons advanced by the
department to prove that these Indians rccognized themselves as subi ects of the King was

523

the fact that tbey were given the privilege of
voting in two general elections in the ciglities,
at poils esta-blished on their territory, and
seventy-five or eighty per cent of thcmn
registered their votes for the election of a
representative of that district to the Parliament of Canada. That, it seemed to me,
was a clear admission that they recognized
their status as citizens of Canada.
Hon. J. S. McLENNAN: Honourable
senators, there is another point that I tbink
ought ta be considered in connection with
this Bii. It seems to me that it would be
in conflict with public policy ta give an opportunity to white people to settle in the very
heart of an Indian reserve. The reserves bave
been establishcd for a good reason, and in my
opinion they should be so administered that
so long as their material prosperity is noV
interfered witb, the tribal unity will be preserved as much as possible. It is obvious that
if white people can purchase land in the centre
of a reserve and go Vo live there, the effect
will be deleterious ta the general policy of
this country in the treatment of our Indian
wards.
While on my feet, penhaps I may be
allowed to register the traditional. pro test
made in this Chamber towards the end of
each session. That protest is against the
practice of sending a great deal of hegishation
to us wben we bave not time Vo give it
full consideration. The practice has been
fohlowed so long as 1 have been in the Senate,
and I bave heard protests made by the
honourable leader on the other side ý(Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) and by predecessors of the
rigbt bonourable leader of the House (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen). But nothing further
bas ever been done towards baving ahi hegislation sent to us in sufficient time. However, I arn making tbis protcst now for fear
that othcrwise there migbt be a gap tbis
session in our usual procedure.
Hon, W. A. GRIESBACH: Honourable
members, I was able Vo fohlow the rîgbt honourable leader of tbe Government in bis
explanation of tbe legai effects of this Bill,
and I can see how one legal fact would lead
to another. If an Indian is made a one
hundred per cent citizen and is given tithe to
land in the middle of a reserve, hie becomes
the owner of that land and should have the
right to dispose of it. I am wondering
whetber sufficient thought was given to the
practical side when the right honourable
gentleman was instructed by the department
in the legal aspects of the case. I shouhd
hike Vo know wbether, as a matter of fact, an
Indian wba had been enfranchised was given

SENATE
a piece of land in the centre of a reserve and
later sold it to a white man who is now
living on it. And if that did happen, how is
the arrangement working out?
Having been brought up among Indians,
and possessing some knowledge concerning
reserves, I agree with what bas been said
by the honourable gentleman from Sydney
(Hon. Mr. MeLennan) that our traditional
Indian policy will bc affected if a white man
is allowed to live on a reserve, in a condition
of absolute freedom, surrounded by Indians
who are under tutelage. A white man has
the right to purchase whiskey and drink it
on his own premises, but the Indian Act forbids the taking of liquor into a reserve. It
is a very serious offence to give liquor to
an Indian.
I fear that such points as these have been
considered from the legalistic rather than
from the practical point of view. Perhaps it is
somewhat late to draw attention to them now,
but I think we shall hear more of this measure
later on. I do not sec how much harm could
be caused by allowing it to stand for a while,
for there is no emergency to be taken care of.
I am not prepared to agree with the statement
of the right honourable leader of the House
that 1e would despair of our Indian policy
if it did not result in the ultimate enfranchisement of these wards. These Indians will
probably be happier living under their own
communal system, and I do not think we
should disturb them. The bonourable leader
on the other side (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
pointed ont that the reputation of this country
for the treatment of its Indian wards stands
very high. We should be careful not to adopt
any policy that might impair this well deserved
reputation. As I say, I sec no great urgency
for the Bill, and I think no barm would result
if we deferred the third reading. The delay
would afford an opportunity to bring some
of the officials of the department before a
committee of this House to discuss the
practical working out of control and the best
means of protecting the Indians in the civilization with which we have surrounded them.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I had no
thougbt of being legalistic. I answered the
question put te me, not as to law, but as
to practice. The practice is to allow enfranchised Indians to sell their land to a white
man. That white man is in the same position
as any other purchaser: the land is his. Undoubtedly there have been cases where land
on an Indian reserve has been sold to a
white man and be has ehosen to live on his
property. My information is that in these
cases no important difficulties have arisen.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACI.

A white man on the reserve must obey the
law as to Indians, the same as a white man
living outside. For instance, the cannot take
liquor into the reserve. But tbe roads through
the reserve are public roads. The land so
alienated is no longer part of the reserve.
Objections 'have been raised-I remeaber
similar objections raised years ago-to what
has been described as the "ohecker-board"
poliey. Well, you anust either adopt the
checker-board policy or submit to the inevitable alternative-a substantial part of our
population remaining indefinitely the wards of
the State. I hope for better things for the
Indians. Most wards at some stage aspire
to emerge from thbeir condition of tutelage.
The best Indiians so aspire. There have been
Indians just as able as any white men. In
the affairs of the Dominion Indians have
played a part that may well earn them
immortal fame. That there have been some
very capable Indians may be taken as presumptive evidence that there will be others.
Many Indians are quite as competent te look
after themselves as are honourable members
of this House. Why should Indians be exempt
from fulfilling their contracts? Why should
they be 'allowed to incur debts without being
obliged to pay them? Why should they have
al1 the various privileges that are now
accorded them. merely because they are
wards? These privileges should appertain
only te those who cannot well get along without them. When wards can do without them
the privileges should be withdrauvn. Simultaneously with the withdrawal of the privileges, rights of citizenship should be conferred. By this Bill such rights are conferred
as soon as enfranchisement takes place.
I
should feel a sense of dismay if Parliament
were to adopt a course which meant that
we must look forward to the indefinite continuance of the Indian in tutelage; that be
should always be a ward of the Government
and be looked after like a child, and should
never be expected to grow to full citizenship.
I do net think that is the ambition of the
leading bands of Indians, and I sincerely
hope it is not the ambition of any substantial
part of tihe population of this country.
The only question is, what is the fair
method of deciding the qualifications of
Indians for enfranchisement.
The Bill provides that a board shall function for this purpose. An honourable senator opposite asked:
"What rule will the board follow in recommending Indians for enfranchisement?" The
rule is simple, clear and brief: the board will
be guided by the capacity of the Indian. If
it feels that an Indian is reasonably capable

MAY 16, 1933
of negotiating, working and competing with
the white man, it will enfranchise him. Education and industry will be factors in deciding
capacity. If, having considered these factors,
the board decides the Indian is reasonably
capable of making bis way without the benign
assistance of Government, hec will take his
place with the rest of us as a citizen of Canada.
Let it be Temembered that if the band's
representative on the board votes that an
Indian sbould remain a member of the band,
and if the other representative votes yea as
to bis fltness for enfranchisement, a judge will
be cal'led upon to give the decision. It seems
ta me th-at aIl proper precautions for the protection of the Indians are embodied in the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: Should we go so
far as to affect injuriously the Indians who
remain on the reserve, 'by introducing what
seems to me an unwholesome element? The
history of the m'aiority of persons who have
"gone native" in other countries would lead
anc to concludýe that a white man living Mn
an Indian reserve would flot be a good
influence.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGUEN: WPhite men
have te live around thc reserves aIl the time.
If they do flot be-have themsclves thcy are not
a bad influence any longer; Vhey are put in
j ail.
Hon. Mr. MrLEiNNAýN: But there are
stages en route to the j ail, and a white man
might have exercised an evil influence before
lie was put be-hind the bars.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With the Icave
of the Senate, I should like to, express this
view to my riglit honourable friend opposite
(Right Hon. Mr. Meiglien). The Senate od
Canada lias the right and duty to, review
proposed enactmcents and to suspend them for
furtifer consideration. I feel that il t.his Bill
had come before us earlier in the session wc
should 'have referred it 'to a committce. This
committce would have summoned before it
representatives of thc Departmcnt of Indian
Affairs, -and pci4xaps would have heard some
members of thc band Who 'have raîsed certain
aobjections to cnfranchiscment. The commitcc
would have reported -back to the House, and
thus we should have had the advantage of lieing fully scized of thc situation hefore passmng upon the measure. I -con-fess I amn not in
a position to, pass final judg-ment on tihe
advisability of enfranchisement, and yet I amn
moving in the direction of tihe enactment of
legisiation w.hi'h xnay flot wark for the good
of thc Indians. I think the right, honourable

525

gentleman will 'admit that the proposai to
enfranchise is a new de-parture. Up to the
present time the Indian's relcase from tutelage
has been soug.ht. by the Indian himsel-f. Now
wc say to thousands of Indian wards, "The
time 'has arrîved whcn you must walk freely
among us as citizens." I appreciate what thc
right honouraible gentleman has said about
the desire of gradually absorbing the Indians
into the 'coxmmunity. As fie says, many of
them. are very bright men. But I doubt tIe
wisdom of the somewhat arbitrary step now
proposed, and I Vihink thc Senate would not
be doing full justice to itself in saying "Amen"
to legisiation that in its application niit
be
fraught with danger.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Section 7 deals
witî enfranchisement. The other sections re~late tu uther matters.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Eniranchisement is the principal feature of tIc Bill.
,Its other features have been alread'y explained. I hope the House will not, think
I am obstinate in a-sking that this Bill be
passe 4 now. For the life of me I
cannýot sc any reason why (final consideration should be postponed. This ie the
third time tIe Bill 'lias Ïbeen beifore tIe
House. IV is not a hast-minute measure.
Every question -bas been fuhly answered, and
w-here there lias been a'ny doubt the anoweS
hais been verified. Why, then, should wc say
we tare not competent to decîde tIe main
feature of -the Bill-efranchisement? This i8
not VIe first suai Bill submitted ta this
House. A similar Bill was paa.sed in the
spring of 1920.
ýHon. Mr. GRIESBAOH: That was asked
for by the Indians.
Rigît Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: No; the Bill
was fathered by mys4if when I was Superintendent Gencral of Indian Aiffairs. It was
enac'ted in 1920, but was repeahcd in 1922
or 1923. TIfhe result is tihat as long as the
Indians cari get tihis special assistance from
the State only those of exceptional. ability
a.mong them are ready to do without i't. Thcy
have the land and the funds. They have the
Governdment officers at their elhow. TIhey have
the full protection of the haw: they can incur
debts, and any property thcy Rmay possess
cannot be app'lied in payment, Do honourablc m'emibers serioupsly say that, although
the Indian are entirely competent, so long as
trhey do noV apply for citizenship we miust
continue ta absolve them froin ail the obligations of citizenghip? Rit is flot sougît by
tis Bill ta take away fro-m the Indians what
they are entitled ta. They geit their share of

SENATE
the band's property-funds and land. Sureiy
this is logic, that nobody in this country is
enititled to be given special protection, special
assistance and special supervision, to be taken
by the hand and helped on tihe way, unless
owing to some natutral disability he is not
able to make his way alone. Surely no honouraible momber will say that if Indians are
incurably lazy and iack a spirit of citizenship,
no matter how thoroughly able they are to
make their own way, they are to be allowed
to remain in their present state of tutelage
for all time to come.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Under their
treaty rights they are entitled to continue as
tbey are.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, they are
not. In fact, the Indian Act provides that
if they have treaty rights, such rights shal
not be overridden by the statute; conserjuently the court will enforce the treaty. We
are taking away from the Indians nothing
that the treaty gives them. He who opposes
this Bill is in the position of saying that as
long as the Indian is prepared to submerge
his independence and enjoy the pleasant,
warm atmosphere of Government wardship,
the question of his competence for citizenship
does not matter at all-we are ready to continue this state of tutelage indefiitely. I feel
rather strongly because while Siperintendent
General of Indian Affairs I came in contact
with the problem year after year. If we are
prepared to hear all the Indians who would
like to be heard on this measure, we shall
unite this session with the next. Not only
are many of the Indians competent to take
care of themselves, but they are able to argue
interminably.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We have had
them before our special committees.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. I have
listened to them by the hour. But when an
Indian has the ability of mind and body to
look after himself, what argument, aside from
any treaty rights, can persuade honourable
members that we are still under obligation to
continue him in a state of tutelage?
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: I am informed that the fees have been paid on the
Bill presented before the Orders of the Day,
intituled "An Act to incorporate the Discount
and Loan Corporation of Canada."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: With the leave of
the Senate, I move that Rule 23f be suspended and that the Bill be now read a second
time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I confess that
I have not read the Bill and do not know
whether it contains the standard clauses that
generally appear in such Bills. However,
inasmuch as it is a private Bill, and in giving
it the second reading we are not bound
by any principle, we can leave it to the
tender mercies of the Committee on Banking
and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
SUSPENSION

OF RULE

Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: I now move that

MAY 16, 1933
JUDGES BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING NEGATIVED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
debate on the motion for the second reading
of Bill 84, an Act to amend the Judges Act.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Honourable members, I moved the adjournment of the debate
yesterday on the ground that I thought we
might improve the time by giving this matter
sorne further consideration. After having considered it further I have decided to support
the Bill. I think we are a little careless when
we say that a judge is appointed for life, because the instant lie takes his superannuation
lie ceases to be a judge, and as nearly all
judges take superannuation sooner or later,
their tern of office is really for onIy such
length of time as they choose to remain judges.
That is an entirely one-eided arrangement.
This BiH seeks to provide that a judge shall
retire upon pension at the age of seventy-five,
but that if lie has not served for fifteen years
he may continue until he has completed such
a period in office.
The question whether a man who has attained the age of sevenity-five years is fit for
the discharge of public duties will never be
settled by discussion. Experience has shown
that the degree of fitness depends upon the
person. In this House we have had many men
of seventy-five or eighty years of age, or even
older, who were as efficient as any of the
younger members. The same can be said of
judges on the Bench, and men elsewhere.
Generadiy speaking, however, a man of seventyfive has at all events reached the maximum of
his powers and may be said to be on the
decline.
The objection is raised that this legislation
will cost us $90,000 a year in pensions and in
the replacement of judges; but if it can be
said in a general way that the efficiency of
our judges is being increased thereby, the expenditure of $90,000 a year wB1 be a comparatively small item.
It was argued elsewhere that this legislation
would result in the wholsale
retirement of
judges and the wholesale appointment of
ethers. Such will not be the case. The judges
will arrive at the age of seventy-five years at
various dates, extending over the next four
or five years; consequently the appointment
of a great number of judges by one party is
not even in question.
I think the strength and vigeur of our
Bench will be improved by this legislation
and that some abuses will bé cured. The
honourable senator from Montarvilie (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) spoke yesterday of legislation that already existe which makes possible
the displacement of judges who are mentally

or physically unfi.t to peform their functions.
He omitted, however, to tell us in how many
cases action had been taken under it. I
venture to think the cases are very few. There
is a natural disinclination on the part of any
person to commence such proceedings. I have
never heard of such a ,thing having ever been
done, and I do not think it is likeiy to be
done; therefore I believe the existing provision is no cure for the situation.
For these reasons I think we should do well
to pass this Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I should not feel that I had fully
performed my duty if I permitted this Bill
to be defeated, or even carried, without saying
something in reply to the impressive argumente urged against it in this House. I say
this despite the very pertinent remarks of the
honourable senator from Edmonton (Hon.
Mr. Griesbach), who has touched on certain
phases of the case for the BiH, whidh I think
are powemful and whieh I hope to elaborate
somewhat this afternoon.
No oie could listen to the honourable
senator from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) and the honourable senator from North
York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) without
feeling that a most plausible and impressive
case could be made against the Bill, and that
it would be diffiult to present a stronger case
in its favour. i do not think any argument
advanced against the measure could be described as irrelevant or weak, in an argumentative sense, and I did not feel competent yesterday, without recourse to the statutes and the
history of the subject, to answer the assault
made upon the Bill. To-day I shall do the
best I can to meet it, convinced, as I am,
that on the whole the public interest will be
served by the legisiation and that no such
instances of incurable injustice as have been
referred to will follow in its train.
Let us devote our minds for a moment to
the actual terms of the measure. The Bill
has for its subject-matter judges of the
superior provincial courts of the Dominion.
Proceeding on the assumption that Parliament is not able to abbreviate the terni of
office of those judges save and except for
misconduct, or, by virtue of an Act of 1922,
for incompetency, the Bill provides that
judges who remain in office after they reach
the age of seventy-five, shall receive, not full
pay, but 66î per cent of full pay, which
is the same amount as they would receive
had they retired. That is the beginning
and the end of the measure, except for the
proviso that if a judge has not been on the
Bench for a period of fifteen years, even

SENATE
though be .may have reached the age of
seventy-five, he may continue in active service
until lie has completed that period.
I shall deal first with the proviso. Had it
not been for the proviso, there would have
been one instance of manifest injustice. Our
law says that a judge who has completed fifteen years of service is entitled to receive full
pension.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Hei may receive;
he is not entitled to receive.
Right Hon. Mr. MEJGHEN: He bas done
all that lie is called upon to do to entitle
him to retire upon full pension. Manifestly
it would be most unfair to a judge who had
ascended the Bencli on that understanding,
which is really a part of his patent, to deprive
him of the right to full pension by intervening before the fifteen years had expired.
This justifies the exception.
I now turn my attention to the main
clause of the Bill. It lias been argued in
this House, and very powerfully, that judicial
appointments are made for life; that they
have been so made in respect of the county
courts, the district courts, the superior courts
of our provinces and also the Rxchequer Court
and the Supreme Court; that the patent itSelf
makes the appointment for life, and that we
should not be justified in breaking the contract with the individual accepting sucb an
appointment. To use the language of the
honourable senator from North York (Hon.
Sir Allen Aylesworth), any governmental or
parliamentary policy departing from this
would b a breach of faith. It behooves us
to examine this contention very carefully.
I mention now the second argument,
namely, that this Bill should be defeated
because of its indirection, because it seeks in
a circuitous way to attain wbat the sponsors
of the Bill apparently have not the courage
to attempt to attain directly.
I shall deal first with the major contention,
as I take it, that the Bill involves a breacli
of faith in declaring to those members of the
Bench who have accepted from the Crown a
patent vesting in them for life that after they
reach the age of seventy-five, though they
may continue to sit, they are entitled to
receive only partial pay. One cannot deal
with tbis question satisfactorily until one
bas reviewed the history of the whole subject.
It is true that the appointments to the
superior courts are made for life, as, indeed,
were appointments to the county courts or
the Exchequer or Supreme courts. But the
differences are the'e. We make appointments
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

to the county court Bench by virtue of our
inherent powers as a sovereign State, and as
such we can change directly and without restraint the conditions of appointment and the
term during which the appointee shall enjoy
office. The argument of the honourable gentleman from North York is doubtless good, that
while we might have abbreviated the term
of office we did not do se, but appointed for
life. But many years ago we chose, in the
publie interest, to depart from that policy
to the extent of determining that an appointee
to the Bench must retire on fuml pension upon
reaching the age of seventy-five. As to the
superior courts of our provinces, our rigbts
being restrained by the British North America
Act, w'e are not able to fix the term of office,
as we are in the case of the county courts.
A still different law applies to the federal
courts. In that sphere our authority is conplete. W e can terminate the tenure of office
of judges of the federal courts, and can say
that they must retire at a certain time, whereas we cannot so act in respect of judges of
the superior courts of the provinces. If bonourable members will keep in mind that
simple and, I hope, plain statement of the law,
tie further review of the subject will be
clearer.
As intimated a moment ago, we proceeded
to act upon our authority with respect to
county court judges about 1912 or 1913. The
theory of the change in the law at that time
was that at seventy-five a judge had passed
the period of his greater usefulness, and that
he was being fairly treated if at that age be,
net choosing to retire voluntarily, was retired
by law upon a pension which in practically
every case was substantially more than be
had any right to expect at the time of his
appointment. What Parliament had in mind,
no doubt, was to maintain by some method
within its power the efficiency of the Bench.
and to secure the maximum good to the public
service with the minimum injustice to the individual. The honourable senator from North
York was not a member of either House at
that time, but many of us were members. I
cannot recall any very serious objection being
taken to that legislation. I do net say no protest was made, but I remember none. Undoubtedly the legislation was generally accepted as being for the public good.
The next step along the same line was a
much more important one. It was taken in
the year 1922, when the late Sir Lomer Gouin
was Minister of Justice. Sir Lomer Gouin
directed his efforts not towards the junior
courts, which had already been dealt with,

MAY
MAY
but toward's the two kinds of superior courts
-the superior provincial courts, and the
federal courts-with the resuit that legisiation was passed affecting both. I shalh mention the legisiation affecting the federal courts
first. It was provided that the terni of office
of a judge of the federal court should expire
when hie reached the age of seventy-five
years. That provision was within the power
of Parliament. The federal courts were in a
different position fromn the superior courts
of the provinces in that our powers in the
provincial sphere were abbreviated by the
British North America Act.
Hlon. Mr. KING: That applhied to judges
then on the Bench?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIOHEN: Yes. Their
terni of office was over at the age of seventyfive and they could no longer be judges. The
understanding embodied in the patent of appointment-if it rnay be described as an understanding-was interfered with exactly as
it had been interfered with ten years before
with respect to county court iudges. I helieve
that by a subsequent amendment these federal
judges, that is. judges of the Supreme Court
of Canada and of the Exohequer Court, were
given their full salary by way of pension.
Thus, while they were removed from the
Bench at the age of seventy-five, their remuneration was really not interfered with.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBTE!N: If the right hionourable gentleman will allow me to interrupt
him, I would point out that that was donc
in 1927. The legisiation of 1922 did not say
that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEI!GIEN: Possibly not.
1 shall corne to the 1922 legisiation in a
minute.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAN1D: The legislation
of 1927 referred exclusi'vely to the federal
courts.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Wfhat I amn
pointing out now is this, that the legislation
of 1927 interpreted the engagement with the
judges exactly as the legisiation of 1912 did.
The legislation of 1927, in common with that
of 1912, undoubtedly was founded on the assumaption that the judge on hie part also had
an engagement-an engagement with the
Crovn. that he would give his talents to the
State while they were sound and strong, and
that the provision for his retirement would ho
availed of by himself when he no longer possessed those talents ini their full strength of
maturity. The legislation of 1912 and of 1927
was made necessary because judges in both
fields had failed to live up to that understand-

16, lW3
529
529
16, 1933
ing which was implied at the tirne of their
appointaient, and as a consequence the public
service had suffered. The duty of the publie
representatives being to look after the public
service, they had to find the most equitable
wa.v possible of remedying the evii that had
resulted.
I will now proceed to deal with Parliament's
treatment of the intermediate judges, those
as to whom our powers were abbrevîated to
the largest extent, the judges of the superior
courts of our provinces. They were dealt with
in the legislation of 1922. 1 suggest that as
I review this legîslation honourable members
keep in mind its terms and the principles
underlying them, and ask themselves whether
any argument could possibly be urged against
this Bill which would not apply still more
powerfully against the 1922 amendment. Now,
what was that amendment? Parliament cannot terminate the tenure of office of a superior
court judge.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Except by impeachment.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: But it cannot 'be done by a statute. However, Parliament did flot sit back and reason that mnasmuch as it could not act direotly it shoulci
refuse to act indirectly. On the contrary,
Parliament reasoned that service to the publie
is the supreme consideration, and that it is
the duty of representatives of the people to
endeavour to ffind the best and most equitable
means of raising the standards of that service
to the highest possible degec, and of elimina-ting any injustice that might be caused by inefficient service. Parliament went about its
task and legislated machinery for the investigation, in certain oircumstanoes, of any of these
judges, by one or more judges of the Supreme
Court of Canada or of the Exchequer Court,
or even of the euperior courts themselves. The
main contention against the present measure is
that it does what was done by the legislation
of 1922. But that legislaition provided that
-the Governor in Couneil could order the
cessation of the salary of any judge against
whom an adverse report was made by a commission of inquiry and who failed to resign.
If he did resign, however, the Governor in
Coundil was empowered. to order that hie be
1)aid his pension.
That legislation of 1922 is still in force, and
it applies not only to the judges of the superior
courts, but also to the Supreme Court and
Exehequer Court judges. It is asked why we
are not satisfied with the present law. Well,
the fact is, as every honourable member know.9,
that there has neyer 'been a judge remnoved

58721--4

fromn office either by impeachment or as the
result of an investigation. The reasons for
this faot are more or less obvious. I do not
know o>f anything that would be more distasteful to a Minister of Justice than to, be
a party to, or indeed to initiate, proceedings
for inquiring into the mental competence of
a member of one of the high courts of this
country. Any citizen would find it exceedingly
unpleasant even to request such an inquiry,
and the iudges who would -have to determine
the issue, according to the statute of 1922,
would perhaps consider their task the most
dlisagreeable of al]. Indeed, I doubt that it
wouid be possible to get any judge in Canada
to accept such a responsibility, unless he were
compellable.
The non-operation cf the two existing
m.ethods for the removal of incompetent
jiidges ha brought us face to face with the
undesirable-1 ýalmost said startling-conditions of the present time. As members of the
Bar well know, we now have in mýost provinces, if not in ail, soýme judges who are of
such an age that ýthey can no longer give that
,concenýtrated, consistent and continuous attention, to the duties of their exalted office which

tirement of judges at the age of seventy-five.
The law does not permit us to bring about
such retirements by compulsion; so we must
carry out our intention in the most direct and
reasonable way that we can. Therefore we say
to a judge, "If you retire at seventy-five you

the publie interest vitally requirees. Natural
laws prevent them from doing so. The result
is that the interests- of the whole State, as
vvell as the rigb'ts of litigants, are serinýusly and
unjustly affected. I do flot want to be
understood as saying that there are flot exceptions among the judges who have passed the
age of e-eventy-five years. There always have
been and there alw.ays will be exceptions to
a ruIe. But I do not think it is possible to
answcr successfully .the reasoning of the Minister of Justice of 1927. He said that the only
way to meet the situation was to draw a line
of dernarkation at sucb a point that in the
great mai ority of cases it wouid be equitable
to those on either sidc of it, and not substantially unjust to anyone. H1e quoted the
opinion of the Chief Justice of the U'nited
States. Mr. Taft, wbich was expressed in convincing language and supported by powerful
reasonin, to the effect that the public would
be best served by the Bench if judges wcre
retired at the age of seventy-flve.
If that contention was sound in 1922 and in
1927, undoubtedly it is equafly sound to-day.
And ail that the present Bill seeks to do is to
have that mule applied to suiperior court
judges. There is no intention of applying the
mule by subterfuge,, by a back--stairs method.
On thie contrary, we are blazing our objective
before the world, and we are seeking to
achieve it in the only constitutional and legal
way pus9sible. We are making it clear to
everyone that we are trying to secure the re-

much more drastic and was open to objections
that 1 freely admit are applicable to this Bill.
1 trust we shahl not depamt from the precedent
which bas been set, and that this measure
will meet with the same bmoad and generally
libemal treatmnent that was accorded in the

Right Hon.

Mr. MEIGHEN.

will be just -as well off tinan-cially' as if you
remained on the Benýcb." Surely this measure
is less drastie than was the amendment of
1922, which provided thiat if on inquiry a
.iudge were found to be incompetent andl refu.sed to resign, the Governor in Council
could order that he be not paid a single
dollar more.
The Bill is not quite so forbidding or heartless as some honourable members have painted
it. I do flot doubt that it would work to the

financial disadvantage of a few j udges who
are stili mentally capable, though beyond three
score and fifteen years; but I am equally certain that it would resuit in the removal of

some judges whose memoval would be for
the public good.

These are the reasons on which I support
the mneasure. I earnestly hope that this bouse
will not depart from the unanimous position
it took with respect to legialation which was

Senate to thuse previous amendments to which

I have refermed.
Hon. Mr. DAN DIRAiND: I should like to,
put a question to the igbt honourable leader.
Is he sure that this legialation wil effeet the

purpose for wvhich it is intended, and which
is stated on the face of the Bill itself?

Would

the pumpose not be more effectively and justly
accomplished if a distinction were made bctwveen

present

judges

and those

appointed

hereaftem. so that t.hose now on the Bench
would continue to receix e their full salaries on
being retired because of baving meached the
age of seventy-five?

If the measume as it

stands were made applicable only to judges
appointed

in the future no injustice would

be done, for they would be aware of the terms
of their employment w'ben they were sworn
in. Is the rigbt bonourable gentleman sure
that ahl the judges affected by this Bill would

retire from tbe Bench if their remuneration
were reduced?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I arn no more
competent than any other bonourable member
to cume to a conclusion upou that puint. I

shoiîld tbink that some judges probably would

MAY 16, 1933
remain on the Bench even though paid no
more than if they retired. But in such cases
we should at least have the consolation that
the country was saving money.
The bonourable gentleman's second question is, Why should the Bill not be applicable only to judges *ho are appointed in~ the
future? In Parliament, when we wish to defeat a measure, we have the practioe of moving the six months' hoist, but if we adopted
the suggestion of my honourable friend the
practical resuit would be to, give fifteen or
twenty years' hoist to this Bill. I mean that
it would be approximately fifteen to twenty
years before the Bill could actually become
effective, for I should say the average judge
serves twenty years before reaching the age
of seventy-five.

SPECIAL WAR REVENUE BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 95, an Act to amend
the Special War Revenue Act.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: It is a long
Bill, with many important clauses. If the
Bouse desires to go into Committee, I am
prepared to give the fullest information on
each clause.
If no honourHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
able member bas any criticism. to offer to. any
part of the Bill, we on this aide of the Bouse
will not insist upon going into Committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Then perhaps
I should put on Hansard a general explanation of the measure, for the bene6it of hionourable senators.

Section 1 has regard only to the application
of the tax on note issues, and exempts those
of 'Canadian banks in circulation ini other
countries.
Section 3 repeals the present exemption
from tax of cheques and money orders under
85, with the exception of cheques issued to
producers of milk and cream.
Ri-ght Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
saine as it was before?

That is the

Right Hon. Mr. ýMEIGHEN: Yes.
Section 6 covers the taxation of transfers,
even though the interest transferred is a
participating interest in the operations or
profits of an association, company or corporation. As honourable members know, a company sometimes issues what are known as
profit warrants. Such instruments when
transferred are macle taxable hy the amendment contained in this section. "Share of
stock" is more f ully deflned, also for the purpose of catching these transfer taxes.
The amendments on page 4 are consequential on the participating interest amendment.
Section 8 extends the excise tax to express
money orders and travellers' cheques, even
though issued for less than 85.
Section 9 extends the tax to post office
money orders under $5.
By section 10 the tax on postal notes is
raised from 1 to 3 cents.
By section il the tax on matches is made
applicable to the very small package now
issued so frequently-sometmes freely.
Section 12 places a tax on cigarette papers
and paper tubes. This is important because
it produces something like fairness as respects
the cigarette manufacturer, and also because
it will produce a very substantial revenue.
Section 14 remits the tax on sugar, syrup
and substitutes theref or when imported by
refiners for further manufacture. Syrup and
syrup substitutes have to be taxed along with
sugar, or they would be substituted for the
sugar, to the injury of the refiners. and al-so
to the impairment of the revenue.
By section 16 "sale price" is defined. There
is nothing much more d'ifficult to, define for
the purposes of the sales tax.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: To define at
what point it begins?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHIEN: Yes, and in
such a way as to prevent evasion. A coinpany will f ormi another comrpany, and sell
to this company in su'ch a way that the prices
will be the "sale price," although it is away
below the price at which. the goods are sold
to actual customers. Very ¶ieavy evasions have
been effected by this method.

SENATE

Section 17 empowers the Minister to determine -the proper market value of raw furs. It
appears to he most difficuit to trace the value.
Section 20 gives authority te determine the
fair price in order to arrive at a dumping
duty on imported goods that are taxable on
an ad vailorem basis.
Section 21 provides that application for remission of -taxes must be made within fifteen
days.
Section 23 prescribes higher penalties for
tampering wi'th books and accounts in order
to evade excise and sales taxes. It also
rnakes the evader hable for twioe the amount,
of the evasion. For instance, a broker pays
lis transfer taxes by stamps. In the pa.st, if
he did not do so he was liable for the penalty
only, which was very mucli less than the
stainps lie should have affixed.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Retroactive?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. It would
hardly be fair to make it se.
By section 25 the Act is amended te increase the penalties for evasion.
By section 26 cosmeties and other toilet
preparations are specially taxed.
Section 27 provides for -a special tax on
sugar. Honourable members are aware of the
seheme and scale of taxation now applied in

respect of sugar.
This brings me te section 28, containing
schedule III. This is a sehedule of exemptions
£rom the six per cent sales tax. As amended,
the schedule is much less comiprehiensive; in

other words, many articles are omitted and
made subject te taxation.
Schedule IV appears on page 18. It is a
list of goods now subjeot te the three per cent
sales tax instead of the six per cent. Honourable members will see that it is a very
limitcd sehedule.
Schedule V appears at the bottom cf page
18. This is substituted for the old schedule V
and defines the list of goods still exempt fromn
the three per cent special excise tax on importations.
Schedules Il and II contain lists cf articles
on wýhiceh excise is imposed, and sections 26
and 27 cf the Bill add further goods te the
previously existing schiedules.
The general
result is that the list cf articles subjeot te
the six per cent is very mu-eh inereased, the
list cf articles subject to the thre'e per cent
is much reduced, and special excise taxes are
imposed on certain articles xvhieh appear in
the sehedules tliat I have just designated.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Can the righit
honourable gentlemnan give us a general outline cf the economy cf this Bill?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: The purpose
cf the Bill is te amalg-amate existing courts
tlîat have te do with pensions. These courts
are the Board of Pension Commissioners for
Canada-which has been in operation, I
should say, since 19ý14-acd what are known
as the Pension Tribuinals.

known as the Pension Appeal Court, remaîn.s
The amalganiated courts are te be called
the Canadian Pension Commission.
Thý
main objeets cf tlîe Bill are to define the
Commission's duties and functàons, simplify
procedure, make it more efficient, and conse-

quently save mcney.

The new Commission

is te be composed cf eighit members, any two
cf whom are to constitute a quorum cf the
court wherever they may be. Their decisions
are appealable to the -court above-the Hyndman court. The Bill also provides that the
deeisions of the Commission are net appealable at the instance cf the Government.
Thiis B3ill is the result cf the deliberations

MAY 16, 1933
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: How about
the veterans?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: The Associated Veterans, composed of representatives of
ail the veteran organizations, have approved
ol the Bill in its entirety.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: From a rapid
reading of the Bill I surmise that it relates
principally to matkers of procedure.
Rilht Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That, 1 think,
is one hundred per cent correct.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And it is somewhat technical in some of its ternis.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEIN: It is.
Hon. Mir. DA'NDURAND: I must, confess
that 1 ar n ot very competent to deal with
these matters. In the past I have relied upon
the honourable senator from Lauzon (Hon.
Mr. Béland), at one time head of the Department of Pensions and National Hea'lth, on
my right honourable friend to my ieft (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham), and occasionally upon
the inspiration of the honourable member from
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach). 1 rernember
on one occasion suggesting that the honourable gentleman frorn Edmonton should steer
through this Chamber a certain Government
measure dealing with military matters. 1 may
say that hie did so very happily and rnich
more brilliantiy than I could have donc it.
On section 1-definitions:
Hon. J. H. KING: This Bill, as I understand it, is the resuit of the labours of a
committee which met last August, and whose
findings have since been under discussion by
a committee of the flouse of Commons. I
believe that the soldier organizations are well
satisfled with it.
It is quite evident tha.t there was congestion
after the passing of the Act of 1930. That
might weli have been expected, because that
legislation opened the door to permit a large
number of cases, particularly those of men
who had cornmuted their pensions, to corne
before the Commission.
There is one statement which I think it is
only fair to make, namely, that in initiating
the -legislation of 1930 -the Government failed
greatly, inasmuch as it did flot utilize the
services of some five or six former officers
of the Appeal Board. If the Governrent
had retained those traîned officers it would
have had the benefit of their years of experience with applications for pensions and
with appeals. I think the Government treated

those gentlemen rather unfairly, not only in
failing to make use of their services, but also
in retiring thern without any regard for their
former contracts. It may be said that the
prcvious Government should have provided
for the retirernent of those men, because the
legislation of 1930 did away with the Federal
Appeal Board. I think it was in the minds
of ail interested that when the new legislation
came into effect and the Tribunals were established, those officers would become the backbone of the Tribunals. I arn satisfied that if
this expectation had been realized there would
flot have been so rnany cases carried to the
Appeal Court.
That is the only complaînt I have to make
mn tonnection with the measure we have
before us to-day. If it fohlows the recoinmendations of the cornmittee, I arn satisfied
with it.
1 inay say in passîng that a reading of the
report of last year's committee, or commission,
shows that there lias been much misunderstanding on the part of the public so far as the
De'partment of Pensions is con *cerned. It was
shown during the investigation, and 1 think it
is conýflrmed in the report, that the work of that
departirnent was propcrly carried on, and I
think honourable gentlemen will agree with
me that those engaged in the administration
of the PenLsion Act carne out with credit.
This, 'I think, is important. I know frorn personal experience that officiais in that department were at times unifairly criticized, and I
think the report of the corn*mittee will rernove
any stigma that rnay have resulted frorn
unjust criticism.
R.igh't Hon. GEO. P. GRAHAM: I wiish to
add just a word to supplement what lias been
said by my honourable friend. 1, with the
honourable senator from Lauzon (Hon. Mr.
Béland), -had the privilege of sitting in at the
proceedings of the comrnittee in 1930, as an
observer. It was apparent ab that tirne that
the various officiais engaged in the administration of the Pension Act were very uneasy,
and, as it tuarned out laiter, they lied reason
to be. Whiie I fully realize the difflculty of
answering the question, 1 should like to know
wbether we are approaehing anything like
finaiity in the matter of arndments to the
Penision Act. The veterans were represented
before the cornrittee, and, generally speaking, everyt.hing they asked for wa.s granted
themi and provided for in the Bill; in faet,
as an observer who could talk, bu.t not vote,
1 was of opinion tihat thie cornmittee alrnost
went, out of its way ta meet the views of the
veterans.

lion. Mr. GRIESBACH: It happened to be
on the eve of a general election. T-hat may
account for it.
Ilight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I think it was

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH-: No; before.
Right Hon. Mr. G'RAH-AM: Just, on t.he
eve, then. 1 know some gentlemen were very
eager to meet the views of the veterans. The
present Minister of Health wa. very active in
that comimittee, and my imnpression is that
everyùhing the veterans asked for wau granted.
lion. Mr. DANDURAND: We thouýght we
were stiil on the wave of prosperity.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAIIAM: But it turned
out to be -the undertow. As a matter of fact,
having Iistened to the discussion and observedi what was being done, I was not at ahi
surprised at -the great congestion wicýh ensued.
The -machinery was litera.lly composed of
wheels within wheels, and it would be impossible, I think, for any such combination as
was set up under the statute to work smoothly
and effectively. I could net see at that time
how it ceuld possibly keep up with the work.
As has been said, in order to please everybody-a purpose which was accomplished for
the momenit--old avenues were widened for
new dlaims, and new avenues were opened for
old dlaims that had been settled. The new
Act made it possible to reopen dlaims that had
been commuted. It is not surprising that it
did flot work. Any member of either Huse
who took ýany interest in the matter was irnmediately deluged with dlaims.
I arn prepared to support this Bill if the
veterans are satisfied with it. I hope tbey
will continue te be satisfied with it for sorne
time ýto ýcorne. We are ail desirous of meeting
just dlaims and doing a little more. The
financial burden is very he-avy, bowever, and
I think that if w-e could ex en approxunate
finality the veterans would be satisfled and the
people of Canada greably relie-ved. I arn nof
sure tbat we can do that just now, but we -can
aim in that direction.
As I have referred te some of the officiaIs,
I should like te say that I have always found
Colonel Thompson, the head of the Pension
Commission, most anxious te accede te any
reasonable request and te do bis utmost te
strajghten out; any difficuhty. True, Colonel
Tbompson bas always taken his position very
seriously. He believed it was bis duty te protect the treasury of Canada te the greatest
extent possible under the statute. I do not
think he ever went beyond that. I think it is
a mistake te criticize men of this character
who have done such good work, very often

under irksome conditions. We know that every
person who makes an application feels that
he is badly treated if whai he requests is not
granted. What I have said with refe-rence to
Colonel Thompson might be said also of the
members -of the old Appeal Board. I think
the Govern*ment would have done well to
retaini thern in sorne position in order to gain
the benefit of their experience.
I think it is flot necessary for me to say
much more. What I have said is based on
some littie experience, for once when my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. B6land) was
absent a few months I had charge of lis
department and tried to study what it was
doing. Sometimes I became more unpopular
than he ever was, for I was flot, so affable.
The department is a difficuit one to manage,
and the work of the men on these boards is
often unpleasant, especially when they are
called upon to deal with appeals made by
personal friends and find it necessary, in the
exercise of their duty towards the country,"
to reject them.
Honourable
Hon, W. A. GRIESBACH:
members, for many years 1 have been interested in pension legislation, and I have
had the opportunity of acquiring some
information with respect to it. This Bill
has corne down to us near the close of the
session and we are not able to controvert
the statement that it is satisfactory to the
ex-service men and alI concerned. After a
burried reading of the Bill I find that it does
flot meet the contention that I have been
making for the past twelve years. Befere the
committee that sat in 1930 1 staked my
reputation on the general proposition that the
machinery then existing was satisfactory so
far as it went, and that the only thing lacking was a better system for the preparation of
cases. I remember that on cross-examination
several witnesses referred to the disposition
of cases at the rate of fifteen to twenty a
day, but an examination of documents showed
that mere requests by ex-service men for pensions were called cases. I arn stili of the
opinion that until we provide for the proper
preparation of cases we have not met the
necessities of the situation at all.
In 1930 1 contended that the establishment
of courts and tribunals would mean merely
the creation of some good positions and the
expenditure of much money. My opinion was
that the Board of Pension Commissioners as
then constituted was an able body. As a
resuit of considerable experience I was able
to form a fairly accurate opinion of the
merits of cases, and, as a rule, when I was
satisfied that a case could be proved the
application for pension was granted, and

relinquish a $9,000 position to take one paying
38,000 or 37,000. Part of this subsection 3 is
nothing more than a pious hope unless there
is some rmeans of augrnenting the remuneration.
The idea has long prevailed among many
ex-service men that the Appeal Court is part
and parcel of the departmnental machinery and
subservient to the Minister of Pensions and
Health. It seerns to me that this would be a
suitable time to take steps to disabuse the
minds of ex-service men in this connection
and make it clear that the Appeal Court is
an independent tribunal and flot subject to
dictation by the Minister or any department
officiais. I suggest that the measure might
well contain provision for giving the Court
equal status with the Exehequer Court, and
for paying adequate salaries to the members.
The intention cleaxly is tihat the Court shall
have a high reputation, but the Bill stops
short of providing for an absolutely independent body and the payment of salaries large
enough to secure the services of men who
possess the high qualifications required.
As I said a few moments ago, the session is
now so far advanced that we have not time
to give this measure the thorough consideration it deserves. The only thing we can do
in the circumstances is to help it on its way,
in the hope that it may work out satisfactorily.
Hon. H. S. BELAND: Honourable members, I should like to, say a few words on this
subI oct of pensions. 1 regret very much that
on account of my physîcal condition this session it was not possible for me te attend the
sittings of the committee appointed to deal
with this important question, and for that
reason I arn not as conversant with the Bill
as otherwise I should have been.
As has been said, during the past few years
there Lave been -bhree courts dealing with
pension cases. One was the Pension Board,
of three members; tihe second was the Tribun-al, and the -third was the Federal Appeal
Board, composed of thTee members. The
Tribunal had a large number of members,
two or three of whom could form a quorum
and travel around to 'hear appeals fromn the
Court of any of the provinces of Canada, or a Pension Board. This machinery for dealing

It is difficult to imagine why any man would Pension Commission, is to consist of

applications that 1 considered not well
founded were generally rejected. 1 have come
into contact with many men who had entrusted the presentation of their cases to
advocates appointed to attend to such work,
but unfortunately possessing very little knowledge of the rules of evidence, and inefficient
generally. Some of those officiaIs are still
employed as advocates and being paid by the
Government. They are not professional. men
and are by no means qualified to do the
work expected of them. It is possible now
to identify such men fromn the records of
the tribunals and appeal courts, and I submit that the Government should dismies
them. In 1930 I opposed the spending of
money upon a bureaucracy and stressed the
importance of engaging qualified and conscientious pension advocates. Some able professional men have been engaged, and I know
of one in Edmonton. Re is a good lawyer,
and his record for cases prepared and presented is the highest in Canada. But so
long as it is true that somne applications of
disabled sold.iers are mishandled by incompetent advocates there will be dissatisfaction.
1 cannot stress too strongly the importance
of this matter. The Government has in its
own hands the power to remedy the situation,
and it should stop listening to the ad-vice of
stupid people who do not know wbat they are
talking about. I ask, not that only lawers
who are ex-soldiers be given these appointments, but rather that the best legal talent
in the community be secured for the prosecution of the cases. Soldiers tbemselves should
ask no more.
I approve of this measure to the extent that
it substitutes one court of first instance for
two courts. I opposed the appointment of
two courts in 10. The intention that some
of the members of this court shaîl travel about
and corne into contact with applicants is also
to the good.
I have noticed one rather curious feature of
the Bill. The new section 9 of the Act provides that the Pension Appeal Court shaîl be
continued, and subsection 3 says:
A person appointed a member of the Court
shall be a person who is or has been a judge
of a Superior Court or of a County or District

than eig.ht members, and in the discretion of
fdse Governor in Council the number may be
increased to twelve. 1 suppose the size of
the Commission will depend iargely upon the
number of applications te be dealt with. Two
members can. formn a quorum, and if eight
commissioners are appointed it will be possible in future ýto have four sittings of the
Commission in different parts of Canada at
the samne time. In making this possible the
1h11 is, I think, an improvement over existing
logisiation. The commissioners xviii corne into
contact wîth the applicants, medical men and
other xitnesses. The Pension Apýpoal Court
is f0 hlave three members, as did ifs predecessor. the Fede-rai Appeai Board. I have not
examincd the Bill vcry care-fuliy, but I presume that this Court xviii sit on]y in Ottawa.
Notwit-hstanding the necessity for economy
in this time of stress, the Bill provides for,
the appointmcnt of somne additionai important
officers. The ncw section 1OI, subsection 1,
on page 8 of the Bill, reads:
Notwithistanding

Service Act,' or an other statute. the Governor

And subsection 2 says:

The fonctions of the Reviewing Offcer are

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

H1e merely

or not. By no means will hie be a Czar.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Suppose two commis-

sionors sit at Halifax and f ake evidence in a
case. They sec and hear the 'applicant, the
physicians xvho have examined him, and probabiy some nmen who were associafed with him
as soldiers at the Front. Upon this evidence,
which is as nearly complote as if can ho made,
they render a decision favourable to the
man's application. But he is flot notified of
flic decision; it is referred te a Reviexving
Officci'. Where is hoe? Evidenfly bore in

other quorums, one sitting in Toronto, one in
W'%7innipog and the oflior in Vancouver?
For
the Commission may be divided into four

Whaf do honourable sonafors think of the

partment. At the time eeveral othor mon
wore appointed to exorcise isimnilar funcetions.
It is impossible f'or a commission dealing with
pension applications to satisfy everybody. But
-members of the Federal Appeal Board gave
very .satisfactory service, and 1 think it iis
regrettable that they were not appointed to
the new Apypeal Board thon set up. They
wore absolutely ignored, thougli they had been
appointed members of the oki Board for a
certain~ termi and at a certain salary.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And had been
sitting for a nudmber of years.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Yes; and, as I say,
they h'ad given entire satisfaction . Undo.ubtedly they were -open to criticismn by
applicants who had been reiused pensions, for
the simple reason that these disappointed mon
were un-able to conceive it possible that their
applications could bo rojected.
My right honourable frieind who sits on my
lef t (Right Hon. Mr. Gra.hamn) has roferred
to the Chairman of the Board of Pension
Comnmissioner.s for Canada, Colonel Thompson. 1 snay say that when 1 was at the
head of the department I disagreed with some
of the decisions of the Board, and discussed
with the commissioners their reasons for rejecting the applications. On these occasions
I always found the Chairman of the Board
albsodlutely imnpartial. Ho may have made
mistakes: I do flot know of any judge who
does not, sometimos make wrong decisions.
During the years that I was in charge of the
departsnent Colonel Thompson was not
popular aimong the returnod mon, 'but I readily
endorse the remarks of my right honourable
friend in commendation of this very capable
ýofficer.
Let us hope -that the now machinery to ho
set up un-der this Bill will work to the satis£action of everybody concernod. Let us hope
also that the GoveTnor in Council wiIl not fix
the salary of the Reviewing Officer at too
high a figure.
Right Hon, Mr. MEIGHEN: 1 think the
honourable senator is inolined to exaggerato
the position and power of the Reviewing
Officer. That oflicer is not the final auithority.
He is in the position of the counsel of a company who advises on questions of appeal.
Somebody has to do that. The Reviewing
Oflicer, it is true, has flot had the advantage
of being present at the hearing; nor will
counsel usually have had that advantage.
He reviews the evidence, and his duty is to
see if sanie mistake was made, as to the facts
or the law, which would ho good ground for

537

an appeal. I cannoît see that his duties go
further. I do not know why the salary is flot
fixed, but apparently bwelve members of the
committee thought it better to leave this to
the discretion of the Governor in Council.
The honourable senator complains of the
non-retention of certain members of tlie Appeal
Board. I confess I cannot make any statement, because I do flot know anything about
the matter. I asc hi.m to keep in mind that
thtis step in administration was taken before
the last glad cirole in the evolution of this
Government of perfection was negotiated: it
was before I became a member of the Government. I can only assume that the reasons
were good.
Right Hon. MT. GRAHAM: A weird assumption.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: I forgot to mention
what I 'believe to be a very important point
in the solection of mombers of the Appeal
Board. At the present time we have -an Appeal
Board com-posed of three membors, Judge
Hyndm-an, Colonel Sherwood and Colonel
LaF.leche.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: He is no longer a
member.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: I think tihere is a
vacancy.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: I. arn very much impressed with the importance of having a medical man on the Appeal Board. Every application for a pension involves medical questions.
It seems to me absolutely indispensable that
on such a board there should ho a medical
man with as high a standing in bis profession
as is required of the legal men in their profession.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Or the Reviewing
Officer.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: I suppose the Reviewing Officer should ho a medical man also.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: While we frequently disciiss the question of appeals from
pension awards, nothing is ever said of reviewing pensions awarded in years gone by. Under
the Act these pensions can ho reviewed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEJOHEN: They are.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not doubt
that they are. There is, I think, some
machinery by which the mombers of the
Board can supervise the working of the Act
and review pensions from time to time. If,
for instance, fraud is brought to their notice
they must act.

SENATE

538

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: That is right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do net know
whether in the other House statemeots of
the activities of the Commission in this respect are tabied periodically. 1 have neyer
seen such a statement tabled in this Houseprobabiy because no honourable member lias
ever asked for it. I think either during the
remaining weeks of this session, or somae time
next session, we miglit well explore this field
and ascertain what control has been exercised
by the Board. There is always an impression
aýbroad 'that some of the pensions included
in the annual vote of S55,000,000 should be
reviewed and perhaps discontinued.
My honourable friend from Edmonton (Hlon.
Mr. Griesbach) has referred to something
that has often passed through my mind. H1e
said the 1930 pension legisiation, which my
right honourable friend te my left (Righit
Hon. Mr. Graham) considered liberal, was
enacted on the eve of an election. Weil, we
know what took place in the United States
after the War of Secession. It is beyond
contradiction that many millions of dollars
in pensions are still paid out every year to
Civil War veterans. I would not indiet a
Government for bringing in, on the eve of an
election, legisiation which would please a few
hundred thousand men, because I know that
gencrally it does flot take the initiative in
the matter. There are 245 members of the
other House who are feeling their way towards
re-election. They ask for the appointment of
a pensions committee. It is in this committee
that we sec such a sentiment of liberality
engendered. In turn the committee sways the
House of Commons. Now, I feel that one
safeguard at ail event, could be provided by
the Senate. We are here for life.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: We cannot
tell.
It is true. I
Hon. Mr. DANDURAN2'D:
have discussed the subjeet with the powcrs
that be and have been. I have suggested
thýat we on both sides of this Huse might
well declare that during the iast two sessions
of Parliament the other House should flot
review pensions for the purpose of increasing
them or opening wider the door; that if anything is to be donc in this regard it should
be donc during the first two sessions. It
seems to me that on this body fails the duty
of protecting the trcasury agaînst these
attemptcd raid-s.
0f course, the

second part is the rating of the disability,
the determination of exactly what percentage
of the disability was contractcd during service. That question is practically alwayo
under revision. A man is required to present
himself periodically for examination in order
that it may be determined whether hýis disability has grown worse or better. We have,
as evcryonc knows, a systema of hospitalization for the treatment of curable disabilities.
On the other hand, with the aging of the

tion. The phase to which my honourable
fricnd should address himself is the review
of entitiement. I am not prepared to say
how much reviewing of entitiement there is.
We read six months or a year ago scare headlines te, the effeet that there were grave
scandais in connection with the administration of pensions. If there was anything of
that kind it was of minor importance, and I
am prepared to say that it occurred flot in
connection with the rateability, but through
false evidience in relation to proof of entitiement. I fancy that the question of entitiement could be reviewed if it were alleged in
a particular case that a man's entitiement was
false. Men are constantly complaining that
their disability is niot rated high enoughmany such cases ýcome to me-and one hears
that a man who was ratcd at thirty per cent
is now rated at twenty-five per cent, and
that some have been practicaliy rated out of
existence.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have here
certain amendments which I have handcd to
the Clerk. The first amendmnent is by way
of addition to clause 5. 'It reads:
(4) Exccpt as herein otherwise expressly
provided, for the purpose of exercising and
perforining the powers, authorities and funetions vested in the CommissionThat is the new Pension Commission.

other amend¶nents, is consequential.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: The main purpose of
these amendments, I surmise, is to make tihe
sections clearer.

Resolved that a message be sent to the Senate
to acquaint Their loours that this House
disagrees with their anendmxent to Bill 71, an

that the deletion of subsection 3 of section 3 of

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: To-morrow.
I may intimate to the House that I intend to

to subsection 2, which immediately precedes
the subsection deleted by the Senate. If that

inove that we do not insist on the deletion of
subsection 3. I am confident that the proviso
at the end of subsection 2 will meet the objection whieh the honourable gentleman opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) made to subsection 3 at the last sitting-an objection that
I thought was perfectly valid.

MAY 17, 1933
Hon. H. S. BELAND: Honourable rnembers, when 1 made a few remarks on this Bill
yesterday I particularly rnentioned my opinion
that one member of the Pension Appeal Court,
as created by this Bill, should be a medical
man. I do flot want to labour the point at
.91l, or to enlarge upon my previous rernarks.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Does this Bill
deal with the Appeal Court?
Hlon. Mr. BELAND: It deals with the old
Board of Pension Commissioners, which is to
be replaced by the Canadian Pension Commission. It also provides for discontinuing
the Trilbunals, and continuing an appeal board,
which in future is to be called the Pension
Appeal Court.
*Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But it does
not provide for a new appeal court.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: No.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Apparently
there is a vacaucy on this Appeal Court.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Yes. There ýha.ppens
to be a va.cancy on the Appeal Court. I
thiuk the tirne is propitious for bringing in an
arnendrnent providing that at lieast one member of the Court sh-ah be an experienced mcdital man. I hope the right honourable leader
will accept this suggestion, which is a very
simiple one, and in f orm 1.5 smilar to the
provision that persons appointed to the Court
shail have been judges or members of the
Bar with at least ten years' experience. I helieve that the Court would 'funiction more
effectively and with greater satisfaction to
everyone concerned if one of its members
were a niedical man. The amendment which
I propose to the section dealing with the
Appeal Court reads as follows:
and one rnember of the Court shail be an
experienced medioal graduate.
It would take only a f ew minutes for the
House to go back into Coxmmittee of the
Whole and insert this amen(Lment. *My suggestion is made not with any desire to em1ba'rrass the Government or to delay the work
of the session, but because I think it is
absolutely essential that a niedical man should
sit on the Appeal Court. The awarding of
pensions, except in cases where the soldier was
killed at the Front, is almost exclusivcly determincd by mediical evidence, yet at present
there is no medical mnan on the Appeal Court,
Hon. *Mr. GORDON: Is the honourable
gentleman not mistaken in that? I think one
of the members of the Pension Board is a
docto.r.
Hon, W. A. GRIFSBACH: But the discussion is about the Appeal Court. To a certain

541

extent 1 arn in sympatby with the amendmient, but it must be remembered that the
work of the Appeal Court is the h'earing of
appeals, whioh involves the consideration of
evidence and records to determine whether
the court below bas erred. In other words,
the duties of the Appeal Court are alanost
entirely of a legal nature, and it is of the
utmost importance that decisions should be
sound Iegal'-ly. It is better that the law ghould
be certain than that it should be just, as
Lord Justice Coke said two hundrcd years
ago. The decisions rendered in these pension
cases should be uniform throughout the length
and breadùh of Canada, as they were not
un-der the Tribunal system. The Government
might do well to consider what bas been suggested 'by the honourable gentleman froin
Lauzon (Hon. Mr. Béland). I do not think
that in this matter the bands cf the Government should be tied. When the appointment of the Tribunals was provided for I
was of opinion that the membership should
consist equaily of medical a.nd legal men, but
the Government d-id not agree with this.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Is 'my honourable
friend referring to the original Appeal Board?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACII: I amn speaking
now t-o the amendment which the honourable
gentleman bas moved, to the effect that one
member of the Appeal Court shaîl be a medical man. I was strongly of the opinion that
the legal and medical professions should have
been equally represented on the Tribunals,
so that the cases would be heard by a lawycr
and a doctor, the doctor to weigh the medical
evidence and the lawyer to, deal with points
of law. I ame prepared now to say that there
should be a medical man on the new Pension
Commission. This wifi be a court of first
instance andl will determine the question of
entitlement on medi-cal testimony. On the
other hand, the Appeail Court deals largely,
if not wholay, with questions of law and reviews the evidence given in the court of firet
instance. I think this discussion might well
be brought to the attention of the Minister
of Pensions, but, as I do not think the Govern.ment should be bound, 1 arn not prepared
fo support the amendment proposed by the
J.onourable senator from Lauzon (Hon. Mr.
Béland).
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I concur in
the remarks of my honourable friend from
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) as to the
judicial. practice. I do not like the proposal
that certain professions shaîl be represcntcd
on boards to be appointed by the Governor
in Council. When it is clearly the intention
of Parhiament to attach a distinctly judicial

542

SENATE

character to the work of a board the legislation constituting the board provides that
the chairman must be an experienced judge.
The statutes constituting the Railway Commission and the Pension Board contain this
provision, and a similar provision is incorporated in the Railway Bill which recently
passed this House. But I do not think it is
good practice to go further and say that
a certain class or profession shall be given
representation in the Appeal Court. It would
seem to me that, other things being equal, a
medioal man should be one of the members
of the Court. I think I am safe in assuring
tihe honourable senator that the Government
will very carefully consider his suggestion and
discuss it with the present chairman, Judge
Hyndman. I have no doubt that if he agrees
with the suggestion a medical man will be
selected -as one of the members of the Court.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Under the circumstances what the right honourable leader of
the House has said amounts almost to an
undertaking on his part that a medical man
shall be appointed to replace Colonel LaFleche.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is not an
undertaking.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: I take it to be almost
an undertaking. Subsection 3 of section 9
provides that the Governor in Council must
appoint as a member of the Court "a person
who either has been a judge of a Superior
Court or of a County or District Court of
any of the provinces of Canada, or a barrister
or advocate of at least ten years' standing
at the bar of any of the said provinces." I
think every honourable member will agree
with me that consideration of a pension
application involves medical rather than legal
questions.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: But there is no provision here that one of the members of the
Appeal Court shall be a medical man. As a
matter of fact, the three original members
of the Appeal Board were legal men.
I do not
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
think Colonel LaFleche is a lýawyer.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Certainly there was
no medical man on the old Appeal Board. I
believe there has always been a medical man
on the Board of Pension Commissioners, and
it seems to me it would be a grave mistake
not to appoint a doctor to the new Appeal
Court. However, under the circumstances, I
do not press the amendment.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

CANADA-FRANCE TRADE AGREEMENT
BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN moved the
second reading of Bill 107, an Act respecting
a certain Trade Agreement between Canada
and France.
He said: Honourable senators, in a sense
this is a taxation measure; nevertheless it is
in much greater degree a very important
article of policy, and the House is entitled
to an explanation of the agreement which it
is asked to ratify.
The Bill is very brief, but the agreement
attached to it is a lengthy document. The
Bill merely ratifies the agreement, and gives
the Governor in Council power to take such
other steps as may be appropriate to give
effect to it.
Our first trade arrangement with France
was made about forty years ago. In 1892
France adopted the protective tariff system,
based on a report made by a distinguished
French economist. Thereafter Canada sought
closer trade relations with France, and, very
largely through the efforts of Sir Charles
Tupper, a trade agreement was negotiated in
1893. This agreement constituted the basis
of our trade relations with France until early
in the present century, when the Government
of Sir Wilfrid Laurier made a very definite
effort to secure a more favourable arrangement. The French public had massed itself
behind the protective principle and very little
success was achieved. In fact the French
Senate rejected the tentative arrangement that
had been made. About 1908 the Canadian
Government entered into fresh negotiations
with the French Government, but they were
not ceoncluded until 1910; then a treaty was
ratified, subject to a certain proviso.
The post-war conditions convinced France
that she should raise ber tariff barriers still
higher, and as a result the treaty of 1910 became less and less beneficial to Canada. Finally, in 1920, it was abandoned, and a modus
vivendi was entered into pending the negotiation of another treaty.
In 1922 the Government of Mr. Ring made
a new arrangement with France. This treaty

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am obliged

Up to tlat time it was the practice for our

MAY 17, 1933
representatives to conduct their negotiations
with foreign countries thTough the British Ainbassador, and lie joined them in signing the
resultant treaty.
By this 1922 treaty we granted France specifie, fixed rates of duty, substantially below
the Canadian intermediate tariff, on thirtytwo important items. Ninety-one articles
were granted the Canadian intermediate tariff
Iess ten per cent, and three articles were
granted the Canadian intermediate tariff lese
fifteen per cent. These were the concessions
made by Canada to France. The important
feature is that thirty-two articles were admitted at rates which could flot be altered.
The others could be altered only by the raising
of the intermediate tariff of Canada. We also
granted France the benefit of the favourednation clause.
In ber concessions to Canada, France admitted one hundred and forty-one articles
under the French minimum tariff. Unfortunately, the preponderance of those articles
eonsisted of drugs and various indescribable
commodities, with unpronounceable names,
which, even to this day, have not been made
in this country. The articles enjoying the
French minimum tariff were really negligible.
They amounted to nothing. We did, however,
gain certain concessions in respect of other
articles, under the maximum tariff, and France
granted us the benefit of the favourcd-nation
clause.
Sucli was the treaty of 1922. 1 ask honourable gentlemen to remember that under the
terms of that treaty, while we had certain
fixed rates for the admission into Canada of
thirty-two French articles of considerable importance, the French Government was able to
raise at will the duties against Canada on al
articles by the simple process of increasing
in the one case the Frenchi minimum tariff,
which was of Iittle importance, or in the other
the intermediate tariff, which was of very
great importance. After that, in consequence
of French policy as it took effeet from year
to year, we found a number of articles for
which we desired admission into France barred
by higher and ever higher customis duties.
Our wheat, which at first had paid a duty of
seventeen and one-haîf cents a bushel,' had
finally, after seven or eight separate increases,
to pay a duty of $1.70. As if this were not
enough, France granted concessions to Yugoslavia and Roumania by giving them quotas
up Vo fifty per cent of the amount of French
importation, and in 1923 made an engagement
witih Germany under which that country received concessions in respect of the very
articles for which we were seeking entry into

France. As honourable members will realize,
the German competition was a very serious
factor indeed. The consequence was a progressive dilution of that treaty.
Efforts to improve the situation proved
abortive, and finally, about the middle of the
year 1931, notice of denunciation of the treaty
was sent VoFrance, the denunciation to take
effeet on the l6th of June, 1932.
The present treaty is the result of advances
made by the Government of Canada with
a view to negotiating some better basis of
trade with that great republic. These negotiations were carried on by the present Secretary
of State, who last October went over to
Europe to attend the Geneva Convention and
at the same time to seek some sort of arrangement with France. The treaty, provided it is
adopted by Parliament, takes effect as of the
l2th of May this year, and remains in effeet
for one year. It is subjeet to termination on
three months' notice. That is to say, if
notice is given by either party on or before
tihe l2th of February next, the treaty will
terminate on the l2th of May, 19J34. If
notice is not given, the treaty will remain in
force, and thereafter will be terminable on
t'hree mon-ths' notice.
Having regard first to the concessions made
ýto France by Canada under the ternis of this
treaty, I may say that seventy-seven articles
appearing in 6chedule C are adinitted to Canada under our intermediate tariff less ten per
cent, and fifteen under our intermediate tariff
less a specified discount which in each caue
txceeds ten per cent. In addition ta Vhs,
seven articles are admitted Vo Canada under
the British preiferential rate, the lowest rate
granted.
As respects the seven articles enjoying Vhe
British preferentiaa rate, the reaty carnes iiato
effect on proclamation. The reason for this
is Vhat under the tenus of the Ottawa agreements of last year Canada was restricted in
grantinig the British preferential. rate. Canada
therefore 'a.ked the approval of the British
Government in the cases in question. I may
Bay that the articles inrvcolved are largely books
in the Frenchi language, cinematograpli and
phonograph records in the French language,
certain religious tracts, aid the like. IV has
been intixnated by the British Government
that it will not object to these concessions
provided they take offiiaI and final form
before thsa particular phase of the treaty is
called into effect. This is the reason for the
suspension o<f the clause applicable Vo these
items.
On the other hand, France grants to Canada the admission under the F-ren<, minimumn

MAY 17, 1933
I do not. intend to examine into the
schedules before us. It is always somewhat
difficuit to foresee the effeet of such a couvention as this. The tTeaty is a provisional
one, and it may be that even twelve months
from now it ivili stili be difficuit to determine
to what extent the two countries have benefited. But, notwithstanding its restrictions, it
is welcome, for it renews contact with France.
I arn sure that it will increase-I hope Iargely
-the flow of goods from Canada to France.
T1he right honourable leader has mentioned
products of the sea and the farm, like fish
and apples, for which larger markets might
be found in France; and in some parts of
Canada we are in need of many things produced in France. Even under the general
tarit! there was a movement of goods between
the two countries. I need not spend much
turne on the history of our conventions with
France, but perhaps I may make a brief reference to the subject. In 1907 Hon. Mr. Fielding and Hon. NIT. Brodeur spent some three
or four months in that country and signed a
treaty, which we adopted in the session of
1908, I think. It was passed by the Chamber
of Deputies in Paris, but was held up for a
time in the French Senate, and ratification
could not be secured until we had agreed to
some slight amendment conýcerning our Canadian cattie.
In 1891, as my right honourable friend bas
said, there was in France a cunsiderable movement, headed by Jules Méline, who afterwards became Prime Minister, for the increasing of tariffs on agricultural products. Since
that time France bas held to the principle of
protection of agriculture, and consequently,
with but a few exceptions, it bas been difficult
f or Canadian farmers to enter the French
market.
I think we stand to gain by this treaty, anud
I weleome it. I hope it will be coatinued and
improved, but, as I have said, it will be some
time belore we shall be able to determine its
actual resulte.
Right Hon. GEO. P. GRAHAM: Honourable members, I have absolute faith in the
ability and honesty of the Secretary of State,
and I amn glad to know thcat the task of
executing this treaty was plaeed in hisi charge.
It is fortunate that he waa not debarred
because of hie age f romn accornplishing tihis

exactly a young man, lie cannot be called old.

effects of the treatry migbt be ininimized. by
the same mnethod thaýt hae been used in the
past, the changing of minimum and interunediate tariffs; but neither country can do
much along that line in t3welve monthe. it
is to be hoped tihat when a new trea'ty is
ei-gned it will be possible to make some
arrangement for the discontinauation of this
practice, which bas the effect of abrogating
the terrms that are intended to benefit us.
I want to a-sk a question of my right
honourable friend. The President of tihe
United States has urged a truce in tariffs until
tihe conclusion of the World Econornic Conference in London. Will thris treaty be a
violation of that suggestion? Are Canada
and France doing something that may have
a derogatory effect on the negotiations among
ail the great nations with respect to tariffs?
President Roosevelt has spoken boldly, and
I thin-k economrists everywhere agree with
liim that existing conditions cannot be
greatly improved until every nation pu-ts a
sto-p to this mad practice of increasing the
fieight of tariff walls. I think the people
of aIl countries have corne to the conclusion
that no nation ean live umto itself, and that
lasting prosperity can be attained only by
the international exchange of goods. Many
years ago I beard an interesting lecture by
the late Dr. Carmaný, who will be remnembered
by soine honoura-ble senators. He was at tihe
time Bishop of the Me.thodist Episcopal
Church. in Canada. The lecture was entitled
"Trade and Oct Rich," and impressed me so
.strongly that 1 have neyer forgotten it. His
argument wa6 that if we are to ha succesaful
we must not isolate ourselves; the~t we cannot
make money by changing jack-knives from
one pockeft to* another; that we -have to
trade with other people andl with other
nations. I have asked bis son te make a
search for the manuscript of the lecture. The
contenta would be so appropriate just now, and
would be so helpful to our people, lt
1
would give sometihing for the privilegg, of
publishing them, and on copies that I dis-.
tributed I should be glad to pay a higher rate
of postage than is charged on newepapers.
I should also like to ask my right honourable friand whether there is anything in this
treaty that will have any effect upon our wine
producers. When the last treaty was made it
was contended, if I remember corractly, that
certain concessions given to French wina would
react against the intereets of our own producers, particularly in the Province of Ontario.
An inquiry was made of me a short time ago
as to how the present treaty compared with

the previous one in this respect, and I could
not give the information. 0f course, I realize
that it is almost impossible to draw up an
international agreement that will be satisfactory to everyone.
There is still another point on which I
should like to be enlightened by the right
honoucable leader. When the treaty of 1922
was coocluded with France the United States
had in its Customs Act a clause that was
known as the "Big Stick." It pcovided a
penalty, in the ferra of a horizontal inerease
of twenty-flve per cent in tihe tariff, against
any country w'bich gave to any other country
trading advantagas that ware not accorded to
the United States; but tha Presidant was cmpowpred to issue a proclamation axampting
aoy offendiog country from the application of
the penalty. The late Mr. Fielding and 1
wecot t0 Washington ta see the Presidant and
lis advisers for the purpose of ascertaining
under wvhat conditions wc could be rclievcd
from the imposition of the penalty. W'e gave
the [nited States somne trivial advaotagcs

Canada. 1 slîould like to ask mv right lionourable friend if t bat "Big Stic»k"' clause is still

have heard of no protcst on behaîf of the
wine producars. They did protest against the
treaty of 1922, and, if 1 remnember correctly,
some changes were made to meet with their
wishes.
Honourable senators will see that
wvine, spirits and other beverages corne under
scedula D. In other words, they are among
thosa French produets which can enter Canada under our intermediate tariff. I do not
think we could ha expeoted to do less than
give France the benefit of the intermediate
tariff in respect of tihiese gonds. Had they
beien covered by sehedule C they wauld have
came undar the intermediate tariff less 10 par
cent, as in certain cases, or lems 15 par cent,
as in others. But they do flot.
I invite the attention of the House to the
gonds that corne under schedula A, and enter
France under the French minimum tariff.
There is nn eyewas',h about them: they are

facm produets and staple articles sueh as wa

an impartant sehedule and wcll worth wvhila.
I amn sorry the tceaty is ot for a longer

CANADA-FRANCE CONVENTION BILL

SENATE
Honourable
Hon. Mr. BAILANTYNE:
senators, I am very pleased to hear the
eloquent reference which the honourable leader
on the other side (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has
made to Canadian ships. My honourable
friend will no doubt remem-ber that during the
War, owing to so much tonnage having been
sunk by enemy submarines, Canada felt it
to be imperative to build a large fleet of
modern freighters. Thereupon British plans
and specification-s were secured and sixty-three
ships were constructed in the shipyards of
Canada. I can imagine how my honourable
friend was thrilled on seeing those ships in
foreign ports, for each of them bore the prefix
"Canadian." Probably lie has at some time
or another seen the Canadian Pioneer, the
Canadian Farmer, t'he Canadian Explorer,
the Canadian Construetor, and other similar
ships.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Some persons
have claimed that that was their sole Canadian quality.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I disagree with
my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that view.

I do not hold

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Apparently my
honourable friend has had a change of heart.
When the Government of which I had the
honour to be a member went out of office
my hon'ourable friend's Governîment sold those
ships as quickly as possible. At that time the
thrill of seeing Canadian ships on the seven
seas did not appeal to him.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

At any cost?

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I need only say
to my honourable friend that the ships cost
$50 a ton less than similar ships built across
the line at the same time, and not nearly as
good as ours. The quality of our ships has
never been questioned.
Hon. Mr. DANIDURAND: Will my honourable friend allow me? Doubtless he remembers that ours was not the only GoveTnment
to dispose of its merchant ships. The 'Governnent to the south also felt the necessity
of disposing of its excess ships.
I think our
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
neighbours to the south followed a very wise
course. If we had been so imprudent as to
build millions of tons of wooden ships, soon
to become practically worthless, we should
have been equally anxious to get rid of them.
If our ships had been no more efficient than
those built by our neighbours across the line,
ours also should have been disposed of. But
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

it is not my intention to make a lengthy
speech about Canada's merchant marine. I
desire simply to compliment my honourable
friend on his change of heart.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Oh, no.

No doubt.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
should his party ever come back into power,
it will embark on an extensive programme of
ship-building in order that he may experience
nany more thrills when he sees the ships in
foreign ports.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I should like to
express some sympathy with the proposal of
the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) that our ships should be known
as Canadian ships. I should be willing to go
a long way with him to bring this about if
he would also suggest that we establish a
Canadian consular service throughout the
world and build a Canadian navy to protect
our shipping. We ought to do this if we really
desire to have our flag carried upon the seven
seas. Then we shall experience all the thrills
tîat he has described, and be able to look
the whole world in the face. instead of depending on the British navy and the British consular service, which are maintained by a people
nuch more heavily taxed than we are.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does my honourable friend really think we should have a
navy to protect our merchant marine? If ho
will look around the world he will notice that
more than forty trading nations feel no need
of men-of-war to protect their merchant
marine.
Hon. Mr. 'GRIESBACH: I would suggest
that my honourable friend send to the Library
for Jane's Registry of Fighting Ships. The
author points out that every trading nation
has a navy to protect its mercantile marine.
If the honourable gentleman will read the
Shipping Bill to which he has referred, and
with which the Banking and Commerce Committee wrestled several weeks, he will notice
the implication that if certain police measures
had to be taken we would rely on the British
navy. We dropped the Bill eventually because it was pointed out that we have no
more power to command the consular service
and the naval strength of Great Britain than
we have to command the naval strength and
the consular service of any foreign country.
As I say, if he will consult Jane's book he will
find that countries far below us in population,

MAY 17, 1933
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I would ask my
right honourable leader to shed some light
on thi, Bill. Fromi time to time I have
studied treaties made by Canada with a view
to granting most-favoured-nation treatment to
varlous counitries of Europe, and 'have found
that they consisted of perhaps two or three
paragraphs at most. This treaty is unique.
It is much more than a commercial arrangenment. I am led to wonder, therefore, whether
wve should not add to or implement the
treaties we *have made with those various
other countries.
Let us look into the matter for a moment.
This treaty provides for what I might caîl
freedomi of person: a Can-adian in France is
to be free to do what a national of that
country is free to do. Sucli a provision is
not necessary with respect to Canada;- it is
covered by our Iaw. The second article,' regarding freedom of property, makes a provision already contained in the la.w of Canada.
The fourth article is a most extraordinary
one: it provides tha~t the nationals of either
country, when in the territory of the other,
shail be exempt fromn compulsory personal
military service. Surely the i-aw of Canada
provides that no alien m-ay be forci'bly called
to the colours. Am I wrong as to that?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Under our
preýent law nobody can be forcibly called.
Hion. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Suppose there were
cempulsory military service as we had it
during the War, surely aliens would be excepted.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Very good. T-hen
it is provided in tihis treaty that the nationals
of cither country, when in the territory of the
other, shaîl have free access to the courts of
that ot'her country. Do not aliens in this
country already possess such a right? 1 know
that at aIl events there is in the Civil Code
of the Province of Quebec an article which
enables foreigners to invoke the protection of
the courts in just the samne way that our
nýationals do. Il they live outside the province they 'have to deposit security for costs.
In this respect a man from, Europe would bo
treated in the samne way as a man from
Ontario.
Freedom of commerce is provided for under
article 6, and article 7 provides that comnpanies, associations, and the like, in-corporated
by Canadians in France, shall be treated in
the sa-me way as ineorporations of nationals.
The question that comes to my mind is
this. If these provisions are useful and necessary, what is the situation with respect to

549

the treaties which we have made in the past,
consisting of just two paragraphs, and under
which most-favoured-nation treatment was
granted to Italy, Germany, Sweden and Norway? Those treaties must be most inadequate. If a provision protecting our nationals
in France against compulsory military service
is necessary, what about our nationals in
Germany or in Italy? Knowing that this
treaty has been earefully drafted by a man
of the ability and character of the Secretary
of State, I arn impelled to inquire, not whether
these terms are useless, but vthether out
treaties in the past have not been woefully
mncomplete. I draw this mnatter to thie attention of the Government because I think there
must be some reason for the inclusion of these
provisions in the treaty now before us.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: To wh ich France
has agreed.
Hon. M-r. BEAUBIEN: Both parties have
agreed to them. Would it not be wise for us
to consider the numerous treat-ies made during
the last five or six years? If upon examination
they are found to be incomplete, should they
not be completed witbout delay?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Speaking generally, this treaty is set out in more detail
than those referred to by the honourable gentleman. I may say in parenthesis, however,
that I do not recaîl the treaties to which he
refers. I shaîl revert to this point in a
moment.
The treaty before us does a great deal more
than merely grant favoured-nation treatmnent
to Canadian nationals, Canadian corporations
and Canadian shipping interests in France; it
puts themn on a parity with French citizens
in many respects. It is true that in Canada today we do lîkewise as far as French nationals
are concerned, 'but if it were not for the treaty
engagement the situation could be changed at
any moment. In view of the treaty, we, and
similarly France, have to respect contractua]
rights now existing.
The honourable gentleman mentioned the
brevity of certain treaties with other countries.
He may be right, but I do not know to just
what countries hie refers. Until very recently
the practioe was that Canada made no such
treaties, but was included in treaties made by
Great Britain, -and in the execution thereof
the Canadian plenipotentiaries joined with the
British.
I will now read frora a memorandum wh'ich
I thînk will clear up the point. I think I have
ýcarried the subjeet far enough to make this
intelligible.
Later, the resolutions of the Imùperial Conference in 1926 prescribed that no treaty could

I think, have been granted most-favoured-natien treatment.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Honiourable
senators, I move:
That the Sexiate do not insist on its first
aiendînent to Bill 71, intituled "An Act to
amend the Criminal Code," but substitute the
tollowing in lieu of the said amendaient:
Page 2, line 14. Add the following as a
proviso to subsection 2 of section 3:
Provided that this subsection shaîl not apply
in the case of two persons who thongh in f act
living in 4ldultery are living apparently respectably as mn and wif e and where the children
affteted are the eildren of such union.
Thiýs addiition to subsection 2 would entirely
remnove from the purview of the Bill the kind
of case referred to by the honourable gentleman opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand). That

being so, I think this Hou6e would have no
objection to subsection 3, which we previously
thoughit should be deleted. That is the subsection which makes it an irrebuttable presumption that a child is in danger of being
or becoming imimoral in certain circum.stances.
White on my feet may I caîl attention to
the fact that the House of Commons, in its
message informing us of its disagreement with
our amendmenit to section 3, bas made no
reference at ail to our other amendments te

inadvertent omission, and 1 a.sk that you, Mr.

to bo said in favour of the solection of a doctor

the President of the Court, .Iudge Hyndman,
would be consulted, I feit that if he agreod
with the suggestion a medicai man wouid be
seiected. Thereupon the honotirabie senator
withdrew bis amendment. At the time I made
the shitement I 1thoughit that while the Pension
Act made it obligatory on the Gov ernment to
appoint as President a judge, or a lawyer et
ten years' standing, this obligation did not extend to the qualifications of the other members. I think tHe lionourabie scnator opposite
was under the saine impression. I find, howover, tint the section dealing with theso appointmcints reads:

Sincc liaving recourse to the exact wording

that the ýCourt had such an intimate knowledge

that it had the advantage ef medicai advisers. I arn inclined to agree; otherwise I
shouid think the court couid not render such

senator should keep in mind that medical and
other scientifie questions are frequently under

Hon. Mr. BELAND: Undoubtedly that is
the case in the civil courts.
,RADIO BROADCASTING BILL
SECOND READING

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN movcd the'
second -eadinig of Bill 99, an Act to amend
the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Act, 1932.

He said: Honourable members, this Bill is
hrief, differing in this respect from many others
that bave corne before us. I have not been
favoured witb any analysis of the principles of
the Bill, nor any data constituting its raison
d'être.
On the contrary, three issues of
Hansard of the Huse of Commons, containing ninety-flve pages of debate. have been sent

to me in the belief, no doubt, tbat I bad
pienty of time to digest this awful mass.
However, a study of tbe Bill and of some of
the debate enables me to make a statement
witb regard to this measure.
Section 1 merely provides for the removal
of the techinical and professional officers of the
Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission

fromn under tbe operation of the Civil Service
Act and makes tbem appointable by the Comnmission, subject to the approval of the Governor in Couincil. Clerks and ail other remaining employees continue te be under the
authority of the Civil Service Commission.
This, it seems to mie, is in accord with the
practice wbich has dcveloped and grown since
the Civil Service Act was passed, of lcaving
under the autbority of the Civil Service Comnmission only such appointments as vrould
naturally become the prey of the patronage
system.
Paragrapli b of section 2 of the Bill makes
the acqijirement of private radio stations by
the Radio Commission, eitber by ],ease or by
purchase, subjeet to the approval of the Governor in Council. Under the previous Iaw tbis
was subject to the approval of Parliament. 0f
course Parliament bas to approve in any event,
for it bas to vote the money; but in the actual
working of the law the Governor in Council
must approve, so tbat there may, be continuîty of operation. Similar remarks apply
to paragrapb c of this section, which refers to
the construction of new radio stations.

553

Section 3 of the Bill provides:
The Commission inay expend for the purposes

of this Act the moneys appropriated by Parliament for such purposes, together with such
sums of money as may be received by the
Commission froin any business carried on by it

under this Act.

Fromn a rcading of this section by itself one
migbt suppose it to be contemplated tbat the
Comm ission would use not only tbe receipts

fromn its own operations. but also supplementary moneys voted by Parliament. I bave made
special inquirics and find that this is not wbat
is contemplated; nor is it provided for by tbe
Bill as a whole. On tbe contrary, the Commission may spcnd only what moncys it receives
from its operations under the Act. Over and
above the receipts tbere is no vote out of the
Consolidatcd Revenue Fond, nor is there
provision for the payment of any moneys.
Subsection 2 of this section makes clear what
I bave just explained.
Subsection 3 of section 3 provides:
l'le Commission shall present to the Minister
of Finance annually an estimate of the expenditure proposed to he made by it during the fiscal
year, and the Minister of Finance shall fromn
time to time pay into a chartered bank to the
credit of the Commission moneys appropriated
bv Parlianmeit for the purposes of the Commis-

sion.

It appears that tbe receipts of the Commission from certain sources go into the Consolidatcd Revenue Fund and are revoted by
Parliament. Tbe new feature of tbis subsection is the requirement that the Commission
shaîl presenit to the Minister of Finance an
estimate of the expcnditure proposed to ho
made by it.
The last clause of the Bill provides:
This Att sliall expire on the thirtieth day of
April, 1934.
I bave not sufficient information to enable
me to tell tbe Huse why such an early
mortality is fixed for this measure. I did not
reach'this point in reading the large mass of
matter which wvas tbrown at me; but 1 do
not tbink the House wi]l defeat or resisQt the
Bill because it deems the deatb too early.
Rigbt Hon. GEO. P. GRAHAM: Honourable members, life insurance companies, wben
tbe risk is great, issue policios for only a very
short period. Tbe Government may have had
the samne principle in mind witb regard to
this measure. I will not say anything about
tbe Radio Commission or its work, but what

Just one more point. T he Chairman of the
Tqriff Board is an able man, who stands very
high in bis profession. I hope, though, tbat
s0 long as most other salaries are being reduced we shahl fot be called upon again to
increase that of the chairman.
Rîghit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: With regard
to the criticismn of the other two members of
the Board, I may say that I arn acquainted
with only one of them. I bave formed a very
high opinion of bis common sense, bis capacity for bard work and bis absolute fairness
of intention. It is my belief that he wil
make n very capable official. Ahl I can say
of the other member is that he was very
higlily recommended. I think I arn disclosing
no secret which should flot be disclosed when
I ~vthat one of these positions-I am n ot
referring to the chairmanship now-was offered
to a gentleman wbo occupies a bigh office,
and whose appointment had been made by the
late Government, of which the right honourable senator fromn Eganville (Rîght Bon..Mr.
Graham) was a member, and although the
salary attaching to that office is, I amn confident, less than the officiai would have received bad he accepted the offer, the utmost
persuasion failed to induce hirn to accept it.
There certainly was no party purpose in the
making of any appointment to the. Tariff
Board.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

SENATE

Riglit Hon. M\1. MEIGIEýN: Honourable
members, 1 have a motion to make which
if passed bcre woîuld, I think, be acceptable
to the House of Commoits. Honourable mcmbers wvill recail the Bill to amend the Criminal
Code, which camne te us from that Huse.
In section 3, an important one, containing fit e
subsections, the Senate made thrce amendments. The Commons objectcd to only one
of these, niamelv, our amendmeat te strike out
subsection 3 of section 3. Subsection 2 providcd tha.t it tvouid be an offence for any
p-erson to be guilty of habituai drunkenness or
participation in adultery te the deterioration
of the morals of children whto resided in the
bouse where the acts wcre committed; and
sub.scction 3, whicli the Senate struck out,
provideci that if there wcre chiidren in such
a lieuse, tvhatever titeir age or the circumstances under wbich tlhey werc living, it
would be an irrebuttable presuimption that
the chiildren wcre in danger of bcing or bccoming immoral.
On recciving fi-omt the Hou-e of Comînons a
înes.age te t lie effect tbat it tl;sagieetl tvth ouiaindiitunt striking out subýection 3, we decided net to in.,$t upon the striking ottt of this
subecetion, .btt w'e subs.tituted an aincndRment in the form of a proviso to modify
subsection 2 so as to except from its operation
a mani and a common law wife w'ho wcre
lit ing together and had a child or cbildrcn
of their union living with thcm. It seemed
quite obvious te this Hotîse that it would be
a grave mnistake te pass legisiatien which
would vir-tually compel that miac and bis
ceimen law wife te abandon their own
cbildren. We were willing te havec tbe irrel)ittable ]resumI)tion appiy in ail other cases,
bowever, and therefere, with the insertion
cf that pteviso, w'e liad ne objection te the

with two amendmnents.

557
After
"act-

Riglit Hon. Mr. M,ýEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, there are two amendments. Subsection 3 of section 414 as contained in the Bihl
passed by this House provided that the pilotage authority might be the Minister, the
Acting Minister or the Deputy Minister. Ail
were clothed with power and were in the position described, in law as persona designata.
The first amendment made by the Hlouse of
Commons changes subsection 3 to read:
Whenever the Minister is appointed as pilotage authority for any district, his successors
iii office or any Acting Minister or, in the
absence of the Minister, his lawful deputy,
shaîl be the pilotage authority, and any sucli
pilotage authority may by by-law confirmed
by the Governor in Council, authorize the
superintendent of pilots in the district to
exercise any of his fonctions. Moreover, sucli
pilotage authorities may, for such tine or
sucli purpose as lie mnay decide, authorize any
person to exercise any particular fonction or
power vested in the pilotage authority by
this Act or any by-]aw made hereunider.

Line 3. Strike out the word "acting."
the word "Minister " insert the words
ing for hirn."
Line 4. After the word " absence "
the words " froin Ottawa." Af ter the
"Minister" insert the words "or any
ister acting for him."

-Ciearly the purpose is to mneet the views of
týhe pilotage people. We should like to meet
their views, if possible, but Il must say very
definitely that the meaning of the Commons
amendment is most uncertain, and the effeet
would be, I arn sure, most unsatisfactory. For
instance, it says:
Whenever the Minister is appointed pilotage
authority for any district, bis successors in
office or auy Acting 3linister may act for
im. .. .
"Any Acting Miiiister" might mean the Acting Ministier of Labour. I presumne the courts
would hold that it meant the Acting Minister
of the Department of Marine and Fîsheries;
Here is the
but At is clumsily expressed.
great difficulty. It says:
or, in the absence of the Minister, bis lawful
deputy, shall le the pilotage authority.
If the Minister is absent, where does the Acting Minister corne in? Apparently the Acting
Minister can act only when the Minister is
preserit. Further, what does the word " absence " mean? Absence from. where? Does it
mean absence from. the place whç're the pilotage is to be exercised, or absence from. Ottawa?
I do net know, and I do not think a court
would know.
Clearly it was the intention to, yield to the
wishes of the pilotage people by making the
Minister or the Acting Minister the real authority. I do not think this House would lie
j ustified in defeating the intent of this first
amendment by the Commons. I do flot see
that the intent is desirable, but, on the other
hnnd, it seems te me that it is not of sufficient
importance for us te resist it. I move:
Tlhat the following changes be made in subsection 3 as amien(led by the Houise ef Ceinniens:

I do not desire, nor do I think the House
would, to oppose that amendiment, but it
seems to me there should be a change in the
wording to make it conformi to the phrasing
adopted elsewhere in the Act. I would therefore add to the motion:
That tlie clause inserted by the second
aînendmnent of the House of Commons be
changed to read as follows:
1A. Paragraph 12 of section 1 of this Act
shall not corne into operation until a date to
bce fixed hy the Governor in Council and
protd]ai.ned in the Canadai Gazette.

insert
word
IýIin-

Subsection 3 as so amendcd would then read:
Whenever the Minister is appointed as pilotage authority for any district, his suecessor
in office or any Minister acting for him or, in
the absence fromn Ottawa of the Minister, or
of any Minister acting for him, his lawful
deputy shahl le the pilotage authority..
And so forth.
The' second amendment made by the House
of Commons is this:
Page 5, between lines 41 and 42, imimediately
after clause 1, insert the following clause:
IA. Subsection 12 of section 1 of this Act
shall corne into operation on a date to be
fixedl by proclamation of the Governur in
Couincil to be published in the Canada Gazette.

Right Hon. GEO0. P. GRAHAM: Honourable members, 1 ar n ot strongly in faveur
of providing that a statute shall come into
force by proclamation, because such a provision -;, like an axe held over the heads of the
people jnterested, and it may drop when least
expected. However, I presume there would
be some consultation beforc the proclamation
would be issued.
Referring to the right honourable gentleman's- suggestion that the words "from Ottawa"
be added after the word " absence," it seems
to me that if that were done some difficulty
mighit arise. For instance, a Minister might
lie absent frrn his office tbrougli illness, and
thoughlit were still in Ottawa hie would be
for official purposes absent, just as if lie were
far distant from the Capital. Would it be
wîse to change the wording to "absence from
Ottawa or through i.lness"?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No; because
such a centingency is covered. If the Minister is ili in Ottawa the Acting Minister could

substitute for him.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: But the Deputy
could not.

S EN ATE
Riglît Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The ]ieputy
uouid flot. But, in the absence from Ottawa
uf both the Minister and an Acting Minister,
dieu the Deputy could act. The point raised
liv my right hionourable friend would be more
ipplicable to the amendmient as worded by
the House of Commons. The Acting Minister
wiiiaîvv be conipetent under the amendnient.
Rigbit HouMii. GRAHAM: But thiere would
hiave to be an Ordcî in Cotincil appointing
an Acting M.\inistcr in any special circumS-tances. Suppose a deputation arrived here
with an appointment to meet a IM'inister, wlio
was taken -dîddenly ill. Noth)ing coutd be done
îîntil ici Cabinet appointed an Acting Mini dci'.
Rigbýt Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: No. A11 that
iliovdbecause of the stand taken by the
plots.
Hon. Mi'. HORSEY: I think the amcendnment miade 1) the House of Commons to
v
p iragrapli 12 of section 1 ôf the Bill is better
without the change iii wording suiggesied by

CRIMINAL CODE BILL
COMMONS DISAGREEMENT WITH SENATE
AMENDMENT

On the motion f0 adjourn:
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: fias the other
flouse accepted oui amendments f0 the
Criminal Code Bill?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: N-ýo, the flouse of
Commons bias nof agreed to the amendmenfs
maide by this flouse. I undcrstand we may
have f0 miake a further amendment, f0 the
Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I may be ont
off order, honourable members, but, having
followed the legisiation pretty closely in bof h
flouses, may I explain the objeet of the
Senafe amendments f0 the Bill.
Section 3 is the .result off representations
made f0 the Depar'tment of Justice by the
Children's Aid Society off Ontario. Its purpose is to proteet children from the corrupting influence off improper conduet, by
their parents. Under ifs Act of incorporation
the Society lias authority to take charge off
children when the domestie conditionsl are
such as f0 be inimical to 'their best interesfs.
As explained to me, the Society now desires
f0 go a etep further and, if possible, rehabilifate the borne, rather t-han remove the
ebjîdren ffrom the parents' custody.
We fhought the amendments we made were
necessary f0 meet existing condifions. Many
couples living together as common law
husband and wifelhave reared families. Off
late years, as we all know, our courts have
held that a divorce secured by a Canadian
citizen in a foreign country is flot valid
in f bis country. Thousands off Canadians
obtained divorces in forei-gn courts, and, acting on the assumaption thaf sncb divorces
were legal, fhey wenf fhrough a f orm off
An
marriage again and raised families.
amendmnent suggesfed by this flouse excepted
such people from the provisions off the Code
relating f0 the corruption off children. But
the other flouse disagreed, considering that
our amendment went f00 far, as if might be
regarded as confenancing something which
shonld be looked upon with disfavour. In
view off the attitude assumed by the Lower

560

SENATE

buse, the Scnate thcn proposed another
arndment, the object being to protect the
classes to wvhich I have referred. We now
learn that this amendment is not acceptable
to the othcr House, and that there is to be
stili another amendrnent to meet the situation.
The riglit hionourable leader of the House
is very conversant with this subject-I think
hc drew the Senate amendments-and if lie
is at ail likely to be here to-morrow it is
better to postpone this matter uintil then.
As a matter of fact we cannot do othecwise,
because we have had no word from the
Commons.

have taken more thaii a couple of minutes to
speak, to them ail.
The redijstribution of constituencies is a
matter that affects every member of the Hou-e
of Commions, and sometimes it is a cause of
%-cry acrimonjious debate. In recent years the
difficulties arising out of bis of this kind
hiave gcnerally been settled satisfactorily-if
flot altogether, at least approxirnately so-by
a comimittee, but at times the committee bas
found it extreniely dificuit to come to conclusions. I rernember that on one occasion
when there was a deadlock with respect to
some constituencies the two leaders in the
House of Commons selected a couple of gentlemen, placed them in a room that was fairly
wett furnished, and asked them to agree on
a report. The decision that the two gentlemen arrived at was flot perfectly satisfactory
to cveryone, but Lt was unanimously accepted
by the House. It strikes nme that it would be
a gond thing to follow that mcthod whcn a
redistribution Bill is undcr consideration, so
that the ineasure might not be the subject of
long discussion. 0f course, every member is
entitled to express himself on redistribution
with the saine frecdom as on any ather matter.
To ail who have had anything to do with
the present measuro in the other House 1
eommcnd the action taken by the late Sir
James Whitney towards myscîf when I was
leader of the Opposition in the Ontario Legislature. A redistribution mneasure was being
put through, and lie assured me that, though
Lt was proposed to change the boundaries of
c'ertain constituencies, there would be no
change whatever in my constituency so long
as I represented it. I have always considerrd
that one of the hrightest incidents in my
political carcer, and I think it is an example of
the courtcsy that should be practised as a
general mbl.
Unless there is some very strongreason for acting to the contrary, the leaders
on both sides of the buse of Commons
should alwvays bce extended the courtesy of
having their constituencies undisturbed when
a readjustment of representation is hein g
made.
Under the procedure laid down in the British
North America Act, this process of readjustment is often a difficult one. The unit of
representation for the country as a whole is
determined by the population of Quebec, as
ascertained at the last decennial census, being
dlvided Ny 65, the number of members te
which that province is always entitled. I

GOVERNOR

GENERAL'S SPEECH

After which His Excellency the Governor
General ivas pleased to close the Fourth
Session of the Seventeenth Parliament of the
Dominion of Canada with the ifoIllwing
Fpeech:
Honourable Menibers of the Senate:
Members of the Bouse of Commons:
In bringing to a close the Fourth Session
of the Seventeenth Parliament, I congratulate
you upon the extent t-o which you have realized
the hopes set forth in my address on the reassenbling of Parliament in October last.
It is deeply gratifying that the benefits of
the Imperial Economic Conference Agreements
now known througbout the world as the
"Ottawa Agreements," to which legisIative sanction was given in the early part of the session,
are already refiected in a profitable and steadily
increasing volume of Empire trade.
The measures which my Government bas taken
to niaintain the integrity of national finance
are already showing gratifying results. The
credit of Canada throughout the world has been
strengthened.
The last decennial census, upon which redistribution of the representation of the people
in the House of Comnnns under the British
North Amer ica Act is based, disclosed that
Canada lias now, like many other countries,
a majority of its population residing in urban
,oninunities. Notwithstanding this added diffi<nlty, a fair and equitable redistribution of the
electoral divisions of the country has been
aceoniplished.
The charters of Canadian banks have been
extended for one year, in order that Parliament before undertakzing thbe decennial revision
of the Bank, Act, may be informed of the conclusions of the World Monetary and Economic
Conference and may have before it the findings

563

of a Royal Commission which my Governmett
%vill shortly appoint, to consider Canadian
Banking and Monetary Problems.
The intricate and difficult problenis of railw-avy transportation in Canada have been dealt
with by legislation enibodying the essential
recoinnendations of the Royal Commission on
Canadian Railways and Transportation. This
legislation, based upon the principle of maintaining the integrity of our two transcontinental
railway rystemis, aimis to sectire efficient andl
economie service an(l to provide means for
enisuring co-operation between the two railways.
The agreement with the Republie of France,
regulating custonîs tariffs, together îvîth the
convention governing the righits of nationals,
commerce and shipping, whichi you have ratified,
will, it is confidently believed, proniote trade
between and confer mnutual beneei s uipon the
two countries.
The anieodmentis to thie Pension Act whichi
you have passed will enable the country more
fairly and equitably and with less cumibersomie
and expensive machinery to discharge its
obligations to those who served in the Great
War.
Among other important nîeasures passed wvere
an Act to amend the Canada Grain Act, an
Act to authorize the Governor iii Concil to
agree to extend by proclamation the duration
of the Canada-New Zealand Trade Agreement,
an Act to amend the Canada Shipping Act, and(
Acts respecting Penitentiaries, His 'Majesty's
Visiting For-ces, the Criminal Code, the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police, and Uneinployment
and Farm Relief.
Menmbers of the House of Commons:
I thank you for the provisions you have
made for the Public Service.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of thc Bouse of Commons:
The courage with which the Caxnadian people
have endured the burdens imposed upon themn
ini these troubled times is witness to their great
faith in the future of their country. It is,
however, realized that co-operation amiongst the
peoples of the world is essential to recovery
fromn the unprecedented conditions which, have
for so long prevailed in aIl countries.
In relieving yon from attendance upon your
parliaunentary duties, 1 pray that Divine Providence may guide and bless you.
